On the usage of clean vocals, the pair commented: [...] "it’s the first time Eddie Hermida has ever been confident enough to do it, but Eddie’s always been <b>a</b> singer. <b>There’s</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of singing in it, <b>there’s</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of screaming in it, <b>there’s</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of everything in it… there’s melody in it.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The AllMusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow states, [...] "Thomas gives the eight tunes fresh {{treatments}} and as usual avoids all clichés (and {{the logic of}} bop) in his explorative improvisations." [...] The Guardians John Fordham noted [...] "This one features the hard-nosed Miles Davis saxophonist Gary Thomas with a fiercely collaborative band of experts... <b>Theres</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of full-on tenor sax blasting over ferocious percussion barrages... The saxophonists tendency to spit out phrases rather than massage them into life gives his work a rather impassive quality that mellowed later".|$|E

Its taking off a little bit from Undertow and New Test Leper, with the freedom of E-Bow the Letter and Country Feedback - songs that just come out. What I really wanted was more of that automatic, {{unconscious}} stuff… greatly inspired by Patti Smith and various others… Bert Downs said the records about people falling down and getting back up again.

And the director, Guggenheim, wanted to have - sort of give people a little break {{every once in a while}} and say, okay, you dont have to absorb this information, you can just sort of - and it was more the personal side of Al Gores life or how it connected to the theme of the film.

5000|$|The song [...] "Cyprus Avenue" [...] is a three chord blues {{composition}} and served {{for many years}} as the closing song for most of Morrisons live shows. Along with [...] "Madame George", it {{is the centerpiece of}} the album and both songs are Belfast related and highly impressionistic. The song is told {{from the point of view}} of an outsider watching from inside an automobile and getting tongue-tied as the refined school girl he fantasizes about appears and he imagines her a fine lady with [...] "rainbow ribbons in her hair" [...] in a carriage drawn by six white horses and [...] "returning from a fair". Van Morrison described Cyprus Avenue as [...] "a street in Belfast, a place where <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of wealth.

5000|$|When I {{first came}} up with the lines, I dont know what it is, but you got to do it/ I dont know where to go but you got to be there, I was at this party for The Strokes in New York. There was this {{prevailing}} sense of, Were not quite sure whats happening or what is cool, but we know that its somewhere around here, in this room. It was this vague confusion, with everybody kind of sniffing for blood. It wasnt that it was a bad party, or that I dont like The Strokes; I just think <b>theres</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of confusion right now in the music business. Then, later on, I realized the song was really personal. I didnt know where I was, and I didnt know I was actually lost. It wasnt about the party at all; its about searching but not knowing what youre searching for. Theres the train motif, being on this train heading for either oblivion or salvation - and just holding on for dear life. That song came down from some mountain somewhere, because it was right after I wrote it that I sort of packed it in.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking to Melody Makers Harvey Kubernik {{in early}} 1977, Harley commented: [...] "I feel {{on this album}} I achieve {{something}} as a singer, producer and songwriter. If it only sold three copies, I wouldnt worry. The achievement {{is more important than}} the success. This is entirely autobiographical: its the only way I can write. I did a lot of it with the running order in mind. I wrote for two months before we went into the studio and the pattern was obvious when I started writing: [...] "Seeking a Love" [...] had to open the album. <b>Theres</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of different music styles that are confusing some people. Its taken the maturity of an older man to come out and say things in the first person. When I first started writing the album, six of the lyrics dealt with love. So I thought Id follow this with the rest of it. Its an album which dwells on the emotion we call love. I became very confident writing this album. Ive come back stronger now cause I believe in myself. I like writing all about human relationships. There is also humour in this LP: [...] "GI Valentine," [...] and [...] "Give Me More".|$|E

The albums title, Deja Entendu, is French for [...] "already heard." [...] It was explained as [...] "very tongue-in-cheek" [...] by vocalist Jesse Lacey.
