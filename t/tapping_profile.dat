INTRODUCTION For the identification of long impulse responses, as eg. found in acoustic echo control problems, often the achievable model may be limited to a truncated solution due to the computational benchmark of a DSP. While IIR filters offer lower complexity but cannot adequately match the nature of the problem [1], FIR subband adaptive filters (SAF) appeal through the advantages of reduced complexity, increased time representat [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{heat demand}} {{of a single}} dwelling, {{existing}} out of space heating and domestic hot water production, decreases due to higher insulation rates. Because of this, investing in efficient and renewable heat generation becomes less interesting. Therefore, to incorporate renewables or residual heat on a larger scale, district heating or collective heating systems grow in importance. Within this set-up, the substation {{is responsible for the}} interaction between local demand for comfort and overall energy performance of the collective heating system. Many different configurations of substations exist, which influence both local comfort and central system performance. Next to that, also hybrids exist with additional local energy input. To evaluate performance of such substations, a new experimental-based test procedure is developed in order to evaluate these different aspects, characterized by the two roles a substation has, namely as heat generator and as heat consumer. The advantage of this approach is that an objective comparison between individual and central systems regarding performance on delivering local comfort can be executed experimentally. The lab set-up consists out of three different subsystems, namely the central system, the domestic hot water consumption and the local space heating. The central system can work with different temperature regimes and control strategies, as these aspects have proven to have the largest influence on actual performance. The domestic hot water system is able to generate similar <b>tap</b> <b>profiles</b> according to eco-design regulation for domestic hot water generation. The space heating system is able to demand a modular heat load...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{available}} solar energy in Belgium {{is more than}} sufficient to meet local heat demand for space heating and domestic hot water in a dwelling. However, the timing of both the availability of solar energy {{and the need for}} thermal energy, match only to a limited extent. Therefore, compact storage of the surplus of thermal energy is a critical issue. Depending on the temperature at which this energy is available, directly from the sun or indirectly through the storage, different combinations with a heat pump can be considered. By combining solar energy with a heat pump one may benefit on both sides since the fraction of solar energy increases as well as the performance of the heat pump. The aim of this thesis is to select the best out of three configurations that combine thermal solar collectors, heat pump and thermal energy storage for heating purposes in dwellings in Belgium, based on model simulations. Energetic, exergetic and economic criteria are used to evaluate the different configurations, while thermal comfort and domestic hot water <b>tap</b> <b>profiles</b> should be met. One (or more) performance index (indices) is (are) defined enabling an objective comparison between different systems. Today several systems are already commercially available on the international market [4]. Since these systems consist of different components, the system design is a crucial issue. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the sizing of the individual components, the interaction of the components within the global system, and the strategy for operational control. To study the interaction with the building, three types of buildings (already defined in a previous project) are considered...|$|R

40|$|Teamwork is {{fundamental}} in rehabilitation, yet research on team {{structure and function}} is lacking. The Teamwork Assessment <b>Profile</b> (<b>TAP)</b> is a rehab specific survey instrument for team dynamics used before and after institution of a novel team format, Issue Oriented Rehabilitation Staffing (IORS), on a rehabilitation unit. With IORS, a “Person Responsible” leads each “Issue. ” Highly structured team meetings focus on team coordination, not reporting or documentation. Statistically significant team dynamic changes occurred on the TAP after IORS, including team interdependence, length of staffing, and percent of staffing time viewed as useful. Sample size and uncontrolled covariables limit conclusions, but the TAP demonstrated face validity. IORS is a viable staffing format.

40|$|We examine {{wireless}} systems employing Rake receivers {{and fast}} scheduling over multiple users. The interactions between multipath diversity, multiuser diversity, and the feedback delay are investigated {{in terms of}} the mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is assumed that all users experience the same propagation characteristics, i. e., the same number of <b>taps</b> and power-delay <b>profile</b> (PDP). The results are exact as well as asymptotic (in the number of users) expressions that quantify this interaction. It is found that as the number of taps in the channel increases, the multiuser diversity gain decreases but better robustness against feedback delay is achieved. Furthermore, the asymptotic results derived show good agreement with the exact results for an exponential PDP, even for few users. Thus, we obtain expressions for the mean SNR that are compact and easy to evaluat...|$|R
5000|$|Swarm is {{a mobile}} app that lets users {{check-in}} to a location and potentially make plans {{and set up}} future meetings with people nearby. This app has {{made it easier for}} people in online communities to share their locations, as well as interact with others in this community through collecting rewards such as coins and stickers through competitions with other users. If a user is on Swarm, their exact location may be broadcast even if they didn't select their location to be [...] "checked-in." [...] When users turn on their [...] "Neighborhood Sharing" [...] feature, their location is shared as the specific intersection that they are at, and this location in current time can be viewed simply by <b>tapping</b> their <b>profile</b> image. This is concerning because Swarm users may believe they are being discreet by sharing only which neighborhood they are in, while in fact they are sharing the exact pinpoint of their location. The privacy implications of this is that people are inadvertently sharing their exact location when they do not know that they are. This plays into the privacy concerns of social media in general, because it makes it easier for other users as well as the companies this location data is shared with to track Swarm members. This tracking makes it easier for people to find their next targets for identity theft, stalking, and sexual harassment.|$|R
40|$|Success {{and failure}} {{outcomes}} in three achievement-oriented com-mon-life situations were simulated in the Trent Attribution <b>Profile</b> (<b>TAP)</b> with both self and others-orientations. The TAP provides measures of {{locus of control}} and stability dimensions which can be further partitioned into individual attribution elements (i. e., ability, effort, task difficulty, and luck) under four different conditions (self-success, other-success, self-failure, other-failure). The Internality di-mension of the TAP was correlated significantly with Rotter’s I-E Scale. The test-retest reliability coefficient was significant. Tradi-tional success-failure and self-other biases were also obtained. ROTTER’S (1968) Internal-External Locus of Control (I-E) Scale measures individual differences in generalized beliefs regarding behav-ior-outcome relationships (i. e., attribution schemal).

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a machine learning approach to large-scale monitoring for malicious activities on Internet. In the proposed system, network packets sent from a subnet to a darknet (i. e., {{a set of}} unused IPs) are collected, and they are transformed into 27 -dimensional <b>TAP</b> (Traffic Analysis <b>Profile)</b> feature vectors. Then, a hierarchical clustering is performed to obtain clusters for typical malicious behaviors. In the monitoring phase, the malicious activities in a subnet are estimated from the closest TAP feature cluster. Then, such TAP feature clusters for all subnets are visualized on the proposed monitoring system in real time. In the experiment, we use a big data set of 303, 733, 994 darknet packs collected from February 1 st to February 28 th, 2014 (28 days) for monitoring.

40|$|Wind-induced fatigue {{loading and}} damage to roof {{claddings}} on gable-roof and hip-roof buildings are investigated {{in this study}} through both wind tunnel tests and computer analyses. The magnitude and distribution of wind pressures on both roofs are first measured at different wind directions. Fatigue characteristics of wind pressures are identified based on a rainflow count method for each tap at its critical wind direction in which its largest negative pressure occurs. Total fatigue loading at each tap on both roofs is then computed using the obtained fatigue characteristics and information on wind climate. Finally, fatigue damage to screw-fastened light-gauge steel roof sheetings of different profiles is estimated in terms of previously obtained S-N curves and a modified Miner's rule. The distributions of fatigue damage index over both roofs show that under the same strong winds, fatigue damage to the hip roof cladding is much less severe than that gable roof cladding. For each type of roof configuration, there are considerable differences in fatigue loading and fatigue damage with respect to different locations of pressure <b>taps</b> and different <b>profiles</b> of roof sheetings.

40|$|Although {{the effects}} of {{replacing}} sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) with water on energy intake and body weight have been reported, {{little is known about}} how these replacements affect diet quality. To simulate {{the effects of}} replacing SSBs with tap water on diet quality and total energy intake of Lower Mississippi Delta (LMD) adults. Retrospective analysis of cross-sectional dietary intake data using a representative sample of LMD adults (n= 1, 689). Diet quality was measured using the Healthy Eating Index- 2005 (HEI- 2005) scores that were computed using the population ratio method. The effects of substituting SSBs with water on diet quality were simulated by replacing the targeted items&#x 2019; nutrient <b>profile</b> with <b>tap</b> water&#x 0027;s <b>profile.</b> Simulating the replacement of SSBs with tap water at 25, 50, and 100 % levels resulted in 1 -, 2. 3 -, and 3. 8 -point increases, respectively, in the HEI- 2005 total score. Based on a mean daily intake of 2, 011 kcal, 100 % substitution of SSBs with tap water would result in 11 % reduction in energy intake. Replacing SSBs with water could substantially improve the diet quality of the LMD adult population and potentially lead to significant weight loss overtime. Prioritizing intervention efforts to focus on the replacement of SSBs with energy-free drinks may be the most efficacious approach for conveying potentially substantial health benefits in this and similar disadvantaged populations...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis was to study the heat flows in the blast furnace hearth lining by {{experimental}} measurements and numerical modeling. Thermocouple data from an operating furnace have been used throughout the work, to verify results and to develop methodologies to use the results in further studies. The hearth lining {{were divided into two}} zones based on the thermocouple readings: a region with regular temperature variations due to the tapping of the furnace, and another region with slow temperature variations. In an experimental study, the temperatures of the outer surfaces of the wall and bottom were measured and compared with lining temperature measured by thermocouples. Expressions to describe the outer surface temperature profiles were derived and used as input in a two-dimensional steady state heat transfer model. The {{aim of the}} study was to predict the lining temperature profiles in the region subjected to slow temperature variations. The methodology to calculate a steady state lining temperature profile was used as input to a three-dimensional model. The aim of the three-dimensional model was primarily to study the region with dynamic lining temperature variations caused by regular tappings. The study revealed that the replacement of original lining with tap clay has an effect when simulating the quasi-stationary temperature variations in the lining. The study initiated a more detailed study of the taphole region and the size and shape of the <b>tap</b> clay layer <b>profile.</b> It was concluded, that in order to make a more accurate heat transfer model of the blast furnace hearth, the presence of a skull build-up below the taphole, erosion above the taphole and the bath level variations must to be taken into consideration.

40|$|According to Impression Management Theory (Leary 2 ̆ 6 Kowalski, 1990), {{people are}} {{motivated}} to create a particular impression to affect how they are perceived, evaluated, and treated by others. Body appearance forms impressions. Perceived inability to create desired body impressions may lead to negative psychological outcomes, such as social physique anxiety (SPA). Motivation to present one’s body in a particular way, and perceived success in doing so, can be shaped by significant others through body-related pressures and victimization. The first {{purpose of this study}} was to examine profiles of such social cues in young adolescents. Targeted variables included perceived pressure to gain weight, lose weight, and gain muscle, and body-related victimization. The second purpose was to compare profile groups on impression construction (motivation for and behavior of impression-related PA and diet, and normative PA levels), outcome (SPA), and individual difference (Body Mass Index and relative pubertal status) variables. Surveys were administered to 503 eighth-graders. After excluding incomplete measurement (n= 97) and those with multivariate outliers (n= 8) there were a total of 398 participants. Body measurements were taken for BMI and pubertal status, and surveys <b>tapped</b> remaining variables. <b>Profiles</b> were obtained using hierarchical and subsequent non-hierarchical cluster analysis. Six profiles were identified: High Victimization, High Pressure, High Social Influence, Low Social Influence, Pressure to Get Bigger, and Pressure to Get Smaller. Girls were disproportionately represented in the Low Social Influence group, while boys were disproportionately represented in the High Pressure Group. Profile group differences on the outcome variables were tested using MANOVA and appropriate follow-up analyses. Profile differences generally supported Impression Management Theory. Participants in the High Social Influence group were among the highest in all body change strategies, normative levels of physical activity, SPA, and BMI, and participants in the Low Social Influence Group were among the lowest in these variables. There were no group differences on pubertal status. Findings suggest that pursuing a deeper understanding of the relationship between social influences and adolescents’ body change strategies, body-related psychological outcomes, and physical characteristics is warranted. ...|$|R
