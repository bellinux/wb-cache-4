25|$|A basic {{melting point}} {{apparatus}} {{for the analysis}} of crystalline solids consists of an oil bath with a transparent window (most basic design: a <b>Thiele</b> <b>tube)</b> and a simple magnifier. The several grains of a solid are placed in a thin glass tube and partially immersed in the oil bath. The oil bath is heated (and stirred) and with the aid of the magnifier (and external light source) melting of the individual crystals at a certain temperature can be observed. In large/small devices, the sample is placed in a heating block, and optical detection is automated.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Thiele</b> <b>tube</b> is a glass {{instrument}} that {{is filled with}} oil that is heated by using an open flame. The sample {{is placed in the}} opening in a capillary tube alongside a mercury thermometer and allowed to be heated by the oil as it circulates through the <b>Thiele</b> <b>tube.</b> By using different oils different temperature ranges can be reached and used to determine melting points. The <b>Thiele</b> <b>tube</b> may also be used to determine boiling points, by using a liquid sample instead of a solid sample.|$|E

5000|$|Laboratory {{drying rack}} is usually used {{to dry up}} the tube in the laboratory; for example, it can help in drying test tube, boiling tube, and <b>Thiele</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{melting point}} {{apparatus}} is a scientific instrument {{used to determine}} the melting point of a substance. Some types of melting point apparatuses include the <b>Thiele</b> <b>tube,</b> Fisher-Johns apparatus, Gallenkamp (Electronic) melting point apparatus and automatic melting point apparatus.|$|E
5000|$|Oil {{is poured}} into the tube, and then the [...] "handle" [...] is heated, either by a small flame or some other heating element. The shape of the <b>Thiele</b> <b>tube</b> allows for {{formation}} of convection currents in the oil when it is heated. These currents maintain a fairly uniform temperature distribution throughout the oil in the tube. The side arm of the tube is designed to generate these convection currents and thus transfer {{the heat from the}} flame evenly and rapidly throughout the heating oil. The sample, packed in a capillary tube, is attached to the thermometer, and held by means of a rubber band or a small slice of rubber tubing. The <b>Thiele</b> <b>tube</b> is usually heated using a microburner with a small flame.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Thiele</b> <b>tube,</b> {{named after}} the German chemist Johannes Thiele, is a {{laboratory}} glassware designed to contain and heat an oil bath. Such a setup is commonly used in {{the determination of the}} melting point of a substance. The apparatus itself resembles a glass test tube with an attached handle.|$|E
5000|$|Friedrich Karl Johannes Thiele (May 13, 1865 [...] - [...] April 17, 1918) was a German chemist and a {{prominent}} professor at several universities, {{including those in}} Munich and Strasbourg. He developed many laboratory techniques related to isolation of organic compounds. In 1907 he described a device for the accurate determination of melting points, since named <b>Thiele</b> <b>tube</b> after him.|$|E
50|$|A {{sample in}} a fusion tube is {{attached}} to a thermometer with a rubber band, and immersed in the tube. A sealed capillary, open end pointing down, is placed in the fusion tube. The <b>Thiele</b> <b>tube</b> is heated; dissolved gases evolve from the sample first. Once the sample starts to boil, heating is stopped, and the temperature starts to fall. The temperature at which the liquid sample is sucked into the sealed capillary is the boiling point of the sample.|$|E
