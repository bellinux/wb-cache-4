40|$|Overlay {{applications}} are popular as they provide high-level functionality by masking the intrinsic complexity of <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> network. However, overlays rely on <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> {{to provide them}} with basic connectivity. Therefore, the intrinsic features of <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> network determine <b>the</b> efficiency of the overlay. Accordingly, studying the interdependency of <b>the</b> overlay and <b>underlay</b> networks leads {{to a better understanding of}} overlay application behavior. We present a visualization-driven analysis technique for evaluating the overlay architecture with respect to <b>the</b> <b>underlay,</b> driven by <b>the</b> goal of overlay engineering.

5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> set of the ring and called <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> set of the module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. <b>The</b> <b>underlying</b> set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E

40|$|Publish-subscribe is a {{well-known}} paradigm for building distributed applications. Events produced by peers, called publishers, are disseminated to interested consumers, called subscribers. Usually publishers and subscribers are arranged in a peer-to-peer overlay network, which helps in dissemination of events in a decentralised manner. Recent research tries to provide Quality-of-Service like delay bounds or reliability in such a system. In order to provide reliability current distributed publish-subscribe systems mostly either rely on overlay level acknowledgement protocols or try to find multiple disjoint paths in the overlay to increase redundancy without taking into account <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> topology. Acknowledgements induce high delays affecting timeliness of event delivery. Providing multiple paths without looking at <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> {{does not take into}} account correlations between paths within <b>the</b> <b>underlay.</b> We address these drawbacks by designing a content-based publish-subscribe system which provides reliability by taking into account <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> topology to reduce correlations within <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> in overlay links. The system consists of three layers: The Topology-Discovery-Overlay (TDO) layer constructs an underlay topology aware overlay which reflects <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> topology by using a path-matching algorithm. On top of the TDO the Maximum-Reliability-Spanning-Tree (MRST) layer constructs k overlay link disjoint trees which contain the most reliable overlay links. The MRSTs are used by the content-based publish-subscribe layer for subscription flooding and event forwarding. The system has been evaluated by simulations in PeerSim using Internet-like topologies. The results show that the TDO discovers most of <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> topology and constructs overlay topologies reflecting <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> topology. Simulations also show that the system converges towards a maximum event delivery probability...|$|R

5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick.

This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of optimal routing in overlay networks. An overlay network is {{constructed}} by adding new overlay nodes on top of a legacy network. The overlay nodes are capable of implementing any dynamic routing policy, however, <b>the</b> legacy <b>underlay</b> has a fixed, single path routing scheme and uses a simple work-conserving forwarding policy. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> routes are pre-determined and unknown to the overlay network. The overlay network can increase the achievable throughput of <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> by using multiple routes, which consist of direct routes and indirect routes through other overlay nodes. We develop a throughput optimal dynamic routing algorithm for such overlay networks called the Optimal Overlay Routing Policy (OORP). OORP is derived using the classical dual subgradient descent method, and it can be implemented in a distributed manner. We show that <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> queue-lengths {{can be used as a}} substitute for the dual variables. We also propose various schemes to gather the information about <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> that is required by OORP and compare their performance via extensive simulations...|$|R
30|$|Cognitive {{radio is}} a {{promising}} wireless technology {{to resolve the}} growing scarcity of the indispensable electromagnetic spectrum resources. In cognitive radio, secondary users (SUs) detect spectrum holes in their radio environment for data transmission, while primary users (PUs) use their own licensed spectrum band [1]. CR techniques for spectrum access (SA) are generally classified as underlay SA, overlay SA, and interweave SA [2]. Among it, <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> SA has higher flexibility since it focuses on specific power control for satisfying a required interference to the PUs. Hence, the other {{can be understood as}} the special cases of <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> SA. Basically, <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> SA allows simultaneous transmission of SUs and PUs by sharing the spectrum as long as the interference to PUs during the secondary transmission is under a predefined threshold level called interference temperature [3]. Thus, to reduce the interference to PUs in a manner of <b>the</b> <b>underlay</b> SA is a critical issue.|$|R
