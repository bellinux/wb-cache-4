40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{condition}} monitoring and failure diagnostics of {{spherical roller bearing}} on <b>adapter</b> <b>sleeve</b> running in high technology Chemical industry machines. Two methods have been used: low frequency mechanical vibration (up to 1000 Hz) and high frequency mechanical vibration (up to 16000 Hz) monitoring method and a shock pulse method (SPM, frequency 32000 Hz). Machines have been tested in at free run and fully loaded. Results have been applied to in-crease reliability of diagnostic methods in a case when radial clearances inside a bearing are too small {{and there is no}} enough lubricant oil supply to bearings. Radial clearances and relative vibra-tion displacements of rotor shafts have been measured using proximity probes. The low frequency vibration excitation method is not efficient enough in failure diagnostics of bearings in comparison to high frequency and shock pulse methods. Both these methods together are efficient evaluating technical condition of heavy loaded roller bearings. The experiments have been provided with spherical roller bearings on <b>adapter</b> <b>sleeve</b> SKF 22228 CCK/W 33 and SKF 22216 CJC 403. Key words: technical condition, diagnostics, vibration, roller bearings, shock pulse method. 1...|$|R
50|$|A caliber {{conversion}} <b>sleeve</b> or <b>adapter</b> <b>sleeve</b> is {{a device}} {{which can be}} used to non-permanently alter a firearm to allow it to fire a different cartridge than the one it was originally designed to fire. The different cartridge must be smaller in some dimensions than the original design cartridge. Alternative names sometimes imply the type of dimensional difference. A chamber insert may be used for a shorter cartridge of similar base diameter. A supplemental chamber or cartridge adapter is typically used for a shorter cartridge of reduced diameter. A cartridge conversion sleeve may include a short barrel of reduced bore diameter. Shotgun conversion sleeves may be called subgauge inserts, subgauge tubes, or gauge reducers. Sleeves intended for rifle or handgun cartridges may have rifled barrels. Additional variations may allow centerfire weapons to fire rimfire ammunition and/or retain autoloading function with the smaller cartridge.|$|R
40|$|A 58 -year-old woman {{presented}} with onset of pain {{associated with a}} popping sound after a twisting motion 4 years after left total knee revision arthroplasty. She had a complex medical history, including a reported bone cement allergy, and presented to the hospital unable to bear weight. Plain radiographs revealed a broken femoral component, with the femoral metaphyseal sleeve separated from the distal articular component. During surgery, {{it was observed that}} the femoral <b>adapter</b> bolt and <b>taper</b> <b>adapter</b> had both fractured. Scanning electron microscopy of the fracture surfaces of the components confirmed that the implant had failed in fatigue, presumably due to high cyclic loads. Failure at this junction has not been described previously. In this type of knee design, we recommend supporting the distal articular component either with bone, augmentation, and/or bone cement to reduce the risk for this mode of failure.

30|$|Most of the non-weld {{connectors}} are {{supplied by}} offshore oil-gas service companies from America and Europe, such as Oil states industries Inc, Cameron, FMC Technologies, Oceaneering International Inc, Quality Connector LLC and Hydratight. Static metal seal based Connectors include tapping connector and method of using same [5], swivel ring flange, external hydraulic tieback connector [6], subsea tool for tie in of pipeline ends [7] and <b>adapter</b> <b>sleeve</b> for wellhead housing [8]. Rubber sealed connectors include pipeline joint [9], over 2000 morgrip connector and coupling device [10]. The other connectors with metal and rubber seal include griplock end connector, smart flange plus connector, quick flange morgrip pipeline connector and hydraulic smart flange connector. The above typical connectors are reliable to connect subsea pipelines, but their design is too complicated. Too many bolts {{have to be}} pre-tightened and operation tools have {{to be used for}} connection, which result in a long lead time and high cost. Gottfried [11] presented a simple metal sealing connector for the connection of water supply and drainage pipelines with diameter less than 168.3 mm under low or zero pressure on land. This paper presents an improved design of subsea pipeline mechanical connector (SPMC) {{that can be used for}} a bigger diameter and a higher pressure in the complicated subsea environment.|$|R
50|$|The P-11 was {{designed}} by Swedish-born George Kellgren, the designer of many earlier Husqvarna (Sweden), Intratec, and Grendel brand firearms. The P-11 uses an aluminum receiver inside a polymer grip housing held on with polymer pins. The slide, barrel, and magazine are steel. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds, or 12 rounds in states not limited to 10-round magazines. Both fit flush {{to the bottom of}} the pistol. At 17.1 oz unloaded, the handgun itself is comparatively light. The P-11 lacks an external manual safety, relying instead on a long and heavy double action only (DAO) trigger pull, which requires 9 pounds of pressure, to prevent accidental discharge. A firing pin spring and low-mass hammer prevent discharge if the gun is dropped. The P-11 will also accept some Smith & Wesson 59 series magazines. An available adapter wraps around the base of 15-round Smith & Wesson model 59-style magazines. Smith & Wesson series 69 compact 12-round magazines will also work, with a matching short <b>adapter</b> <b>sleeve,</b> as well. Accessories such as trigger shoes, finger-rests, belt clips, steel guide rods to replace the factory installed polymer guide rod, gray- and OD green-colored polymer grip housings, night sights, and other accessories are also available from the manufacturer.|$|R
40|$|Background: Metal-on-metal bearings, as used {{in total}} hip {{arthroplasty}} prostheses that have a large-diameter femoral head, were proposed as an option for treating young and active patients with degenerative hip disorders. Despite the theoretical improved performance of large metal articulations with regard to wear, metal ion levels produced by total hip arthroplasty prostheses in which a large-diameter femoral head is used have not been thoroughly evaluated. Methods: From 173 eligible patients, 144 patients were allocated to undergo a unilateral total hip arthroplasty with use of metal-on-metal components and a large-diameter femoral head. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the amount of metal ion release (chromium, cobalt, and titanium) from four different types of prostheses from four different implant manufacturers (Biomet, DePuy, Smith & Nephew, and Zimmer). Results: For cobalt ion levels, a significant difference was found between the different types of total hip arthroplasty prostheses with a large-diameter femoral head at three, six, twelve, and twenty-four months, but only in male patients or patients with a femoral head size of 50 mm or greater. The highest mean cobalt levels at all follow-up periods were observed with the Zimmer implant and the lowest with the Biomet implant. Titanium ion levels were highest in the Zimmer group at all follow-up periods, whereas no difference between groups was found for chromium. At the most recent follow-up, one hip was revised after the development of an adverse local tissue reaction. Of concern was the observation at the time of revision surgery of black metallic deposits inside the <b>adapter</b> <b>sleeve</b> and on the prosthetic femoral neck...|$|R
40|$|The {{enormous}} {{changes in}} flexography printing {{in recent years}} concerning the printing quality achievable cannot generally be ascribed to a single revolutionary invention, but {{are the result of}} continuous developments to the complete system. Thus the direct drive technology in all machine types and its associated advantages in terms of printing length corrections has become established since drupa 2000. The race for ever finer raster rolls has also been completed to the benefit of improvements in bowl geometry and in ceramic surfaces. Clearly improved colour transfer behaviour has become feasible as a result. In a closely intermeshed system such as flexography printing this naturally has to {{have an effect on the}} printing colours used. Further improvements in bonding agents and pigment concentrations now allow users to print ever thinner colour layers while maintaining all of the required authenticities. Furthermore, it has become possible to reduce additional disturbing characteristics in the UV colour area, such as the unpleasant odour. While the digital imaging of printing plates has primarily been improved in terms of economic efficiency by the use of up to eight parallel laser beams, extreme improvements in the system are noticeable especially in the area of directly engraved printing moulds. Whereas many still dismissed directly engraved polymer plates at the last drupa as a laboratory system, the first installation was recently placed on the market a mere three years later. A further noteworthy innovation of recent years that has reached market maturity is thin sleeve technology, which combines the advantages of a photopolymer plate with a round imaged printing mould. There are no high sleeve costs for each printing mould, except for one-off cost for an <b>adapter</b> <b>sleeve.</b> To conclude, it can be said that although flexography printing has experienced many new features in the time between drupa 2000 and today, it still has enormous potential for further development...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} in optics a transformational technique {{inspired by}} the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) cosmology. We found that the extended covariant scaling transformation used in the FRW theory {{can be applied to}} light wave phenomena under scalar paraxial approximation. Our method provides new ways to propagate light beams as well as novel guidelines for advanced optical structure design, as discussed in some application examples. In the first example we study Talbot imaging in different configurations comprising illumination with spherical beams or with Gaussian beams and propagation in homogeneous or inhomogeneous gradient-index media. In the second example we derive an exact analytical solution for the propagation of self-accelerating parabolic beams in parabolic gradient-index media. Finally, in the third example we show how the new insightful transformational method can be exploited to design lossless nonadiabatic waveguide <b>tapers</b> and <b>adapters...</b>|$|R
