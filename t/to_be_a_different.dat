5|$|A {{limited edition}} retail {{version of the}} PC game was {{released}} in April 2011. It included bonuses such as behind-the-scenes videos, a sample disc of the game's music, and a Super Meat Boy comic. In 2012 Team Meat began prototyping an iOS and Android version of the game. The game is intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> take on the Super Meat Boy concept that is more adapted to touch-screen controls than a direct port would be. Later Team Meat released two images of the new game one with the new graphics and other with the new chapter named The Green Hills.|$|E
5|$|Cordova-Buckley, {{who began}} {{appearing}} on the show during the third season, {{was surprised to find}} the writers' characterization of Rodriguez in the episode to closely mirror her own life. Cordova-Buckley stated that, like how Rodriguez is seen in the episode, she dislikes nightclubs, and has found herself changing over time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> person from who her old friends remember; for Cordova-Buckley, this was seen in returning to Mexico after becoming an actor in the United States, which is reflected with Rodriguez's friends from Colombia from before she worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. as an Inhuman asset.|$|E
5|$|Some Scotch bonnets have a {{completely}} smooth and glossy shell. This was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> species which {{was given the}} name cicatricosa by Gmelin in 1791. This taxon was recognized for a while, including up until 2010 as a separate species, Semicassis cicatricosa. However, in 2015 this {{is considered to be}} only a form, therefore S. cicatricosa has become another synonym of S. granulata.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} the attack is unknown, with {{theories}} that Centaur was in breach of the international conventions that should have protected her, that I-177s commander was unaware that Centaur was a hospital ship, or that the submarine commander knowingly attacked a protected vessel. The wreck of Centaur was found on 20 December 2009; a claimed discovery in 1995 had been proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> shipwreck.|$|E
5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} a being that cannot be conceived not to exist. He argued that if something can be conceived not to exist, then something greater can be conceived. Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can be conceived cannot be conceived not to exist and so it must exist. This can be read as a restatement of the argument in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different,</b> stronger argument.|$|E
5|$|Alloxylon flammeum, {{commonly}} known as the Queensland tree waratah or red silky oak, is a medium-sized tree of the family Proteaceae found in the Queensland tropical rain forests of northeastern Australia. It has shiny green elliptical leaves up to 18cm (7.2in) long, and prominent orange-red inflorescences that appear from August to October, followed by rectangular woody seed pods that ripen in February and March. Juvenile plants have large (up to 25cm (10in) long) deeply lobed pinnate leaves. Previously known as Oreocallis wickhamii, the initial specimen turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> species to the one cultivated and hence a new scientific name was required. Described formally by Peter Weston and Mike Crisp in 1991, A. flammeum was designated the type species of the genus Alloxylon. This genus contains the four species previously classified in Oreocallis that are found in Australasia.|$|E

25|$|Leszek died in 1186. The day of {{his death}} is unknown. Duke Leszek, whose death is {{mentioned}} in the necrology of the abbey of St. Vincent in Wrocław on 21 November, according <b>to</b> historians <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> Leszek, Leszek Biały, who was killed on 24 November 1227.|$|R
5|$|Disney had {{originally}} conceived Mulan as an oppressed young Chinese woman who ultimately elopes to Europe {{to be with}} a British prince. However, director Tony Bancroft, who was inspired by the well-being of his own daughters, wanted Mulan <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different,</b> unique kind of Disney heroine – one who is strong and independent, whose fate does not depend upon a male character. Thus, the relationship between Mulan and Captain Li Shang was relegated to that of a minor subplot, while Mulan's bravery and strength were emphasized {{in order to ensure that}} she remained the hero of her own story. Mulan's supervising animator was Mark Henn, who deliberately designed the character so that she would appear less feminine than her predecessors.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{supporting}} characters was kept low to emphasize their individuality, and their personalities were left ambiguous {{to reinforce the}} desire for player immersion. The heroine Yuko Takao was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> type of character to previous main heroines, being a non-playable character {{from the beginning of}} story development. She was the only major non-playable character not to have her own Reason. The character of Lucifer designed was not a standard villain, but rather as a gentlemanly observer who sets tests for the player. To reflect his omnipotent status as God's opposite, he is portrayed in a number of forms, including a child and an old man. Alongside this, the staff wanted to portray demons not only as enemies but as characters the player could relate to and grow attached to when inviting them to their party. One of the key elements for demon designs recycled from earlier games was bringing them into the game and making them as true as possible to the original design while fitting into the game's art style.|$|E
25|$|Sentences of {{the second}} type are called false passives by some linguists, who feel that such {{sentences}} are simply confused with the passive voice due to their outward similarity. Other linguists consider the second type <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> kind of passive – a stative or static passive, {{in contrast to the}} dynamic or eventive passive illustrated by the first sentence. Some languages express or can express these different meanings using different constructions.|$|E

25|$|Note {{that only}} the -i in -shii inflects; the other kana are invariant, and in {{practice}} serve only for disambiguation and to reflect historical grammar. Briefly, -shii adjectives used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> class from -i adjectives (distinguished historically as -ku and -shiku adjectives, for present -i and -shii), but have since merged; -yaka and -raka used to be suffixes, but are no longer productive, while -taru and -naru are historical variants {{of what is now}} the adjective particle -na.

25|$|In Croatia, {{the nearly}} 880 {{hectares}} (2,175 acres) of Blaufränkisch, known as Frankovka, represent around 2.7% of all Croatian vineyard plantings. This number {{is expected to}} rise, as many plantings previously thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> variety, Borgonja, have now been proven by DNA testing to be Blaufränkisch. Most of the Croatian plantings {{are found in the}} Kontinentalna Hrvatska (Continental Croatia) region in the northwestern part of the country and on the Istrian peninsula along the Adriatic Sea. In Serbia, most of the plantings of Blaufränkisch are found in the province of Vojvodina.|$|E
25|$|Fancy Bear {{carried out}} spear {{phishing}} attacks on email addresses {{associated with the}} Democratic National Committee {{in the first quarter}} of 2016. On April 15, which in Russia was a holiday in honor of the military's electronic warfare services, the hackers seemed to become inactive for the day. Another sophisticated hacking group attributed to the Russian Federation, nicknamed Cozy Bear, was also present in the DNC's servers at the same time. However the two groups each appeared to be unaware of the other, as each independently stole the same passwords and otherwise duplicated their efforts. Cozy Bear appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> agency, one more interested in traditional long-term espionage.|$|E

25|$|A {{tradition}} {{reported by}} Ishtori Haparchi (1280–1355) and other early Jewish writers is that Ramla was the biblical Gath of the Philistines. Initial archaeological claims {{seemed to indicate}} that Ramla was not built {{on the site of}} an ancient city, although in recent years the ruins of an old city site were uncovered on the southern outskirts of Ramla. Earlier, Mazar had proposed that ancient Gath lay at a site Ras Abu Hamid east of Ramla. Avi-Yonah, however, considered that <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> Gath, usually now called Gath-Gittaim. This view is also supported by other scholars, those holding that there was, both, a Geth (believed to be Tell es-Safi) and Gath-Rimmon (in or near Ramla).|$|E
25|$|The building's {{original}} {{elevator shaft}} {{was determined to}} be too small for a modern elevator, so a new shaft was built onto the back of the building along with a new stairwell. As part of the restoration requirements, the exterior of the shaft had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> color than the building to easily distinguish it from the original structure. Its placement on the building's southwest corner was done under guidelines from the National Park Service. The original elevator shaft was used as a conduit for electrical wiring and plumbing. Additionally, one of the original entrance doors facing East Main Street had to be restored but unusable due to a ramp for the building to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act.|$|E
25|$|Biofluorescence is the {{absorption}} of electromagnetic wavelengths from the visible light spectrum by fluorescent proteins in a living organism, and the reemission of that light at a lower energy level. This causes the light that is re-emitted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> color than the light that is absorbed. Stimulating light excites an electron, raising energy to an unstable level. This instability is unfavorable, so the energized electron is returned to a stable state almost as immediately as it becomes unstable. This return to stability corresponds {{with the release of}} excess energy in the form of fluorescent light. This emission of light is only observable when the stimulant light is still providing light to the organism/object and is typically yellow, pink, orange, red, green, or purple. Biofluorescence is often confused with the following forms of biotic light, bioluminescence and biophosphorescence.|$|E

25|$|After the Sauber team parted {{company with}} their sponsor Kouros {{at the end}} of 1987, Mercedes-Benz {{increased}} their involvement with Sauber for the 1988 season to become a factory entrant under the Sauber-Mercedes name. Still using the C9 the team won 5 races but came 2nd to the TWR Jaguar team in the championship. However, 1989 was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> story with Sauber-Mercedes winning all but one championship race to become world champions (including coming 1st and 2nd at the 24 Hours of Le Mans - all achieved with the C9. For the 1990 World Sportscar Championship season the C9 was replaced by the all-new C11, while the team was renamed Mercedes-Benz (though the outfit was still run by Sauber). The team dominated the season, again winning all but one race to become world champions. Mercedes-Benz eventually withdrew from sportscar racing after a dismal 1991 season with the C291.|$|E
25|$|Uhtred (fl. x 911–926, 930–50, {{and perhaps}} 955–58) was an ealdorman based in Derbyshire in the 10th century. His {{date of birth}} and origins are unclear, {{although}} it has been suggested by some modern historians that he came from Northumbria. He is thought to have been the thegn who, having purchased land at Hope and Ashford in Derbyshire from the Vikings before 911, had it confirmed by King Æthelstan in 926. He was ealdorman in or before 930. It appears that he witnessed charters during the remainder of the reign of Æthelstan, the reign of Edmund I (939–46) and the reign of Eadred (946–55), and the last king appears to have granted Uhtred land at Bakewell in 949. It is thought that Uhtred may have used this land to found a minster there. An Uhtred witnesses charters from 955 to 958, in the reigns of Eadwig the Fair (955–59) and Edgar the Peaceable (957–75), but some historians believe this <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> Uhtred, perhaps Uhtred Cild.|$|E
25|$|The Mint {{could not}} find a {{suitable}} metal which was sufficiently different in colour to the existing coins and which would not tarnish. This last point was thought to be important because the new coin would be the most valuable coin in general circulation in the world (about £8.40 in today's values). It therefore had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> shape; various methods had been used overseas to overcome this problem but none were without drawbacks. A hole through the coin did unacceptable things to the Queen's head (which is a legal requirement on British coins), and wavy-edged, flat-edged or square coins could not be used in the coin-handling machinery which was then coming into increasing use in industry, banking and vending. To be used in a vending or sorting machine a coin would have to roll under gravity and be capable of being measured without being presented in a special way, in other words it needed a constant breadth at whichever angle it was measured.|$|E
