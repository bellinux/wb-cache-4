5|$|By 1914 Olivia {{seems to}} have {{realised}} that Dorothy was determined to marry Pound, and finally consented; ironically Pound was then earning less <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> in 1911. Hope Shakespear relented when the couple agreed to a church wedding rather than a civil ceremony, which took place on 20April 1914. Olivia gave them two early circus drawings by Pablo Picasso.|$|E
5|$|During {{his senior}} season, scouts {{became aware that}} McGary was less {{polished}} offensively <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> appeared. By January, his ranking had been reduced from number 2 overall to about number 20. He eventually settled between 26th and 30th by Scout.com, ESPN and Rivals.com in the final class of 2012 overall rankings.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{is convinced}} {{to return to}} work after the death of a close friend. However, it soon becomes apparent that his first case back on the job is much deeper <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> expected.|$|E

5|$|Oda {{revealed}} that he originally planned One Piece to last five years, {{and that he had}} already planned the ending. However, he found it would take longer <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> expected. Oda stated that the ending would be what he had decided in the beginning; he is committed to seeing it through.|$|E
5|$|While {{lacking in}} the social qualities common to politicians, one {{characteristic}} served Goebel well in the political arenahis intellect. Goebel was well-read, and supporters and opponents both conceded that his mental prowess was impressive.

5|$|After {{attending}} the Far Eastern People's Conference in the Soviet Union, Nosaka returned to Japan in 1922, and {{helped found the}} Japanese Communist Party (JCP) that same year. Nosaka was more secretive {{about his relationship with}} the Communist Party <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been in Britain, and kept his membership a secret from Bunji Suzuki and other moderate labour leaders. After his return, Nosaka worked as a trade unionist and editor of the JCP's official newspaper, Musansha Shimbun.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} title, Steinitz played in tournaments more {{frequently}} <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> previously. He won at New York 1894, and was fifth at Hastings 1895 (winning the first brilliancy prize for his game with Curt von Bardeleben). At Saint Petersburg 1895, a super-strong four player, multi-round-robin event, with Lasker, Chigorin and Pillsbury, he took second place. Later his results began to decline: 6th in Nuremberg 1896, 5th in Cologne 1898, 10th in London 1899.|$|E
5|$|Although Shaw's unmasking scene {{lasted only}} {{two minutes and}} seven seconds and {{included}} just 24 words of dialogue spoken by Shaw, he received more fan mail and autograph requests from Return of the Jedi <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> for any role {{in the rest of}} his career. He later reflected that he very much enjoyed his experience filming for Return of the Jedi and expressed particular surprise that an action figure was made of him from the film.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1891 he was {{considered}} by many to be the top two-year-old. During the 1892 season he earned £13,023, the second highest of any horse and only bettered by La Fleche. By the time he retired at the end of the 1893 season, he had earned £32,528 throughout his racing career. This was the third highest of any horse in history, behind only Donovan and Ayrshire. When Orme was at his best, John Porter rated him 7 to 10 pounds inferior to Ormonde, whom Porter also trained. Porter also believed that Orme was a better racehorse at age four <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been at two and three.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock, racing {{under his}} {{name for the}} first time, started the 1818 season much earlier <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done the {{previous}} two seasons, with his first race coming on 18 May at the York Spring Meeting in a sweepstakes of 20 guineas each over two miles. He started as the 1/2 favourite, but could only finish third behind St. Helena. Two days later he started as the 4/6 favourite for the Constitution Stakes over a mile-and-a-quarter. He biggest rival {{was expected to be}} the Duke of Leeds's Rasping, who was priced at 2/1. Blacklock won the race from Rasping, with Hornby in third and Whiff last of the four runners.|$|E
5|$|Debs ran for {{president}} in the 1920 election while in prison in Atlanta, Georgia, at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. He received 919,799 votes (3.4%), slightly less <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> won in 1912, when he received 6%, {{the highest number of}} votes for a Socialist Party presidential candidate in the U.S. During his time in prison, Debs wrote a series of columns deeply critical of the prison system. They appeared in sanitized form in the Bell Syndicate and were published in his only book, Walls and Bars, with several added chapters. It was published posthumously.|$|E

5|$|In May 1909 Wodehouse {{made his}} second visit to New York, where he sold two short stories to Cosmopolitan and Collier's {{for a total}} of $500, a much higher fee <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{commanded}} previously. He resigned from The Globe and stayed in New York for nearly a year. He sold many more stories, but none of the American publications offered a permanent relationship and guaranteed income. Wodehouse returned to England in late 1910, rejoining The Globe and also contributing regularly to The Strand Magazine. Between then and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he revisited America frequently.|$|E
5|$|Kerry led off the Australian team in {{a faster}} time <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> clocked in the {{individual}} event, {{but it was still}} two seconds slower than his personal best time. Kerry finished in a time of 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Kuznetsov gave the Soviets the lead with a leadoff leg of 56.81s with Hungary and Great Britain in second and third place. France was last to reach the 100m mark, posting a time of 58.84s. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, the fastest split among the breaststrokers by 0.63s. His leg moved Australia into second place at the halfway mark, just 0.45s behind the hosts and roughly half a second ahead of the British and the Hungarians. The remainder of the teams had been dropped, with a two-second gap back to the fifth-placed East Germans. Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done over the distance. Tonelli began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a body length behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of his leg. Tonelli's butterfly leg was such that if he had swum the same time in the individual event, he would have claimed the silver medal. Although he lost 0.36s to Seredin, he had minimised his loss and Australia were within 0.81s going into the final leg. Furthermore, the Australians were now more than a second clear of the third placed Great Britain.|$|E

Following his instruction at Fry's academy, {{he returned to his}} father's brickyard, where tradition holds that he helped build the state's first governor's mansion alongside future governor Thomas Metcalfe. He then read law in the office of Humphrey Marshall, was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in Lancaster, Kentucky. He briefly served as a judge advocate in Colonel John Allen's volunteer militia during the War of 1812.|$|E

5|$|Nuyts died on 11 December 1655 and {{was buried}} in a churchyard in Hulst. The {{tombstone}} remained until 1983, when it was destroyed during renovations of the church.

It was the younger Pieter who also arranged the posthumous publication of his father's treatise Lof des Elephants, in 1670 — a single known copy of which still exists, in the Koninklijke Bibliotheek in The Hague.|$|E
