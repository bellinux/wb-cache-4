5|$|According to Nathan Fillion, {{there was}} an episode in which the crew land on a dying planet. The {{inhabitants}} try to steal Serenity, after they explain to the crew about <b>their</b> <b>need</b> {{to get off the}} planet. The problem is that unless they were to run into another ship along the way, with the extra passengers, Serenity would not have enough fuel and oxygen {{to make it to the}} closest destination. While everyone else is asleep, Mal takes the ship himself and discovers that help never would have arrived.|$|E
5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without <b>their</b> <b>need</b> to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E
40|$|Patients are {{supposed}} to be given care according to <b>their</b> <b>needs.</b> This concept is, however, difficult to define and patients and caregivers may have different opinions about a patient's needs. Twenty patients were interviewed and asked to give a definition of <b>need,</b> describe <b>their</b> <b>needs</b> while hospitalized and depict what they do to make sure <b>their</b> <b>needs</b> are fulfilled. Ten groups of needs were identified: communication, basic care, contact with other people, behaviour of staff, empathy, competent caregivers, continuity, integrity, participation in decision making, and pain relief. The descriptions patients gave of how they ensured <b>their</b> <b>needs</b> were met could be divided into two groups: openly seeking attention; or not wanting to disturb the staff. Interviews with patients emphasized the importance of recognizing that they have individual needs and varying abilities to see that <b>their</b> <b>needs</b> are fulfilled...|$|R

5|$|Benfica began March with an away game in Braga. They lost 3–1 {{in their}} first league loss since December. They dropped to fourth place in the standings. On the {{following}} Saturday, Benfica visited Belenenses and lost {{for a second time}} in a row. A week later, Benfica received Paços de Ferreira at home. The match ended with a 3–2 win for the visitors and Benfica dropped to fifth place. They were now eleven points behind leader Boavista. In the last game of March, Benfica faced Campomaiorense on the road. With a 1–1 draw, the team avoided losing all of their matches in March. However, <b>their</b> <b>need</b> to get points was aggravated, especially if they wanted to qualify for the European competitions.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} when various Islamic empires {{controlled}} much of the Middle East as well as parts of West Africa and the Iberian peninsula, Muslim armies consisted mostly of cavalry, made up of fighters from various local groups, mercenaries and Turkoman tribesmen. The latter were considered particularly skilled as both lancers and mounted archers. In the 9th century the use of Mamluks, slaves raised to be soldiers for various Muslim rulers, became increasingly common. Mobile tactics, advanced breeding of horses, and detailed training manuals made Mamluk cavalry a highly efficient fighting force. The use of armies consisting mostly of cavalry continued among the Turkish people who founded the Ottoman Empire. <b>Their</b> <b>need</b> for large mounted forces lead to an establishment of the sipahi, cavalry soldiers who were granted lands in exchange for providing military service in times of war.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{started writing}} East Coker in 1939, and {{modelled}} the poem after Burnt Norton {{as a way}} to focus his thoughts. The poem served as a sort of opposite to the popular idea that The Waste Land served as an expression of disillusionment after World War I, though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. The poem focuses on life, death, and continuity between the two. Humans are seen as disorderly and science is viewed as unable to save mankind from its flaws. Instead, science and reason lead mankind to warfare, and humanity needs to become humble in order to escape the cycle of destruction. To be saved, people must recognize Christ as their savior as well as <b>their</b> <b>need</b> for redemption.|$|E

5|$|Limited by <b>their</b> <b>need</b> for water, trees such as willows, alders, and ponderosa pines {{are found}} only near the monument's streams or springs. Serviceberry bushes and shrubs like {{mountain}} mahogany {{are found in}} places where moisture collects near rock slides and ledges. Elsewhere long-rooted rabbitbrush has adapted to survive in dry areas. Other shrubs with adaptive properties include greasewood, sagebrush, shadscale, broom snakeweed, antelope bitterbrush, and purple sage. Western junipers, which have extensive root systems, thrive in the dry climate; {{in the absence of}} periodic fires they tend to displace grasses and sagebrush and to create relatively barren landscapes. The Park Service is considering controlled burning to limit the junipers and to create open areas for bunchgrasses that re-sprout from their roots after a fire.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} Gangers have regrouped, led by Ganger Cleaves. She realizes {{that she is}} {{suffering}} from the same terminal illness that the human Cleaves is suffering, and questions <b>their</b> <b>need</b> to kill their counterparts. The group is spurred on by Ganger Jennifer who insists the humans must die. As Ganger Cleaves orders her group to stay {{one step ahead of}} the humans, the Ganger Jennifer kills the real Jennifer, and then stages a fight with another Ganger Jennifer to fool Rory that she is the human version. Ganger Jennifer leads Rory to a console, claiming it will restore power when instead it disables the cooling system for the acid, making it dangerously unstable. She then convinces Rory to lead the human group into the acid storage chamber and traps them inside; crewman Jimmy is killed trying to stall the acid release.|$|E
5|$|The Bosnian Muslims' {{dissatisfaction with}} the Ustaše rule of the NDH and <b>their</b> <b>need</b> for {{protection}} were combined with nostalgia {{for the period of}} Habsburg rule in Bosnia and a generally friendly attitude towards Germany among prominent Bosnian Muslims. These factors led to a push towards autonomy for the Bosnian Muslim community which was strongly opposed by Pavelić as counter to the territorial integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, the autonomists were desperate to protect the Muslim people and wrote to Adolf Hitler asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich.|$|E

5|$|The Germans, too, had {{suffered}} heavy casualties; the 116th Panzer Division, for example, {{had lost its}} offensive capabilities after countless attempts to break the U.S. First Army's encirclement of Aachen. This gave American and British commanders {{a false sense of}} security, believing that the Wehrmacht did not have the strength to launch a counteroffensive. Given their view {{on the state of the}} German armed forces and <b>their</b> <b>need</b> to push to the Rur, the First Army decided to drive German forces out of the Hürtgen Forest—located on the Belgian–German border—in an attempt to take a series of dams which could be used by the Germans to flood the valley below.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{wrote to}} several engine manufacturers, but none met <b>their</b> <b>need</b> for a {{sufficiently}} lightweight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in {{just six weeks}} in close consultation with the brothers. To keep the weight low enough, the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice for the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from the fuel tank mounted on a wing strut into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air: the fuel-air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into the cylinders.|$|E
5|$|The two Brummer class cruisers were {{designed}} in 1914, when the turbines being built by AG Vulcan for the Russian battlecruiser Navarin became available {{owing to the}} state of war between Germany and Russia. The German navy instructed AG Vulcan to divide the turbines in half and design a pair of cruiser-minelayers around the propulsion system. As a result of <b>their</b> <b>need</b> for high speed, they were lightly armed, with only four 15cm guns. And to further aid them in their offensive minelaying role, they {{were designed}} to resemble British cruisers to help conceal their identity.|$|E

U-boats could operate from French Atlantic ports, {{reducing}} <b>their</b> <b>need</b> to make the dangerous journey from ports in Norway or Germany around Scotland, and increasing their operational range in the ocean by several hundred miles. The Luftwaffe with its small, but valuable fleet of Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors, could now operate from the same area. From June 1940 onwards, the Battle of the Atlantic began in earnest.|$|E

Edwin dies from a heroin overdose, resulting in the family smuggling the body out of a hospital and nearly having it discovered by the police.

5|$|Under communism, {{everyone}} was guaranteed employment. However, women suffered the double burden of paid and unpaid work, leading to lower birth rates. The commitment to social equality {{and the issue}} of declining birth rates allowed women to have some rights, such as child care and child allowances. For example, in the Soviet Union, maternity leave was extended to three years and part-time work was introduced. With the collapse of communism, many of these rights have been revoked due to the new largely male oriented democracy that has been put in place. Although there has been an increase in female workers, <b>their</b> <b>need</b> for welfare support such as child care has not been met, and has been ignored.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians {{might seem}} {{unlikely}} desert-dwellers, because of <b>their</b> <b>need</b> {{to keep their}} skins moist and their dependence on water for reproductive purposes. In fact, the few species that are found in this habitat have made some remarkable adaptations. Most of them are fossorial, spending the hot dry months aestivating in deep burrows. While there they shed their skins {{a number of times}} and retain the remnants around them as a waterproof cocoon to retain moisture. In the Sonoran Desert, Couch's spadefoot toad spends most of the year dormant in its burrow. Heavy rain is the trigger for emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others. Eggs are laid and the tadpoles grow rapidly as they must reach metamorphosis before the water evaporates. As the desert dries out, the adult toads rebury themselves. The juveniles stay on the surface for a while, feeding and growing, but soon dig themselves burrows. Few make it to adulthood. The water holding frog in Australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain falls. The Desert rain frog of Namibia is nocturnal and survives because of the damp sea fogs that roll in from the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|From 20 January 1943, the Partisans {{had been}} hard-pressed by the Axis Case White offensive. Throughout that offensive, Partisan Supreme Headquarters engaged the Germans in {{negotiations}} to gain time {{to cross the}} Neretva river. In late February or early March 1943, the Partisans captured a German officer and about 25 soldiers, who joined about 100 Croatian Home Guards, and 15 Italian officers and 600 soldiers already being held as prisoners of war by the Partisans. Due to their desperate situation {{at this stage of}} Case White, and <b>their</b> <b>need</b> to delay the Axis in order to cross the Neretva river before the Germans struck, they decided to use the recently captured German officer to initiate negotiations. The German historians Ladislaus Hory and Martin Broszat concluded that at this critical period, Tito was also concerned {{that by the end of}} the war the attrition to his Partisan forces would be such that Mihailović's Chetniks would be more powerful. They suggest that Tito may have been willing to agree to a truce with the Germans in order to destroy the Chetniks.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Fraser {{returned}} to Toronto {{and took up}} her research post, simultaneously working as a demonstrator with the Department of Hygiene and Preventative Medicine. She {{was one of the}} founding faculty of the School of Hygiene at U of T. She made her home with her brother Donald; Williams, who had also returned from England, moved in with her own mother. Though the two women wanted to live together, raise children and continue their careers, they were unwilling to displease or fail in their obligations to their mothers. They also realized that though they were middle-class, working women, economic inequalities in their pay compromised their ability to support themselves and <b>their</b> <b>need</b> to remain in the good graces of their families for support. When Williams was bequeathed a farm near Aurora, Ontario, the couple believed it might become their haven, but when Williams applied for courses at the Ontario School of Agriculture, she was advised the courses were full. For the next several years, they lived apart but within a 30-minute walk from each other at various residences.|$|E
