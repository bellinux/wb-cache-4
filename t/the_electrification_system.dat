5|$|From 1913 former S {{lines were}} {{electrified}} with 1,500Vdc overhead lines and electric locomotives hauled coal trains between Shildon and Erimus marshalling yard, which had opened in 1908 between Middlesbrough and Thornaby.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{electric}} {{railway system}} becomes an efficient mass transportation in large urban areas. A railway <b>electrification</b> <b>system</b> supplies electric power to railway trains through the transformers. Therefore, the transformer {{is a key}} component to help reduce problems of the unbalance of voltage and current in the power grid. As electric trains have their power delivered on a single-phase system, the single-phase transformer causes the unbalance of voltage and current in the power system network, with which <b>the</b> railway <b>electrification</b> <b>system</b> is connected. In order to alleviate these problems, special transformers, i. e. Scott transformer and Le-Blanc transformer, have been proposed {{to be used in}} <b>the</b> railway <b>electrification</b> <b>system.</b> This paper focuses on developing the special transformer models for using in DIgSILENT PowerFactory software. The developed models have been verified with a simple train system in order to study the effectiveness of reduction of voltage unbalance factors from the three types of transformers. In addition, the developed special transformer models can be applied in a large-scale power system network for power quality problem analysis...|$|R
30|$|In recent years, {{the railway}} {{transportation}} system {{has become a}} rapid and reliable means of traveling. Old fossil-fueled railway systems have been replaced with new highly sophisticated electric railways, owing to their higher performance, less energy costs, and environmentally friendly profile [1]. <b>The</b> AC <b>electrification</b> <b>system</b> is widely used in high power, high-speed corridors worldwide owing to its convenient transformation at high voltages (15 – 25  kV). Meanwhile, <b>the</b> DC <b>electrification</b> <b>system</b> is generally utilized in low power trains such as trams, metros, and suburban railways, with voltages ranging from 600  V to 3  kV, because of its complex voltage transformation system [2]. Notwithstanding the numerous advantages of <b>the</b> AC railway <b>electrification</b> <b>system</b> (RES), it exhibits certain challenges including voltage and current distortions owing to harmonics generated by the traction load of trains and the capacitive and inductive effects of catenary [3, 4]. However, advancements {{in the fields of}} power electronics and voltage source converter (VSC) technology have enabled engineers to consider DC transmission for long distances at high voltages in conventional power systems. The focus is mainly on the North Sea countries, where the plan is to transmit 100 GW of energy from offshore sites into the mainland [5]. Practical examples of such VSC-high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) transmission lines are the 320  kV HVDC system between Spain and France, and the 420 and 500  kV systems in China [6].|$|R
