5|$|At {{the first}} {{performances}} of Parsifal {{problems with the}} moving scenery during the transition from scene 1 <b>to</b> <b>scene</b> 2 in act 1 meant that Wagner's existing orchestral interlude finished before Parsifal and Gurnemanz arrived at the Hall of the Grail. Engelbert Humperdinck, who was assisting the production, provided a few extra bars of music to cover this gap. In subsequent years this problem was solved and Humperdinck's additions were not used.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock Hoax is {{a detective}} who has little respect {{in the small}} {{tropical}} town where he lives, {{despite the fact that}} he thinks he is a better sleuth than Sherlock Holmes. A pair of boys decide to play a trick on Hoax and tell him about a murder. Hoax rushes <b>to</b> <b>scene</b> of the crime where he discovers a shred of cloth, later finding that a tramp is wearing the same type of clothes that he found. The tramp runs away and Hoax gives chase, with other people helping the pursuit. Eventually, Hoax captures the tramp with the aid of a police officer, and returns to the victim's body with the man. Hoax then comes to a realization that the body was just a dummy that had been stuffed with the leaves. The crowd has a laugh at Hoax's expense while the two boys are punished.|$|E
5|$|The {{length and}} {{internal}} structure of Peking-opera plays is highly variable. Prior to 1949, zhezixi, short plays or plays {{made up of}} short scenes from longer plays, were often performed. These plays usually center on one simple situation or feature a selection of scenes designed to include {{all four of the}} main Peking opera skills and showcase the virtuosity of the performers. This format has become less prevalent in recent times, but plays of one act are still performed. These short works, as well as individual scenes within longer works, are marked by an emotional progression {{from the beginning of the}} play to the end. For example, the concubine in the one act play The Favorite Concubine Becomes Intoxicated begins in a state of joy, and then moves to anger and jealousy, drunken playfulness, and finally to a feeling of defeat and resignation. A full-length play usually has from six to fifteen or more scenes. The overall story in these longer works is told through contrasting scenes. Plays will alternate between civil and martial scenes, or scenes involve protagonists and antagonists. There are several major scenes within the work that follow the pattern of emotional progression. It is these scenes that are usually excerpted for later zhezixi productions. Some of the most complex plays may even have an emotional progression from scene <b>to</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{critically}} acclaimed, four-part and 431-minutes long Soviet War and Peace (film series), by director Sergei Bondarchuk, {{released in}} 1966 and 1967. It starred Lyudmila Savelyeva (as Natasha Rostova) and Vyacheslav Tikhonov (as Andrei Bolkonsky). Bondarchuk himself played {{the character of}} Pierre Bezukhov. It involved thousands of extras and took six years to finish the shooting, {{as a result of}} which the actors age changed dramatically from scene <b>to</b> <b>scene.</b> It won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film for its authenticity and massive scale. Bondarchuk's film is considered to be the best screen version of the novel. It attracted some controversy due to the number of horses killed during the making of the battle sequences and screenings were actively boycotted in several US cities by the ASPCA.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} {{aspect of the}} {{production}} is Craig's use of a single, plain set that varied from scene <b>to</b> <b>scene</b> by means of large, abstract screens that altered {{the size and shape}} of the acting area. There is a persistent theatrical myth that these screens were impractical and fell over during the first performance. This myth may be traced to a passage in Stanislavski's My Life in Art (1924); Craig demanded that Stanislavski delete the story and Stanislavski admitted that the incident occurred only during a rehearsal. He eventually provided Craig with a sworn statement that the mishap was due to an error by the stage-hands and not the design of Craig's screens. The screens had been built ten feet taller than Craig's designs specified, which may have also contributed to the mishap. Craig had envisaged specially costumed, visible stage-hands to move the screens, but Stanislavski had rejected the idea. This forced a curtain close and delay between scenes, which disrupted the sense of fluidity and movement inherent to Craig's conception. The different arrangements of the screens for each scene were used to provide a spatial representation of Hamlet's state of mind or to underline a dramaturgical progression across a sequence of scenes, as visual elements were retained or transformed. In terms of costume design there were also differences between the two artists. For example, in the scene containing the dumb show Craig wished for the Actors to wear oversized masks, but Stanislavski despised this idea as it did not ring true to a realistic style of acting. Eventually there was a compromise which allowed the actors to wear makeup along with extravagant beards and wigs (Innes 158).|$|E

500|$|When {{the crew}} began {{production}} on the pilot, they were tasked with designing the stock locations where [...] "the show {{would return to}} again and again, and in {{which most of the}} action would take place, such as the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob's pineapple house". The idea for the series was [...] "to keep everything nautical", so the crew used a great amount of rope, wooden planks, ships' wheels, netting, anchors, boilerplates, and rivets in creating the show's setting.

500|$|Production {{designer}} Michael Wylie, who {{had previously}} worked on Marvel Television's Agent Carter, found designing for Legion to be more flexible than other series, {{due to the lack}} of set continuity from scene <b>to</b> <b>scene,</b> though Hawley was very specific about his ideas for the series, and provided Wylie with a 'lookbook' for the show when first interviewing him for the job. To avoid dating the series, elements such as cars are rarely shown, and when they are seen there is a mixture of modern-day cars and vehicles from the 60s. Clothing is also a mixture of present-day and past fashions, emulating a prediction of the future from the 60s or 70s.

500|$|Sesame Street {{reflected}} the prevailing view that preschoolers had short attention spans; it featured a magazine-like format consisting of varied segments. Based on research conducted over the 30 {{years since the}} launch of Sesame Street by theorists like Anderson, the producers of Blue's Clues wanted to develop a show that took advantage of children's intellectual and behavioral activity when watching television. Previous children's television programs presented their content with little input from their viewers, but Blue's Clues {{was one of the}} first children's shows to actively invite its viewers' involvement. Its creators believed that if children were more involved in what they were viewing, they would attend to its content longer than previously expected—for up to a half hour—and learn more. They also dropped the magazine format for a more traditional narrative format. As Variety magazine stated, [...] "...The choice for Blue's Clues became to tell one story, beginning to end, camera moving left-to-right like reading a storybook, transitions from scene <b>to</b> <b>scene</b> as obvious as the turning of a page." [...] Every episode of Blue's Clues was structured in this way.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} marketed as being [...] "grittier {{than the average}} cop show" [...] {{according}} to Tony Schwartz of The New York Times, who described the setting as a San Francisco precinct. The Boston Globe Jack Thomas described the show's debut as the [...] "newest effort to dramatize the danger and frustration of police work" [...] and as being set in the Midwest. William A. Henry III wrote in The Boston Globe that the show's marketing endured so much conflict and confusion {{that it would have}} been sufficient to keep most shows from ever being scheduled to air. [...] With all the confusion, Henry's Globe colleague Bud Laughton described the pilot episodes and the series as [...] "long-awaited, on-again, off-again". Henry noted that, [...] "It is filmed to look like a documentary, with saturated color, a hand-held camera, quick cuts from scene <b>to</b> <b>scene,</b> high-decibel background noise, overlapping dialogue. The show creates atmosphere more than character. Like a documentary, it conveys a way of living more than a story." [...] The original version of the pilot had one mortal wound, but Henry correctly predicted that it would be re-edited to reduce the violence and allow both officers to return to work.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of Love and Rockets, the Hernandez {{brothers}} made increasing using of what Joseph Witek calls [...] "uncued closure": frequent use of abrupt ellipsis to pack large amounts of narrative into {{a small number of}} panels, relying on readers to fill in the gaps. [...] In Poison River the gaps between panels, which readers normally processed unconsciously, come to the forefront in a slow, staccato rhythm. [...] Panels are crowded with abundant dialogue, stretching out their perceived duration in time, while transitions from one panel to another are sudden—as are transitions from scene <b>to</b> <b>scene,</b> which can happen several times per page. [...] Hernandez limits the narrative only to important details, showing rapid growth in his characters and situations in limited space, rather than relating the story in a traditional step-by-step manner. [...] He compresses great a great deal of action into a minimum of panels, as in a two panel sequence which critic Jordan Raphael says [...] "delineates both the entirety (action and consequences) of a shootout between rival gangs even as [...] reveals each character's guiding motivation". [...] The narrative's chronology is fluid, with frequent jumps in time, such as an uncued 16-page flashback sequence. [...] Hernandez avoids using captions, leaving such jumps to the reader to sort out. [...] The copious, compact dialogue gives the reader an impression {{of what is going on}} at a given moment, but filtered through the speaker.|$|E
