5|$|Arsenal {{finished}} the league season {{without a single}} defeat and earned the tag of The Invincibles, a tag once given to the 1888–89 Preston North End team, the only previous team {{to go through a}} league season undefeated. Van Nistelrooy's missed penalty, therefore, was a crucial moment in Arsenal's season. The return fixture between the two sides at Highbury finished as a 1–1 draw and passed without incident. Manchester United finished in third place in the league table behind Chelsea but defeated Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final. Their run included a semi-final victory against Arsenal courtesy of a Paul Scholes goal. The following season, after Manchester United had brought Arsenal's unbeaten run to an end after 49 matches, the two clubs were involved in another incident at Old Trafford, variously dubbed the Battle of Old Trafford II, the Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Buffet</b> or simply the Battle of Old Trafford.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Buffet</b> system bassoon {{achieved}} {{its basic}} acoustical properties somewhat {{earlier than the}} Heckel. Thereafter, it continued to develop in a more conservative manner. While {{the early history of}} the Heckel bassoon included a complete overhaul of the instrument in both acoustics and key work, the development of <b>the</b> <b>Buffet</b> system consisted primarily of incremental improvements to the key work. This minimalist approach of <b>the</b> <b>Buffet</b> deprived it of improved consistency of intonation, ease of operation, and increased power, which is found in Heckel bassoons, but <b>the</b> <b>Buffet</b> is considered by some to have a more vocal and expressive quality. The conductor John Foulds lamented in 1934 the dominance of the Heckel-style bassoon, considering them too homogeneous in sound with the horn. The modern Buffet system has 22 keys with its range being about the same as the Heckel.|$|E
25|$|The modern bassoon {{exists in}} two {{distinct}} primary forms, <b>the</b> <b>Buffet</b> {{system and the}} Heckel system.

40|$|Problem statement: Flutter {{derivatives}} are {{the essential}} parameters in the estimations of the flutter critical wind velocity and {{the responses of}} long-span cable supported bridges. These derivatives can be experimentally estimated from wind tunnel test results. Generally, wind tunnel test methods {{can be divided into}} free decay test and buffeting test. Compared with the free decay method, <b>the</b> <b>buffeting</b> test is simpler but its outputs appear random-like. This makes the flutter derivatives extraction from its outputs more difficult and then a more advanced system identification is required. Most of previous studies have used deterministic system identification techniques, in which buffeting forces and responses are considered as noises. These previous techniques were applicable only to the free decay method. They also confronted some difficulties in extracting flutter derivatives at high wind speeds and under turbulence flow cases where <b>the</b> <b>buffeting</b> responses dominate. Approach: In this study, the covariance-driven stochastic subspace identification technique (SSI-COV) was presented to extract the flutter derivatives of bridge decks from <b>the</b> <b>buffeting</b> test results. An advantage of this method is that it considers <b>the</b> <b>buffeting</b> forces and responses as inputs rather than as noises. Numerical simulations and wind tunnel tests of a streamlined thin plate model conducted under smooth flow by the free decay and <b>the</b> <b>buffeting</b> tests were used to validate the applicability of the SSI-COV method. Then, wind tunnel tests of a two-edge girder blunt type of Industrial-Ring-Road Bridge deck (IRR) were conducted under smooth and turbulence flow. Results: The identified flutter derivatives of the thin plate model by the SSI-COV technique agree well with those obtained theoretically. The results from the thin plate and the IRR Bridge deck validated the reliability and applicability of the SSI-COV technique to various experimental methods and conditions of wind flow. Conclusion/Recommendations: The SSI-COV was successfully employed to identify flutter derivatives of bridge decks with reliable results. It is a proven technique that can be readily applied to identify flutter derivatives of other bridge decks either by the free decay or <b>the</b> <b>buffeting</b> tests...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>buffeting</b> loads {{acting on}} the wing and {{horizontal}} tail of a 1 / 4 -scale model of the X- 1 E airplane have been measured in the Langley 16 -foot transonic tunnel in the Mach number range from 0. 40 to 0. 90.

40|$|Characteristics of fin {{buffeting}} over various delta wings {{was investigated}} by measurements of fin tip acceleration, particle image velocimetry measurements, and flow visualization. For slender wings, {{there is a}} strong asymmetry with regard to the effect of fin location on <b>the</b> <b>buffeting</b> response, and largest response occurs for the inboard fin locations. For outboard fin locations, <b>the</b> <b>buffeting</b> is small, even at high angles of attack when vortex breakdown is well upstream. For inboard fin locations, the largest fin vibrations were found for breakdown locations well upstream of the fin, and when the shear layer of the breakdown region impinges on the fin. The results show that single-fin buffeting may be as important as twin-fin buffeting. For a wing with low sweep angle, vortex shedding rather than vortex breakdown may become the responsible mechanism, and large buffeting excitation for outboard fin locations at a specific incidence is possible. For a double-delta wing, the interaction of strake vortices with the wing flow has a major influence on <b>the</b> <b>buffeting</b> characteristics. Finally, it was found that a nonzero fin angle did not have much effect on the conclusions arrived in this study. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
