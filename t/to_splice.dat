5|$|Like the board, {{which might}} be an ad hoc affair, the actual exam {{questions}} were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate {{was expected to be}} able <b>to</b> <b>splice</b> ropes, reef a sail, work a ship in sailing and shift his tides. In navigation, he was expected {{to be able to keep}} a reckoning of the ship's way by plane sailing, to use Mercator projection maps and observation of the sun and stars to determine the course and position of the ship, and to understand the variation of the compass. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an able seaman and midshipman.|$|E
25|$|Overlap-{{extension}} PCR or Splicing by overlap extension (SOEing) : {{a genetic}} engineering technique {{that is used}} <b>to</b> <b>splice</b> together two or more DNA fragments that contain complementary sequences. It is used to join DNA pieces containing genes, regulatory sequences, or mutations; the technique enables creation of specific and long DNA constructs. It can also introduce deletions, insertions or point mutations into a DNA sequence.|$|E

25|$|In simpler terms, {{there is}} a maximum angle from the fiber axis at which light may enter the fiber {{so that it will}} propagate, or travel, in the core of the fiber. The sine of this maximum angle is the {{numerical}} aperture (NA) of the fiber. Fiber with a larger NA requires less precision <b>to</b> <b>splice</b> and work with than fiber with a smaller NA. Single-mode fiber has a small NA.|$|E

25|$|A more {{straightforward}} {{way to use}} kernel {{machines for}} deep learning was developed for spoken language understanding. The main idea {{is to use a}} kernel machine to approximate a shallow neural net with an infinite number of hidden units, then use stacking <b>to</b> <b>splice</b> the output of the kernel machine and the raw input in building the next, higher level of the kernel machine. The number of levels in the deep convex network is a hyper-parameter of the overall system, to be determined by cross validation.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new model for the {{splicing}} of long introns, which we call intrasplicing. The basic idea of this model is that the splicing of long introns may be facilitated by the splicing of inner parts of the intron prior <b>to</b> the <b>splicing</b> of the long intron itself. Since long introns have up to about 100, 000 bases, this model {{seems to be a}} likely explanation of their <b>splicing.</b> <b>To</b> investigate the possibility of this model, we develop a new computational method for the analysis of DNA sequences with respect <b>to</b> <b>splicing.</b> We analyze the genomic sequence of four species with our method and derive several results indicating that intrasplicing may be an appropriate model for the splicing of {{at least part of the}} long intron sequences. ...|$|R

25|$|Splicing timber piles {{is still}} quite common {{and is the}} easiest of all the piling {{materials}} <b>to</b> <b>splice.</b> The normal method for splicing is by driving the leader pile first, driving a steel tube (normally 60–100cm long, with an internal diameter no smaller than the minimum toe diameter) half its length onto {{the end of the}} leader pile. The follower pile is then simply slotted into {{the other end of the}} tube and driving continues. The steel tube is simply there to ensure that the two pieces follow each other during driving. If uplift capacity is required, the splice can incorporate bolts, coach screws, spikes or the like to give it the necessary capacity.|$|E
25|$|A {{vulnerability}} of the renegotiation procedure was discovered in August 2009 {{that can lead to}} plaintext injection attacks against SSL 3.0 and all current versions of TLS. For example, it allows an attacker who can hijack an https connection <b>to</b> <b>splice</b> their own requests into the beginning of the conversation the client has with the web server. The attacker can't actually decrypt the client-server communication, so it is different from a typical man-in-the-middle attack. A short-term fix is for web servers to stop allowing renegotiation, which typically will not require other changes unless client certificate authentication is used. To fix the vulnerability, a renegotiation indication extension was proposed for TLS. It will require the client and server to include and verify information about previous handshakes in any renegotiation handshakes. This extension has become a proposed standard and has been assigned the number RFC 5746. The RFC has been implemented by several libraries.|$|E

40|$|The A subunit of DNA gyrase in {{mycobacteria}} {{is frequently}} subjected <b>to</b> <b>splicing</b> events as its gene, gyrA, harbours an insertion encoding an intein.

500|$|When Diary of a Camper was created, no {{software}} tools existed to edit demo files into films. Rangers clan member Eric [...] "ArchV" [...] Fowler wrote his own programs to reposition {{the camera and}} <b>to</b> <b>splice</b> footage from the Quake demo file. Quake movie editing software later appeared, {{but the use of}} conventional non-linear video editing software is now common. For example, Phil South inserted single, completely white frames into his work No Licence to enhance the visual impact of explosions. In the post-production of , Rooster Teeth Productions added letterboxing with Adobe Premiere Pro to hide the camera player's head-up display.|$|E
500|$|Before Diary of a Campers release, Uwe Girlich, a German {{doctoral}} candidate, had {{documented the}} Quake demo file format, in which [...] "the player coordinates {{and the camera}} positions may be different". He added that [...] "for people with too much spare-time Quake can replace a full 3D modelling system". However, the Rangers developed Diary of a Camper before any demo-editing software tools had been publicly released; clan member Eric [...] "ArchV" [...] Fowler instead created his own tools to reposition the camera and <b>to</b> <b>splice</b> recorded footage. As with all of United Ranger Films' productions, Heath [...] "ColdSun" [...] Brown wrote the story, and Matt [...] "Unknown Soldier" [...] Van Sickler was the director.

500|$|During the SETI program, Earth's {{scientists}} {{send out}} transmissions (shown {{to be the}} Arecibo message) with information about Earth and its inhabitants, DNA structure, etc., in hopes of finding life beyond Earth. They then receive transmissions from an alien source on how to create endless fuel effortlessly. Therefore, the scientists assume {{that this is a}} friendly alien species. From a second alien transmission, the scientists receive information about an alien DNA along with instructions on how <b>to</b> <b>splice</b> it with human DNA. A government team led by Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) goes forward with the genetic experiment attempting to induce a female, under the (later proved to be mistaken) assumption that a female would have [...] "more docile and controllable" [...] traits.

500|$|The {{original}} musicians {{returned to}} the studio {{on the evening of}} April 3; they were joined by saxophonist Boots Randolph.

500|$|Captain Davy Jones had {{originally}} been designed with chin growths, before the designers made the move to full-blown tentacles; {{the skin of the}} character incorporates the texture of a coffee-stained Styrofoam cup among other elements. To portray Jones on set, Bill Nighy wore a motion capture tracksuit that meant the animators at Industrial Light & Magic did not have to reshoot the scene in the studio without him or on the motion capture stage. Nighy wore make-up around his eyes and mouth <b>to</b> <b>splice</b> into the computer-generated shots, but the images of his eyes and mouth were not used. Nighy only wore a prosthetic once, with blue-colored tentacles for when Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) steals the key to the Dead Man's Chest from under his [...] "beard" [...] as he sleeps. To create the CG version of the character, the model was closely based on a full-body scan of Nighy, with Jones reflecting his high cheekbones. Animators studied every frame of Nighy's performance: the actor himself had blessed them by making his performance more quirky than expected, providing endless fun for them. His performance also meant new controls had to be stored. Finally, Jones' tentacles are mostly a simulation, though at times they were hand-animated when they act as limbs for the character.|$|E

The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard thirty-two-bar form for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure.
