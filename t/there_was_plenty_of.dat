5|$|Following Michael VIII Palaiologos' reconquest of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantine Empire {{was left}} in a grave position. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> talk among the Latin states of the Greek {{mainland}} and other regions of retaking Constantinople for the Latin Empire whilst to the north the main threat came from Serbian expansion into the Balkans by king Stefan Uroš I. What was once a strong frontier under the Komnenian dynasty at the Danube river now threatened Constantinople itself.|$|E
5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked {{the fate of the}} expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E
5|$|At 13:29 {{the first}} Ju 87s took off. By 13:45 all were in {{formation}} and beginning the 85-mile trip. Major Helmut Bode led III./StG 77 to Poling. He {{knew nothing of}} the technicalities of his target. Behind him was Hauptmann Alfons Orthofer's II./StG 77 bound for Ford. After them, Hauptmann Herbert Meisel's III Gruppe was heading on {{the left of the}} formation for Thorney Island. Hauptmann Walter Seigel's I./StG 3 headed for Gosport on the extreme left. Each Ju 87 was loaded with 550-lb bombs under the main fuselage and four 11-lb bombs and two under each wing. The Bf 109s would not take off for some time. The long trip and low speed of the Ju 87s meant <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time to catch up without burning fuel keeping close contact with the Stukas.|$|E

5|$|A grandniece of Anne Boleyn {{and close}} to Elizabeth since childhood, Lettice Knollys was {{introduced}} early into court life. At 17 she married Walter Devereux, Viscount Hereford, who in 1572 became Earl of Essex. After her husband went to Ireland in 1573 she possibly became involved with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> scandalous talk, not least when Essex died in Ireland of dysentery in 1576. Two years later Lettice Knollys married Robert Dudley in private. When the Queen was told of the marriage she banished the Countess forever from court, effectively curtailing her social life. The couple's child, Robert, Lord Denbigh, {{died at the age}} of three, to the great grief of his parents and ending all prospects for the continuance of the House of Dudley. Lettice Knollys' union with Leicester was nevertheless a happy one, as was her third marriage to the much younger Sir Christopher Blount, whom she unexpectedly married in 1589 only six months after the Earl's death. She continued to style herself Lady Leicester.|$|E
25|$|Confederate {{soldiers}} were also faced with inadequate food rations, {{especially as the}} war progressed. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> meat in the Confederacy. The unsolvable problem was shipping it to the armies, especially when Lee's army in Virginia {{was at the end}} of a long, tenuous supply line. Union victory at Vicksburg in 1863 shut off supplies from Texas and the west.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, as {{a result}} of four A-4S being written off in {{separate}} accidents, coupled with the low serviceability of the original batch of A-4S. Investigations conducted by RSAF reveal that although <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> fuselage life left, the Wright J65 turbojet engines in use by the Skyhawks was too old and the associated spare parts were becoming both difficult and expensive to obtain. Consequently, the RSAF decided to upgrade the A-4S/TA-4S rather than to replace them.|$|E

25|$|In 1812, the U.S. was financially {{unprepared}} for war. The Democratic Republicans allowed the First Bank of the United States to expire in 1811, over Gallatin's objections. He had to ship $7 million to Europe {{to pay off}} its foreign stockholders just at a time money was needed for war. The heavy military expenditures for the War of 1812, and the decline in tariff revenue caused by the embargo and the British blockade cut off legitimate trade (<b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> untaxed smuggling).|$|E
25|$|As Davies's first attack {{ground to}} a halt and the attack of Irvin Gregg's brigade failed to {{dislodge}} the Confederates, David Gregg sent for reinforcements from Sheridan, who released two brigades from Torbert's division. Torbert's reserve brigade under Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt extended Gregg's line to the right, thwarting a flanking maneuver attempted by Hampton with Chambliss's newly arrived brigade. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> infantry nearby that could have been called for reinforcements, with Hancock's II Corps dug in about one mile to the north, and there are disagreements between Sheridan's memoirs and historians about whether he asked for such reinforcements.|$|E
25|$|That night, the Spanish generals held {{a council}} of war.

The council voted to adopt this action, which would secure the supply road from Le Boulou to Bellegarde. As a precaution, the council decided to withdraw the army's trains by the road to Bellegarde. However, they decided <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time to issue orders the next morning, rather than that evening.|$|E

25|$|When WSC players rejoined {{official}} cricket for 1979–80, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> {{debate over}} the Australian captaincy. Chappell was the far from unanimous choice, but led the Test team in twin series, against England (won 3–0) and West Indies (lost 0–2), and the first triangular ODI series where Australia failed to reach the final. It was a mixed bag of results and the programming came in for some criticism. Chappell led by example in scoring 74 and 124 in the Brisbane Test against the West Indies in his comeback to Test cricket. His 98* guided Australia to victory over England at Sydney, then 114 and 40* extracted a similar result at Melbourne. While he averaged 44 with the bat and claimed seven wickets in the ODIs, a constant shuffling of positions ensured an uneven Australian performance.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with Visscher's directions, Tasman sailed from Batavia on 14 August 1642 {{and arrived at}} Mauritius on 5 September 1642, according to the captain's journal. The reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> fresh water and timber to repair the ships. Tasman got {{the assistance of the}} governor Adriaan van der Stel. Because of the prevailing winds Mauritius was chosen as a turning point. After a four-week stay on the island both ships left on 8 October using the Roaring Forties to sail east as fast as possible. (No one had gone as far as Pieter Nuyts in 1626/27.) On 7 November snow and hail influenced the ship's council to alter course to a more north-eastern direction, expecting to arrive one day at the Solomon Islands.|$|E
25|$|As the {{takeoff roll}} began, {{the first officer}} noted several times to the captain that the {{instrument}} panel readings he was seeing {{did not seem to}} reflect reality (he was referring {{to the fact that the}} plane did not appear to have developed as much power as it needed for takeoff, despite the instruments indicating otherwise). The captain dismissed these concerns and let the takeoff proceed. Investigators later determined that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time and space on the runway for the captain to have aborted the takeoff, and criticized his refusal to listen to his first officer, who was correct that the instrument panel readings were wrong. The pilot was told not to delay because another aircraft was 2.5 miles out (4km) on final approach to the same runway. The following is a transcript of Flight 90's cockpit voice recorder during the plane's acceleration down the runway.|$|E

25|$|Dunning {{claimed to}} have {{directed}} most of the critical scene in which Quintus Arrius first confronts Judah Ben-Hur on the galley, {{as well as the}} following segment in which Arrius forces the slaves to row at high speed. Some of the dialogue in the scene, he says, was shot by Wyler, but most of the rest (including the high-speed rowing) was shot by Dunning himself. Dunning has stated that he spent several days on the high-speed rowing segment, shooting the sequence over and over from different angles to ensure that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> coverage. He then edited the immense amount of footage down to obtain a rough cut that matched the script, and then re-edited the footage to be more cinematic and work emotionally on screen. The galley sequence {{is one of the few}} scenes in the film which is not historically accurate, as the Roman navy (in contrast to its early modern counterparts) did not employ convicts as galley slaves.|$|E
25|$|After {{thrashing}} Wonga Park in the semi, {{they met}} Ainslie Park in the 1993/94 Chandler Shield Grand Final, which would twist and {{turn into the}} greatest RDCA final of all time. Scheduled for 3 days and 240 overs, Warrandyte batted first, as John Sharman's 64 runs pushed the score to a meagre total of 175 from 90 overs. With {{a day and a}} half day remaining, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time, and when Ainslie Park got within 35 runs with 7 wickets in hand, they had one hand their first Chandler Shield. Then Hogg produced a tremendous spell of bowling, and sparked a collapse of 6/31 to end day 2 with the game well and truly in the balance. The final day began with Warrandyte needing 1 wicket, and Ainslie 5 runs for victory. The first over was a maiden bowled by Sturesteps, then Hogg sent a yorker into the stumps, and Warrandyte into delirium.|$|E
25|$|Joel's brother Woolf Joel {{was murdered}} in Johannesburg in 1898, {{probably}} by a blackmailing con-man named Karl Frederic Moritz Kurtze going under the pseudonym of Ludwig von Veltheim. Although <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> evidence that Veltheim had been threatening Woolf Joel, the defense was that Veltheim had not been properly compensated for planning a kidnap scheme against the Boer leader Paul Krueger. That, the all Boer jury, and the mixture of anti-British and anti-Semitic feelings towards the deceased enabled Veltheim to avoid conviction. Freed, he was immediately deported from the Boer territories. For the next decade, Veltheim was following a series of con-games in Europe, but in 1907, he turned up in London, and started making threatening demands against Joel, who reported him to Scotland Yard, and the police arrested Veltheim. There was a trial for extortion, and Veltheim used the same defense he had previously used in Johannesburg, but the British jury was unconvinced and found him guilty. He was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment.|$|E

25|$|For their inaugural {{season in}} the league, the Colts brought in coach Bert Templeton to lead the upstart franchise. Jeff Cowan was named as the franchise's first captain. With a mixture of youth and experience, Templeton led the team to a 28–31–7 finish. The Colts became the first OHL team to make the post-{{season in the}}ir inaugural year. In the playoffs the Colts lost {{in the first round}} to the Kitchener Rangers. Although the Colts {{finished}} their first season in the league with a below-.500 record, and lost {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> optimism among Barrie fans. Seventeen-year-olds Alexandre Volchkov (63 points), and Jan Bulis (59 points), and sixteen-year-old Daniel Tkaczuk (61 points), who was selected first overall in the 1995 OHL selection, were some of the few reasons for hope. For his efforts in taking an expansion franchise to the playoffs, Templeton was honoured as the OHL Executive of the Year.|$|E
25|$|By 1844 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> {{business}} but little architecture. Mason dissolved his partnership with Paton {{and took up}} farming in Epsom. He designed a windmill there and may have had some hand {{in the building of}} St John's College at Epsom, but these were architecturally unproductive years. He continued farming in various places around Auckland and entered public life. In 1851 {{he was elected to the}} Common Council of Auckland, but eventually a substantial commission turned up. Mason was living at Howick late in 1854 when he was appointed architect of the 10,000 pound project to build a new Government House. The result was a large, two story, neo-classical building, whose manner may not have been entirely of Mason's choosing. It is made of timber treated to look like stone. Its principal facade has a central breakfront with round-headed windows in the upper floor. It has been the subject of rather mixed reviews since its completion in 1856 but it is a substantial house for New Zealand at the time and of its nature a significant building.|$|E
25|$|Cotton {{was first}} {{planted in the}} Shire valley by Eugene Sharrer, and the British Central Africa Company {{continued}} to grow cotton on its Chelumbo and Chikwawa estates. From 1903 the company also encouraged cotton cultivation by African smallholders in the Upper Shire District, by distributing cheap Egyptian cotton seed. The company gave instruction on the method of cultivation and agreed to buy the future crop at a guaranteed (but low) price. There was no significant shortage of land for peasant farming in the Upper Shire Valley, as the British Central Africa Company only exploited {{a small proportion of}} its land and, until the 1930s, the company tolerated squatters who did not pay rent on its land. Its tenants had to perform labour thangata or grow cotton for sale to the company, but in general <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> land available for food production. The efforts of the colonial administration to introduce cotton as a peasant cash-crop were largely unsuccessful, as the prices paid to the peasants were low, so they concentrated on growing food. The British Central Africa Company Ltd also had a cotton ginnery for processing its own and smallholder cotton until at least 1961. In 1971, the purchase and processing of smallholder cotton was taken over by a parastatal body.|$|E
