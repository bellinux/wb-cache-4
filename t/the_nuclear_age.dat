5|$|In May 1957, Eisenhower tasked the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) {{to provide}} {{a report on the}} {{potential}} effectiveness of fallout shelters and other means of protecting the US population {{in the event of a}} nuclear war. Chaired by Horace Rowan Gaither, the PSAC team completed their study in September, publishing it officially on 7 November as Deterrence & Survival in <b>the</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Age,</b> but today known as the Gaither Report. After ascribing an expansionist policy to the USSR, along with suggestions that they were more heavily developing their military than the US, the Report suggested that there would be a significant gap in capability in the late 1950s due to spending levels.|$|E
5|$|In World War II, {{the bomber}} mafia's {{theory of the}} primacy of unescorted {{daylight}} strategic bombing was proved wrong. Fleets of heavy bombers {{were not able to}} achieve victory without the cooperation of the Army and Navy, and required the protection of long-range fighters for deep penetration missions. Overall casualties in the war were not minimal, and victory did not come significantly quicker. Precision in bombing was not achieved until long-range fighter escorts became available and air superiority was achieved, as opponents had warned. The strategic bombing concept, however, was {{a major factor in the}} eventual victory and became the first core doctrine of the independent United States Air Force. Its proponents continued to promote the doctrine into <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>age,</b> forming the Strategic Air Command to carry out a vision modified to fit the needs of the Cold War and the threat of nuclear warfare. The bomber mafia was gradually replaced in the 1950s and 1960s by advocates of intercontinental ballistic missile warfare.|$|E

40|$|Context:Ages {{derived from}} the low mass stars still {{contracting}} onto the main sequence often differ from ages {{derived from the}} high mass ones that have already evolved away from it. Aims:We investigate the general claim of disagreement between these two independent age determinations by presenting UBVRI photometry of the young galactic open clusters NGC 2232, NGC 2516, NGC 2547 and NGC 4755, spanning the age range ~ 10 - 150 Myr Methods: We derive reddenings, distances and <b>nuclear</b> <b>ages</b> by fitting ZAMS and isochrones to color-magnitudes and color-color diagrams. To derive contraction ages, we use four different pre-main sequence models, with an empirically calibrated color-temperature relation to match the Pleiades cluster sequence. Results: When using exclusively the V vs. V-I color-magnitude diagram and empirically calibrated isochrones, there is consistency between <b>nuclear</b> and contraction <b>ages</b> for the studied clusters. Although the contraction ages seem systematically underestimated, in none of cases they deviate {{by more than one}} standard deviation from <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>ages.</b> Comment: 22 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication on A&A.

25|$|Illinois had a {{prominent}} role in the emergence of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>age.</b> In 1942, as part of the Manhattan Project, the University of Chicago conducted the first sustained nuclear chain reaction. In 1957, Argonne National Laboratory, near Chicago, activated the first experimental nuclear power generating system in the United States. By 1960, the first privately financed nuclear plant in the United States, Dresden 1, was dedicated near Morris. In 1967, Fermilab, a national nuclear research facility near Batavia, opened a particle accelerator, which was the world's largest for over 40 years. With eleven plants currently operating, Illinois leads all states in the amount of electricity generated from nuclear power.|$|E

Reconfiguring the nation's defences to meet the realities of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>age,</b> he ended National Service, strengthened the nuclear forces by acquiring Polaris, and pioneered the Nuclear Test Ban with the United States and the Soviet Union. Belatedly recognising the dangers of strategic dependence, he sought a new role for Britain in Europe, but his unwillingness to disclose United States nuclear secrets to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom's entry into the European Economic Community.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, Gale applied these {{principles}} {{to the development}} of airborne forces. An advocate of shock manoeuvre with elite forces, Gale stressed extensive training, the use of the latest battlefield technologies and strong personal leadership. For Gale, the quality of one's military forces were as important as their number, and he drew additional lessons on the disproportionate effect that surprise manoeuvre had on a 'demoralised or unprepared enemy', as opposed to a 'well-trained opposition', from the operations of his own 6th Airborne Division in Normandy. Later in life, Gale examined the issues of war in <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>age.</b> Still an advocate of manoeuvre and high-quality forces, Gale was to stress the importance of achieving mobility and flexibility {{in the face of the}} Soviet threat, foreshadowing in many ways the evolution of the AirLand battle doctrine of the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to review {{technical}} specifications for emergency diesel generators {{in the context of}} new information developed in <b>the</b> <b>Nuclear</b> Plant <b>Aging</b> Research Program and the application of current NRC regulatory concepts and knowledge. Aging and reliability relationships related to the standard technical specifications are reviewed and supported by data and published information to ensure that conservative and beneficial specifications are identified. Where technical specifications could adversely influence aging and reliability, the technical issues and reasonable alternatives are identified for consideration. This report documents and spans the technical progress from the published and approved regulatory documents to the current knowledge basis. This ensures that the technical bases for the technical specifications discussed are documented and relatively complete subject information is contained in one document. The Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) has participated in <b>the</b> <b>Nuclear</b> Plant <b>Aging</b> Research (NPAR) Program directed by <b>the</b> <b>Nuclear</b> Regulatory Commission&#x 27;s (NRC) Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, Division of Engineering. The NPAR study of emergency diesel generator aging was performed in two phases.

Phase II was chiefly concerned with aging mitigation measures...|$|R
25|$|He was {{insulated}} by his wife, who selected {{matters for}} his attention and delegated others to his cabinet. Wilson temporarily resumed a perfunctory attendance at cabinet meetings. By February 1920, the President's true condition was publicly known. At issue was Wilson's fitness {{for the presidency}} {{at a time when}} the League fight was reaching a climax, and domestic issues such as strikes, unemployment, inflation and the threat of Communism were ablaze. No one close to him, including his wife, his physician, or personal assistant, was willing to admit he was unable to perform the duties of the presidency. Because of this complex case, and the subsequent realization of the difficulties that might have been experienced in <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>age</b> if, instead of being assassinated in 1963, John F. Kennedy had been left in a permanent vegetative state on account of his brain injuries, the 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967 to allow the voluntary or forcible replacement of an unable or unwilling incumbent.|$|E
25|$|After the Bomber Gap {{came the}} Missile Gap. Eisenhower {{wanted to use}} the U-2 to {{disprove}} the Missile Gap, but he had banned U-2 overflights of the USSR after meeting Secretary Khrushchev at Camp David. Another reason the President objected {{to the use of the}} U-2 was that, in <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>age,</b> the intelligence he needed most was on their intentions, without which, the US would face a paralysis of intelligence. He was particularly worried that U-2 flights could be seen as preparations for first strike attacks. He had high hopes for an upcoming meeting with Khrushchev in Paris. Eisenhower finally gave into CIA pressure to authorize a 16-day window for flights, which was extended an additional six days because of poor weather. On May 1, 1960, the USSR shot down a U-2 flying over the Soviet territory. To Eisenhower, the ensuing coverup destroyed his perceived honesty, and his hope of leaving a legacy of thawing relations with Khrushchev. It would also mark the beginning of a long downward slide in the credibility of the Office of the President of the United States. Eisenhower later said that the U-2 coverup was the greatest regret of his Presidency.|$|E
