40|$|Prepared {{learning}}, {{learning that}} is selective, resistant to extinction, evident after one trial, and encapsulated from cognition, {{is said to}} underlie animal and social phobias (O¨ hman, 2009). Resistance to extinction has been shown for fears conditioned <b>to</b> <b>pictures</b> of snakes and spiders and <b>to</b> <b>pictures</b> of faces of threatening conspecifics (angry faces or faces that look different – other race faces). However, whereas fear conditioned <b>to</b> <b>pictures</b> of snakes and spiders is encapsulated from cognition, fear conditioned <b>to</b> <b>pictures</b> of other race faces is not (Mallan et al., 2009). The present study investigated whether fear conditioned <b>to</b> <b>pictures</b> of angry faces is encapsulated from cognition. Two groups of participants were trained in a differential Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure with angry face or happy face conditional stimuli (CSs). Prior to extinction, half the participants in each group were informed that no more unconditional stimuli would be presented. In the absence of verbal instruction, participants showed resistance to extinction after training with angry face CSs, but not after training with happy face CSs. Instructed extinction abolished differential fear conditioning regardless of the emotion expressed by the CS faces. This finding suggests that unlike fear conditioned <b>to</b> <b>pictures</b> of snakes and spiders, but similar to fear conditioned <b>to</b> <b>pictures</b> of other race faces, fear conditioned <b>to</b> <b>pictures</b> of angry faces is malleable by cognition...|$|R

Ulm noted that much of the automatic weapons and small arms fire came from the trees and that it was extremely accurate, so he ordered his company to concentrate on the well-camouflaged and concealed snipers in the trees.|$|E

25|$|Heuristics are {{cognitive}} short cuts. Instead of weighing all {{the evidence}} when making a decision, people rely on heuristics to save time and energy. The availability heuristic occurs when people estimate the probability of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine. As such, vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> or are difficult to understand, resulting in a corresponding cognitive bias. The representativeness heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype they know of. Numerous other biases have been found by social cognition researchers. The hindsight bias is a false memory of having predicted events, or an exaggeration of actual predictions, after becoming aware of the outcome. The confirmation bias {{is a type of}} bias leading to the tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.|$|E
25|$|Eventually {{the modern}} theory of quantum {{mechanics}} came <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> light as (in some sense) both a particle and a wave, and (in another sense), as a phenomenon which is neither a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, modern physics sees light as {{something that can be}} described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles), and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (water waves), but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined. As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.|$|E
25|$|The {{impetus for}} a more complex type of {{television}} remote control came in 1973, {{with the development of}} the Ceefax teletext service by the BBC. Most commercial remote controls at that time had a limited number of functions, sometimes as few as three: next channel, previous channel, and volume/off. This type of control did not meet the needs of teletext sets, where pages were identified with three-digit numbers. A remote control to select teletext pages would need buttons for each numeral from zero to nine, as well as other control functions, such as switching from text <b>to</b> <b>picture,</b> and the normal television controls of volume, channel, brightness, colour intensity, etc. Early teletext sets used wired remote controls to select pages, but the continuous use of the remote control required for teletext quickly indicated the need for a wireless device. So BBC engineers began talks with one or two television manufacturers, which led to early prototypes in around 1977–1978 that could control many more functions. ITT was one of the companies and later gave its name to the ITT protocol of infrared communication.|$|E

[...] Dorsey, however, pictured Conley as [...] "a familiar type" [...] of [...] "old negro", like a minstrel or plantation worker. [...] Dorsey's strategy played on prejudices of the white 1900s Georgia observers, i.e., that a black man could not have been intelligent enough to make up a complicated story. The prosecution argued that Conley's statement explaining {{the immediate aftermath of the}} murder was true, that Frank was the murderer, and that Frank had dictated the murder notes to Conley in an effort to pin the crime on Newt Lee, the night watchman.|$|E
