40|$|In the mid-nineties, {{multimedia}} became {{established as}} an industrial branch {{in the region}} of Munich. Munich holds a leading position among Germany's multimedia regions, referring to the numbers of companies and employees. The multimedia boom in the early 1990 s was triggered by a rapidly increasing demand from enterprises in the Munich region (in the automobile, electronics, publishing, movie and <b>television,</b> banking, <b>insurance</b> and advertising industries) for modern forms of information, communication and training. The multimedia companies find a sufficient supply of qualified labour on Munich's labour market. Moreover a broad range of institutions for education and training and the willingness of many employees to move into the Munich area are additional factors. Multimedia in the Munich region constitutes a fully-fledged production and service cluster. It is based on the availability of varied support services, a specific infrastructural environment, and a creative, innovative milieu. Vertical and horizontal cooperation along the value chain is enabled. Political support on the level of the Bundesland and the region does not primarily aim at promoting multimedia directly but at creating the basic conditions for the entire media economy as well as a specific further qualification of the employees.

5000|$|The first, {{and best}} known, of the Eagle <b>Insurance</b> <b>television</b> spots {{was created in}} 1993 by RDR Productions of Northbrook, Illinois. In the commercial, two young women are riding in an {{automobile}} when they suddenly hear a loud thud emanating {{from the roof of}} their car. Having no vehicle insurance, they realize they have been visited by Eagle Man, who speaks in a slow, deep voice and proclaims, “I’ve … got … something … for … you!” He then squats down and inexplicably lays an oversized egg, out of which hatches a hand puppet. The chick presents a piece of paper listing Eagle’s vehicle insurance rates, and the women exclaim in unison, “Ohhh, look at those low rates.” An announcer then provides a detailed description of all of Eagle Insurance’s services.|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "When potential borrowers apply for a mortgage loan, lenders typically use borrowers' credit scores [...] {{which are based on}} their credit payment histories, debt, length of credit history, new credit accounts or requests, and types of credit used [...] to help determine their creditworthiness. However, some borrowers have limited or no credit histories, and lenders are unable to determine their creditworthiness using this traditional method. For these nontraditional borrowers, lenders may assess creditworthiness through alternative means, including the compilation of performance on rental payments; utility, phone, and cable <b>television</b> bills; and <b>insurance</b> or tuition payments. While some lenders have developed statistical scoring methods to determine borrowers' creditworthiness based on these data, others rely on the judgment of their staff to make determinations on a case-by-case basis, according to Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) officials. HUD permits lenders that originate mortgages insured by HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to establish a borrower's credit history through alternative means and has provided guidance to FHA lenders for evaluating these nontraditional credit histories. According to HUD officials, 7, 319 nontraditional borrowers were approved for FHA-insured mortgages in fiscal year 2009. Section 2124 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) requires HUD to develop a pilot program establishing an automated process for providing FHA lenders with alternative credit rating information for borrowers who have insufficient credit histories to determine their creditworthiness using traditional methods. Section 2124 of HERA also directs GAO to report by July 30, 2010, on (1) the number of additional borrowers served using the automated process and (2) the impact of the process on the safety and soundness of FHA's insurance funds. ...|$|R
