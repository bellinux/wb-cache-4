40|$|In my {{dissertation}} I aim {{to explore}} the impacts of work-related mobility on job, family life and personal well-being of the <b>travelling</b> <b>employees.</b> To do so, three {{studies have been conducted}} with the purpose to investigate business travel behavioral patterns and impacts of work-related mobility on various life domains of the three segments, namely frequent corporate business travelers, expatriates and travelling academics, for whom the issues of travel stress and work-life balance are of great relevance. The first study focuses on the analysis of business travel impacts, both positive and negative ones, on the professional and private life of the 'road warriors', investigating the role of frequent work-related journeys in deteriorating work-life balance of the <b>travelling</b> <b>employees.</b> Having analyzed benefits and downsides of frequent business trips I address the possibility to enhance travel experience and improve employees' satisfaction and work productivity by means of providing travelers with the option to get involved into leisure life of visited destinations. The second paper examines factors that determine the degree of psychological success of expatriates and their satisfaction with international assignments overall, analyzing a wide array of variables from job, family and personal life domains. The research addresses the expatriation theme from the side of international assignees, providing implications for HRM departments directed towards improvement of expatriation experience. The last study sheds light on travel behavior of academics, investigating modes of travel and types of work-related trips undertaken by university employees, along with their attitude to travel and the influence of business trips on their work-life balance. The research demonstrates which trip features, work and non-work variables, as well as socio-demographic characteristics do matter when it comes to satisfaction with travel. The results of the afore-mentioned studies are relevant in terms of both theoretical contributions to the under-researched field of business travel, as well as practical implications. Apart from adding to the existing knowledge in the mobility field, the research outcomes demonstrate the necessity to carefully manage manifold aspects of business travel and expatriation in order to improve satisfaction of mobile employees with their trips of shorter or longer duration. In particular, the research sheds some light on work-life balance issues connected with travel, contributing to 'work-private life' conflict elimination and highlighting the crucial role of organizations in solving the existing problems...|$|R

The corporate travel industry may be influenced by videoconferencing. The focus {{of this study was to}} identify the impacts of videoconferencing on management decisions for <b>employee</b> <b>travel.</b> A review of literature, focusing on information technology and videoconferencing was completed. Information was gathered by studying industry journals and current publications. A questionnaire was used to collect further research. The survey was sent to decision makers for <b>employee</b> <b>travel.</b> The questionnaire was designed to capture both present and future perspectives. The questions were developed to gather information regarding strategic planning, economic development, employee growth and customer satisfaction within a corporate travel department. These areas were used to determine the impact of videoconferencing on the corporate travel industry. Overall, the results determined that videoconferencing has no significant impact on management decisions for <b>employee</b> <b>travel.</b> However, the study determined two facts that should be considered by corporate travel departments and agencies when developing their companies corporate travel strategic plan.

40|$|The tourism {{industry}} thrives {{on the notion}} that holiday travel improves well-being. However, scientific evidence that holiday travel is more beneficial than spending free time at home is lacking. Using the Effort-Recovery and the Limited Resources model as theoretical basis, this study investigates whether workers behave, think, and feel differently during travel than during leisure time spent at home. In a five-week longitudinal field study, we followed 24 workers during free evenings after work, a free weekend at home, and on a free weekend of domestic travel. Within-person differences were investigated between these three occasions in behavior, cognition, and emotions. During <b>travel,</b> <b>employees</b> slept more, engaged more in physical and social activities and less in obligatory activities than during free evenings after work. Hedonic well-being was higher and ruminative thinking lower during travel than during free evenings after work. Physical distance from home and work was related to engagement in resource-providing rather than resource-consuming activities and seems to translate into mental distance from everyday worries. Differences between holiday travel and weekends at home were small. Still, the findings suggest that travel may provide feelings of remoteness in places with novel and fascinating qualities, free of chores...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the risk of VTE in a cohort of Dutch airline pilots. Airline pilots who had been active members of the Dutch aviation society (VNV) were questioned for the occurrence of VTE, presence of risk factors for VTE and number of flight hours per year and rank. Incidence rates among pilots were compared with those of the general Dutch population and with a population of frequently flying employees of multinational organizations. A total of 2630 male pilots were followed-up for a total of 20420 person-years (py). Six venous thromboses were reported, yielding an incidence rate of 0. 3 per 1000 py. The standardized morbidity ratio, comparing these pilots with the general Dutch population adjusted for age, was 0. 8. Compared with the international employee cohort, the standardized morbidity ratio was 0. 7 when all employees were included and 0. 6 when only the frequently <b>travelling</b> <b>employees</b> were included. The incidence rate did not increase with number of flight hours per year and did not clearly vary by rank. We conclude that the risk of VTE is not increased amongst airline pilot...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{economic}} {{importance of the}} meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE) industry, it remains relatively underresearched. The area of incentive travel is particularly lacking in academic research and remains without a strong theoretical foundation. Anecdotal evidence suggests that incentive travel {{is seen as an}} important and significant reward by organizations and their employees. However, while considerable research has examined how to motivate employees in the workplace, including the use of incentives, there has been little examination of why travel makes such as good incentive. In an effort to address this gap, this conceptual article integrates tourism motivation literature with the literature on employee motivation, with particular reference to expectancy theory. Expectancy theory suggests that the valence of a reward (its attractiveness) is a key component of motivating <b>employees.</b> <b>Travel</b> motivation theory helps to explain which particular aspects of travel make it an attractive reward. The article presents an introductory conceptual framework for understanding the relationship between incentive <b>travel</b> and <b>employee</b> motivations and acts as a foundation for future research in this area...|$|R
