5|$|The keep {{is unusual}} {{both for the}} period and for Devon as a whole, being a very strong {{defensive}} structure, albeit without any independent source of water or facilities to support a garrison {{in the event of}} a siege. Other rectangular 11th century keeps in Devon existed, including at Exter and Lydford, and were typically associated with the king or major nobles. Few were built on top of fresh mottes, as at Okehampton, and this may have been made possible in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>because</b> the motte was largely natural and therefore able to support the heavy weight.|$|E
25|$|Each {{preposition}} {{is associated}} {{with one or more}} grammatical cases. The noun governed by a preposition must appear in the case required by the preposition in the given context (e.g. from friends = od priateľov). Priateľov is the genitive case of priatelia.

25|$|Counsel for the Law Society raised two counterarguments to this point, both {{stemming}} {{from the fact that}} this was an application for judicial review. First, he argued that the High Court should be reluctant to exercise its powers of judicial review in <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>because</b> Shankar had an alternative remedy in the form of show cause proceedings before a court of three judges. Secondly, he argued that evaluating whether the standard of proof was applied correctly would involve an examination of the merits of the Committee's decision, and such an examination of merits was not permitted in a judicial review case.|$|E
25|$|Jordan frames {{provide one}} of the main Jordan {{algebraic}} techniques to describe the symmetry groups. Each Jordan frame gives rise to a product of copies of R and C. The symmetry groups of the corresponding open domains and the compactification—polydisks and polyspheres—can be deduced from the case of the unit disk, the upper halfplane and Riemann sphere. All these symmetries extend to the larger Jordan algebra and its compactification. The analysis can also be reduced to <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>because</b> all points in the complex algebra (or its compactification) lie in an image of the polydisk (or polysphere) under the unitary structure group.|$|E
25|$|Separating {{the effect}} of {{resource}} use from that of interference is not easy. A good example of exploitative competition is found in aphid species competing over the sap in plant phloem. Each aphid species that feeds on host plant sap uses some of the resource, leaving less for competing species. In one study, Fordinae geoica was observed to out-compete F. formicaria {{to the extent that}} the latter species exhibited a reduction in survival by 84%. Another example is the one of competition for calling space in amphibians, where the calling activity of a species prevents the other one from calling in an area as wide as it would in allopatry. A last example is driving of bisexual rock lizards of genus Darevskia from their natural habitats by a daughter unisexual form; interference competition can be ruled out in <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>because</b> parthenogenetic forms of the lizards never demonstrate aggressive behavior.|$|E

25|$|Metaxa {{comes in}} nine major varieties: Three Stars, Five Stars, Five Stars Honey Shot, Seven Stars, Twelve stars, Grande Fine, Private Reserve, Angels Treasure and AEN. The number of stars {{represents}} {{the number of}} years the blend is matured. The three and 5 star are not as different, but the 5 star is notably drier, making the alcohol more pronounced. The seven and twelve star are more flavoursome and complex, while the Twelve-star G.O.R. is again more dry, in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>because</b> there is no addition of wine. In either of the two latter varieties, the smell and taste of the barrel in which the brandy matured is noticeable. The house of Metaxa has recently launched a new product, the Metaxa Twelve Star containing distillates matured for 12 years adding Muscat wine from the island of Samos, unlike the Metaxa Twelve Stars Grand Olympian Reserve. Metaxa Private Reserve is the most oldest member of Metaxa family. Only 5.000 numbered decanters of Metaxa Private Reserve are on the market containing distillates aged for 30 years from Spyros Metaxas' family barrels.|$|E
25|$|Azeotropes {{can form}} {{only when a}} mixture {{deviates}} from Raoult's law. Raoult's law applies when the molecules of the constituents stick to each other {{to the same degree}} as they do to themselves. For example, if the constituents are X and Y, then X sticks to Y with roughly equal energy as X does with X and Y does with Y. A positive deviation from Raoult's law results when the constituents have a disaffinity for each other – that is X sticks to X and Y to Y better than X sticks to Y. Because this results in the mixture having less total sticking together of the molecules than the pure constituents, they more readily escape from the stuck-together phase, which is to say the liquid phase, and into the vapor phase. When X sticks to Y more aggressively than X does to X and Y does to Y, the result is a negative deviation from Raoult's law. In <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>because</b> there is more sticking together of the molecules in the mixture than in the pure constituents, they are more reluctant to escape the stuck-together liquid phase.|$|E
25|$|Slack et al. {{reported}} that {{the total number of}} boron atoms in the unit cell, calculated from the measured values of density, chemical composition and lattice constant, is 1628 ± 4, which is larger than the value 1584 obtained from the structural analysis. The number of B atoms in the unit cell remains nearly constant when the chemical composition changes from YB56 to YB66. On the other hand, the total number of yttrium atoms per unit cell varies, and it is, for example, ~26.3 for YB62 (see right table). If the total number of Y atoms stays below or equal to 24 then it is possible that one Y atom accommodates in each Y pair (partial occupancy). However, the experimental value of 26.3 significantly exceeds 24, and thus both pair sites might be occupied. In <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>because</b> of the small separation between the two Y atoms, they must be repelled by the Coulomb force. To clarify this point, split Y sites were introduced in the structure analysis resulting in a better agreement with the experiment. The Y site distances and occupancies are presented in the left table.|$|E

When people suffer a fracture by an accident or have problems in this location, need to improve a rehabilitation process. This robot helps in <b>this</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>because</b> it combines movements of abduction/adduction and flexion/extension that help the patients to restore their mobility.

500|$|On August 26, 2016 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit {{dismissed}} Dugard's civil claims {{under the}} Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). In a 2-1 decision authored by Judge John B.

500|$|Running in {{parallel}} to the Marines' criminal trial were legal proceedings relating to the anonymity of the defendants. In the autumn of 2012, Judges Advocate Elsom and Blackett issued anonymity orders for the Marine defendants due to the risk that, once named, the defendants would become targets for terrorists. The move had been opposed by elements of the UK media. A lawyer for the Press Association argued that anonymity orders should not be issued in <b>this</b> <b>case</b> <b>because,</b> firstly, British military award recipients named in the media had not been previously targeted; and, secondly, that {{the names of those}} British service personnel investigated following the death of Baha Mousa had not been similarly protected.

[...] He concluded that officers therefore acted reasonably [...] "under these circumstances in stopping a driver whose alleged conduct was a significant indicator of drunk driving". Justice Thomas noted that many drivers will behave more cautiously when followed by police officers, and he concluded that {{there was no need to}} conduct [...] "xtended observation" [...] in <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>because</b> [...] "allowing a drunk driver a second chance for dangerous conduct could have disastrous consequences".|$|E
