Aims: To study the change in <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> of interns towards psychiatry before and after clinical rotation in Psychiatry. Methods: The study sample comprised of 60 interns in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Medical Condition Regard Scale (MCRS) {{was used to assess}} <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> of interns towards Psychiatry before and after a 2 week Psychiatry rotation.

40|$|Abstract — A {{deterministic}} attitude estimation {{problem for}} a rigid body in an attitude dependent potential field with bounded measurement errors is studied. An attitude estimation scheme that does not use generalized coordinate representations of <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> is presented here. Assuming that <b>the</b> initial <b>attitude,</b> angular velocity and measurement noise lie within given ellipsoidal bounds, an uncertainty ellipsoid that bounds <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> and <b>the</b> angular velocity of the rigid body is obtained. The center of the uncertainty ellipsoid provides point estimates, and its size gives {{the accuracy of the}} estimates. The point estimates and the uncertainty ellipsoids are propagated using a Lie group variational integrator and its linearization, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>attitude</b> estimation is optimal in the sense that <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> estimation error {{and the size of the}} uncertainty ellipsoid is minimized, and it is global since <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> is represented by a rotation matrix.

40|$|A {{satellite}} naturally becomes {{charged in}} space filled with collisionless plasma. The relaxation methods for charging {{have been studied}} for a long time. Charged satellites are subjected to Coulomb forces from other charged satellites. Besides, the charged satellite is subjected to Lorentz force from the Earth's magnetic field. Control of charging a satellite is a good method to control orbit and attitude of satellites since {{it has the potential}} to lead novel dynamics. In the present thesis, we analyze <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> motion of electrical-charged satellites using Lorentz force caused by Earth's magnetic field. Attitude control methods using gravity gradient torque are conventionally applied to a number of satellites. However, we apply them for the mission keeping and changing <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> to <b>the</b> orbital radius direction. The objective is to demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> dynamics with <b>the</b> Lorentz force and the gravity force for <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> control using these forces.

5|$|The Capcom Five {{announcement}} {{came at a}} {{time when}} Nintendo had been struggling with its new console, with the apparent goal of supporting the fledgling system. However, each successive game's release reinforced Capcom's view that the GameCube was unprofitable; they ported the games one-by-one to Sony's PlayStation 2. These ports were generally inferior in quality: many reviewers noted slowdown issues and lower resolution graphics. Ultimately, four games were released and only one remained exclusive to GameCube. This lone GameCube exclusive was P.N.03 and not Resident Evil 4, as Capcom had repeatedly emphasized in press releases. GameCube owners and Nintendo fans were disappointed by the Capcom Five's failure to improve the GameCube's reputation and sales. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku noted that despite best intentions, Capcom's five even at their full potential could not have made up for the GameCube's failings in that generation's console wars. The dramatic reversal of the five is representative of <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> of third-party developers toward Nintendo's platform.|$|E

In this paper, a computationally efficient nonlinear attitude estimation strategy based on the vector observations is proposed. The Rodrigues parameter is chosen as <b>the</b> local error <b>attitude</b> parameter, to maintain the normalization constraint for the quaternion in the global estimator. <b>The</b> proposed <b>attitude</b> estimator is performed in four stages. First, <b>the</b> local <b>attitude</b> estimation error system is described by a polytopic linear model.
