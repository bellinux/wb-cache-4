500|$|Filming for Crossroads {{initiated}} in March 2001 in Baton Rouge and Hammond, Louisiana, near Spears' hometown. Due {{to the fact}} that Spears was also recording her third studio album along with the film's production, filming only wrapped up after six months. Additional scenes were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Crossroads had a total budget of $10 million; a relatively low budget by industry standards. According to the Louisiana Film and Video Commission, the film was originally titled What Friends are For. Spears described it as a teen movie that deals with real issues that normal teenagers live on a daily basis. She continued to explain the film's content, saying that it [...] "is about this journey that <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> best friends take, finding ourselves and what we want out of life and getting our friendship back. Friends are all you have {{at the end of the}} day. When your boyfriend breaks up with you, who do you call? Your girlfriend. I just love that message." ...|$|E

We have played with some [...] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We're not interested in stepping on [...] rich legacy. It's a tough thing to go through. Do you take the Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a lot of years. Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We're willing {{to take a chance on}} it. It's completely a reunion because <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who're left are back together. But it's not about separating and forgetting — it's about remembering and moving on." [...] Before the tour, Kinney mentioned in an interview that he would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains.|$|E
500|$|Aspinall later commented {{about his}} first meeting with George Harrison, who also {{attended}} the Liverpool Institute: [...] "My first encounter with George was behind the school’s air-raid shelters. [...] This great mass of shaggy hair loomed up and an out-of-breath voice requested a quick drag of my Woodbine. It {{was one of the first}} cigarettes either of us had smoked. We spluttered our way through it bravely but gleefully. After that <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> did lots of ridiculous things together.... By the time we were ready to take the GCE exams we added John Lennon to our 'Mad Lad' gang. He was doing his first term at Liverpool College of Art which overlooks the Liverpool Institute playground and we all got together in a students coffee bar at lunchtime." [...] Aspinall took nine GCEs at the Institute and passed eight of them, but failed the French exam. He left school in July 1959, and studied accountancy. [...] Aspinall worked for a Liverpool company for two years, receiving a wage of £2-10s–0d. (£2.50 decimal equivalent) per week as a trainee accountant.|$|E

500|$|The group's primary musical {{influences}} {{came from}} bands such as Buzzcocks, The Jam, Madness and The Kinks. Supergrass took this contemporary music and mixed it with pop punk's characteristic fast, three-chord, guitar-based, catchy tunes {{to produce a}} sound uniquely their own; [...] "we were just <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> in my bedroom or someone's house, just making... we played really hard and just made loads of noise. Most of our early songs were just three chord grooves and stuff that was fun to play. So that's why the first album sounded so 'punky', I think... it's just 'cause we were all used to playing in this small room and it being really loud, so we just made the album sound like that." [...] Songs for Beginners by Graham Nash was another possible influence on I Should Coco. Gaz Coombes told The Guardian in 2003, [...] "We used {{to listen to it}} a lot when we lived in Cowley Road in Oxford in 1994, just when the band were getting big." ...|$|E

He read a short statement from the family, and disclosed that Jennings had died in his New York apartment with his fourth wife, two children by his marriage to Kati Marton, and sister at his side. The anchor's ABC colleagues, including Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, and Ted Koppel, shared their thoughts on Jennings's death.

I do remember that TV Guide did a quote that <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can be compared to Earth, Wind and Fire. Michele was the Earth, I was the Wind and Donna was the Fire. I think that really captured it." [...] Van Ark was later asked about who she saw Val as today. She said, [...] "Of course the dysfunctional elements would come out. Why even bother otherwise? But of course they would persevere and still be together after all.

500|$|The trio {{embarked}} on a European tour the following fall, during which DeLonge felt increasingly conflicted both about his creative freedom within the group and the toll touring was taking on his family life. [...] "It became [...] we weren't a band, it wasn't <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> working together for a goal," [...] said Hoppus, [...] "it was like me and Travis having to pull his along, and be like, 'Come on, let's go, let's do this that we all created and that we love.'" [...] DeLonge eventually expressed his desire to take a half-year respite from touring in order {{to spend more time}} with family. Hoppus and Barker were dismayed by his decision, which they felt was an overly long break. In addition, DeLonge was not fond of Barker's new reality television series, Meet the Barkers; he disliked television cameras everywhere, feeling as though his personal privacy was invaded. Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, DeLonge agreed to perform at Music for Relief's Concert for South Asia, a benefit show to aid victims. Further arguments ensued during rehearsals, rooted in the band member's increasing paranoia and bitterness toward one another. DeLonge asserted he would only record another album at his home in San Diego, suggesting he mail Pro Tools files back and forth to Hoppus and Barker in Los Angeles. The duo were flexible regarding DeLonge's time off, but became angry when he began deciding [...] "when we can and can't tour, when and how we can record." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's overall {{low profile}} in 2008 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} due to them spending time working on their second album. However, in December 2008, Delorentos explained in their MySpace blog that a potential record deal had fallen through due to the prospective label encountering financial problems. Added to this, the collapse of Pinnacle, their distribution company, denied the band a chance to release their album in the United Kingdom. Their blog entry stated that [...] "these are strange times for everyone, and for us in the music industry {{there has been a lot}} of uncertainty. It just happened that our opportunity coincided with this extraordinary time." [...] After performing a number of shows with fellow Dubliners Director, Delorentos announced their break-up on 17 February 2009. The split came about after Yourell decided to leave the band due to his desire to [...] "do other things". A MySpace entry stated: [...] "It's with a very heavy heart that we have to let you know that Ronan has decided to leave the band. He feels its best for him to move on and do other things. <b>The</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will still be making music and will let you know about what happens next". However, they still planned to record their second album, believed to be titled You Can Make Sound, in March 2009 – it would contain all the songs they had written in the previous year – and play [...] "a gig or two" [...] as part of a farewell tour. The band's farewell tour includes shows in Whelan's in Dublin and Cyprus Avenue in Cork. Reaction to the split was generally one of shock – The Kinetiks were amongst the neighbouring bands they had influenced, Jacqui Carroll attributed her discovery of Irish music to an early Delorentos show, whilst blogger UnaRocks, John Walshe of State, Jonnie Craig and others had recently been championing the band's sound. On 22 April 2009, the band announced they would not split after all, citing a newfound excitement for recording as their reason. Yourell later explained that the band signing away their independent stance only to be let down by their record company had [...] "knocked us out of our stride" [...] and had led to him considering his future.|$|E
