5000|$|Each cell {{has four}} flagella of equal length, {{in which the}} flagella are shorter than {{the length of the}} cell. [...] The flagella emerge from the apical {{depression}} in pairs and point in opposite directions, running parallel to the long side of the cell. [...] Due to their emergence from a deep depression, the mechanical force the flagella can produce is restricted. [...] Other lineages with non-depressed flagellar insertions can produce higher amounts of flagellar force, because the flagellar base is not geometrically limited. [...] The flagella of Tetraselmis species are thick, covered in mucilaginous material, and have a blunt end. [...] They are also covered in flagellar hairs which are loosely attached to the cell exterior; they are cross-striated with two scale layers on flagella. [...] See figure 3 for a detailed picture of flagella including their scales and hair. The inner layer is compact and densely covers the flagella, and hair cells are attached to the cell membrane through small sections of membrane that are not covered due to patterning. [...] The outer scale layer is made of small-round scales which are mainly used to overlap bare membrane not covered by the inner scales. [...] The inner scales are larger than the outer scales, and usually resemble a pentagon or square in shape. [...] See figure 1 for a generalized drawing of flagellar scales. The flagellar hairs have a distinct sequence of structural components, the proximal filament connects the flagellum and cell surface, this is followed by the <b>tubular</b> <b>shaft,</b> then the transition zone in which the shaft is modified, followed by a stretch of linear globular subunits, and the hair ends with a distal filament.

[...] Thus, flagellar hairs are a good morphological tool for species comparison and classification. [...] Figure 1 includes these hairs on the flagella drawing. Species use their flagella to travel in straight lines while rotating along their axis, in which they travel in one direction for long distances and then abruptly change directions instantaneously without stopping.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the failure {{investigation of a}} <b>tubular</b> <b>shaft</b> {{that is part of}} a hammer drill assembly. The failure investigation was particularly challenging as the fracture surfaces were completely damaged during and subsequent to the failure process. However, careful examination of the component and its assembly revealed many clues that pointed to the root causes of failure. It was determined that the shaft was subjected to impact, fatigue, bending and torsional loads simultaneously at elevated temperatures. The basic failure mode was identified as a combination of torsional fatigue and rotating bending fatigue failure that originated on the inside diameter of the shaft. The root causes were determined to be operational overload in combination with rough machining marks on the bore surface and higher than necessary operating torque required to overcome the dry adhesive friction in the system. The preventative measures recommended were many-fold including improving surface finish on the bore diameter, reducing dry sliding friction, decreasing the overall level of dynamic loads by appropriate design changes and adding a surface strengthening heat treatmen...|$|E

Time and frequency domain analysis of pressure pulsation of typical measure points indicated that larger pulsation amplitudes appeared in the tip of the blades and the main vibration source was the pressure pulsation induced by rotation of the blades. The fluid pulsation amplitudes decreased gradually along the flow direction, which can be ascribed to the function of fixed guide vane. Structural analysis of the blades in both pressure and suction side indicated that significant stress concentration was formed at the blade and hub connection near the leading edge. Maximum effective stress of the blades varied periodically, so prevention measures of the fatigue of blades should be taken.

40|$|The structure, assembly, and {{composition}} of the extracellular hairs (mastigonemes) of Ochromonas are detailed in this report. These mastigonemes form two lateral unbalanced rows, each row {{on opposite sides of}} the long anterior flagellum. Each mastigoneme consists of lateral filaments of two distinct sizes attached to a <b>tubular</b> <b>shaft.</b> The shaft is further differentiated into a basal region at one end and a group of from one to three terminal filaments at the free end. Mastigoneme ontogeny as revealed especially in deflagellated and regenerating cells appears to begin by assembly of the basal region and shaft within the perinuclear continuum. However, addition of lateral filaments to the shaft and extrusion of the mastigonemes to the cell surface is mediated by the Golgi complex. The ultimate distribution of mastigonemes on the flagellar surface seems to be the result of extrusion of mastigonemes near the base of the flagellum, and it is suggested that mastigonemes are then pulled up the flagellum as the axoneme elongates. Efforts to characterize mastigonemes biochemically after isolation and purification on cesium chloride (CsCI) followed by electrophoresis on acrylamide gels have demonstrated what appear to be a single major polypeptide and several differentially migrating carbohydrates.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a methodology to synthesize a fuzzy controller to correct the tracking dynamics of the electromechanical positioning drive trajectory. A general framework about topologies in the field of linear electromechanical drives is presented. Special focus is made on parallel manipulators using tubular linear synchronous permanent magnet motors, where computer simulations confirmed large amplitude variations of load forces applied to linear actuators of the six degrees of freedom (6 DOF) parallel manipulator. The 6 DOF parallel manipulators are wide used for the support of the flight simulators, and are projected to emulate the aeronautic motions. The commercial 6 DOF parallel manipulators usually employ hydraulic linear actuators. The hydraulic linear actuators have bigger volume/power ratio than tubular linear synchronous motors and an expensive maintenance cost. The difficulties of these applications are {{in the absence of the}} trajectory planning, which is common in parallel manipulator applications. The fuzzy controller synthesis for the linear position drive is described. Its main goal is to perform the automatic adjustment of the tubular linear motor positioning trajectory, by changing its speed and acceleration references. The resulting motion trajectory obtained from the fuzzy controller is particularly suited to high accuracy applications such as parallels manipulators, robotics systems and factory automation. The electromechanical position drive present in this paper is based on Permanent Magnet Tubular Linear Synchronous Motor (PM-TLSM) as the electromechanical linear actuator fed by a position drive controller and a linear encoder as feedback device of the system. The structure of the laboratory prototype of the fuzzy controller coupled to the electromechanical linear position drive is presented. The experimental results demonstrate that the trajectory correction is made lower than 1 s. Comparing the experimental results with different loads, it is verified that the position errors values does not depend of the load force applied to the <b>tubular</b> linear motor <b>shaft.</b> The experimental results obtained are used to evaluate the performance of the fuzzy controller, which was able to reduce the positioning errors from 40 % to 10 %...|$|R
