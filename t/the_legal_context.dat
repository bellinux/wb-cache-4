2500|$|There {{was wide}} {{agreement}} that the FCO was still withholding files. Keith Flett said: [...] "It {{is likely to be}} correct that despite William Hague's professed policy of transparency towards the release of government files from the colonial era that far from everything will be released and it will depend on the skills of historians to spot gaps in the record." [...] Elkins, who, like Anderson, is an expert witness for the Mau Mau legal action, highlighted the need for caution, and wrote of her involvement with trying to get files out of the foreign office for analysis back at Harvard: [...] "This process has been anything but straightforward. Despite <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>context,</b> the FCO has culled files, requiring multiple requests for full disclosure, and still files have not been forthcoming." [...] Of the April 2012 release, she noted that it [...] "excludes territories such as Palestine and Rhodesia. The Cyprus files exclude the period of the emergency. The Malaya files cover very little of the contested emergency years. The Kenya documents are a meagre subset of the files released (though culled) {{in the context of the}} Mau Mau case. For all 12 colonies covered in today's release, there appears to be a great deal pertaining to finance, tourism, administration and the like. ... The first release of the 'migrated archives' is, at first glance, lacking in substantive files, particularly for former colonies like Cyprus and Malaya where future lawsuits potentially loom." ...|$|E

2500|$|Israel has {{a policy}} of {{targeted}} killings against those it considers proven to have intentions of performing a specific act of terrorism {{in the very near}} future or to be linked with several acts of terrorism. In 2006, the Supreme Court of Israel issued its judgment in The Public Committee against Torture in Israel v. The Government of Israel. The case addressed the issue of whether the state acts illegally in its policy of targeted killings. The court considered that <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>context</b> is a conflict [...] "of an international character (international armed conflict). Therefore, the law that applies to the armed conflict between Israel and the terrorist organizations is the international law of armed conflicts." [...] The court decided that [...] "members of the terrorist organizations are not combatants [...] They do not fulfill the conditions for combatants under international law" [...] and that [...] "they do not comply with the international laws of war." [...] They concluded that [...] "members of terrorist organizations have the status of civilians" [...] but that [...] "the protection accorded by international law to civilians does not apply at the time during which civilians take direct part in hostilities." [...] They ruled that they could not determine whether targeted killings are always legal or always illegal, but the legality must be established on a case by case basis. Their ruling stated [...] "it cannot be determined in advance that every targeted killing is prohibited according to customary international law, just as it cannot be determined in advance that every targeted killing is permissible according to customary international law. The law of targeted killing is determined in the customary international law, and the legality of each individual such act must be determined in light of it." [...] The judgment included guidelines for permissible and impermissible actions involving targeted killings and provided the conditions for investigating the criminality of some of the actions.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{test for}} <b>legal</b> advice {{privilege}} {{is to establish}} whether the communication in question was made confidentially for <b>the</b> purpose of <b>legal</b> advice - construing such purposes broadly. [...] That breadth was emphasized by the House of Lords, which has stated that the policy justification for legal advice privilege rests not simply {{on the right of}} the individual to obtain confidential legal advice, but also on the public interest in the observance of law and the administration of justice. The House therefore decided that legal advice privilege was to be given the scope commensurate with these wide policy considerations. To achieve this end, legal advice could not be narrowly construed to be limited to advice on <b>the</b> client's <b>legal</b> rights and liabilities. It would be broadly construed, to include advice as to what should prudently and sensibly be done in <b>the</b> relevant <b>legal</b> <b>context.</b> Where there was doubt about <b>the</b> relevant <b>legal</b> <b>context,</b> <b>the</b> court should ask (a) whether the advice related to the rights, liabilities, obligations or remedies of the client under either private or public law; and, if so, (b) whether the communication fell within the policy justification for the privilege.|$|R
