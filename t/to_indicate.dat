5|$|In the tropics, a {{plentiful}} {{supply of}} phytoplankton is continuously available for starfish larvae to feed on. Spawning {{takes place at}} any time of year, each species having its own characteristic breeding season. In temperate regions, the spring and summer brings an increase in food supplies. The first individual of a species to spawn may release a pheromone that serves to attract other starfish to aggregate and to release their gametes synchronously. In other species, a male and female may come together and form a pair. This behaviour is called pseudocopulation and the male climbs on top, placing his arms between those of the female. When she releases eggs into the water, he is induced to spawn. Starfish may use environmental signals to coordinate the time of spawning (day length <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> the correct time of the year, dawn or dusk <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> the correct time of day), and chemical signals <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> their readiness to breed. In some species, mature females produce chemicals to attract sperm in the sea water.|$|E
