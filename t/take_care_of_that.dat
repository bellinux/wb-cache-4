25|$|In 1990, Rykodisc {{released}} , {{billed as}} a Badfinger live recording from 1974. The album underwent substantial re-recording, and a rearranged track order by the album's producer, Molland, and had a mixed critical reaction. The album's release then sparked {{a lawsuit filed by}} Molland. The band's accounting firm, collecting for a 1985 court order settlement, had re-adjusted against Molland's Apple royalty income by deducting away the percentage amounts of that court order, then reimbursing those amounts to the other Badfinger parties. The Rykodisc contract did not include artist royalty payments, because Molland had advised Rykodisc he would <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> distribution himself under another company name. Molland subsequently sued the other members and their estates to recoup his expenses plus a producer's royalty. He was awarded a partial settlement, as the judge stated the evidence against Molland was insufficient to justify a severe penalty, also noting that since both parties had conceded the original tapes were of a poor quality, Molland's salvaging of them to a commercial level merited consideration.|$|E

500|$|Richard Johnson, under {{contract}} to MGM, was cast as Dr. Markway. Wise saw Johnson in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of The Devils. Impressed with his acting, he offered him the role. Johnson later said he received invaluable film acting advice from Wise. Wise told {{him to keep his}} eyes steady, to blink less, and to try not to time his acting (Wise said he would <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> in the editing room). Johnson also credited Wise with helping him to craft a much more natural acting performance. Russ Tamblyn, also {{under contract}} with MGM, initially turned down the role as Luke because he felt that the character was [...] "a jerk", although he thought that the script was very good. The studio forced him to reconsider, threatening him with suspension. Tamblyn told the British cinema magazine Film Review in 1995 that while reading the script a second time, he realised the character was much more interesting. [...] "This is the ironic part," [...] he said, [...] "it {{turned out to be one}} of my favourite films that I've been in!" ...|$|E

I guess they were {{waiting to see what}} was going to happen. When I was able to steady my knees, I walked up to the guard who had let the white students in. He didn’t move. When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They glared at me with a mean look and I was very frightened and didn’t know what to do. I turned around and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer. Somebody started yelling, [...] "Drag her over this tree! Let's <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> nigger!'" ...|$|E

This volume <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> little problem by ignoring it completely and just tacking 'The End' on the last story." ...|$|R
