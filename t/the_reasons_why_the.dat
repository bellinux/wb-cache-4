5|$|Another {{element of}} the Commonwealth army {{consisted}} of various private armies fielded by the most powerful magnates. In time of peace these consisted of usually small regiments {{of a few hundred}} men, but at their extreme they could number up to 10,000, including cavalry and artillery. In some instances the magnate contribution could surpass that of the main Commonwealth army on the frontlines, although often the magnates preferred to save their troops, as they were not compensated for the state for their contributions. The troops were paid for and equipped by the richest of the noble families, such as the Opaliński, Lubomirski, Potocki, Ossoliński, Zamoyski, Koniecpolski, Sieniawski, Żółkiewski, Sapieha, Chodkiewicz, Pac and Radziwiłł families. This was one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> magnates {{played a major role in}} Polish politics, and on occasion, allowed them to engage in bloody civil wars (such as the Lithuanian Civil War in 1700) amongst themselves.|$|E
5|$|Silent Hill 3 {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} {{universe}} of the Silent Hill series. Seventeen years before the start of Silent Hill 3, in the year 1983, Harry Mason defeated a god brought forth by the resident cult of Silent Hill and at the ending, was given a baby girl to care for. The protagonist and player character of Silent Hill 3 is Heather, the teenaged adopted daughter of Harry. Claudia Wolf, the cult's priestess who plans to bring about a paradise on Earth, serves as the game's antagonist. As Heather attempts to unravel <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> cult of Silent Hill is pursuing her, she encounters a private investigator named Douglas Cartland; Vincent, a member of the cult who detests Claudia; and Leonard Wolf, Claudia's abusive father.|$|E
5|$|With {{political}} and geographic division came religious division. One {{part of the}} Armenian Church claimed it wanted to be separate from the head, whose seat was in Echmiadzin, Armenian SSR. Some Armenians in the US thought Moscow tried to use the Armenian Church to promote Communists' ideas outside the country. The Armenian Church thus separated into two branches, Echmiadzin and Cilician, and started to operate separately. In the US, Echmiadzin branch churches of the Armenian Apostolic Church would not admit members of the ARF. This was one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> ARF discouraged people from attending these churches and brought the representatives from a different wing of the church, the Armenian Catholicate of Cilicia, from Lebanon to the US. In 1933, members of ARF were convicted in the assassination of Armenian archbishop Levon Tourian in New York City. Prior to his murder, the archbishop {{had been accused of}} being exclusively pro-Soviet by the ARF. The ARF was legally exonerated from any direct complicity in the assassination.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{historians have}} also re-examined {{the role of}} the States Department and Lord Mountbatten during the {{accession}} process. Ian Copland argues that the Congress leaders did not intend the settlement contained in the Instruments of Accession to be permanent even when they were signed, and at all times privately contemplated a complete integration of the sort that ensued between 1948 and 1950. He points out that the mergers and cession of powers to the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 contravened the terms of the Instruments of Accession, and were incompatible with the express assurances of internal autonomy and preservation of the princely states which Mountbatten had given the princes. Menon in his memoirs stated that the changes to the initial terms of accession were in every instance freely consented to by the princes with no element of coercion. Copland disagrees, on the basis that foreign diplomats at the time believed that the princes had been given no choice but to sign, and that a few princes expressed their unhappiness with the arrangements. He also criticises Mountbatten's role, saying that while he stayed within the letter of the law, he was at least under a moral obligation to do something for the princes when it became apparent that the Government of India was going to alter the terms on which accession took place, and that he should never have lent his support to the bargain given that it could not be guaranteed after independence. Both Copland and Ramusack argue that, in the ultimate analysis, one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> princes consented to the demise of their states was that they felt abandoned by the British, and saw themselves as having little other option. Older historians such as Lumby, in contrast, take the view that the princely states could not have survived as independent entities after the transfer of power, and that their demise was inevitable. They therefore view successful integration of all princely states into India as a triumph for the Government of India and Lord Mountbatten, and as a tribute to the sagacity of the majority of princes, who jointly achieved in a few months what the Empire had attempted, unsuccessfully, to do for over a century—unite all of India under one rule.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} {{there are}} several construction grammarians who operate within the general framework of construction grammar without affiliating themselves with any specific construction grammar program. There is a growing interest in the diachronic aspect of grammatical constructions and thus in the importation of methods and ideas from grammaticalization studies. Another area of growing interest is the pragmatics of pragmatic constructions. This {{is probably one of}} <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> usage-based model is gaining popularity among construction grammarians. Another area of increasing interest among construction grammarians is that of language acquisition which is mainly due to Michael Tomasello's work. Mats Andrén coined the term multimodal constructions to account for constructions that incorporate both (conventionalized) gesture and speech.|$|E
25|$|Concerning affordability, an {{analysis}} of the 2007 household budget survey shows that the wealthiest quintile of Tanzanians spends more than 4000 Tanzanian Shilling (US$3.10) per month for water, corresponding to about 1 percent of their income. Those in the poorest quintile spend only about 1000 Tanzanian Shilling (US$0.77) per month for water, but this represents 4.5 percent of their income. One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> poor spend less in absolute terms on water is that they fetch water for free from wells and streams. The data are not differentiated between rural and urban areas, although {{it is likely that the}} urban poor who have no access to free water sources pay much more for water than those in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|This yearning {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Killing Curse used by Voldemort on Harry in the Forbidden Forest does {{destroy the}} {{fragment}} of Voldemort’s soul within Harry, but only sends Harry’s soul into a near-death state. Harry could return to his body despite being hit by the Killing Curse from the Elder Wand because Voldemort had used Harry's blood to regain his full strength in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and because the actual master of the Elder Wand, Draco Malfoy, had been defeated by Harry making Harry the new master of the Elder Wand. Harry’s ownership of the wand used for the curse and the horcrux-like connection between Voldemort and Harry diminished Voldemort’s curse and protected Harry from irreversible death.|$|E
