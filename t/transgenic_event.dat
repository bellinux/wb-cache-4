A significant negative correlation existed between the chitinase activity and the frequency of infection to the three tested pathogens.

40|$|Recombinant genes conferring {{resistance}} to antibiotics or herbicides are widely used as selectable markers in plant transformation for selecting the primary <b>transgenic</b> <b>events.</b> However, these become redundant once the transgenic plants have been developed and identified. Although, {{there is no evidence}} that the selectable marker genes are unsafe for consumers and the environment, it would be desirable if the marker genes can be eliminated from the final <b>transgenic</b> <b>events.</b> The availability of efficient transformation methods can enable the possibility of developing <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> that are devoid of the marker gene/s upfront. Taking advantage of the high and consistent transformation potential of peanut, we report a technique for developing its transgenics without the use of any selectable marker gene. Marker-free binary vectors harboring either the phytoene synthase gene from maize (Zmpsy 1) or the chitinase gene from rice (Rchit) were constructed and used for Agrobacterium tumefaciensmediated transformation of peanut. The putative <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> growing in vitro were initially identified by PCR and further confirmed for gene integration and expression by dot blots assays, Southern blots, and RT-PCR where they showed a transformation frequency of over 75 %. This system is simple, efficient, rapid, and does not require the complex segregation steps and analysis for selection of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>events.</b> This approach for generation of markerfree transgenic plants minimizes the risk of introducing unwanted genetic changes, allows stacking of multiple genes and can be applicable to other plant species that have high shoot regeneration efficiencies...|$|R
40|$|Genetically {{modified}} organisms (GMOs) {{have recently}} {{attracted the attention}} of agricultural, medical and food scientists and governments of many countries in the world due to an increasing concern that the recombinant gene(s) inserted into an organism may result in unforeseen effects. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} regulate each <b>transgenic</b> <b>event</b> so that the officially approved events will be the only products for commercial use. However, for controlling the unauthorized use of the unregulated transgenic events, their early detection is necessary. These detection methods are primarily based on identifying the inserted DNA sequence (DNA-based techniques) or the specific proteins resulted from the inserted gene (protein-based techniques). The DNA-based techniques are currently the major detection methods that are widely used due to their ease and accuracy. However, detection for the presence or absence alone is not sufficient for regulation of GMOs. Rather, identification of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>event</b> (authorized or not) and their amount in a given lot should also be quantified to determine the threshold level.

Water use efficiency under drought conditions {{is thought to be}} one of the most promising traits to improve and stabilize crop yields under intermittent water deficit. A transcription factor DREB 1 A from Arabidopsis thaliana, driven by the stress inducible promoter from the rd 29 A gene, was introduced in a drought-sensitive peanut cultivar JL 24 through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer. The stress inducible expression of DREB 1 A in these transgenic plants did not result in growth retardation or visible phenotypic alterations. T 3 progeny of fourteen <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> were exposed to progressive soil drying in pot culture. The soil moisture threshold where their transpiration rate begins to decline relative to control well-watered (WW) plants and the number of days needed to deplete the soil water was used to rank the genotypes using the average linkage cluster analysis. Five diverse events were selected from the different clusters and further tested. All the selected <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> were able to maintain a transpiration rate equivalent to the WW control in soils dry enough to reduce transpiration rate in wild type JL 24. All <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> except one achieved higher transpiration efficiency (TE) under WW conditions and this appeared to be explained by a lower stomatal conductance.

40|$|Abstract Multiple trait {{integration}} (MTI) is {{the process}} by which a target hybrid (or variety) is converted to add value-added traits to the compre-hensive performance package represented by that genotype.

40|$|Quantitative {{analysis}} {{of genetically modified}} (GM) foods requires estimation {{of the amount of}} the <b>transgenic</b> <b>event</b> relative to an endogenous gene. Regulatory authorities in the European Union (EU) have defined the labelling threshold for GM food on the copy number ratio between the <b>transgenic</b> <b>event</b> and an endogenous gene. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is currently being used for quantification of GM organisms (GMOs). Limitations in realtime PCR applications to detect very low number of DNA targets has led to new developments such as the digital PCR (dPCR) which allows accurate measurement of DNA copies without the need for a reference calibrator. In this paper, the amount of maizeMON 810 and hmg copies present in a DNA extract from seed powders certified for their mass content and for their copy number ratio was measured by dPCR. The ratio of these absolute copy numbers determined by dPCR was found to be identical to the ratios measured by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using a plasmid DNA calibrator. These results indicate that both methods could be applied to determine the copy number ratio in MON 810. The reported values were in agreement with estimations from a model elaborated to convert mass fractions into copy number fractions in MON 810 varieties. This model was challenged on two MON 810 varieties used for the production of MON 810 certified reference materials (CRMs) which differ in the parental origin of the introduced GM trait.

40|$|Background: The genetic {{diversity}} of maize in Peru includes several landraces (within race clusters) and modern open pollinated and hybrid cultivars that are grown by farmers across various regions, thereby making this country a secondary center of diversity for this crop. A main topic of controversy {{in recent years}} refers to the unintended presence of <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> in locally grown cultivars at main centers of crop diversity. Peru does not yet have biosafety regulations to control or permit the growing of genetically modified crops. Hence, {{the aim of this}} research was to undertake a survey in the valley of Barranca, where there were recent claims of authorized transgenic maize grown in farmers fields as well as in samples taken from feed storage and grain or seed trade centers. Results: A total of 162 maize samples (134 from fields, 15 from local markets, eight from the collecting centers of poultry companies, from the local trading center and four samples from seed markets) were included for a qualitative detection by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35 S promoter (P 35 S) and nopaline synthase terminator (Tnos) sequences, as well as for six <b>transgenic</b> <b>events,</b> namely BT 11, NK 603, T 25, 176, TC 1507 and MON 810. The 134 maize samples from farmers fields were negative for Cry 1 Ab delta-endotoxin insecticidal protein and enzyme 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase (EPSPS) using lateral flow strips. The PCR analysis did not detect any of the six <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> in samples from farmers fields, local markets, seed trading shops and the local collecting center. There were four <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> (T 25, NK 603, MON 810 and TC 1507) in grain samples from the barns of poultry companies. Conclusions: This research could not detect, at the 95 % probability level, transgenes in farmers' fields in the valley of Barranca. The four <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> in grain samples from barns of poultry companies were not surprising because Peru imports maize, mainly for animal feed, from Argentina and the United States that are known for growing transgenic maize...|$|R

Co-bombardment was performed with the neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptII) gene and the green fluorescent protein (gfp) gene, both {{under the control of}} the maize ubiquitin 1 (ubi 1) promoter. After optimization of both tissue culture media and parameters of microprojectile transformation, 25 independent <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> were obtained from 121 bombarded IEs.

From several <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> of chickpea developed by Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation, four single copy events (RD 2, RD 7, RD 9 and RD 10) were characterized for DREB 1 A gene overexpression and evaluated under water stress in a biosafety greenhouse at T 6 generation. Under progressive water stress, all <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> showed increased DREB 1 A gene expression before 50 % of soil moisture was lost (50 % FTSW or fraction of transpirable soil water), with a faster DREB 1 A transcript accumulation in RD 2 at 85 % FTSW.

40|$|Abstract Background As {{compared}} with traditional transgene copy number detection {{technologies such as}} Southern blot analysis, real-time PCR provides a fast, inexpensive and high-throughput alternative. However, the real-time PCR based transgene copy number estimation tends to be ambiguous and subjective stemming {{from the lack of}} proper statistical analysis and data quality control to render a reliable estimation of copy number with a prediction value. Despite the recent progresses in statistical analysis of real-time PCR, few publications have integrated these advancements in real-time PCR based transgene copy number determination. Results Three experimental designs and four data quality control integrated statistical models are presented. For the first method, external calibration curves are established for the transgene based on serially-diluted templates. The Ct number from a control <b>transgenic</b> <b>event</b> and putative <b>transgenic</b> <b>event</b> are compared to derive the transgene copy number or zygosity estimation. Simple linear regression and two group T-test procedures were combined to model the data from this design. For the second experimental design, standard curves were generated for both an internal reference gene and the transgene, and the copy number of transgene was {{compared with}} that of internal reference gene. Multiple regression models and ANOVA models can be employed to analyze the data and perform quality control for this approach. In the third experimental design, transgene copy number is compared with reference gene without a standard curve, but rather, is based directly on fluorescence data. Two different multiple regression models were proposed to analyze the data based on two different approaches of amplification efficiency integration. Our results highlight the importance of proper statistical treatment and quality control integration in real-time PCR-based transgene copy number determination. Conclusion These statistical methods allow the real-time PCR-based transgene copy number estimation to be more reliable and precise with a proper statistical estimation. Proper confidence intervals are necessary for unambiguous prediction of trangene copy number. The four different statistical methods are compared for their advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, the statistical methods can also be applied for other real-time PCR-based quantification assays including transfection efficiency analysis and pathogen quantification. </p...|$|E

As well as being important readily mobilisable energy reserves for the plant, fructans are also involved in stress tolerance. Fructans are also readily digested by grazing ruminants and hence are a valuable source of energy for sheep, beef and dairy production systems in temperate regions. This paper describes the re-programming of the expression of fructan biosynthesis genes through the transgenic manipulation of 6 -glucose fructosyltransferase (6 G-FFT) and sucrose:sucrose 1 -fructosyl-transferase (1 -SST) in perennial ryegrass. <b>Transgenic</b> <b>events</b> were developed with altered fructan accumulation patterns with increases in fructan accumulation and greatly increased accumulation of fructan in leaf blades {{as opposed to the}} traditional site of fructan accumulation in the pseudostem.

An interesting observation was noticed when T 0 transgenics developed with pRD 400 and pNBRI– 1 vector-constructs were subjected to insect bioassay with H. armigera. Although highly expressing transgenic plants expressing Trcry 1 Ac gene showed protection against H. armigera whereas, only two low expressing transgenic events harbouring Flcry 1 Ac gene, (FlAc 7 and FlAc 11) repeatedly showed full-protection against H. armigera. This observation made us to realize that although Flcry 1 Ac gene showed a lower transformation frequency and expression but the promising events were highly toxic to H. armigera. Certainly, there is a scope for more improvement of Flcry 1 Ac gene for higher expression in transgenic plants. These results can be co-related to the most successful <b>transgenic</b> <b>event</b> Monsanto 531 which was developed with full-length modified cry 1 Ac-like gene and commercialized as Bollgard cotton, for complete protection against bollworm complex (Perlak et al. 2001; Purcell et al. 2004).|$|E

The high toxicity and strong efficacy against two different lepidopteran insects seems to reflect the synergistic interaction of high-level of Cry 1 Ab toxin with all possible available receptors or targets on the brush border membrane in both the insects. The results of receptor binding assay of midgut preparations with partially purified recombinant Bt-Cry 1 Ab toxin expressed in transgenic tomato plants corroborates well with our observed data for efficient protection against two different pests, as compared to earlier reports of toxicity to H. armigera only (Mandaokar et al. 2000; Kumar and Kumar 2004).

It can reduce yields by 50 % by itself and cause various synergistic disease complexes when co-infecting with other viruses, including sweetpotato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV; genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae). Because no sources of true resistance to SPCSV are available in sweetpotato germplasm, a pathogen-derived transgenic resistance strategy was tested as an alternative solution in this study. A Peruvian sweetpotato landrace 'Huachano' was transformed with an intronspliced hairpin construct targeting the replicase encoding sequences of SPCSV and SPFMV using an improved genetic transformation procedure with reproducible efficiency. Twentyeight independent <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> were obtained in three transformation experiments using a highly virulent Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and regeneration through embryogenesis.

A total of 49 <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> of chickpea were produced with the 35 S:P 5 CSF 129 A gene through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer through the use of axillary meristem explants. Eleven <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> that accumulated high proline (2 - 6 folds) were further evaluated in greenhouse experiments based on their transpiration efficiency (TE), photosynthetic activity, stomatal conductance, and root length under water stress. Almost all the <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> showed a decline in transpiration at lower values of the fraction of transpirable soil water (dryer soil), and extracted more water than their untransformed parents. The accumulation of proline in the selected events was more pronounced that increased significantly in the leaves when exposed to water stress. However, the overexpression of P 5 CSF 129 A gene resulted only in a modest increase in TE, thereby indicating that the enhanced proline had little bearing on the components of yield architecture that are significant in overcoming the negative effects of drought stress in chickpea...|$|R
40|$|Cultivation {{and trade}} of {{transgenic}} or {{genetically modified organisms}} (GMO) and commodities has become widespread worldwide. In particular, production of transgenic crops has seen an accelerated growth along with a complex regulatory process. Current Peruvian legislation prohibits import of transgenic seeds and cultivation of transgenic crops in National territory but allows import of GMO-derived products and commodities. In addition, there is legislation that mandates the labeling of food products containing transgenic ingredients but the labeling threshold is still under discussion and the enforcement of this law is on hold. In this context, we evaluated adventitious presence of transgenic events in locally traded yellow maize using PCR- and immuno-based detection methods. Our results indicated that contamination during the distribution system of lots derived from non-transgenic maize was unavoidable and generally below 1. 0 % (w/w). <b>Transgenic</b> <b>event</b> MON 810 was found in truck-loads of nationally grown maize. In general, frequencies of GMO-derived targets in whole-grain lots were 2. 2 % (GMO content >= 1 %), 16. 4 % (GMO content 0. 9 %), 65. 1 % (GMO conten...|$|E
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are small}} {{regulators}} of gene expression that act on many different molecular and biochemical processes in eukaryotes. To date, miRNAs {{have not been}} considered in the current evaluation system for GM crops. In this study, small RNAs from the dry seeds of a GM wheat line overexpressing GmDREB 1 and non-GM wheat cultivars were investigated using deep sequencing technology and bioinformatic approaches. As a result, 23 differentially expressed miRNAs in dry seeds were identified and confirmed between GM wheat and a non-GM acceptor. Notably, more differentially expressed tae-miRNAs between non-GM wheat varieties were found, indicating {{that the degree of}} variance between non-GM cultivars was considerably higher than that induced by the <b>transgenic</b> <b>event.</b> Most of the target genes of these differentially expressed miRNAs between GM wheat and a non-GM acceptor were associated with abiotic stress, in accordance with the product concept of GM wheat in improving drought and salt tolerance. Our data provided useful information and insights into the evaluation of miRNA expression in edible GM crops...|$|E
30|$|The {{transgenic}} line Ab 25 E {{of tomato}} upto T 6 generation has consistently exhibited high expression of Cry 1 Ab toxin and complete protection against two different lepidopteran insects without affecting {{the growth and}} yield parameters. There is no evidence till date, of any in vivo toxicity of Cry 1 Ab on initial regeneration and development of plants transformed with cry 1 Ab gene (Kumar and Kumar 2004; Rawat et al. 2011). One instance can be recalled where the <b>transgenic</b> <b>event</b> Bt 176 of Bt-cry 1 Ab maize {{was found to be}} detrimental against non-target pest monarch butterfly feeding on pollen of transgenic maize because cry 1 Ab gene was driven by pollen specific promoter (Sears et al. 2001). The cultivated tomato is strictly self-pollinated crop (cleistogamous nature of flower) and pollen specific promoter is not used for expression cry 1 Ab gene, therefore, the possibility of pollen-toxicity is ruled out in our case. Although, the use of single cry 1 Ab gene targeted against African maize stem borer in Bt-maize did not endure longer, and enforcement of high refugia and gene pyramiding strategy had prevented the development of resistance (Berg et al. 2013; Tabashnik et al. 2011).|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{efficiency}} {{and stability of}} RNA interference (RNAi) in perennial species, particularly in natural environments, is poorly understood. We studied 56 independent poplar RNAi <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> in the field over 2 years. A resident BAR transgene was targeted with {{two different types of}} RNAi constructs: a 475 -bp IR of the promoter sequence and a 275 -bp IR of the coding sequence, each with and without the presence of flanking matrix attachment regions (MARs). RNAi directed at the coding sequence was a strong inducer of gene silencing; 80 % of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> showed more than 90 % suppression. In contrast, RNAi targeting the promoter resulted in only 6 % of <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> showing more than 90 % suppression. The degree of suppression varied widely but was highly stable in each event over 2 years in the field, and had no association with insert copy number or the presence of MARs. RNAi remained stable during a winter to summer seasonal cycle, a time when expression of the targeted transgene driven by an rbcS promoter varied widely. When strong gene suppression was induced by an IR directed at the promoter sequence, it was accompanied by methylation of the homolo-gous promoter region. DNA methylation was also observed in the coding region of highly suppressed events containing an IR directed at the coding sequence; however, the methylation degree and pattern varied widely among those suppressed events. Our results suggest that RNAi can be highly effective for functional genomics and biotechnology of peren-nial plants...|$|R
40|$|Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an {{economically}} important oilseed crop which is grown widely in the semi-arid tropics, and India being {{the second largest}} producer in world with annual yield of 5. 78 MT (FAOSTAT, 2012). Aflatoxin contamination of peanut has gained global significance due to the deleterious effects of these contaminants on human and livestock health, and the consequent importance in international trade. Although, aflatoxin contamination does not affect crop productivity, it makes the produce unfit for consumption while the higher aflatoxins load in the exportable commodities jeopardize the export earnings. Breeding efforts so far have not resulted in varieties with durable resistance {{to high levels of}} A. flavus infection and consequent aflatoxin production. Biotechnological applications involving the genetic engineering technology provides an attractive approach for developing <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> to circumvent this important problem. Plant lipoxygenases (LOXs) are hypothesized {{to play an important role}} in mediating host-pathogen interactions by initiating the octadecanoic branch in response to fungal attack, catalyzing the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid (18 : 2) and α-linolenic acid (18 : 3) to produce unsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides. Jasmonic acid (JA), a derivative of α- linolenic acid has been reported as a potent inhibitor of aflatoxin biosynthesis. At ICRISAT, work was initiated using the LOX gene approach for addressing this recalcitrant problem in peanut. A highly efficient peanut transformation protocol using cotyledon explants was used to produce 25 marker-free <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> of peanut by incorporating PnLOX 3 gene under the control of constitutive and seed specific promoters. These <b>transgenic</b> <b>events</b> were characterized at molecular level using PCR, Southern hybridization and RT-PCR assays for the presence and expression of the transgene which were further evaluated under contained greenhouse conditions...|$|R
