In December, Douglas was invited to meet with Roosevelt in Albany, New York, where soon became an influential member of the president-elect's group of advisers. Though there was considerable speculation that Douglas would be offered the secretaryship of State, Treasury, or War, Roosevelt asked him instead to serve as Director of the Bureau of the Budget after Roosevelt's initial choice, J.

Clinton's requested budget provided a middle-class tax cut, including new deductions for children and college expenses, which was offset by a twice-as-large reduction in spending elsewhere in the budget, echoing Speaker Gingrich's goal to eliminate programs that had outlived their usefulness. However, Republicans had demanded a budget that would lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> in 2002, but Clinton's budget projected annual deficits of around $190 billion up to 2005. Clinton's plan also proposed to abolish the Interstate Commerce Commission, and reorganize the Departments of Energy, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development by consolidating programs into fewer, larger ones, as well as the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration by cutting their staff by a third and a half, respectively.|$|E

50|$|The only social {{democratic}} governments in Europe that remained {{by the early}} 1930s were in Scandinavia. In the 1930s several Swedish {{social democratic}} leadership figures, including former Swedish Prime Minister Rickard Sandler — the secretary {{and chairman of the}} Socialization Committee — and Nils Karleby, rejected earlier SAP socialization policies pursued in the 1920s for being too extreme. Karleby and Sandler developed a new conception of social democracy, the Nordic model, which called for gradual socialization and redistribution of purchasing power, provision of educational opportunity, and support of property rights. The Nordic model would permit private enterprise on the condition that it adheres to the principle that the resources it disposes are in reality public means, and would create of a broad category of social welfare rights. The new SAP government of 1932, replaced the previous government's universal commitment <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> with a Keynesian-like commitment, which in turn was replaced with a balanced budget within a business cycle. Whereas the 1921-1923 SAP governments had run large deficits, the new SAP government, after a strong increase in state expenditure in 1933, reduced Sweden's budget deficit. The government had planned to eliminate Sweden's budget deficit in seven years, but it took only three years to eliminate the deficit and Sweden had a budget surplus from 1936 to 1938. This policy was criticized, however, because although the budget deficit had been eliminated, major unemployment still remained a problem in Sweden.|$|E

5000|$|On Memorial Day, Goode {{spoke at}} a Veterans Memorial Program in Clarksville, Virginia. Afterwards, he told the South Hill Enterprise that Romney and Obama {{represented}} [...] "Tweedledum and Tweedledee", criticizing both for putting forth unbalanced budgets, specifically mentioning the deficit in the proposed budget of Republican Congressman Paul Ryan. Elaborating on this criticism, during a June 5 interview with Star News, Goode said he supported cutting foreign aid and opposed the Ryan budget's proposed increases to defense, arguing [...] "I'm pro-strong defense, but you can't get <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>budget</b> unless you cut defense." [...] The next day, Goode repeated this view during {{a meeting with the}} Rotary Club of Martinsville at the Virginia Museum of Natural History; however, he pledged that as president he would not seek cuts to military salaries or veterans' benefits. James Antle of The American Conservative discussed Goode's evolving views on defense matters and foreign policy. He observed that Goode had embraced non-interventionism, but still expressed the belief that pre-invasion Iraq had Weapons of Mass Destruction, and used a tone [...] "a bit off for someone who is leading a party that truly advocates a humble foreign policy" [...] when arguing the U.S. [...] "send Iran a clear message that if we are assaulted, we will meet it and trump it." [...] Discussing the comments, Antle's fellow American Conservative writer Daniel Lairson concluded [...] "it doesn’t make for much of a protest candidacy if the third party candidate can’t make his differences with the major parties sufficiently clear." ...|$|E
