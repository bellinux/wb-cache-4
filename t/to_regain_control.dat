5|$|During gameplay, players {{attempt to}} create goal-scoring {{opportunities}} through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try <b>to</b> <b>regain</b> <b>control</b> of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.|$|E

5|$|Henry and Becket quickly {{disagreed}} over {{a number}} of issues, including Becket's attempts <b>to</b> <b>regain</b> <b>control</b> of lands belonging to the archbishopric and his views on Henry's taxation policies. The main source of conflict, however, concerned the treatment of clergy who committed secular crimes: Henry argued that the legal custom in England allowed the king to enforce justice over these clerics, while Becket maintained that only church courts could try the cases. The matter came to a head in January 1164, when Henry forced through agreement to the Constitutions of Clarendon; under tremendous pressure, Becket temporarily agreed but changed his position shortly afterwards. The legal argument was complex at the time and remains contentious.|$|E
50|$|Bensel {{argues that}} all of this precipitated a secession crisis in which the federal {{government}} completely lost control over its southern installations.

50|$|Buhtrap was {{the first}} {{criminal}} group that started using network worms to infect a bank’s entire infrastructure.

The British seizure of the city led to an extended occupation and was the opening move in the British southern strategy <b>to</b> <b>regain</b> <b>control</b> of the rebellious Southern provinces by appealing to the relatively strong Loyalist sentiment there.|$|E
5000|$|Later, Utterson {{tells the}} {{audience}} that Jekyll had given up his task of [...] "finding the truth," [...] condemning his father to the darkness. Yet, as Sir Danvers would put it, the doctor had returned at [...] "the sound of wedding bells" [...] ("Façade (reprise #4)"). Several weeks later, Jekyll seems <b>to</b> have <b>regained</b> <b>control</b> as he and Emma stand before the priest at their wedding in St. Anne's Church. As the Minister begins the ceremony, Jekyll doubles over in pain and transforms into Hyde. Hyde then kills Stride, a guest at the wedding, before taking Emma hostage.

Desperate, Jekyll impales himself on Utterson's swordstick. Emma weeps softly as Jekyll dies, finally free of Hyde's evil control ("Finale").|$|R
