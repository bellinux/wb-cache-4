2500|$|The {{influential}} architectural {{critic and}} historian, Sigfried Giedion {{in his book}} Space, Time and Architecture (1941) dismissed Expressionist architecture as a side show {{in the development of}} functionalism. In the middle of the twentieth century, in the 50s and 60s, many architects began designing in a manner reminiscent of expressionist architecture. In this post war period, a variant of expressionism brutalism had an honest approach to materials, that in its unadorned use of concrete, was similar to the use of brick by the Amsterdam School. The designs of Le Corbusier took a turn for the expressionist in his brutalist phase, but more so in his Notre Dame du Haut. In Mexico, in 1953, German émigré Mathias Goeritz, published the [...] "Arquitectura Emocional" [...] (Emotional architecture) manifesto where he declared that [...] "architecture's principal function is emotion." [...] Modern Mexican architect Luis Barragán adopted the term that influenced his work. The two of them collaborated in the project Torres de Satélite (1957–58) guided by Goeritz's principles of Arquitectura Emocional. Another mid-century modern architect to evoke expressionism was Eero Saarinen. A similar aesthetic can be found in later buildings such as Eero Saarinen's 1962 TWA Terminal at JFK International Airport. His TWA Terminal at JFK International Airport has an organic form, as close to Herman Finsterlin's Formspiels as any other, save Jørn Utzon's Sydney Opera House. It was only in the 1970s that expressionism in architecture came to be re-evaluated in a more positive light. More recently still, the aesthetics and <b>tactility</b> of expressionist architecture have found echo in the works of Enric Miralles, most notability his Scottish Parliament building, deconstructivist architects such as Zaha Hadid and Daniel Libeskind, as well as Canadian Aboriginal architect Douglas Cardinal.|$|E
5000|$|The groups' {{reactions}} {{to one of}} the films were roughly similar. Distinct reactions, however, were found for the other. Generally, the 'light on' (movie) presentation was perceived as having lowered <b>tactility</b> and heightened visuality, as compared to the heightened <b>tactility</b> and lessened visuality of the 'light through' (TV) presentation.|$|E

50|$|Shuter was {{an early}} {{contributor}} {{to the field of}} intercultural communication (ICC). In the 1970s and 1980s, Shuter established an international reputation as an expert in nonverbal communication and culture, particularly in the ways proxemics, <b>tactility,</b> and gesticulation function in different countries. To enhance his research, he interacted with the cultures at the heart of his investigations, traveling extensively throughout Europe, East Asia, and Latin America. He published articles in leading communication and psychology journals, including the Journal of Communication, Communication Monographs, Journal of Social Psychology, Journal of Applied Communication Research, and Management Communication Quarterly. One of his most cited articles, “Proxemics and <b>tactility</b> in Latin America,” was published in the Journal of Communication in 1976.|$|E

5000|$|Martin Duwell in Australian Poetry Review {{has noted}} [...] "a genuine {{fascination with the}} word, its sound, almost its taste in the mouth and that fascination {{continually}} alters the path of what might be, otherwise, predictable poems.

This is the world of pimps and smugglers, of crooks and petty politicians, of opium dens, brothels and beleaguered urban tenements." ...|$|E
50|$|This {{series was}} the first issued by the Bank of Canada to {{incorporate}} a tactile feature to allow {{individuals with visual impairments}} to determine a banknote's denomination. This takes the form of Braille blocks consisting of six dots arranged in two parallel columns, each denomination having a different pattern of blocks, placed on the top right-hand corner when facing the obverse. The feature was developed by the Canadian Bank Note Company, which collaborated with Queen's University <b>tactility</b> perception expert for symbol design. It produced 48 sample designs, of which six were selected for final consideration based on <b>tactility,</b> production techniques, and banknote thickness. These were tested with collaboration of the Canadian National Institute for the Blind and the Canadian Council of the Blind by individuals with functional blindness. The feature was considered appealing as it did not require individuals to use assistive technology in order to identify a banknote's denomination.|$|E
50|$|Armstrong first {{received}} critical {{attention for}} his intimate portraits of men, either lovers or friends, in sharp focus. In the nineties, {{he began to}} photograph cityscapes and landscapes in soft focus to contrast with the resolution of his portraits. Street lights, electric signs and cars are reduced to a sensual mottled blur, complementing the vividness and <b>tactility</b> of his portraits.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, he began [...] "The Vault Series", {{a group of}} six large {{paintings}} of draperies stretched across a wall that were exhibited at the Queens Museum of Art in 1982, and later at the Armstrong Gallery in New York in 1984. The reviews commented on Bruder's concern with renaissance-like <b>tactility,</b> air, and light, comparing Bruder with Titian and Michelangelo.|$|E
50|$|The {{theory was}} {{developed}} in 2009 by Professor Eric Anderson, University of Winchester, to account for changing patterns of masculinity in research that documented young, heterosexual men exhibiting a range of once-stigmatized behaviors. This included deep emotional connections {{in the form of}} bromances with other men; the acceptance of physical <b>tactility</b> including kissing and cuddling; metrosexual appearance; and the inclusion of gay male friends.|$|E
5000|$|Likewise, homohysteria has {{the ability}} to explain nuances between male <b>tactility</b> over time, with the work of John Ibson [...] found an {{decrease}} in social distance between group photographs of men, which can be understood through utilising homohysteria. This concept has been utilised in explaining homophobia and gender policing among females also; primarily by Rachael Bullingham in her exploration of the athletes experiences in team sports.|$|E
5000|$|Kirili once {{described}} his aesthetic as [...] "organic simplicity" [...] {{in the tradition}} of, but formally not attached to, minimalism and abstract expressionism. Indeed, his early sculptures are already concerned with <b>tactility</b> and gesture, emphasizing the active involvement of the artist’s hand {{in the process of}} creation. Kirili embraces a process that is immediate, combining emotions, intuitions, and the subconscious, in a free improvisation with the material.|$|E
50|$|Affective Meditation is a Christian spiritual {{practice}} {{originating in}} Medieval Europe {{by which a}} pilgrim, worshipper, or other follower of Christ seeks to imagine the sights, sounds, tastes, smells, movement, and <b>tactility</b> of specific scenes from canonical Gospels and their characters, with particular emphasis on empathising with the compassion and suffering of Jesus and the joys and sorrows of the Virgin Mary, leading to the authentic and spontaneous expression of emotion.|$|E
50|$|Sensory design aims to {{establish}} an overall diagnosis of the sensory perceptions of a product, and define appropriate means to design or redesign it on that basis.

While Rabinowitch’s art has often rippled with sublimated emotion and maculate <b>tactility,</b> these drawings suggest that its internal tensions have precipitated an irreparable rupture with its own past, eradicating its Platonic surface to expose a jarring, multi-leveled parallel world." ...|$|E
5000|$|Yu Hong (Hong Yu, 喻红) (born 1966) is a Chinese {{contemporary}} artist.

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1970s, Matsutani {{goes back}} to three {{dimensional}} works combining vinyl adhesive and graphite pencil. Patiently covering the canvas or paper with pencil strokes, the artist questions the concepts of space and time, immobility and movement. Remaining most of the time faithful to the two dimensions of canvas or paper work, he brings life to the surface, letting vinyl adhesive inflate or flow, leaving the door open to unexpected results, full of sensuality and of an unusual <b>tactility.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because the water-spray from hydraulophones obscures vision (or because hydraulophones {{are played}} {{underwater}} where visibility is poor), finger holes are sometimes encoded in Braille. Braille has the added advantage that the one-to-one correspondence between letters and numbers {{is the same}} as the standard A-minor hydraulophone, i.e. jet 1 is A, jet 2 is B, jet 3 is C, etc.. The skill (intricate sense of <b>tactility)</b> needed to play a hydraulophone well is also similar to the skill needed to read Braille.|$|E
50|$|He has {{published}} numerous scientific texts in political theory, social anthropology, and theoretical psychoanalysis in international and Slovenian scholarly journals (e.g. Problems, Journal for the Critique of Science), {{as well as}} several scientific monographs. Three of them (Attempt of a Touch/Poskus nekega dotika, 2008, Discourse and Violence/Diskurz in nasilje, 2012, Socratic Touches/Sokratski dotiki, 2015) hinge on the main axis of his research: an attempt at a philosophical reconceptualization of touch and <b>tactility</b> informed with insights from the contemporary humanities and social sciences.|$|E

50|$|Utilizing {{techniques}} and relying on skills culled from over 25 {{years of training}} and 50 years practice in the arts, Bonifacho works in {{the medium of oil}} which he applies to large squares and rectangles of prepared canvas. On occasion, he has also used encaustic for its <b>tactility</b> and luminosity. Periodically, Bonifacho has focused on qualities of geometry, surface, gesture, and sgraffito in metallic paints as a relief from working with prismatic colour. His work is represented by the Bau Xi Gallery in Toronto and Vancouver (Canada), the Foster/White Gallery in Seattle (US), and the Herringer Kiss Gallery in Calgary (Canada).|$|E
5000|$|The S-5 was {{powered by}} a [...] Argus {{water-cooled}} engine turning a propeller Sikorsky designed and built himself. The fabric covering the wooden wings was tightened with pure alcohol and glue mixed with boiling water while the fuselage structure was left exposed. Instead of separate levers to control the elevator and ailerons as in his previous aircraft, Sikorsky designed a single control lever with a wheel allowing control of pitch and roll. This [...] "control column" [...] included a button switch to momentarily deactivate the ignition thereby controlling engine power. The S-5 was also built with reversed rudder controls because it better suited Sikorsky's <b>tactility</b> of the machine.|$|E
50|$|Cluett became {{increasingly}} {{fascinated by the}} charged relationships between the spiritual and the physical in the buildings she saw — the sacred landscape of the architecture. She began to use the computer to manipulate temple plans, shaping them to position the viewer {{in relation to the}} structure. The plan was then sandblasted on to a stone slab, which left it in polished relief against the vulnerable surface of the exposed stone. Cluett believed this practice created tensions in her work; the juxtaposed surfaces at once drawing the viewer in with <b>tactility</b> of the stone, and pushing them away with the manipulation of the plan, eventually leaving them to float somewhere in between.|$|E
5000|$|For the Canadian Journey Series, the Bank of Canada and the Canadian National Institute for the Blind held {{consultations}} with [...] "experts {{in the fields}} of vision and <b>tactility</b> perception", during which several desirable features were identified. The Bank of Canada concluded that accessibility features should enable an individual to identify a banknote's denomination [...] "quickly, independently, privately, and with the note in any orientation", and that it should implement features assisting individuals with a range of vision impairments. It again rejected denominations having banknotes of different size for being inconsistent with the use of banknote processing equipment such as automated teller machines, vending machines, self checkout machines, slot machines, ticket and parking lot machines, and note sorting equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Mark McCormack [...] {{documents}} {{even more}} significant shifts in the masculine dynamics in British high schools. Using inclusive masculinity theory, he demonstrates {{that there has been}} an erosion of homophobia and a softening of masculinity among 16- to 18-year-old boys. In addition to documenting the inclusion of LGBT students, he finds boys engage in a great deal of homosocial <b>tactility,</b> and that they esteem acts of social inclusion. He also develops a class analysis to show that while class does act as a dampener on progressive attitudes, it does not prevent them. Thus, he supports inclusive masculinity theory’s central argument that these changes are the result of a substantial decrease in homohysteria in the broader youth culture.|$|E
50|$|In 1971 he {{was part}} of the winning team {{competing}} in the French government's competition for the centre of Paris at Beaubourg, partnering Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano. Edmund Happold was the senior Arup engineer for the competition. Rice became the engineer for the built project which was greatly modified from the initial design. Art and technology were intertwined in the design enabling him to experiment with materials. He brought the concepts of humanity, <b>tactility</b> and scale to the project His team developed the gerberette which enabled the counterbalancing of the weight of the building with light tubing, lightening the external appearance. He specified that these were to be made in cast steel. After the Pompidou Centre, Rice set up his own company in 1977—"RFR"—along with Martin Francis and Ian Ritchie although he continued with Arup as a partner. In 1978 he was involved with Rogers again, this time on Lloyd's of London, completed in 1984. During this time his other projects encompassed the Fleetguard Factory at Quimper in France, and Stansted Airport in London.|$|E
5000|$|Her {{work has}} {{predominantly}} {{been featured in}} New York, with her first solo exhibition at Higher Pictures in 2009, which was reviewed in Artforum and many other well-known publications. The Huffington Post commented on her exhibition “The WOAHS of Female Tragedy II”: “We don't know what we love most about Jaimie Warren: her knack for puns, her obsession with [...] "Toddlers & Tiaras" [...] or her endless devotion to Roseanne Barr…Warren, like a Reddit-crazed Cindy Sherman, inserts her self-portraits into {{the best and most}} bizarre memes, channeling everything from Picasso's [...] "Demoiselles" [...] to the celebrity spoof, [...] "Lasagna Del Rey." [...] For her second solo exhibition at the Hole in 2014, Roberta Smith writes in the New York Times: “In her latest New York exhibition, Jaimie Warren comes across as a force of nature, or at least pop culture, whose work brims with messy promise. photographs indicate a talent for color and <b>tactility</b> (to say the least) as well as for rough-edged transformation that combines aspects of the work of Cindy Sherman, Sandy Skoglund and Alex Bag while channeling the spirits of Leigh Bowery, Divine and George Grosz.” ...|$|E
