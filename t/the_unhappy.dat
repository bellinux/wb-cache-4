25|$|Eventually {{the trouble}} with England {{escalated}} into the War of 1812. That same year, Daniel Webster gave {{an address to the}} Washington Benevolent Society, a speech that proved critical to his career.

25|$|On 27 September 1604, King James I married Mary to Sir Robert Wroth of Loughton Hall. The {{marriage}} was not happy; there were issues {{between the two}} beginning with difficulties over her father’s payment of her dowry. In a letter written to his wife, Sir Robert Sidney described different meetings with Robert Wroth, who was often distressed by the behavior of Mary shortly after their marriage. Robert Wroth {{appeared to have been}} a gambler, philanderer and a drunkard. More evidence of <b>the</b> <b>unhappy</b> union comes from poet and friend Ben Jonson, who noted that ‘my Lady Wroth is unworthily married on a Jealous husband’. Various letters from Lady Mary to Queen Anne also refer to the financial losses her husband had sustained during their time together.|$|E
25|$|British Naval Intelligence {{document}} ADM 223/464 {{has become}} available under the Freedom of Information Act. The document, which bears a Top Secret stamp {{in the upper}} right hand corner, originated from the National Archives in Kew, London. It provides substantial insight into Operation Tracer and {{was the work of}} Charles Langbridge Morgan (1894–1958). The respected author and journalist was employed by the Naval Intelligence Division throughout World War II, first under Godfrey and later under his successor Edmund Rushbrooke. A native of Bromley, Kent, Morgan wrote his first book, The Gunroom, in 1919. The novel, which detailed <b>the</b> <b>unhappy</b> life of a midshipman in the Royal Navy prior to World War I, was not well received by the Admiralty. While the British Admiralty suppressed the book, it did result in reforms in the Royal Navy. Morgan penned an Intelligence Digest on a weekly basis during World War II. British writer Nicholas Rankin believes him to have been the unofficial historian of the Naval Intelligence Division.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} war Xavier was engaged in {{assisting}} Zita and Karl following their deposition. In 1919 together with Sixte he travelled to England and contacted king George V; the British support materialized as a liaison officer, dispatched to the republican Austria to assist <b>the</b> <b>unhappy</b> couple on their route to exile. However, it soon turned {{out that it was}} his own business which attracted most of Xavier’s attention. Following wartime financial turmoil and expropriations of some family estates, economic prospects of both brothers seemed rather bleak. As a counter-measure, they decided to challenge the French state, which in 1915 seized Chambord as property of Élie, the Austrian officer; the Versailles Treaty stipulations allowed to conclude the seizure legally if combined with paying compensation fee. Sixte and Xavier sued; they claimed that the family-agreed 1910 partition, based on the Austrian concept of an indivisible , was not applicable in the French law, and that the Chambord property should be divided; they claimed also that as volunteers to the French and Belgian armies, they should be exempted from expropriation procedure. Centred on fortune-worth Chambord property, in fact the lawsuit was directed against Élie. In 1925 the court accepted brothers’ point of view, the decision immediately appealed by their half-brother. In 1928 the case was overturned in favor of Élie, the decision appealed by both brothers. In 1932 the Court of Cassation upheld the 1928 decision, which eventually left Xavier and Sixte frustrated in their bid.|$|E

25|$|England {{now had to}} win {{the final}} three Tests {{if they wanted to}} regain the Ashes, for which the only {{precedent}} was when Don Bradman made three big centuries in the 1936–37 Ashes series to win 3–2 after being 2–0 down to Gubby Allen's England side. Sydney is a famous spinning wicket, though the three tour matches the MCC had seen lots of runs for few wickets. In the New South Wales game immediately before the Third Test they had made 553/8 with Len Hutton making 150 and Reg Simpson 259 and the fast-medium bowler John Warr took 4/67. As a result <b>the</b> <b>unhappy</b> Brian Close was dropped in favour of Warr, making his debut, and England went into the Test with Doug Wright as the only specialist spinner, supported by the part-time spin of Freddie Brown and Denis Compton. The leg-spinner Eric Hollies had taken 5 wickets (78.60) in his three games at the Sydney Cricket Ground and off-spinner Bob Berry was going for 4 runs an over in his containment role and were not chosen. Denis Compton was fit again and replaced the ailing John Dewes, but Gilbert Parkhouse stayed in the team thanks to his fighting 28 at Melbourne and 92 against New South Wales. Australia kept the same team from the Second Test, though if they had lost the performances of a few of them would have resulted in their being dropped. For the only time in Lindsay Hassett's career as captain he lost the toss in an Ashes Test and Freddie Brown was able to bat first on another flat batting track.|$|E

The film was not a success as a musical, with Kelly and Kidd making little use of the widescreen format of the film.
