5000|$|One view is <b>that</b> <b>sharing</b> {{leadership}} {{among more}} people {{does not necessarily}} bring positive student outcomes. Some researchers have called the influence of shared leadership into question, suggesting that the influence of shared leadership is statistically non-significant (Leithwood & Jantzi, 1999), and indicating <b>that</b> <b>shared</b> leadership is [...] "not a significant factor for students' participation in or engagement with school" [...] (Silins et al., 2002). Timperley (2005, p. 417) also underlines the significance of promoting the quality of shared leadership activities, emphasizing <b>that</b> <b>shared</b> leadership has risks associated with [...] "greater distribution of incompetence." ...|$|R

5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors <b>that</b> <b>share</b> memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) <b>that</b> <b>share</b> the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of aggressive mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids <b>that</b> <b>share</b> {{the same}} biosynthetic pathway {{tend to have}} the same first base in their codons. This could be an {{evolutionary}} relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids. It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons, reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an alternative view of shared governance within higher education institutions, examining {{the major problems}} encountered by institutions as they implement a shared governance model. Based on {{a review of the}} literature, it argues <b>that</b> <b>shared</b> governance, though increasingly popular in recent years, is an issue that should be carefully explored before it is implemented. The paper notes <b>that</b> <b>shared</b> governance is an elusive concept, and that participants often over-anticipate the benefit, while at the same time, under-commit their own involvement in understanding what shared governance is. Critics have noted <b>that</b> <b>shared</b> governance involves a large commitment of time and effort and requires that senior-level administrators commit real support to the process. It argues <b>that</b> <b>shared</b> governance has a limited ability to extricate the governing effort from the mire of self-interest, unreal expectation, and role confusion. The paper concludes <b>that</b> <b>shared</b> governance is not a panacea, and that successfully governed institutions have an established history and culture of administration-faculty collaboration.

5|$|However, some eusocial {{species such}} as {{termites}} are not haplodiploid. Conversely, all bees are haplodiploid but not all are eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, creating half-sisters <b>that</b> <b>share</b> only 25% of their genes. Haplodiploidy is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality. But, monogamy (queens mating singly) is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated, so {{it is likely that}} haplodiploidy contributed to the evolution of eusociality in bees.|$|E

Broad thumbs and big toes are primary characteristics of Rubinstein syndrome.|$|E

The fatty acids are typically saturated or mono-unsaturated with chain lengths from 16 to 26 carbon atoms.|$|E
