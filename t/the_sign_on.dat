500|$|In March 1910, {{tired of}} the controversy, Battersea Council sent four workers {{accompanied}} by 120 police officers to remove the statue under cover of darkness, after which it was reportedly melted down by the council's blacksmith, despite a 20,000-strong petition in its favour. A new statue of the brown dog, commissioned by anti-vivisection groups over 70 years later, was erected in Battersea Park in 1985. According to Peter Mason in 1997, {{all that was left}} of the old statue was a hump in the pavement, <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> a nearby fence reading [...] "No Dogs".|$|E

[...] Other attractions included a 50-piece orchestra, famed organist Jesse Crawford at the 26-rank Wurlitzer theatre organ—"Oh, yes, it was mighty," [...] recalled Orson Welles— and a live stage show. [...] Poet Carl Sandburg, reporting for the Chicago Tribune, wrote that mounted police were required for crowd control. The theater's strategy of enticing movie patrons with a plush environment and top notch service (including the pioneering use of air conditioning) was emulated nationwide.|$|E

500|$|There {{was much}} {{competition}} over the proposed {{name of the}} settlement. Ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name [...] "Meridian," [...] believing the term to be synonymous with [...] "junction"; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred [...] "Sowashee" [...] (meaning [...] "mad river" [...] in Choctaw, from {{the name of a}} nearby creek; and Ragsdale proposed [...] "Ragsdale City." [...] Ball erected a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad – <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> which would alternate between [...] "Meridian" [...] and [...] "Sowashee" [...] each day. Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left [...] "Meridian" [...] on the station permanently.

2500|$|For {{their first}} 30 years, until 2016, the Type 1 cars had roll-type, printed {{destination}} signs. [...] The Type 1 {{were the only}} MAX cars whose rollsigns were hand-cranked. Because of the time-consuming process to change the signs, only <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> the exposed end of the car was changed to the correct destination. The side signs only listed the designated route color (such as [...] "Blue Line") rather than a destination, and <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> the coupled end of each car in a two-car train was left blank. [...] A two-year program that began in October 2014 and was completed in September 2016 gradually replaced all of the rollsigns in the Type 1 cars (as well {{as those in the}} Types 2 and 3) with digital, LED-type destination signs.|$|E

2500|$|In {{language}} {{very similar}} to that of Minucius Felix, Tertullian, too, who distinguished between stipes (stake) and crux (cross), noted that it was the cross that people associated with Christianity.

2500|$|The {{competition}} continued between Ragsdale and Ball. Each day <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> {{the station}} {{house would be}} changed, alternating between Meridian and Sowashee.

One day {{one of them would}} drive stakes in line with his plan, and the next day, the other would pull up his rival's stakes and drive some of his own. Ball laid his streets parallel to the railroad, and Ragsdale chose to use true compass headings. The competition is still evident today in the angles at which some streets meet in the city. The intersecting area has been described as [...] "having been formed by some giant who playfully gathered up a ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{important}} features of every chart that the astrologer must give {{special attention to}} are {{the positions of the}} sun and moon by sign and house; <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> the [...] ascendant, and the planet that rules that sign, called the ascendant ruler or chart ruler. Also important is the first planet to occupy the first, second, or third houses after the ascendant. Called the rising planet it will be particularly strong in the chart. If no planet occupies the first three houses, then a planet in the twelfth house close to the ascendant can be taken to be the rising planet. Planets that are in conjunction to (right beside) the primary angles of ascendant, midheaven, descendant, or IC (known as angular planets) must also be especially considered.|$|E

2500|$|In Hellenistic, Vedic, Medieval and Renaissance astrology {{each house}} is {{ruled by the}} planet that rules <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> its cusp. For example, if a person has the sign Aries {{on the cusp of}} their 7th house, the planet Mars is said to [...] "rule" [...] the 7th house. This means that when a planet is allotted a house, the planet's {{attributes}} will have some bearing on the topics related to that house within the life of the individual whose chart is being analyzed. This planet is considered very important for events specifically pertaining to that house's topics; in fact, its placement in the chart will have at least as much influence on the chart as the planets placed within the house. In traditional Western & Hindu astrology, each sign is ruled by one of the 7 visible planets (note that in astrology, the Sun and Moon are considered planets, which literally means wanderers, i.e. wandering stars, as opposed to the fixed stars of the constellations).|$|E
2500|$|Within each type, turns may {{be further}} {{classified}} by their backbone dihedral angles (see Ramachandran plot). A turn {{can be converted}} into its inverse turn (in which the main chain atoms have opposite chirality) by changing <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> its dihedral angles. (The inverse turn is not a true enantiomer since the Cα atom chirality is maintained.) Thus, the γ-turn has two forms, a classical form with (φ,ψ) dihedral angles of roughly (75°,−65°) and an inverse form with dihedral angles (−75°,65°). At least eight forms of the beta turn occur, varying in whether a cis isomer of a peptide bond is involved and on the dihedral angles of the central two residues. The classical and inverse β-turns are distinguished with a prime, e.g., type I and type I′ beta turns. If an i → i+3 hydrogen bond is taken as the criterion for turns, the four categories of Venkatachalam [...] (I, II, II′, I′) suffice [...] to describe all possible beta turns. All four occur frequently in proteins but I is most common, followed by II, I′ and II′ in that order.|$|E
2500|$|Ford's last {{completed}} {{feature film}} was 7 Women (MGM, 1966), a drama about missionary women in China ca. 1935 {{trying to protect}} themselves from the advances of a barbaric Mongolian warlord. Anne Bancroft took over the lead role from Patricia Neal, who suffered a near-fatal stroke two days into shooting. The supporting cast included Margaret Leighton, Flora Robson, Sue Lyon, Mildred Dunnock, Anna Lee, Eddie Albert, Mike Mazurki and Woody Strode, with music by Elmer Bernstein. Unfortunately it was a commercial flop, grossing only about half of its $2.3million budget. Unusual for Ford, it was shot in continuity {{for the sake of the}} performances and he therefore exposed about four times as much film as he usually shot. Anna Lee recalled that Ford was [...] "absolutely charming" [...] to everyone and that the only major blow-up came when Flora Robson complained that <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>on</b> her dressing room door did not include her title ("Dame") and as a result Robson was [...] "absolutely shredded" [...] by Ford in front of the cast and crew.|$|E
