5|$|On 22 July 1847 {{the company}} {{acquired}} {{control of the}} Paisley and Renfrew Railway under the Paisley & Renfrew Railway Sale and Improvement Act. ,. The purchase had earlier been agreed by the proposed Paisley, Barrhead and Hurlet Railway, supported by the GPK, for £34,000. It was horse-operated and had a <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> of 4ft4in (1,321mm). The line was loss-making and had no practical value other than the tactical one of securing territory against competing companies. The Paisley Barrhead and Hurlet Bill failed in the 1847 session of Parliament and was re-presented in 1848; the share capital proposed had risen to £230,000; during the Lords' hearings it became plain that running powers {{were likely to be}} granted to the Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway, an offshoot of the Caledonian Railway. The GPK had subscribed to £150,000 in face value of the shares of this proposed line, with the sole intention of excluding the Caledonian Railway from the area. The GPK now petitioned against the Bill, but this was unsuccessful, and it received the Royal Assent, with the running powers clause, on 31 August 1848.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{extensively}} reconstructed {{in the early}} 2000s, undergoing a $50 million overhaul to connect the subway station to the new AirTrain JFK. The project was designed by STV Group and financed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. During {{the reconstruction of the}} station, the original subway platforms were demolished and temporary platforms were erected in the center trackways while the new platforms and mezzanine were built. During off-peak hours, trains utilized a single track. The AirTrain structure around the station was completed in 2001, and the AirTrain station opened on December 17, 2003, at which time the shuttle bus was discontinued. The transfer was popular, with 4 million people transferring between the subway and the AirTrain from 2003 to 2007. The AirTrain was designed with the same track height and <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> as those of the subway, to facilitate a future extension of the subway over the AirTrain system.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s and 1850s, {{a flurry}} of railroad-building {{activity}} led to the completion of four separate railroads converging in Erie. A break of gauge between the the Erie and North East Railroad and the Franklin Canal Companyensured that the citizens of Erie profited from the delays necessary to transfer cargo between the lines. When it was proposed in 1853 to standardize the <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> to allow through traffic, a conflict that {{became known as the}} Erie Gauge War ensued. The residents of Erie, who saw it as an affront to their desire that the city become a major lake port, dismantled railroad bridges and tore up railroad tracks in the city in an effort to prevent the impending standardization. As part of the dispute's settlement, both railroads provided financial support for the construction of the Erie and Pittsburgh and Sunbury and Erie railroads. The Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad acquired the Franklin Canal Company in 1854, and the Erie and North East was merged with the Buffalo and State Line to form the Buffalo and Erie Railroad a few years later. The Sunbury and Erie was renamed the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1861. The Pennsylvania Railroad soon acquired the Sunbury and Erie through a 999-year lease and funded completion of the line by 1864.|$|E

25|$|The SMJR built a {{line from}} Perth to Forfar; at Perth it used the Scottish Central Railway joint station. The main line ran through the fertile area of Strathmore and the SMJR adopted two {{existing}} short lines that were on a suitable alignment. They were the Newtyle and Coupar Angus Railway and the Newtyle and Glammiss Railway. (Glammiss is spelt Glamis nowadays.) Both were unsuccessful adjuncts to the Dundee and Newtyle Railway, built using stone block sleepers and a <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> of 4ft6.5in (1,384mm). The two short lines were modernised and altered to double track using standard gauge. At Forfar the SMJR joined the Arbroath and Forfar Railway, another earlier stone block railway, in this case using the <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> of 5ft6in (1,384mm). The SMJR opened in 1848.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1830s the Russian {{father and son}} inventors the Cherepanovs built the first Russian steam locomotive.

25|$|The City of Toronto's and the TTC's Transit City report {{released}} on March 16, 2007, proposed creating new light rail lines.

25|$|The <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> was 4ft 4in and the {{gradients}} were steep: {{as much as}} 1 in 13 near Vantage. The wooden {{permanent way}} was laid with two timber beams making a rail, fir underneath and beech above; wood sleepers were at two-feet intervals. The rails were 10 to 11 feet in length, secured {{to each other and}} the sleepers by oak pins. The line was a single line throughout.|$|E
25|$|Very {{little thought}} {{was given in}} the early years of the {{development}} of the colony-based rail networks of Australia-wide interests. The most obvious issue to arise was determining a <b>track</b> <b>gauge.</b> Despite advice from London to adopt a uniform gauge, should the lines of the various colonies ever meet, gauges were adopted in different colonies, and indeed within colonies, without reference to those of other colonies. This has caused problems ever since.|$|E

5000|$|Parts of the [...] <b>gauge</b> <b>track</b> {{were built}} as dual <b>gauge</b> <b>track,</b> with the outer rails gauged to {{standard}} gauge; {{other parts of}} the site were only served by standard <b>gauge</b> <b>track.</b> Some 120 mi of mixed or purely standard <b>gauge</b> <b>track</b> existed by 1918.

25|$|The {{industrial}} development {{led to the}} construction of other railways contiguous with the M, in particular the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway and the Wishaw and Coltness Railway. These two lines worked in harmony, merging to form the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway in 1841, and competing with the M and its allies. All these lines used the local <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> of 4ft6in (1,372mm), and they were referred to as the coal lines; passenger traffic was not a dominant activity.|$|E
25|$|Evidently the Monkland Canal Company {{exercised}} {{the power}} to acquire the Railway Company, and with the changes of ownership of the canal itself, the Drumpeller Railway became {{the property of the}} Caledonian Railway (CR). The CR changed the <b>track</b> <b>gauge</b> to standard gauge during June 1872 in association with making a connection of the hitherto isolated line to its own network. The connection was a west-to-south curve at Bargeddie station on the Rutherglen and Coatbridge line, giving rail access from the pits.|$|E
25|$|The {{first model}} {{railways}} were not built {{to any particular}} scale and were more like toys than miniature representations of the full size prototype. Eventually, the authenticity of models grew and benefits of standardization became more obvious. The most significant and the most basic area of standardization was the model <b>track</b> <b>gauge.</b> At first, certain gauges became de facto standards in hobbyist and manufacturer circles. While the first unofficial standard gauges made interchangeability possible, the rolling stock were still only a rough approximation of the full scale prototype.|$|E
50|$|All {{three of}} these {{commercial}} standards suffer from being too narrow to accurately represent the <b>track</b> <b>gauges,</b> and as a result, finescale standards have been developed.|$|R
