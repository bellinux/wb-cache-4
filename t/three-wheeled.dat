5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that they could not be railed to Moscow either. Special <b>three-wheeled</b> trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began {{after the release of}} Killer Instinct 2, in which a team was split into making Killer Instinct Gold for the Nintendo 64 and a new racing game for that console. At its first stage of development, Diddy Kong Racing was {{conceived}} as a real-time strategy game with a caveman/time-travel theme worked on by a team of four Rare members; Chris Stamper, Lee Musgrave, Rob Harrison and Lee Schuneman. During later stages of development, the game became influenced by Walt Disney World and soon evolved into an adventure game called Wild Cartoon Kingdom, with which Nintendo had no involvement. In June 1997, the game was altered to Pro Am 64, an unrelated follow-up to the NES racing game R.C. Pro-Am. According to Schuneman, the Pro Am 64 project featured <b>three-wheeled</b> trikes in contrast to radio-controlled cars.|$|E
5|$|Minibuses are {{the most}} common type of public {{transportation}} in Mogadishu. The next most frequently used public vehicles in the city are auto rickshaws (bajaj). They number around 3,000 units and come in various designs. The auto rickshaws represent a lower cost alternative to taxis and minibuses, typically charging half the price for the same distance, with flexible rates. Due to their affordability, capacity to negotiate narrow lanes and low fuel consumption, the <b>three-wheeled</b> vehicles are often appealing investment opportunities for small-scale entrepreneurs. They are generally preferred for shorter commutes. In June 2013, two new taxi companies also started offering road transportation to residents. Part of a fleet of over 100 vehicles, Mogadishu Taxi's trademark yellow cabs offer rides throughout the city at flat rates of $5. City Taxi, the firm's nearest competitor, charges the same flat rate, with plans to add new cabs to its fleet.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} survive the {{remainder}} of the Depression, the company manufactured industrial powerplants based on their motorcycle engines. They also designed and built a <b>three-wheeled</b> delivery vehicle called the Servi-Car, which remained in production until 1973.|$|E
25|$|While {{motorcycles}} {{typically have}} two wheels, some motorized tricycles are classed as <b>three-wheeled</b> motorcycles. Some brands have made {{various types of}} three-wheelers direct from the factory. Most of these vehicles are treated as motorcycles for registration or licensing purposes.|$|E
25|$|Also {{released}} for the 2009 {{model year}} is the FLHTCUTG Tri-Glide Ultra Classic, the first <b>three-wheeled</b> Harley since the Servi-Car was discontinued in 1973. The model features a unique frame and a 103-cubic-inch (1,690cm³) engine exclusive to the trike.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1950s, {{when the}} pulled {{rickshaw}} was phased out, mid-city and large city passengers may travel using <b>three-wheeled</b> pedicabs, or cycle rickshaws. The Chinese {{term for the}} conveyance is sanlunche (三轮车). The vehicles may be pedal- or motor-powered. In Shanghai, most of the vehicles are powered by electricity.|$|E
25|$|In November 1881, French {{inventor}} Gustave Trouvé {{demonstrated the}} first working (<b>three-wheeled)</b> car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris. Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus) {{were working on}} the problem at about the same time, Karl Benz generally is acknowledged as the inventor of the modern car.|$|E
25|$|A {{motorcycle}} is {{broadly defined}} by law {{in most countries}} {{for the purposes of}} registration, taxation and rider licensing as a powered two-wheel motor vehicle. Most countries distinguish between mopeds of 49cc and the more powerful, larger vehicles (scooters do not count as a separate category). Many jurisdictions include some forms of <b>three-wheeled</b> cars as motorcycles.|$|E
25|$|A {{motorcycle}} {{often called}} a bike, motorbike, or cycle is a two- or <b>three-wheeled</b> motor vehicle. Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit {{a range of}} different purposes: long distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport including racing, and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.|$|E
25|$|Alfred Scott also {{developed}} a <b>three-wheeled</b> machine gun carriage which was not {{taken up by the}} military and in 1919 he left the company he had founded to develop the vehicle for civilian use as the Scott Sociable.

25|$|The Frisky Family Three was {{basically}} a <b>three-wheeled</b> version of the coupe fitted with a smaller Villiers 9E engine and MacPherson strut front suspension. Having three wheels instead of four meant the car qualified for lower vehicle excise duty and also meant {{that it could be}} driven with a motorcycle licence. It entered production in about February 1959.|$|E
25|$|In September 2007, Aptera Motors {{announced}} their Typ-1 two-seater. They planned to produce both an electric 2e and a plug-in series hybrid 2h {{with a common}} <b>three-wheeled,</b> composite body design.

25|$|<b>Three-wheeled,</b> {{yellow and}} black or yellow and green auto-rickshaws, {{referred}} to as autos, are a popular form of transport. They are metered and can accommodate up to three passengers. Taxis, commonly called City Taxis, are usually available too, but they are only available on call or by online based services. Taxis are metered and are generally more expensive than auto-rickshaws.|$|E
25|$|Daedalus {{marked a}} drastic design {{change from the}} team's {{previous}} solar cars. Designed for the new cruiser class in the World Solar Challenge, it was the team's first two-seater car {{with an emphasis on}} practicality. The team overcame electrical problems to be in the minority of teams to finish the race without trailering. Daedalus also marked a permanent switch from <b>three-wheeled</b> to four-wheeled solar cars.|$|E
25|$|Zhao's {{rehabilitation}} {{began in}} April 1971, {{when he and}} his family were woken {{in the middle of the}} night by someone banging on the door.

The factory's only means of transport was a <b>three-wheeled</b> motorcycle, which was ready to take him.|$|E
25|$|In February 1914, one of {{the eagles}} was stolen. The thieves {{attempted}} to sell it as scrap metal for $24. The thieves broke the eagle from the granite base, rolled it down the slope and loaded it on a <b>three-wheeled</b> push cart, leaving tracks which the police were able to follow. When police found it at a recycling yard, {{the wings of the}} eagle had already been removed and partially melted.|$|E
25|$|Murdoch's working {{model was}} a <b>three-wheeled</b> vehicle {{about a foot}} in height with the engine and boiler placed between the two larger back wheels with a spirit lamp {{underneath}} to heat the water and a tiller at the front turning the smaller front wheel. The mechanics of the model locomotive incorporated a number of innovations, such as a boiler safety valve, having the cylinder partly immersed in the boiler and using a new valve system on {{the lines of the}} D-slide valve.|$|E
25|$|Aptera Motors – This company, now defunct, {{was founded}} by Steve Fambro and Chris Anthony. They {{developed}} a <b>three-wheeled</b> vehicle, the Aptera 2 Series. The initial model was to be all electric, but eventually sold alongside a plug-in hybrid version. The shape of the car is credited to Jason Hill, a designer {{who worked on the}} body of the Porsche Carrera GT, and to Aptera's own aerodynamicist, Miles Wheeler. The design was inspired by modern composite aircraft and is legally classified as a motorcycle.|$|E
25|$|Hadid also {{undertook}} some high-profile interior work, {{including the}} Mind Zone at the Millennium Dome in London {{as well as}} creating fluid furniture installations within the Georgian surroundings of Home House private members club in Marylebone, and the Z.CAR hydrogen-powered, <b>three-wheeled</b> automobile. In 2009 she worked with the clothing brand Lacoste to create a new, high fashion, and advanced boot. In the same year, she also collaborated with the brassware manufacturer Triflow Concepts to produce two new designs in her signature parametric architectural style.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the end of}} the Second World War, the company returned to manufacturing vehicles. Fuso bus production resumed, while a small <b>three-wheeled</b> cargo vehicle called the Mizushima and a scooter called the Silver Pigeon were also developed. However, the zaibatsu (Japan's family-controlled industrial conglomerates) were ordered to be dismantled by the Allied powers in 1950, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was split into three regional companies, each with an involvement in motor vehicle development: West Japan Heavy-Industries, Central Japan Heavy-Industries, and East Japan Heavy-Industries.|$|E
25|$|Vehicles with {{a single}} driving wheel. Besides motorcycles, which are {{generally}} not classified as automobiles, this group includes most <b>three-wheeled</b> cars. These were quite common in Europe in the mid-20th Century, but have now become rare there. They are still common {{in some areas of}} the developing world, such as India. Some early four-wheeled cars also had only one driving wheel to avoid the need for a differential. However, this arrangement led to many problems. The system was unbalanced, the driving wheel would easily spin, etc. Because of these problems, few such vehicles were made.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, {{the second}} Wolseley car is revealed. It is a <b>three-wheeled</b> design {{featuring}} independent rear suspension, mid-engine and back-to-back seating for two adults. Four {{years later the}} Wolseley Gasoline Carriage is built featuring a steering wheel instead of a tiller. Austin manages the new Wolseley company {{for a short time}} before resigning to form his own concern, the Austin Motor Company, in 1905. Wolseley later becomes a successful car and engine maker selling upmarket cars, and even opens a lavish showroom, Wolseley House, in Piccadilly London (next to the Ritz Hotel, now housing a restaurant called The Wolseley). The company is later merged in other motor car companies.|$|E
25|$|The first {{electronic}} autonomous robots {{with complex}} behaviour {{were created by}} William Grey Walter of the Burden Neurological Institute at Bristol, England in 1948 and 1949. He wanted to prove that rich connections between {{a small number of}} brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, named Elmer and Elsie, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement. The <b>three-wheeled</b> tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis, by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power.|$|E
25|$|Armand Peugeot became {{interested}} in the automobile early on and, after meeting with Gottlieb Daimler and others, was convinced of its viability. The first Peugeot automobile, a <b>three-wheeled,</b> steam-powered car designed by Léon Serpollet, was produced in 1889; only four examples were made. Steam power was heavy and bulky and required lengthy warmup times. In 1890, after meeting Daimler and Émile Levassor, steam was abandoned in favour of a four-wheeled car with a petrol-fuelled internal combustion engine built by Panhard under Daimler licence. The car was more sophisticated than many of its contemporaries, with a three-point suspension and a sliding-gear transmission. An example was sold to the young Alberto Santos-Dumont, who exported it to Brazil.|$|E
