50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sunsets</b> persisted for a {{few more}} years with Barrett {{arranging}} tours of the Netherlands and Ireland as well as many one night gigs in the UK.

When Louie finally left <b>the</b> <b>Sunsets</b> and reformed <b>the</b> Backbeats, Barrett decided the time had arrived to sever his association with <b>the</b> <b>Sunsets.</b> Several years later <b>the</b> <b>Sunsets</b> started performing again with original members, but with no further association with Barrett.|$|R

5|$|The Coast Starlight began {{operating}} with Superliners in January 1981. <b>The</b> <b>Sunset</b> Limited, a long-distance train {{running along the}} southern border of the United States between Los Angeles and New Orleans, gained them in February, resulting in a commendation from the Texas State Legislature.

Superliner assignments became permanent in the 1990s. Amtrak estimated that reequipping a train with Superliners boosted ridership on it by 25%.

5|$|Although al-Jamri's {{death was}} {{announced}} in the morning, the mourning processions only began after <b>the</b> <b>sunset</b> Maghrib prayer. The funeral course was changed several times.

The weather was extremely cold for Bahrain, yet thousands showed up wearing black mourning clothes and carrying black flags. According to a number of Al-Wasat writers, the funeral was the largest in the modern history of Bahrain.|$|E
5|$|Ancient weather {{forecasting}} methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition.

However, {{not all of these}} predictions prove reliable, and many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing.|$|E

5|$|The Sammamish River valley {{was settled}} in the late 19th century and served by the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad, built in 1889 from Bothell to North Bend, {{traveling}} through Redmond, Issaquah, Fall City, and Snoqualmie. By 1902, several wagon roads were built along the railroad, including a road between Fall City and North Bend, which was incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>Sunset</b> Highway when it was designated as a state highway in 1909. The road from Redmond to North Bend {{became part of the}} national Yellowstone Trail in the 1910s, including a section near Redmond that was paved with bricks in 1913. A portion of the Yellowstone Trail, along with unpaved roads from Redmond to Bothell, were designated as a state highway in 1925.
