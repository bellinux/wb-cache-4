25|$|Although we {{recognize}} that the Supreme Court did not identify a formal standard for assessing when these equitable defenses apply, the broadness of the Supreme Court's statements indicates <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> Sherrills holding is not narrowly limited to claims identical to that brought by the Oneidas, seeking a revival of sovereignty, but rather, that these equitable defenses apply to “disruptive” Indian land claims more generally.|$|E
25|$|With the {{way that}} {{everything}} is being done, with people like Trent Reznor and Radiohead, it was very inspiring <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> when you're doing things on your own {{you can do whatever}} you want. Not that we're going to give records away but this time we're starting a label, we want to build it up first and have the freedom to release exclusive things whenever we want. That's something we've always been able to do until we were on Epic, so it's nice that we're able to do that again.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} April, the Dean William Sancroft {{wrote to}} him that he had been right in his judgement: [...] "Our work at the west end," [...] he wrote, [...] "has fallen about our ears." [...] Two pillars had collapsed, and the rest was so unsafe that men were afraid to go near, even to pull it down. He added, [...] "You are so absolutely necessary <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we can do nothing, resolve on nothing without you." ...|$|E

And if you and I are powerless now, I {{want to believe that}} if we listen to what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves."

500|$|Now sitting upright, {{the robot}} {{looks up to}} see another robotic Björk as the {{machines}} stop the assembly. It smiles and extends its hand to the sitting robot, joining in the song. In the climax of the video, the robots passionately kiss and embrace while the machines assemble their backs and light comes and goes. The images of the kissing robots are interposed with shots of white fluid washing over robotic parts and the mechanical arms assembling them. According to the Institute for the Unstable Media, [...] "as the music fades and the pulsating beat becomes more dominant, we are once again drawn in the womb-like dark space, making it clear <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we sampled a glimpse of a black-boxed kingdom".|$|E
500|$|Ferb was devised as a {{character}} devoid of ill will. Marsh explained, [...] "It was important <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> [...] never did anything with any animosity. They never tried to get their sister in trouble or outsmart their mother {{and get away with}} it." [...] Instead, he and his brother create things for the sheer enjoyment of it or to help out others ("and for the ladies"); for example, Ferb and Phineas carve Candace's face into Mount Rushmore for her birthday, set up a roller derby for a rematch race with his Grandmother Betty Jo's old rival, create a haunted house for their friend Isabella to cure her hiccups and make a super-computer to find out what to do for their mom after being so kind to them.|$|E
500|$|As Chairman of COSC, Scherger {{played a}} leading role in the {{large-scale}} commitment of Australian forces to Vietnam. In an address at the Australian War Memorial in 2005, journalist Paul Kelly referred to him as [...] "Australia's most prominent military hawk" [...] at the time, who [...] "exceeded his brief" [...] by promising a battalion to the Americans before a formal request had been made. Historians Peter Edwards and Gregory Pemberton have written that [...] "no official could have done more to press Australia into a military commitment in Vietnam than its most highly ranked serviceman, Air Chief Marshal Scherger". Reflecting later on Australia's involvement in the war, Scherger said [...] "If you want allies, you've got to support allies...It was never conceivable <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> America could lose—no way." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1792, Lady Charlotte Finch {{had become}} ill and deaf. Princess Sophia remarked that autumn, [...] "I am grieved to death about her, she is if {{possible}} more kind {{to us than}} ever. Indeed, both [...] and her are so good <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> {{we should not be}} deserving of having such treasures about us, if we did not feel their kindness in the highest degree". Finch resigned from her role in November 1792 and retired on 5 January 1793, though she continued to correspond with {{members of the royal family}} and receive gifts from them, particularly the Prince of Wales, the future George IV. She received £600 in yearly payment, supplemented by income from the South Sea Company, until her death on 11 July 1813 at St James's Palace.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, another rock genre, Britpop, {{emerged in}} part as a {{reaction}} against the dominance of grunge in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by [...] "youthful exuberance and desire for recognition". The leading Britpop bands, [...] "Blur and Oasis exist as reactionary forces to [...] eternal downcast glare." [...] Britpop artists' new approach was inspired by Blur's tour of the United States {{in the spring of}} 1992. Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Damon Albarn) explained, [...] "Damon and I felt like we were in the thick of it at that point ... it occurred <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness." ...|$|E
500|$|Kubrick and Clarke privately {{referred}} to the project as How the Solar System Was Won as a reference to MGM's 1962 Cinerama epic, How the West Was Won. On February 23, 1965, Kubrick issued a press release announcing the title Journey Beyond The Stars. Other titles considered include Universe, Tunnel to the Stars, and Planetfall. In April 1965, eleven months after they began working on the project, Kubrick selected 2001: A Space Odyssey; Clarke said the title was [...] "entirely" [...] Kubrick's idea. Intending to set the film apart from the [...] "monsters and sex" [...] type of science fiction films of the time, Kubrick used Homer's The Odyssey as inspiration for the title. Kubrick said, [...] "t occurred <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> for the Greeks the vast stretches of the sea must {{have had the same}} sort of mystery and remoteness that space has for our generation." ...|$|E

500|$|Prior {{to writing}} the script, Arndt {{read in a}} {{newspaper}} about Arnold Schwarzenegger speaking {{to a group of}} high school students and saying [...] "If there's one thing in this world I hate, it's losers. I despise them." [...] As a result, Arndt developed his script lampooning the thought process: [...] "And I thought there's something so wrong with that attitude... I wanted to... attack that idea that in life you're going up or you're going down... So to a degree a child beauty pageant is the epitome of the ultimate stupid meaningless competition people put themselves through." [...] Co-director Jonathan Dayton also commented on the importance of the pageant to the film: [...] "As far as the pageant goes, it was very important <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the film not be about pageants. It's about being out of place, it's about not knowing where you're going to end up..." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982, Gittings remembered, [...] "I {{joined the}} {{movement}} in 1958, when the subject of homosexuality was still shrouded in complete silence. There were no radio talk shows or TV documentaries. In all the United States, there were maybe a half dozen groups, two hundred people active in all." [...] The Daughters of Bilitis served as a social alternative to bars for lesbians, but took great care to deny that they were [...] "arranging for 'immoral contacts'." [...] While president of the DOB in New York, attending members numbered between ten and forty per meeting. They met twice a month and often invited doctors, psychiatrists, ministers and attorneys to address their meetings, even if the message was clearly disparaging to lesbians. Gittings recalled, [...] "At first we were so grateful just to have people— anybody— pay attention <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we listened to and accepted everything they said, {{no matter how bad}} it was...anything that helped to break the silence, no matter how silly or foolish it may look to us today, was important." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> it might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{head of the}} {{household}} takes a jug of wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: [...] "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> our property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" [...] or, [...] "Hail, badnjak, veseljak! I give you wheat and wine, and you give me every good thing and peace!" [...] or similar. The name veseljak, literally [...] "jovial one", is used along with badnjak in some areas. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. In the clan of Kuči, wine is poured on the [...] "beard" [...] of the badnjak, and then a little girl sits for a moment on the log—for the well-being of the cattle. Christmas Eve dinner follows, which traditionally includes a round loaf of unleavened bread, beans, fish, walnuts, honey, and red wine. The bread is not cut with a knife, but broken with hands.|$|E
500|$|Musically, 21st Century Breakdown {{is similar}} to the punk rock style of American Idiot, but many critics have claimed that Green Day's {{traditional}} sound has evolved in the five years since their last release to incorporate new influences such as heavier, louder pop rock and stadium rock on an epic scale. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone indicated that the album sports ballads that are Green Day's most polished; he claimed that the band [...] "combine punk thrash with their newfound love of classic-rock grandiosity". MTV compared the material to that of classic rockers like The Who, while Spin called the title track [...] "Green Day's most epic song yet". Cool has remarked: [...] "It's important <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we're still looked at as a punk band. It was our religion, our higher education". However, he also noted that Armstrong had delved into the past in writing 21st Century Breakdown, gleaning inspiration from the artists who shaped rock music. Armstrong himself has stated: [...] "Ground zero for me is still punk rock. I like painting an ugly picture. I get something uplifting out of singing some of the most horrifying shit you can sing about. It's just my DNA." ...|$|E
500|$|Mikengreg first {{announced}} {{the game on}} March 1, 2012, and it was later released for iPad on August 9, 2012. Mikengreg decided to release the game as free-to-play for the base game with in-app purchases for the extended content. Wohlwend saw that {{a quarter of the}} top grossing games on iOS used in-app purchases (albeit with predatory practices) and felt that they could follow the model with a more ethical strategy: free to play, but pay once to unlock forever. Wohlwend later remarked that, [...] "So far, humanity is proving <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> we can't have it both ways." [...] They were told by friends that the purchase function was too hidden, which they later fixed. Journalists had noted the difficulty in purchasing the full version as well. Gasketball had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked near the top of an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart. The game's conversion rate from its free-to-play base package to the paid version was 0.67%—lower than their goal of at least 2% of an estimated five million downloads. The paid addition includes 100 additional levels and 10 new objects.|$|E
