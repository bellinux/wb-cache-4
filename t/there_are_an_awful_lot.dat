5000|$|Some {{components}} of tick saliva have potential as drugs {{to treat a}} range of conditions unrelated to tick disease. Nuttall comments that [...] "These molecules have been refined by {{millions of years of}} evolution. There are no toxicity problems, they work on a range of animals, they aren't fragile — and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of them." [...] For example, with Guido Paesen, Nuttall has characterised histamine-binding proteins that can suppress inflammation in humans by binding directly to histamine, rather than blocking its access to cell receptors, of which at least four are known. One of these proteins, rEV131, was investigated by NERC spin-off company Evolutec for the treatment of hay fever and for use in recovery from cataract surgery. Another example is the anticoagulant variegin, discovered by Nuttall and Maria Kazimirova in the tropical bont tick (Amblyomma variegatum), which represents a novel class of thrombin inhibitor; it has been shown to prevent venous thrombosis in a zebrafish model.|$|E
40|$|This item {{includes}} {{a segment of}} an instructor interview in a Writing Intensive course in Geology & Geophysics at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The interview was conducted in 2014, and in this clip the interviewee is responding to the question 'What observations on course dynamics and discussions do you have?'Brief excerpt from interview: They typically know each other {{because they have been}} taking classes for a few years. I encourage them to work together in the field just for safety's sake. They have to write individual reports, of course, but for safety and bouncing ideas off each other in the field. When we go together to california, and we're living together for 11 days, and riding around in the same van, eating dinner and breakfast together, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of dynamics. It's really fun. I think they end up, more than in most courses, knowing each other really well, which is usually a good thing...|$|E

40|$|The {{average person}} on the street {{will tell you that}} {{copyright}} is for printed creative works like text, paintings, or musical compositions, while patents are for functional physical devices and processes. But here in the modern day, that basic intuition just doesn’t match up with the real-ity of U. S. law. The two regimes have been growing closer over the last few decades, which means that the things that some think of as the key distinction between the two are not much of a distinction anymore, while other features are of increasing impor-tance. Subject matter <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> of types of work that could be covered by either system. In the absurdist plays section of my bookshelf, I’ve got a copy of Endg-dame by Beckett [1958]. Although it is plain text, it is a series of instructions for actors, comparable to a series of instructions for people on an assembly line. If you’d like to excise words entirely, the publishers added a short bonus play, entitled Act with-out words: A mime for one player. The stage directions are text, but are entirely about how props or the actor should move, to achieve a final goal [which I take to be demonstratin...|$|E

60|$|She {{suffered}} an agony of disillusion. Was this the real Siegmund, {{and her own}} only a projection of her soul? She took her breath sharply.

50|$|As {{the army}} arrived near Simancas, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> {{eclipse of the}} sun that covered the earth of a dark yellow amid the day and it filled us and the infidels with terror as neither had seen in their life {{such a thing as}} this. Two days passed without either side making any movement.|$|R
6000|$|... "No more do I. That's {{the dreadful}} thing about it. You've got {{to listen to}} chaps that you don't know.

60|$|One Sunday in {{the last}} long vacation, the wretched boy pushed his rebellious spirit so far as {{not to go to}} church, and he was seen at the gate of the Clavering Arms smoking a cigar, {{in the face of the}} {{congregation}} as it issued from St. Mary's. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> sensation in the village society, Portman prophesied Pen's ruin after that, and groaned in spirit over the rebellious young prodigal.|$|R

You see, the summertime number flopped on the second night, and they hadn't anything to put in its place. But it's all right. They took it out and sewed up the wound, and now you'd never know <b>there</b> had <b>been</b> anything wrong. The show was ten minutes too long, anyway." ...|$|R
50|$|When {{asked how}} Tarkus could be written so quickly (six days), Emerson said:Our sort of {{creativity}} comes in varying periods. We get long periods when there isn't any creativity, {{we go into}} a studio and nothing sounds right, you know. Tarkus was written in six days because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> lot of inspiration and one idea triggered another idea, and it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> long series of ideas being triggered off of what we had already done.|$|R

60|$|I {{made about}} three {{passes in the}} air, and then <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> crash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks, along with a vast {{volcanic}} fountain of fire that turned night to noonday, and showed a thousand acres of human beings groveling {{on the ground in}} a general collapse of consternation. Well, it rained mortar and masonry the rest of the week. This was the report; but probably the facts would have modified it.|$|R
5000|$|In later testimony, First Officer Donatos Lilis said: [...] "I heard a {{very loud}} noise, like iron bars beating against each other. Perhaps {{the cover of}} a pump had broken. Then <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> explosion." [...] Five crewmen died immediately, as fire broke out and oil started leaking from the hull as the plates overheated. As the fire engulfed the ship, flames rose 100m high and, after a series of further explosions occurred, between 30-40,000 tons of oil poured into the sea.|$|R
