5|$|Many Chaplin-unauthorized {{compilations}} of his Keystone, Essanay and Mutual {{films were}} {{released in the}} years following his departure from those companies. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> exhaustive list but does contain the most notable and widely released examples.

5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people {{do not respond to}} the SSRI, even though <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> officially approved indication. The addition of bupropion to an SSRI (most commonly fluoxetine or sertraline) may result in an improvement in some people who have an incomplete response to the first-line antidepressant.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} few {{antidepressants}} {{that does}} not cause sexual dysfunction. A range of studies demonstrate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants, but can actually help to alleviate sexual dysfunction. According to a survey of psychiatrists, it is the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. There have also been a few studies suggesting that bupropion can improve sexual function in women who are not depressed, if they have hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).|$|E
5|$|Like all rare-earth metals, cerium is of low to {{moderate}} toxicity. A strong reducing agent, it ignites spontaneously in air at 65 to 80°C. Fumes from cerium fires are toxic. Water {{should not be}} used to stop cerium fires, as cerium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas. Workers exposed to cerium have experienced itching, sensitivity to heat, and skin lesions. Cerium is not toxic when eaten, but animals injected with large doses of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse. Cerium is more dangerous to aquatic organisms, on account of being damaging to cell membranes, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> important risk because it is not very soluble in water.|$|E

5|$|The love dart {{is not a}} penial stylet (in {{other words}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> {{accessory}} organ for sperm transfer). The exchange of sperm between both of the two land snails is a completely separate part of the mating progression. Nevertheless, recent research shows that use of the dart can strongly favor the reproductive outcome for the snail that is able to lodge a dart in its partner. This is because mucus on the dart introduces a hormone-like substance that allows far more of its sperm to survive.|$|E
5|$|Final Damnation: Finally, {{those who}} persist in {{living in a}} state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject {{themselves}} to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God. No one is predestined to hell and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to hell. Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo, although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> official dogma of the Church.|$|E
5|$|The dog conch {{lives on}} muddy sand bottoms among algae and {{seagrass}} beds on insular and continental shores. It usually prefers major islands and continental coasts {{rather than the}} shores of small islands, although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> absolute rule. L.canarium prefers areas of mixed seagrasses (with a predominance of Halophila), and also prefers sediment {{with high levels of}} organic matter. This conch avoids environments with a high density of Enhalus acoroides, a large seagrass native to coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific. The dog conch can be found in littoral and sublittoral zones, from shallow water to a depth of 55m (180ft). It is normally found in large colonies, and is usually abundant wherever it occurs.|$|E
