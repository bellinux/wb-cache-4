5|$|McDowell's {{statement}} of admission {{was published in}} David McKittrick's book Lost Lives:"There was very little planning. I only came into it because of my UDR connection and the fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> uniform. I was given a sub-machine gun but I had never fired it. I passed out when the explosion happened {{and that was when}} I lost the gun, the glasses, and a UDR beret".|$|E
25|$|In 2006, I made {{a serious}} error in {{judgment}} and conducted {{myself in a}} way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and I told my wife <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E

But I was also aware <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> huge {{responsibility}} {{to get it right}} and do justice to those suffering in real life. [...] Because Sam has chemotherapy, I was asked if I'd be willing to shave off my hair, and I said, [...] "Absolutely," [...] which is why I'm bald. I've also done a lot of research, and try hard to separate my character from my life off-screen, but I feel guilty {{that at the end of}} each day I can walk away from the illness, when many aren't so fortunate." ...|$|E
50|$|Here, the presupposition {{triggered}} by the expression my wife (<b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wife) is blocked, because it is stated in the antecedent of the conditional: That sentence doesn't imply <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wife. In the following example, it is not stated in the antecedent, so it is allowed to project, i.e. the sentence does imply <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wife.|$|R

500|$|In the episode, Logan {{makes an}} obscene hand gesture {{known as the}} shocker, {{something}} that the UPN censors did not notice. Before the filming of [...] "Normal Is the Watchword", Rob Thomas informed actor Teddy Dunn, who played Duncan Kane, that he was planning remove the character from the show. Dunn {{has said that he}} was not too upset by the news, as he almost did not return for the season at all. On his role in the season, Dunn stated, [...] "And so I knew going in <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> finite amount of episodes, so it was like any other job. It was week-to-week and then I went on my merry way." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{featured}} {{the first meeting}} of Daenerys Targaryen and Yara and Theon Greyjoy, and Yara's first meeting with Tyrion Lannister. Gemma Whelan, who plays Yara, talked about filming the scene: [...] "Oh my goodness – I was so excited when I saw <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> scene with those two [...]" [...] About the dynamic between the two women, Whelan said: [...] "It's clear as the scene plays out that Yara quite likes Dany. We share a lot of little looks and there's some playful language in how we talk to one another – Dany asks if the Iron Islands ever had a queen, and Yara says, 'No more than Westeros.' They recognize the girl-power undertow between the two of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Love {{claimed she}} was misquoted by Hirschberg, and {{asserted}} {{that she had}} immediately quit using heroin during her first trimester after she discovered she was pregnant. Record executive Danny Goldberg, who {{was a friend of}} Love and Cobain's, defended her against the claims, and commented on her decision to be profiled in the piece: [...] "Courtney had this yearning for mass-culture acceptability and just couldn't say no to something like <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> sense of foreboding about it, but I had no idea it as gonna be as bad as it was. [...] done a lot of stupid, self-destructive things, but I don't believe she screwed around with her pregnancy. Those allegations were anonymous." [...] Love would later claim that the publication of the article had serious implications for her marriage as well as Cobain's mental state, suggesting it was a factor in his suicide.|$|E

500|$|... "Dog Eat Dog" [...] is a style {{parody of}} the Talking Heads. Described as a [...] "tongue-in-cheek look at office life", the song was {{inspired}} by Yankovic's past experience of working in the mailrooms {{as well as the}} traffic department at Westwood One radio station. He noted, [...] "At first I thought [...] was kinda cool <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> phone and a desk and a little cubicle to call my own, but after a while I felt like my soul had been sucked out of me." [...] The song features a line directly parodying the Talking Heads song [...] "Once In a Lifetime": [...] "Sometimes I tell myself, this is not my beautiful stapler/Sometimes I tell myself this is not my beautiful chair!" [...] This mirrors a similar line in the Talking Heads song: [...] "You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful house/You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful wife".|$|E
500|$|Affleck acted professionally {{throughout}} his childhood but, {{in his own}} words, [...] "not in the sense <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> mom that wanted {{to take me to}} Hollywood or a family that wanted to make money from me ... I kind of chanced into something." [...] He first appeared, at the age of seven, in a local independent film called Dark Side of the Street (1981), directed by a family friend. His biggest success as a child actor was as the star of the PBS children's series The Voyage of the Mimi (1984) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988), produced for sixth-grade science classes. Affleck worked [...] "sporadically" [...] on Mimi from the age of eight to fifteen in both Massachusetts and Mexico. As a teenager, he appeared in the ABC after school special Wanted: A Perfect Man (1986), the television film Hands of a Stranger (1987), and a 1989 Burger King commercial.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled {{that he and the}} band were at odds: [...] "Suffice to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very intense personal relationship [...] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [...]" [...] Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something out of me that I wasn't feeling, and we got in a fight and I knew that I was done with him." ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{amid the}} New Woman and burgeoning suffragist {{movements}} that, in 1908, O'Neill began {{to concentrate on}} producing original artwork, and {{it was during this}} period that she created the whimsical Kewpie characters for which she became known. Their name, [...] "Kewpie", derives from Cupid, the Roman god of love. According to O'Neill, she became obsessed with the idea of the cherubic characters, to the point that she had dreams about them: [...] "I thought about the Kewpies so much <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> dream about them where they were all doing acrobatic pranks on the coverlet of my bed. One sat in my hand." [...] She described them as [...] "a sort of little round fairy whose one idea is to teach people to be merry and kind at the same time". The Kewpie characters made their debut in comic strip form in 1909 in an issue of Ladies' Home Journal. Further publications of the Kewpie comics in Woman's Home Companion and Good Housekeeping helped the cartoon grow in popularity rapidly.|$|E

2500|$|Anger has {{finished}} writing Hollywood Babylon III, {{but has not}} yet published it, fearing severe legal repercussions if he did so.

2500|$|I was {{requested}} to attend at the Sunshine Welfare Offices, where they formerly (sic) discharged me from State ward ship.
