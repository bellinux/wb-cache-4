5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> (NSC) {{met again}} on April 19, Obama gave {{provisional}} {{approval for the}} helicopter raid.

5|$|At {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> (NSC) {{meeting on}} September 6, {{it was agreed that}} the {{priority}} was to obtain more information on the situation in Vietnam.

5|$|The new DM-15B Nike Zeus B (the earlier model retroactively {{becoming}} the A) received a go ahead for development on 16 January 1958, the same date the Air Force was officially told {{to stop all}} work on a Wizard missile. On 22 January 1958, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> gave Zeus S-Priority, the highest national priority. Additional funds were requested to the Zeus program to ensure an initial service date {{in the fourth quarter}} of 1962, but these were denied, delaying service entry until some time in 1963.|$|E
5|$|The plan's aim was {{to rebuild}} the {{democratic}} and economic systems of Europe and to counter perceived threats to Europe's balance of power, such as communist parties seizing control through revolutions or elections. The plan also stated that European prosperity was contingent upon German economic recovery. One month later, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, creating a unified Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> (NSC). These would become the main bureaucracies for US policy in the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|Four years later, with Drumlin {{seeking to}} close SETI, Arroway discovers a signal repeating a {{sequence}} of prime numbers, apparently sent from the star system Vega some 26 light-years away. This announcement causes Drumlin and <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> led by Michael Kitz to attempt {{to take control of}} the facility. Arroway's team then discover a video buried in the signal: Adolf Hitler's opening address at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Arroway and her team postulate that this would have been the first television signal strong enough to leave Earth's atmosphere, taking 26 years to reach Vega and then being transmitted back from there.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Secretary of State Dean Acheson {{appointed}} Thomas {{to serve}} on a panel with Robert Oppenheimer, David Lilienthal, Chester I. Barnard and Harry Winne to appraise international atomic inspection, culminating in the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In 1951 Truman appointed Thomas to the Science Advisory Committee, an eleven-man committee of prominent scientists to advise on defense planning. In 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him a scientific consultant to <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council,</b> {{and he was the}} U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, Thomas was part of a group that persuaded Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy to establish DARPA.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{met with}} <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> on March 14 {{to review the}} options. The President was {{concerned}} that the mission would be exposed and wanted to proceed quickly. For that reason he ruled out involving the Pakistanis. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and other military officials expressed doubts as to whether bin Laden was in the compound, and whether a commando raid was worth the risk. At {{the end of the}} meeting, the president seemed to be leaning toward a bombing mission. Two U.S. Air Force officers were tasked with exploring that option further.|$|E

5|$|The scandal {{began as}} an {{operation}} to free seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, a paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. It was planned that Israel would ship weapons to Iran, and then the United States would resupply Israel and receive the Israeli payment. The Iranian recipients promised {{to do everything in}} their power to achieve the release of the hostages. Large modifications to the plan were devised by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> in late 1985, in which a portion of the proceeds from the weapon sales was diverted to fund anti-Sandinista, or Contras, in Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|Agnew {{continued}} {{to try to}} increase his influence with Nixon, against the opposition of Haldeman, who was consolidating his power as the second most powerful person in the administration. Agnew was successful in being heard at an April 22, 1970, meeting of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council.</b> An impediment to Nixon's plan for Vietnamization {{of the war in}} Southeast Asia was increasing Viet Cong control of parts of Cambodia, beyond the reach of South Vietnamese troops and used as sanctuaries. Feeling that Nixon was getting overly dovish advice from Secretary of State William P. Rogers and Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, Agnew stated that if the sanctuaries were a threat, they should be attacked and neutralized. Nixon chose to attack the Viet Cong positions in Cambodia, a decision that had Agnew's vigorous support, and that he remained convinced was correct after his resignation.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the U.S. was {{planning}} its own actions against bin Laden. Michael Scheuer, {{chief of the}} CIA's bin Laden unit (Alec Station), considered using local Afghans to kidnap bin Laden, then exfiltrate him from Afghanistan in a modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Documents recovered from Wadih el-Hage's Nairobi computer suggested a link between bin Laden and the deaths of U.S. troops in Somalia. These were used {{as the foundation for}} the June 1998 New York indictment of bin Laden, although the charges were later dropped. The planned raid was cancelled in May after internecine disputes between officials at the FBI and the CIA; the hesitation of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> (NSC) to approve the plan; concerns over the raid's chance of success, and the potential for civilian casualties.|$|E
5000|$|From 1958 to 1961 General Hickey was Staff Director for <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council's</b> Net Evaluation Subcommittee.

5|$|From 1943 to 1945, he coordinated Manhattan Project work on {{plutonium}} purification and production. He also coordinated {{development of}} techniques to industrially refine polonium {{for use with}} beryllium in the triggers of atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project's Dayton Project, part of which {{was conducted on the}} estate of his wife's family. Shortly before the war ended, he took over the management of the Clinton Laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Monsanto pulled out of Oak Ridge in December 1947, but became the operator of the Mound Laboratories in 1948. Secretary of State Dean Acheson appointed Thomas to serve on a 1946 panel to appraise international atomic inspection, which culminated in the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In 1953 he was appointed as a consultant to <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council,</b> and served as U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E
5|$|Planning for the {{evacuation}} of the Americans and their South Vietnamese allies from South Vietnam had begun prior to April, 1975. When U.S. President Gerald Ford met with <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> on 9 April 1975 he was told by Henry Kissinger that a maximum of 1.6 million people had been identified as possible evacuees and that these included: American citizens and their relatives, the diplomatic corps, the ICCS, third country nationals under contract by the U.S. government and the employees the US and their dependents (estimated at about 200,000 people). In addition, the Vietnamese relatives of American citizens and senior Govt. of Vietnam officials and their dependents (apx. 600,000 people) were also identified as potential evacuees, along with Vietnamese formerly employed by the U.S. and their dependents.|$|E
5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras, although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more {{power in the hands of}} that chair.|$|E
50|$|On February 2, 2005, President George W.
