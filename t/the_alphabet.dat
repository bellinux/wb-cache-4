5|$|How <b>the</b> <b>Alphabet</b> Was Made ‚Äî Taffimai and {{her father}} invent an alphabet.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians, however, {{doubt the}} {{veracity}} of this theory. For one thing, notes Kenneth R. Beesley, the Deseret News and every book published in <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> prominently feature the key to <b>the</b> <b>alphabet,</b> and anyone without a key could have gotten a copy of A Journey to Great-Salt-Lake City, or traveled to Salt Lake City themselves and bought one. Contemporary scholars Richard F. Burton and Jules Remy also dismissed the secrecy argument, in 1860 and 1855 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The name-letter {{effect is}} the {{tendency}} of people to prefer the letters in their name over other letters in <b>the</b> <b>alphabet.</b> Whether subjects are asked to rank all letters of <b>the</b> <b>alphabet,</b> rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out {{of a set of}} two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.|$|E

See double acute accent.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Urdu <b>alphabet</b> is <b>the</b> right-to-left <b>alphabet</b> {{used for}} <b>the</b> Urdu language. It is a {{modification}} of <b>the</b> Persian <b>alphabet</b> known as Perso-Arabic, which is itself a derivative of <b>the</b> Arabic <b>alphabet.</b> <b>The</b> Urdu <b>alphabet</b> has up to 58 letters. With 39 basic letters and no distinct letter cases, <b>the</b> Urdu <b>alphabet</b> is typically written in the calligraphic Nasta ølƒ´q script, whereas Arabic is more commonly in the Naskh style.|$|R
5|$|Today, <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> {{is used by}} {{approximately}} 16,000,000 people to write the Sinhalese language in very diverse contexts, such as newspapers, TV commercials, government announcements, graffiti, and schoolbooks.|$|E
5|$|Applying ROT13 to a {{piece of}} text merely {{requires}} examining its alphabetic characters and replacing each one by the letter 13 places further along in <b>the</b> <b>alphabet,</b> wrapping back to the beginning if necessary.|$|E
5|$|During the alphabet's heyday between 1854 and 1869, books, newspapers, {{street signs}} and {{correspondence}} used the new letters, but despite heavy and costly promotion {{by the early}} LDS church, <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> never enjoyed prolonged widespread use and has been regarded by historians as a failure.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> Arabic <b>alphabet</b> {{concerns}} <b>the</b> origins {{and the evolution}} of the Arabic script. It is thought that <b>the</b> Arabic <b>alphabet</b> is a derivative of the Nabataean variation of <b>the</b> Aramaic <b>alphabet,</b> which descended from <b>the</b> Phoenician <b>alphabet,</b> which, among others, gave rise to <b>the</b> Hebrew <b>alphabet</b> and <b>the</b> Greek <b>alphabet</b> (and therefore <b>the</b> Cyrillic and Roman alphabets).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Urdu <b>alphabet</b> is <b>the</b> right-to-left <b>alphabet.</b> It is a {{modification}} of <b>the</b> Persian <b>alphabet,</b> which is itself a derivative of <b>the</b> Arabic <b>alphabet.</b> With 38 letters, <b>the</b> Urdu <b>alphabet</b> is typically written in the calligraphic Nasta'liq script, whereas Arabic is more commonly in the Naskh style.|$|R

5|$|His new {{alphabet}} closely resembled an 1853 {{publication of}} Isaac Pitman, containing only 33 letters. However, at this point, Young was still enamored {{with the original}} Deseret alphabet, and so he rejected the proposal and Watt continued to publicly promote <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> {{as part of his}} job despite his reservations.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Sinhalese {{letters are}} curlicues; {{straight}} lines are almost completely absent from <b>the</b> <b>alphabet.</b> This is because Sinhala {{used to be}} written on dried palm leaves, which would split along the veins on writing straight lines. This was undesirable, and therefore, the round shapes were preferred.|$|E
5|$|ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", {{sometimes}} hyphenated ROT-13) is {{a simple}} letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in <b>the</b> <b>alphabet.</b> ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher, developed in ancient Rome.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Latin <b>alphabet</b> {{was derived}} from Old Italic (originally a form of <b>the</b> Greek <b>alphabet),</b> used for Etruscan and other languages. The origin of <b>the</b> Runic <b>alphabet</b> is disputed, and the main {{theories}} are that it evolved either from <b>the</b> Latin <b>alphabet</b> itself, some early Old Italic <b>alphabet</b> via <b>the</b> Alpine scripts or <b>the</b> Greek <b>alphabet.</b> Despite this debate, <b>the</b> Runic <b>alphabet</b> is clearly derived from one or more scripts that ultimately trace their roots back to <b>the</b> Phoenician <b>alphabet.</b>|$|R
5|$|Sogdian {{was written}} largely in three scripts: <b>the</b> Sogdian <b>alphabet,</b> <b>the</b> Syriac <b>alphabet,</b> and <b>the</b> Manichaean <b>alphabet,</b> each derived from <b>the</b> Aramaic <b>alphabet,</b> {{which had been}} widely used in both the Achaemenid and Parthian empires of ancient Persia. <b>The</b> Sogdian <b>alphabet</b> formed <b>the</b> basis of <b>the</b> Old Uyghur <b>alphabet</b> of <b>the</b> 8th century, which in turn was used to create the Mongolian script of the early Mongol Empire during the 13th century.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{standard}} <b>alphabet</b> {{is equivalent}} to <b>the</b> Romanian <b>alphabet</b> (based on <b>the</b> Latin <b>alphabet).</b> Until 1918, varieties of <b>the</b> Romanian Cyrillic <b>alphabet</b> were used. <b>The</b> Moldovan Cyrillic <b>alphabet</b> was used in 1924-1932 and 1938-89, and remains in use in Transnistria.|$|R
5|$|The Cyrillic {{script was}} {{introduced}} in Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic in the late 1930s, replacing the Latin script {{that had been used}} since the October Revolution. After 1939, materials published in Persian in the Persian alphabet were banned from the country. <b>The</b> <b>alphabet</b> below was supplemented by the letters –© and –´ in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The Deseret {{alphabet}} was purposely {{designed so}} as to not have ascenders and descenders. This was envisioned as a practical benefit for <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> {{in an era of}} metal type: after many uses, the edges of type sorts become dull, and narrow ascenders and descenders are most prone to this effect.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main {{handwritten}} {{forms of the}} Deseret alphabet: a cursive version and a printed version. Over the lifetime of <b>the</b> <b>alphabet,</b> the cursive form fell out of favor among most users of <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> and by 1856 no more cursive documents exist. Its impact on the glyphs can however still be plainly seen in the loops of certain characters such as êëÖ, êëÄ and êêº. The earliest surviving versions of the Deseret alphabet, from 1853 (one year before its January 1854 approval), have printed and cursive forms side-by-side, suggesting that a cursive form {{was part of the}} plan from the very beginning.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>alphabets</b> {{used for}} Slavic {{languages}} are frequently {{connected to the}} dominant religion among the respective ethnic groups. Orthodox Christians use <b>the</b> Cyrillic <b>alphabet</b> while Roman Catholics use the Latin alphabet; the Bosniaks, who are Muslim, also use <b>the</b> Latin <b>alphabet.</b> Additionally, some Eastern Catholics and Roman Catholics use <b>the</b> Cyrillic <b>alphabet.</b> Serbian and Montenegrin use both the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. There is also a Latin script to write in Belarusian, called <b>the</b> Lacinka <b>alphabet.</b>|$|R
5|$|Until this point, all {{the printed}} {{material}} (mostly just charts of <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> and its standard orthography equivalents) had been produced with large wooden type, {{which was not}} suitable for printing at small sizes. Because <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> was wholly unique, no font existed, so in 1857 {{the board of regents}} appointed Erastus Snow to procure metal type from St. Louis-based font foundry Ladew & Peer. However, in May 1857 the Utah War began, and Snow left St. Louis to support the Mormon pioneers. During the war, Ladew & Peer kept working on the type, and the punches and matrices were delivered in the winter of 1858. The first use of the new type was to make a business card for George A. Smith, an early Mormon historian.|$|E

Mary Jenkins, {{a fan of}} both <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> and the comic, publishes a transcription of the comic into the Deseret alphabet. She has done so for every comic since Xkcd #658, published on 4 November 2009.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 65, Babcock {{became a}} pilot. As of 2006 he was in good mental and {{physical}} health, displayed by his ability to quickly recite <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> backwards, spell out his name in Morse Code, and take daily walks with his wife to keep in shape. At the age of 100 he wrote an autobiography titled Ten Decades of John Foster Babcock. It was distributed only to family and friends.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Paleo-Hebrew <b>alphabet,</b> used {{to write}} early Hebrew, was a {{regional}} offshoot of Phoenician; it is nearly identical to the Phoenician one (in many early writings {{it is impossible to}} distinguish between the two). <b>The</b> Samaritan <b>alphabet,</b> used by <b>the</b> Samaritans, is a direct descendant of <b>the</b> Paleo-Hebrew <b>alphabet.</b> <b>The</b> current Hebrew <b>alphabet</b> is a stylized form of <b>the</b> Aramaic <b>alphabet,</b> itself a descendant of the Phoenician script.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{classical}} Latin <b>alphabet,</b> {{also known}} as <b>the</b> Roman <b>alphabet,</b> is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. <b>The</b> Latin <b>alphabet</b> evolved from <b>the</b> visually similar Cumaean Greek version of <b>the</b> Greek <b>alphabet,</b> which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted <b>the</b> Cumaean Greek <b>alphabet</b> which was modified over time to become <b>the</b> Etruscan <b>alphabet,</b> which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce <b>the</b> Latin <b>alphabet.</b>|$|R
5|$|From 1950 through 1952, {{names from}} the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet were first used for storms in the North Atlantic. Able {{is the first}} name in <b>the</b> <b>alphabet,</b> and as such, Hurricane Able in 1950 was the first name officially {{to be used for}} an Atlantic {{hurricane}}. It was also the first of eight major hurricanes in the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season, which as of 2010 is still the record for the most major hurricanes in a season.|$|E
5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down <b>the</b> <b>alphabet.</b> For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.|$|E
5|$|In public statements, Young claimed <b>the</b> <b>alphabet</b> was {{intended}} to replace the traditional Latin alphabet with an alternative, more phonetically accurate alphabet for the English language. This would offer immigrants {{an opportunity to learn}} to read and write English, he said, the orthography of which is often less phonetically consistent than those of many other languages. Similar experiments have not been uncommon, the most well-known of which is the Shavian alphabet.|$|E
50|$|Bellaso‚Äôs second booklet {{appeared}} in 1555 as {{a continuation of}} the first.
