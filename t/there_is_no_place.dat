5|$|They meet up {{with the}} rest of the family at a car museum. They steal a replica of the main villain's car from The Road Warrior and engage in a ludicrous car chase through the streets of Hollywood, with the film {{executives}} on their trail. Homer, taking an idea he believes to be from Braveheart, moons the executives along with Gibson so that they will stop their car out of disgust. Homer and Gibson then attend the film's premiere back in Springfield, but when the film ends, the entire audience walks out disgusted, and Jimmy Stewart's granddaughter walks up to them, slaps them, and threatens to sue them for the bad film. Homer then tries to apologize to Gibson, but he does not blame him, arriving to the conclusion <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> for violence-lovers like them in Hollywood; however, as soon as Homer suggests more stupid film ideas, Gibson kicks him out of his limousine.|$|E
5|$|Hurt by Whatsername's departure, Johnny {{longs for}} better days ahead, Tunny longs for home, and Will longs {{for all the}} things he's lost ("Wake Me Up When September Ends"). St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny's attention, but that part of Johnny has died, {{resulting}} in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy ("The Death of St. Jimmy"). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> {{for him in the}} city ("East 12th Street"). Will, all alone with his television, bemoans his outcast state ("Nobody Likes You"). As he finally gets up off the couch, Heather appears with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend ("Rock and Roll Girlfriend"). Will heads to the 7-Eleven to get away from them and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're Coming Home Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E

A brief visit to Liège in September was {{followed}} immediately by a three-month round trip, to Scandinavia, Germany, Austria and Hungary, returning to England via Prague, Dresden, Leipzig, Berlin and Amsterdam. Her [...] "orgy of musical experiences" [...] included a Mozart pilgrimage in Salzburg, [...] performances of Der Rosenkavalier and Die Entführung aus dem Serail at the Vienna State Opera, Bach in Berlin and Mahler's Seventh Symphony in Amsterdam. On 1 February 1932 she departed again, this time for Italy. After a two-month tour Imogen came home with mixed views on Italian music-making. She concluded that [...] "the Italians are a nation of singers... But music is a different language {{in that part of}} the world".

500|$|The Economist heralded the book's publication, saying [...] "If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> for Watership Down in children’s bookshops, then children’s {{literature}} is dead." [...] Peter Prescott, senior book reviewer at Newsweek, gave the novel a glowing review: [...] "Adams handles his suspenseful narrative more dextrously than most authors {{who claim to}} write adventure novels, but his true achievement lies in the consistent, comprehensible and altogether enchanting civilisation that he has created." [...] Kathleen J. Rothen and Beverly Langston identified the work as one that [...] "subtly speaks to a child", with [...] "engaging characters and fast-paced action [...] make it readable." [...] This echoed Nicholas Tucker's praise for the story's suspense in the New Statesman: [...] "Adams ... has bravely and successfully resurrected the big picaresque adventure story, with moments of such tension that the helplessly involved reader finds himself checking whether {{things are going to}} work out all right on the next page before daring to finish the preceding one." ...|$|E

In response to the person's suggestion about trying to cast votes {{in the names of}} 100 inactive voters, Patrick Moran attempted to discourage the scheme, but also discussed the practical difficulties of forging documentation such as utility bills. [...] The person he was speaking with was actually a conservative activist with James O'Keefe's Project Veritas, and was secretly recording the conversation. Patrick Moran resigned from the campaign, saying he didn't want to be a distraction during the election, and stating, [...] "at no point have I, or will I ever endorse any sort of illegal or unethical behavior. At no point did I take this person seriously. He struck me as being unstable and joking, and for only that reason did I humor him.

[...] Ben Norman of About.com considered the song a [...] "true and triumphant Britney Spears pop song with a pensive underbelly (the first verse in particular) and a supremely executed hook." [...] Jonny Mugwump of The Quietus said, [...] "a paean to her performance adrenalin, [...] a medium-paced, big power-popper topped with an orbit-esque guitar," [...] and commented that the song's lyrics highlight Spears' uniqueness – [...] "the fuck you attitude. Despite everything, regardless of the personal destruction and undoubted hell she might still be haunted by, within the fictional space of the music, this woman couldn't give a damn. She rightly taunts the world around her, sounding utterly defiant. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> for apology or humble platitudes." [...] John Murphy of musicOMH also praised its lyrics, describing them as [...] "a confident, and encouraging, return to form."
