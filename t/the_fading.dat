5|$|The Whigs also {{maintained}} {{control of}} the General Assembly, and although Governor Powell was largely able to cooperate with his political opponents, some clashes did occur.

The governor was successful, however, in vetoing legislation that he felt would have created an overabundance of banks in the Commonwealth.|$|E

40|$|The {{solution}} of space-fractional advection-dispersion equations (fADE) by random walks {{depends on the}} analogy between <b>the</b> <b>fADE</b> and <b>the</b> forward equation for the asso-ciated Markov process. The forward equation, which provides a Lagrangian description of particles moving under specific Markov processes, is derived here by the adjoint method. <b>The</b> <b>fADE,</b> however, provides an Eulerian description of solute fluxes. There are two forms of <b>the</b> <b>fADE,</b> based on fractional-flux (FF-ADE) and fractional divergence (FD-ADE). The FF-ADE is derived by taking the integer-order mass conservation of non-local diffusive flux, while the FD-ADE is derived by taking the fractional-order mass conservation of local diffusive flux. The analogy between <b>the</b> <b>fADE</b> and <b>the</b> for-ward equation depends on which form of <b>the</b> <b>fADE</b> is used and on the spatial variability of the dispersion coefficient D in <b>the</b> <b>fADE.</b> If D does not vary in space, then <b>the</b> <b>fADEs</b> can be solved by tracking particles following a Markov process with a simple drift and an α-stable Lévy noise with index α that corresponds to the fractional order of <b>the</b> <b>fADE.</b> If D varies smoothly in space and the solute concentration at the upstream boundary remains zero, the FD-ADE can be solved by simulating a Markov proces...|$|R
5|$|Many motifs {{are used}} in {{traditional}} kilims, handmade flat-woven rugs, each with many variations. In Turkish Anatolia in particular, village women wove themes significant for their lives into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life. Some motifs represent desires, such as for happiness and children; others, for protection against threats such as wolves (to the flocks) and scorpions, or against the evil eye. These motifs were often combined when woven into patterns on kilims. With <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> of tribal and village cultures in the 20th century, the meaning of kilim patterns has faded also.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28 with the score at 64, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes. On 39, Compton aimed a hard cut shot from Johnston's bowling, which flew into Lindwall's left hand at second slip. Hutton managed to continue resisting the Australians before Miller struck Crapp {{in the head with}} a bouncer. Hutton then edged Miller to Tallon and was out for 64, having top-scored in both innings. He had batted for over four hours and left England at 153/4. Thereafter, England collapsed. Crapp was bowled by Miller for nine, and two runs later, Ring dismissed debutant Watkins for two to take his only wicket. Lindwall returned and bowled Evans for eight. Evans appeared to not detect Lindwall's yorker in <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> light, and the umpires called off play due to bad light. The ground was then hit by rain, resulting in a premature end to the day's play. England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178/7.|$|E
5|$|In English {{folklore}} and literature, green {{has traditionally been}} used to symbolize nature and its embodied attributes, namely those of fertility and rebirth. Critics have claimed that the Green Knight's role emphasizes the environment outside of human habitation. With his alternate identity as Bertilak, the Green Knight {{can also be seen}} as a compromise between both humanity and the environment as opposed to Gawain's representation of human civilization. Oftentimes it is used to embody the supernatural or spiritual other world. In British folklore, the devil was sometimes considered to be green {{which may or may not}} play into the concept of the Green Man/ Wild Man dichotomy of the Green Knight. Stories of the medieval period also portray the colour as representing love and the amorous in life, and the base, natural desires of man. Green is also known to have signified witchcraft, devilry and evil for its association with the fairies and spirits of early English {{folklore and}} for its association with decay and toxicity. The colour, when combined with gold, is sometimes seen as representing <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> of youth. In the Celtic tradition, green was avoided in clothing for its superstitious association with misfortune and death. Green can be considered in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight as signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; displaying both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour. Given these varied and even contradictory interpretations of the colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous.|$|E

40|$|The {{fractional}} advection-diffusion equation (fADE) {{model is}} {{a new approach to}} describe the vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration in steady turbulent flow. However, the advantages and parameter definition of <b>the</b> <b>fADE</b> model in describing the sediment suspension distribution are still unclear. To address this knowledge gap, this study first reviews seven models, including <b>the</b> <b>fADE</b> model, for <b>the</b> vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration in steady turbulent flow. <b>The</b> <b>fADE</b> model, among others, describes both Fickian and non-Fickian diffusive characteristics of suspended sediment, while the other six models assume that the vertical diffusion of suspended sediment follows Fick’s first law. Second, this study explores the sensitivity of the fractional index of <b>the</b> <b>fADE</b> model to <b>the</b> variation of particle sizes and sediment settling velocities, based on experimental data collected from the literatures.

These backed individual pretenders in exchange for domination of the country's affairs. The conflicts were tolerated by the Ottoman Empire, which exercised suzerainty over Wallachia and neighboring Moldavia (the Danubian Principalities).
