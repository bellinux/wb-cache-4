5|$|Bagramyan was {{instrumental}} in the planning of two Soviet counter-offensives against the Germans, including the major push made by Soviet forces in December during the Battle of Moscow, and for this was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General. In the same month, he was made the chief of staff of a military operations group that would oversee three Army Groups: the Southern, <b>the</b> <b>Southwestern</b> and Bryansk Fronts. In March 1942, he went along with Khrushchev and Timoshenko to Moscow to present the plans of a new counter-offensive in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv to Stalin. Stalin, impressed with his plan, approved the operation and on April 8, promoted Bagramyan as Chief of Staff of <b>the</b> <b>Southwestern</b> Front. On 12 May 1942, armies of <b>the</b> <b>Southwestern</b> Front attacked Kharkiv but the launch of the offensive came at an inopportune moment since they were attacking from the Barvenkovo Salient, a region that German forces were near closing.|$|E

5|$|In {{an average}} year, the {{remnants}} of 3.1Pacific tropical cyclones affect <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> United States. In some locations, the systems provide 30% of the annual rainfall. In New Mexico, however, stations' annual rainfall from tropical cyclones range from 10% in the western portion to less than 5% in the eastern. Rainfall from tropical cyclones affect the Albuquerque International Sunport an average of 3.9days per year. Storms affect New Mexico less than Arizona, and are generally weaker. The greatest threat from such storms are accompanying floods. Damage from tropical cyclones {{is expected to increase}} as the population increases in <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> United States.|$|E

5|$|Storms that {{approach}} <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> United States, {{and by extension}} Arizona, generally form closer to the Mexican shoreline than average, making them more likely to recurve northwards {{under the influence of}} an approaching trough. These troughs tend to extend farther to the south during {{the latter part of the}} Pacific hurricane season, in the period between late August and early October. These pronounced troughs thus produce a synoptic-scale flow that is conducive to steering hurricanes towards <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> United States.|$|E

5|$|The storm brought {{tropical}} storm force winds and precipitation to <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> Mexican coastline. Later, Emilia produced similar {{conditions in the}} southern portion of the Baja California peninsula, where its passage caused minor damage and flooding.

5|$|The {{tropical}} depression initially moved northwestward around <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> periphery of a ridge over Mexico. Convection continued to develop {{to the west}} of the center, and late on August 23, a ship report confirmed the depression intensified Tropical Storm Julio. Initially, the persistent shear left the center partially exposed from the thunderstorm activity, though upper level conditions gradually became more favorable for strengthening. On August 24, Tropical Storm Julio attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) as intense convection developed near the center. Shortly thereafter, the center became difficult to locate, and late on August 24 the storm moved ashore along <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> coast of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{areas of}} {{tropical}} cyclone formation {{are divided into}} seven basins. These include the north Atlantic Ocean, the eastern and western parts of the northern Pacific Ocean, <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> Pacific, <b>the</b> <b>southwestern</b> and southeastern Indian Oceans, and the northern Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal). The western Pacific is the most active and the north Indian the least active. An average of 86tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones (at least of Category 3 intensity).|$|E
