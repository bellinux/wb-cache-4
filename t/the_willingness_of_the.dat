5|$|A {{possible}} reason for <b>the</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Franks to connect {{themselves with the}} Kentish court {{is the fact that}} a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then {{it may be that the}} marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people. Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.|$|E

5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be <b>the</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child to cooperate.|$|E

If the military or police attempt to repress nonviolent resisters violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, the military or police will be forced to accept the fact that they no longer have any power over the resisters. Often, <b>the</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.|$|E
25|$|Bismarck's {{government}} had to submit three draft bills before it could get one passed by the Reichstag in 1884.

The National Liberals took this program to be an expression of State Socialism, against which they were dead set.

40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{prominent}} features <b>of</b> Romanization in <b>the</b> British countryside were the Romanized villas, which clearly demonstrated <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> Roman lifestyles. Many represented <b>the</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>of</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> native élite to exhibit their status through <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> residences with Roman-style architecture and materials (John, 1969 : 40; Black, 1987 : 7).

The report is to be delivered within 6 months, with an interim report by mid-May, 'prepared in close cooperation with the International nuclear community and other nuclear safety regulators'. On March 15, Huhne expressed regret that some European politicians were 'rushing to judgement' before assessments had been carried out, and said that it was too early to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> private sector to invest in new nuclear plants would be affected. In the wake of the accident the Government was criticised for having colluded with EDF Energy, Areva and Westinghouse in order to manage communications and maintain public support for nuclear power.|$|E

While some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, in the sense that some found them sexist, the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and [...] "The Blue Light" [...] have been described as a [...] "hilarious critique of <b>the</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American people to believe anything". The album is also notable for the presence of guitarist Steve Vai, who joined Zappa's touring band in late 1980.|$|E

500|$|Hunter College {{became the}} main recruit-training center for enlisted WAVES: chosen {{because of its}} space; location; ease of transportation, and <b>the</b> <b>willingness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> college to make its {{facilities}} available. Captain William F. Amsden, also a recipient of the Navy Cross in World War I, was named the commanding officer. On 8 February 1943 the college was commissioned the U.S. Naval Training Center, the Bronx, and became known as U.S.S. Hunter. Nine days later, approximately 2,000 recruits began their six-weeks of indoctrination. The training objectives {{were meant to be}} {{similar to those of the}} boot camp for men. In Lady in the Navy, Joy Hancock described the indoctrination of the recruits in this way: [...] "Each recruit went through a balanced training program. She was instructed in Navy ranks and ratings; ships and aircraft of the fleet; naval traditions and customs; and of course, naval history. Physical training and fitness were stressed. As the women marched in platoons to classes, medical examinations, and drills, their approach was signaled by singing, their voices providing the cadence for marching feet." [...] Between 17 February 1943 and 10 October 1945, some 80,936 WAVES, 1,844 SPARS, and 3,190 women Marines completed the training course. [...] The SPARS and Marine reservists used the Navy's training center until the summer of 1943, at which time they established their own training centers.|$|E

A constitutional conference on the reforms broke down in November 1910 after 21 meetings. Asquith and Lord Crewe, Liberal leader in the Lords, asked George to grant a dissolution, leading to a second general election, and to promise to create sufficient Liberal peers if the Lords blocked the legislation again. If George refused, the Liberal government would otherwise resign, which would have given the appearance that the monarch was taking sides– with [...] "the peers against the people"– in party politics. The King's two private secretaries, Lords Knollys and Stamfordham, gave George conflicting advice. Knollys, who was Liberal, advised George to accept the Cabinet's demands, while Stamfordham, who was Unionist, advised George to accept the resignation. Like his father, George reluctantly agreed to the dissolution and creation of peers, although he felt his ministers had taken advantage of his inexperience to browbeat him. After the December 1910 election, the Lords let the bill pass on hearing of the threat to swamp the house with new peers. The subsequent Parliament Act 1911 permanently removed– with a few exceptions– {{the power of the}} Lords to veto bills.
