5|$|In September, a poll {{conducted}} by the Goldwater campaign revealed <b>that</b> <b>Johnson</b> had a comfortable lead over him. Indeed, Goldwater's campaign was an uphill battle against an incumbent administration during a prosperous economy. In {{the wake of the}} death of John Kennedy, who had been leading in polls for reelection in 1964, there lingered the possibility <b>that</b> <b>Johnson</b> had the sympathy of the media and voters.|$|E
5|$|A rematch with Tony Ferguson was {{expected}} to take place on March 5, 2016 at UFC 196. However, on January 27, it was announced <b>that</b> <b>Johnson</b> withdrew from the bout due to injury.|$|E
5|$|However, on 15 March 2016, American comedian Jim Breuer (a {{friend of}} Johnson) {{revealed}} on his podcast <b>that</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{had received a}} second opinion on his hearing {{and it was not}} as bad as initially thought. Nonetheless, Breuer mentioned <b>that</b> <b>Johnson</b> told him that he was essentially fired from AC/DC and that he hadn't heard from the band since the announcement of the tour being postponed, adding that Angus Young wants to continue the band for at least another ten years and do at least one more studio album and world tour. Breuer later clarified his comments on Facebook that did not end speculation on Johnson's future with the band.|$|E

5000|$|In The Guardians music blog from May 2010, Jon Wilde speculated <b>that</b> <b>Johnsons</b> {{recordings}} {{may have}} been [...] "accidentally speeded up when first committed to 78 records, or else were deliberately speeded up to make them sound more exciting." [...] He did not give a source for this statement. Biographer Elijah Wald and other musicologists dispute this hypothesis on various grounds, including <b>that</b> <b>Johnsons</b> extant recordings were made on five different days, spread across two years at two different studios, making uniform speed changes or malfunctions highly improbable. In addition, fellow musicians, contemporaries and family who worked with or witnessed Johnson perform spoke of his recordings for more than 70 years preceding Wildes hypothesis without ever suggesting that the speed of his performances had been altered.|$|R
50|$|Johnsons film {{career began}} with the Howard Hughes film, The Outlaw. Before filming began, Hughes bought some horses at the Oklahoma ranch <b>that</b> <b>Johnsons</b> father managed, and hired Johnson to get the horses to {{northern}} Arizona (for The Outlaws location shooting), and then to take them on to Hollywood.|$|R

5|$|Family {{tradition}} holds <b>that</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{broke off}} an early marital engagement {{when he was}} about sixteen years old because of his mother's disapproval. Purportedly Johnson vowed revenge for his mother's interference. Despite the fact that the engagement was broken off, a daughter named Celia was born. She was raised by the Johnson family and later married to Wesley Fancher, {{one of the men who}} served in Johnson's regiment at the Battle of the Thames.|$|E

After a short meeting, Johnson was impressed both with the King himself and with their conversation.|$|E

The third was in dispute however, with each fighter's coach convinced they had won the round. Johnson was declared the winner via split decision.|$|E
5|$|In {{the season}} opener against the Chicago Bears, Johnson caught a pass with 31seconds left in {{regulation}} {{in the end zone}} for what looked like a game-winning touchdown.

5|$|Re-elected in 1866, Hayes {{returned}} to the lame-duck session {{to vote for the}} Tenure of Office Act, which ensured <b>that</b> <b>Johnson</b> could not remove administration officials without the Senate's consent.

Hayes continued to vote with the majority in the 40th Congress on the Reconstruction Acts, but resigned in July 1867 to campaign for governor of Ohio.|$|E

5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it would keep him out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season <b>that</b> <b>Johnson</b> was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
5|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1999 for the City of Portland by researchers from Portland State University found <b>that</b> <b>Johnson</b> Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates, {{an important source}} of food for fish and other aquatic life.

5|$|Although Johnson {{had focused}} the {{majority}} of his campaign activities on the New Hampshire primary, he announced on November 29, 2011 that he would no longer campaign there due to his inability to gain traction with less than a month until the primary.

In December, Politico reported <b>that</b> <b>Johnson</b> would quit the Republican primaries and announce his intention to seek the Libertarian Party nomination at a December 28 press conference. He also encouraged his supporters to vote for Ron Paul in 2012 Republican presidential primaries.|$|E
