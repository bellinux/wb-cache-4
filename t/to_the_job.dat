5|$|Behan {{utilized}} his existing {{position and}} his superior political connections to successfully lobby for the position. He also promised Wyatt {{a position as}} his undersheriff if he was appointed over Wyatt. Wyatt withdrew from the political contest and the governor and legislature appointed Behan <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of Cochise County sheriff on February 10, 1881. Behan reneged on his deal with Earp and appointed Harry Woods as undersheriff instead. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because Wyatt Earp used Behan's name to threaten Ike Clanton when Wyatt recovered his stolen horse from Clanton.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the summer}} of 1936, the Canadiens re-hired Cecil Hart to be {{the coach of the}} team. Hart agreed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> on one condition: that the Canadiens bring Morenz back to the team. On September 1, 1936, Morenz once again joined the Canadiens, his {{contract}} being purchased by the team from the Rangers. The Canadiens spent most of the 1936–37 season {{as one of the best}} teams in the NHL; Morenz contributed regularly, occasionally showing the speed that had made him notable at the start of his career. By mid-January, he had 4 goals and 20 points, far better totals than previous years.|$|E
5|$|The SPARS enjoyed {{success in}} the work place, but they also {{suffered}} a degree of intolerance at times. On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would {{make the point that}} the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to see the need for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E
5|$|The initial vigour and {{excitement}} he brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> {{began to fade}} as administration, commuting and office life became tedious. At {{the same time as}} Wilde's interest flagged, the publishers became concerned anew about circulation: sales, at the relatively high price of one shilling, remained low. Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine by letter, he began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly. In October 1889, Wilde had finally found his voice in prose and, {{at the end of the}} second volume, Wilde left The Woman's World. The magazine outlasted him by one issue.|$|E

5|$|Under the Armoury System, a character's {{equipped}} weapon {{determines the}} character class and players may change their class at will by changing weapons. Classes {{are divided into}} four disciplines: Disciples of War, masters of physical combat; Disciples of Magic, practitioners of the magical arts; Disciples of the Hand, crafters and handymen who synthesize and repair items; and Disciples of the Land, gatherers who collect resources from the environment. Certain abilities learned under one class may be equipped and used by other classes. The Job System builds upon the Armoury System for Disciples of War and Magic. In exchange for restricting the range of equippable abilities from other classes, players gain access to powerful skills, magic, weapons, and armor exclusive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> corresponding to that class. These jobs, based on classic Final Fantasy character jobs, are more suited to party-based combat.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, and {{particularly}} after the fourth Test defeat, critics suggested that Walter Robins, {{one of the}} selectors, should captain England to bring a more attacking approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> However, Robins' age counted against him; the selectors were satisfied with Yardley's captaincy in what were difficult circumstances, and retained him for the final Test. In that match, he failed twice with the bat, scoring 7 and 9 as England were humiliated, bowled out for 52 and 188 to lose by an innings. England lost the series 4–0. Yardley managed 150 runs {{at an average of}} 16.66, not passing fifty in a single innings. However, he once again topped the England bowling averages, taking nine wickets at an average of 22.66. Bowes believed that the pressure of captaincy had affected Yardley's batting. Bowes also cast doubt on Yardley's future, stating that other commitments may have prevented his continuing to play cricket much longer.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Muller's career took a new turn. The Dutch government appointed him government commissioner in charge {{of one of the}} main Belgian Refugee Camps in the Netherlands. Muller was charged with the transfer of the camp from a makeshift army encampment in Oldebroek to a proper refugee camp with full provisions in Nunspeet. He took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> with great enthusiasm, but resigned a year later, declaring that he had attained the goals he had set himself on his appointment. Actually the resignation came in a cloud of controversy around his person and policies. At the end of World War I the Dutch prime minister did acknowledge the high quality of Muller's work in setting up the camps and bringing and maintaining order and human dignity under very trying circumstances. Apart from his position as member of the Consular Examinations Commission, this position was the only Dutch government appointment Muller held inside the Netherlands.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims at analyzing <b>the</b> {{influence of}} <b>job</b> motivation, leadership, and corporate culture toward employee job satisfaction, {{and their impact}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corporate performance.

The result of the research has evidenced that job motivation, leadership, and organizational culture are significantly related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> employee’s <b>job</b> satisfaction.

Job motivation is not significantly related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corporate performance influenced by the intervening variable is employee’s job satisfaction.

He recognized that restoring public safety was possible, but reiterated {{that it was a}} difficult and long process for all branches of the government. Among the solutions he proposed was the reconstruction of Nuevo Laredo's social fiber, since he believed that that would keep the younger generations and those suffering from poverty away from the lure of organized crime. Galván admitted that the Nuevo Laredo police force was composed entirely of members of the Mexican Armed Forces, the Federal Police, and Tamaulipas state law enforcement and not by municipal police officers, who had all been suspended for investigation and training. However, he said that the military had a role to play, but that he wanted to see civilian forces step up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> in the future.|$|E
5|$|Under the Armory System, a character's {{equipped}} weapon or crafting tool, {{determines the}} player's character class, {{allowing them to}} switch roles at will.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a single-machine scheduling problem for which both <b>the</b> <b>job</b> processing times and due windows are decision variables {{to be determined}} by the decision maker. <b>The</b> <b>job</b> processing times are controllable as a linear or convex function of the amount of a common continuously divisible resource allocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs,</b> where <b>the</b> resource allocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> can be used in discrete or continuous quantities. We use the common flow allowances due window assignment method to assign due windows <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs.</b> We consider two performance criteria: (i) the total weighted number of early and tardy <b>jobs</b> plus <b>the</b> weighted due window assignment cost, and (ii) the resource consumption cost. For each resource consumption function, <b>the</b> objective is <b>to</b> minimize <b>the</b> first criterion, while keeping the value of the second criterion no greater than a given limit. We analyze the computational complexity, devise pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming solution algorithms, and provide fully polynomial-time approximation schemes and an enhanced volume algorithm to find high-quality solutions quickly for the considered problems. We conduct extensive numerical studies <b>to</b> assess <b>the</b> performance of the algorithms. The computational results show that the proposed algorithms are very efficient in finding optimal or near-optimal solutions. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R
