2500|$|It {{was also}} at the bar that Aykroyd {{introduced}} Belushi to the blues. An interest soon became a fascination, {{and it was not}} long before the two began singing with local blues bands. Jokingly, SNL band leader Howard Shore suggested they call themselves [...] "The Blues Brothers." [...] In an April 1988 interview he gave to the Chicago Sun-Times, Aykroyd said the Blues Brothers act borrowed from Sam & Dave and others; the Sun-Times quoted him as explaining: [...] "Well obviously the duo thing and the dancing, but the hats came from John Lee Hooker. The suits came from the concept <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a jazz player in the 40's, 50's 60's, to look straight, you had to wear a suit." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are always}} with us--I know that--I heard of <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> at Cambridge; {{so was the}} late lord; so is the young viscount." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your mother {{mentions}} <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{three or}} four years older she might perhaps be able to raise you about two thousand dollars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There will be {{time enough}} for <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> safely lodged, said the captain, roughly pulling at the rein, which he had held all the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's very true," [...] replied Mrs. Parkman. [...] "Do {{you hear}} that, William? <b>You</b> must {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{going to change}} the plans without asking my consent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --I {{speak of}} normal natures, said Stephen. You {{also told me}} <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a boy in that charming carmelite school you ate pieces of dried cowdung.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She died on {{the last}} {{plantation}} two months ago; and she died once before <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> working for me last year,' said the planter, who knew something of the ways of nativedom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me, Jack, for interrupting," [...] said Peterkin; [...] "surely {{you must}} be mistaken in that. You've often told me <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a baby you used to howl and roar from morning to--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{exactly does}} it mean to our business, anyway?" [...] he asked. [...] "Does it mean <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a {{representative}} <b>you</b> will not scruple to skewer M. le Marquis?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure they}} would,' rejoined Oliver's benefactress; 'and Mr. Losberne {{has already been}} kind enough to promise <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> well enough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aunt Olivia says <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{going to}} have an {{important}} interview with a man you ought to look your very best," [...] said the Story Girl, giving her skirt a lustrous swirl and enjoying the effect.|$|R
6000|$|... "She died on {{the last}} {{plantation}} two months ago, and she died once before <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> working for me last year," [...] said the planter, who knew something of the ways of nativedom.|$|E
6000|$|... "I could {{swear to}} you in a police-court. What put the lid on it was <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> cutting my wire--and an infernal liberty it was!--I saw that white tuft of yours {{sticking}} out from behind your mask." ...|$|E
6000|$|Kate was indignant. [...] "Well, I like <b>that!</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> the one {{crazy to}} experiment. Of course they're coming, coming to stay to-morrow night, and any one who dares to talk ghosts to her {{will be sent}} to bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY CICELY. Don't <b>you</b> {{understand}} <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{the nephew}} of a great bigwig, and have influential connexions, and good friends among them, lots of things can <b>be</b> done for <b>you</b> that <b>are</b> never done for ordinary ship captains? ...|$|R
50|$|Beware {{of being}} taken in reverse; take care, when placing and making your defences, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> engaged in {{shooting}} the enemy {{to the front}} of your trench, his pal cannot sneak up and shoot you in the back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Busy!" [...] said Elinor. [...] "There must be {{something}} even more unusual than <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> too low spirited to keep up a quarrel with me. Why dont you sit on the easy chair, or sprawl on the ottoman, after your manner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She looked {{round at}} him. [...] "You said {{something}} like <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> delirious," [...] she answered, after a little pause. [...] "It's one of the ideas that you're struggling with. You go on, old man, and talk. We've months--for repetitions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get over it!" [...] she repeated. [...] "Yes, but I {{thought that}} {{that sort of thing}} was at an end. I thought <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a Cabinet Minister no one would dare to treat me as though I were a social nobody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{had been}} {{conscious}} of the truth before, but she had stifled her misgivings insanely, and, as I feel, almost wickedly, pushing on, and saying to herself <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> married, {{then there would be}} no escape, and she must love you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Maxwell {{stood looking}} at his wife with the cold disgust which hysterics are apt to inspire in men after they have seen them more than once. [...] "I suppose <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> ready <b>you</b> will tell me what is the matter with you." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the next}} 5 years (1949-53) Rinpoche had many {{problems}} because he didn’t have any money, {{and had to}} beg for food from his friends. There wasn’t much food but he studied well because of this..."they say <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> hungry your mind is very alert"[...]|$|R
6000|$|... "You have an adorable way {{of making}} {{yourself}} understood," [...] she laughed. [...] "Come, do let us talk sense {{for a minute or}} two. <b>You</b> say <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> with me <b>you</b> <b>are</b> my slave. Then why <b>is</b> it that <b>you</b> do not bring Beatrice here <b>when</b> I beg <b>you</b> to?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{people always}} sigh {{like that when}} they get to be sixteen?" [...] asked Jimmy curiously. [...] "You didn't sigh like <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> only fifteen, Theodora. I wish you wouldn't. It makes me feel funny--and it's not a nice kind of funniness either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear guests," [...] she murmured, [...] "you {{remember}} the condition, the only condition upon which we bestowed our company upon {{one another in}} this benighted place. You remember it was agreed <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> bored, you left without excuse or any foolish apologies. The same to apply to your hostess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you will}} go to heaven, mamma, and why should I not speak of it? You will go to heaven, and yet I suppose you have been very wicked, because we are all very wicked. But you won't be told of your wickedness there. You won't be hated there, because you were this or <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sammy Jay became greatly excited. [...] "There!" [...] he cried! [...] "You heard <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> {{standing}} {{right in front}} of me and talking to me, Jerry Muskrat. You know that I wasn't making a sound! I told you that I hadn't been screaming in the night, and this proves it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would it comfort, {{or would}} it wound {{you to have a}} similar painting? Tell me <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would it be a {{consolation}} to have that memento in your possession? or would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{need not}} {{ask if you}} have slept well," [...] she remarked [...] "for the clocks have sounded nine, and I have been back an hour from market. Here are all your things, and I warrant me <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> dressed in them you will pass {{anywhere}} as a buxom peasant girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, you're {{not afraid}} of snakes yourself, you know, mother," [...] she went on, undismayed. [...] "I {{remember}} papa saying <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> at St. Kitts with him you never minded them a bit, but caught them in your hands like an Indian juggler, and treated them as playthings, so I wasn't afraid either. I suppose it's hereditary." ...|$|E
6000|$|Elizabeth {{really looked}} quite appalled at {{this piece of}} intelligence; and Katherine continued, 'And Chartists, and Socialists, and horrible people, have been lecturing there! I {{remember}} now, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> at Merton Hall in the spring, {{there was a great}} uproar, and the Abbeychurch Reporter behaved very badly to Papa about it. A fine affair you have made of it, indeed, Lizzie!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And then, after <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{riding on}} Revels-day by our house, and the lads were {{gathered}} there, {{and you wanted}} to dismount, when Jim Drake and George Upway and three or four more ran forward to hold your pony, and Felix stood back timid, why did you beckon to him, and say you would rather he held it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is perfect! I won't {{say more}} than <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> praising a person to another who is to know her, it is bad policy to go into details. I won't exaggerate. I simply {{recommend}} her. Among all women I have known she stands alone; she is of a different clay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be stupid!" [...] she replied. [...] "Please {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> with me, at any rate, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in Bohemia and not Belgravia. I don't expect such attentions. I {{rather like}} {{coming up to}} your rooms like this, and I always love the Milan. I really believe that I am your first lady visitor here." ...|$|R
2500|$|Esau was heartbroken by the {{deception}} and begged {{for his own}} blessing. Having made Jacob a ruler over his brothers, Isaac could only promise, [...] "By your sword you shall live, but your brother you shall serve; yet it shall <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> aggrieved, <b>you</b> may cast off his yoke from upon your neck" [...] (27:39–40).|$|R
