5|$|After the hurricane's passage, {{officials}} deployed the Florida National Guard to {{affected areas}} in order <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>order</b> and quell looting. Across Florida, {{a total of}} 3,897people filed damage claims after receiving damage from the hurricane, 80% {{of them in the}} Miami area. Insurance companies paid about $1million to compensate for the storm damage. Due to the loss in citrus crop, prices briefly increased, although they returned to normal levels by late October.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, {{officials}} in Honduras requested international assistance, which totaled $2.8billion over a several year period. Despite this, {{the gross domestic}} product began decreasing at the end of 1998, and contracted by 1.9% in 1999. Officials enacted a widespread curfew following the storm, and for 15days temporarily restricted constitutional rights <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>order.</b> There were outbreaks in various diseases, and many residents faced food and water shortages. Due to the heavy damage, the name Mitch was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming list.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} 2097, {{according}} to the introductory sequence. This sequence also provides {{the history of the}} game’s setting: in 2057, the depletion of Earth’s resources coincided with widening space exploration. After a catastrophic war over ever-declining resources, ending 10 years prior to the events of G-Police, Earth’s governments were stripped of military power. As a result, powerful corporations had exerted control over Earth and the burgeoning space colonies. The Government Police (G-Police) was formed by Earth’s remaining coalition government <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>order</b> in these colonies.|$|E

5|$|As {{the demonstrations}} continued, Ambassador Nolting managed to extract {{theoretical}} concessions from Diệm on 18 May. Diệm agreed a modest compensation package of USD $7000 {{for the families}} of the victims as a conciliatory gesture. Diệm also agreed to dismiss those responsible for the shootings. However, the publicly stated reason for this action was that the officials had failed <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>order,</b> rather than that they had been responsible for the deaths of the protesters. Despite these concessions, Diệm maintained that his government was not responsible for the deaths, resolutely continuing to blame the Việt Cộng. It was enough to satisfy Nolting, who immediately departed for his vacation. His absence allowed the remaining American diplomatic staff led by William Trueheart, Nolting's deputy, to end Nolting's policy of appeasing Diệm.|$|E
5|$|Finally, General Conway {{proposed}} {{what was}} a workable compromise in his opinion: the Fallujah Brigade. Led by former Iraqi Sunni Ba'athists, such as Jasim Mohammed Saleh and Muhammed Latif, and made up largely of insurgents who had been fighting the Marines, the brigade was supposed <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>order</b> in the city while allowing the US to withdraw and save face. On 10 May, General Mattis formally turned the city over and withdrew the following day. The First Battle for Fallujah had resulted in 51 US servicemen killed and 476 wounded. Iraqi losses were much higher. The Marines estimated that about 800 Iraqis were killed. Reports differed on how many were civilians: the Marines counted 300, whereas the independent organization Iraq Body Count argued that 600 civilians had been killed.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days after}} the shootout, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Doc Holliday and the Earps. Wyatt and Holliday were arrested and brought before Justice of the Peace, Wells Spicer. Morgan and Virgil were still {{recovering}} at home. Only Wyatt and Holliday were required to post $10,000 bail, which was paid by their attorney Thomas Fitch, local mine owner E.B. Gage, Wells Fargo undercover agent Fred Dodge, and other business owners appreciative of the Earps' efforts <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>order.</b> Virgil Earp was suspended as town marshal pending {{the outcome of the}} trial. Justice Spicer convened a preliminary hearing on October 31 to determine if there was enough evidence to go to trial.|$|E

He ensures the complete subjugation of Nabradia and Dalmasca and exterminates their royal families in order to acquire their deifacted nethicite. He confronts Dalmasca's resistance movement with absolute ruthlessness, accepting no surrender. He even {{goes so far as to}} murder his own ailing father and frame the Imperial senators, to put an end to their scheming against himself and Larsa, and to level cities in nethicite testing experiments. Vayne's ultimate goal is to free humanity from the control of the Occurians, a race of god-like beings that have for centuries secretly meddled with the course of human history.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 1844, Philadelphia {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} {{that gave the}} city a battalion of artillery, a regiment of infantry {{and at least one}} full troop of cavalry for the purpose of providing the preservation of peace within the city when necessary. The difficulty of quelling the riots and other crime led to the Pennsylvania General Assembly to pass an 1845 act that required Philadelphia, the township of Moyamensing and the unincorporated districts of Spring Garden, Northern Liberties, and Penn to maintain a police force of one man per 150 taxable inhabitants. In 1850, another act was passed that established that the Philadelphia police force would police the city and seven surrounding districts. The inability <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>order</b> effectively in Philadelphia's suburbs would be an important argument for the consolidation of the city in 1854.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{state that}} William the Lion had a royal castle at Urquhart in the 12th century, though Professor Alcock finds no {{evidence}} for this. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Meic Uilleim (MacWilliams), descendents of Malcolm III, staged a series of rebellions against David I and his successors. The last of these rebellions was put down in 1229, and <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>order</b> Alexander II granted Urquhart to his Hostarius (usher or door-ward), Thomas de Lundin. On de Lundin's death {{a few years later}} it passed to his son Alan Durward. It is considered likely that the original castle was built soon after this time, centred on the motte at the south-west of the site. In 1275, after Alan's death, the king granted Urquhart to John II Comyn, Lord of Badenoch.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian Revolution {{broke out}} on 25 August 1830, after the {{performance}} of a nationalist opera (La muette de Portici) in Brussels led to a minor insurrection among the capital's bourgeoisie, who sang patriotic songs and captured some public buildings in the city. This early revolutionary group was swelled by a large number of urban workers. The following day, the revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by that of the Brabant Revolution of 1789. <b>To</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>order,</b> several bourgeois militia groups were formed. The situation in Brussels led to widespread unrest across the country. William I rejected his son's advice to negotiate with the rebels, forcing them towards a more radical, pro-independence stance, and sent a large military force to Brussels suppress the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|The Italians {{handed over}} the {{administration}} of eastern Herzegovina to the NDH government on 20 May 1941, following {{the signing of the}} Treaties of Rome, which ceded formerly Yugoslav territory along the Adriatic coast to Italy. The Italians did not immediately withdraw all their troops from the region. The NDH moved quickly to establish its authority in the towns and districts of eastern Herzegovina, which included appointing mayors and prefects, the creation of local units of the Ustaše Militia, and deploying hundreds of gendarmes, Croatian Home Guards and Ustaše Militia units from outside eastern Herzegovina. These forces were brought in <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>order.</b> The academic Professor Alija Šuljak was appointed the Ustaše commissioner for eastern Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} of the United States was also influenced by the Monroe Doctrine, a philosophy of foreign policy articulated by James Monroe in 1823, and which justified the maintenance of US hegemony in the region. The stated aim of the doctrine was <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>order</b> and stability and {{to make certain that}} access to resources and markets was not limited. The historian Mark Gilderhus states that the doctrine also contained racially condescending language, which likened Latin American countries to fighting children. The US government did not need to engage in military interventions in Guatemala to enforce this hegemony, given the presence of military rulers friendly to the US; nevertheless, the doctrine was used to justify the coup in 1954.|$|E

5|$|As Boyd took off, another C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel John Delmore {{closed in}} on Khâm Đức. At an {{altitude}} of about 300 to 400 feet, Delmore's aircraft began to receive North Vietnamese fire, and {{both sides of the}} cockpit were opened up by bullets that had ripped through the floorboards. Subsequently, just before touch down, Delmore and his co-pilot shut down the engine and forced the aircraft to remain upright. With no brakes and little directional control, the aircraft crashed into the CH-47 that had been destroyed early in the morning, but Delmore managed to turn his aircraft off the runway to avoid blocking it. When the aircraft had stopped completely, the five-man crew got out as quickly as they could. About 20 minutes later, U.S. soldiers on the ground guided them to safety, and they were rescued by a U.S. Marine CH-46. After witnessing the destruction of two C-130 Hercules, Lieutenant Colonel Franklin Montgomery landed his C-130 and extracted more than 150 Vietnamese civilians, and some CIDG and U.S. soldiers. Montgomery's aircraft suffered no hits, but the loadmaster was knocked down and trampled by panic-stricken Vietnamese civilians whilst trying <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the force}} {{was called in}} to manage {{industrial}} disputes on a range of occasions between 1887 and 1906. In the mining town of Lethbridge, for example, the Alberta Railway and Coal Company locked out its workforce in 1894 during an attempt to cut staff and reduce wages; a team of ten police was deployed <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>order,</b> in particular any risks posed by eastern European immigrants, and to mediate in the dispute. Police deployed there again in 1906 for nine months during a dispute between the company, now called the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company, and the workforce over union recognition, pay and working conditions. A team of 82 regular police were reinforced by 11 special constables recruited from within the company, with an undercover constable deployed to infiltrate the strike and send back intelligence. Efforts were made to collect information on the earnings of the union leaders, probably intended for use in discrediting them. The police maintained order and escorted non-striking workers past the picket lines.|$|E
5|$|By noon, {{the rebels}} of the 108th Infantry Regiment were {{approaching}} Bjelovar, and {{were joined by}} elements of the 42nd Infantry Regiment and other units of the division. The leader of the rebels in Bjelovar was Kapetan Ivan Mrak, a reserve aviator. When 4th Army commander Armijski đeneral Petar Nedeljković {{became aware of the}} rebels' approach, he ordered the local gendarmerie commander <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>order,</b> but was advised this would not be possible, as local gendarmerie conscripts would not report for duty. His headquarters reported the presence of the rebels to the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, suggesting that the Royal Yugoslav Air Force could bomb the rebel units. The 8th Bomber Regiment at Rovine was even warned to receive orders to use its Bristol Blenheim Mk I light bombers to bomb the 108th Infantry Regiment, but the idea was subsequently abandoned. Instead, it was decided to request that the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, Vladko Maček intervene with the rebels.|$|E
