5|$|It is {{not known}} when cacti were first cultivated. Opuntias (prickly pears) were used {{for a variety of}} {{purposes}} by the Aztecs, whose empire, lasting from the 14th to the 16th century, had a complex system of horticulture. Their capital from the 15th century was Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City); one explanation for the origin of the name is that it includes the Nahuatl word nōchtli, referring to the fruit of an opuntia. The coat of arms of Mexico shows an eagle perched on a cactus while holding a snake, an image {{at the center of the}} myth of the founding of Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs symbolically linked <b>the</b> <b>ripe</b> red fruits of an opuntia to human hearts; just as the fruit quenches thirst, so offering human hearts to the sun god ensured the sun would keep moving.|$|E
5|$|Figs have {{complicated}} inflorescences called syconia. Flowers {{are entirely}} contained within an enclosed structure. Their only {{connection with the}} outside is through a small pore called ostiole. Monoecious figs like F. aurea have {{both male and female}} flowers within the syconium. Female flowers mature first. Once mature, they produce a volatile chemical attractant. Female wasps squeeze their way through the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they pollinate the flowers, lay their eggs in some of them, and die. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. After four to seven weeks (in F. aurea), adult wasps emerge. Males emerge first, mate with the females, and cut exit holes through the walls of the fig. The male flowers mature around {{the same time as the}} female wasps emerge. The newly emerged female wasps actively pack their bodies with pollen from the male flowers before leaving through the exit holes the males have cut and fly off to find a syconium in which to lay their eggs. Over the next one to five days, figs ripen. <b>The</b> <b>ripe</b> figs are eaten by various mammals and birds which disperse the seeds.|$|E
5|$|Parasites {{can also}} be {{aggressive}} mimics, though the situation is somewhat different from those outlined previously. Some predators have a feature that draws prey; parasites can also mimic their host's natural prey, but are eaten themselves, a pathway into their host. Leucochloridium, a genus of flatworm, matures in the digestive system of songbirds, their eggs then passing out of the bird in the faeces. They are then taken up by Succinea, a terrestrial snail. The eggs develop in this intermediate host, and must then find a suitable bird to mature in. Since the host birds do not eat snails, the sporocyst has another strategy to reach its host's intestine. They are brightly coloured and move in a pulsating fashion. A sporocyst-sac pulsates in the snail's eye stalks, coming to resemble an irresistible meal for a songbird. In this way, it can {{bridge the gap between}} hosts, allowing it to complete its life cycle. A nematode (Myrmeconema neotropicum) changes the colour of the abdomen of workers of the canopy ant Cephalotes atratus to make it appear like <b>the</b> <b>ripe</b> fruits of Hyeronima alchorneoides. It also changes the behaviour of the ant so that the gaster (rear part) is held raised. This presumably increases the chances of the ant being eaten by birds. The droppings of birds are collected by other ants and fed to their brood, thereby helping to spread the nematode.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{personal}} mythology of Robert Graves, Persephone {{is not only the}} younger self of Demeter, she is in turn also one of three guises of the Triple Goddess– Kore (the youngest, the maiden, signifying green young grain), Persephone (in the middle, the nymph, signifying <b>the</b> <b>ripe</b> grain waiting to be harvested), and Hecate (the eldest of the three, the crone, the harvested grain), which to a certain extent reduces the name and role of Demeter to that of group name.

25|$|An aronia wine {{is made in}} Lithuania. In Poland, aronia berries are dried to make an {{herbal tea}} {{sometimes}} blended with other ingredients, such as blackcurrant. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the berries are sold fresh and frozen or made into juices, jams and teas. Aronia is also used as a flavoring or colorant for beverages or yogurts. Juice from <b>the</b> <b>ripe</b> berries is astringent, semi-sweet (moderate sugar content), sour (low pH), and contains {{a low level of}} vitamin C. The berries have a tart flavor and, in addition to juice, can be baked into breads. In the United States and Canada, aronia juice concentrate is used in manufactured juice blends.|$|E
25|$|There is {{not much}} vintage {{variation}} due to the reliability of favorable weather with little risk of summer time frost or harvest time rains. The main exception, again, is Casablanca {{due in part to}} its proximity to the Pacific. For the Chilean wine regions in the Valle Central, the Andes and Coastal Ranges create a rain shadow effect which traps the warm arid air in the region. At night, cool air comes into the area from the Andes which dramatically drops the temperature. This help maintain high levels of acidity to go with <b>the</b> <b>ripe</b> fruit that grapes develop with the long hours of uninterrupted sunshine that they get during the day. The result is a unique profile of flavonoids in the wine which some Chilean wineries claim make Chilean wines higher in resveratrol and antioxidants. Harvest typically begins at the end of February for varieties like Chardonnay with some red wine varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon being picked in April and Carmenère sometimes staying on the vine into May.|$|E

500|$|The sexes {{are usually}} {{separate}} in bivalves but some hermaphroditism is known. The gonads are located {{close to the}} intestines, and either open into the nephridia, or through a separate pore into the mantle cavity. <b>The</b> <b>ripe</b> gonads of male and females release sperm and eggs into the water column. Spawning may take place continually or be triggered by environmental factors such as day length, water temperature, or the presence of sperm in the water.

Mass spawning events sometimes take place when all the bivalves in an area synchronise their release of spawn.|$|E

500|$|Several of the book's episodes {{have drawn}} {{attention}} for the insight they offer into the culture, structure and conflicts of traditional society before 1900. Commenting on this characteristic, Djuvara asserted: [...] "even {{if we take}} into account that the grown-up will embellish, transfigure, 'enrich' the memories of his childhood, how could we not recognize the sincerity in Creangă's heart-warming evocation of his childhood's village?" [...] The book stays true to life in depicting ancient customs: discussing the impact of paganism on traditional Romanian customs, Marcu Beza communicated a detail of Creangă's account, which shows how January 1 celebrations of Saint Basil opposed the loud buhai players reenacting a fertility rite to people preferring a quieter celebration. The work also offers details on the traditional roles of a rural society such as that of Humulești, in the context of social change. Muguraș Constantinescu highlights the important roles of old men and women within Nică's universe, and especially that of his grandfather and [...] "clan leader" [...] David Creangă. The latter, she notes, is an [...] "enlightened man" [...] displaying [...] "the wisdom and balance of <b>the</b> <b>ripe</b> age", a person able to insist on the importance of education, and a churchgoer who frowns on [...] "his wife's bigotry." [...] The seniors' regulatory role within the village is evidenced throughout the book, notoriously so in the episode where the boy captures a hoopoe who bothers his morning sleep, only to be tricked into releasing it by old man, who understands the bird's vital role as village alarm clock.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of carotenoids, both qualitative and quantitative, during 3 stages of ripening of mango {{has been studied}} using chromatographic, spectroscopic and chemical methods.

The present study showed there were 15, 14 and 17 different carotenoids in <b>the</b> unripe, partially <b>ripe</b> and fully ripe mangoes, respectively. Even though phytofluene (39. 26 %) was the major carotenoid in <b>the</b> partially <b>ripe</b> mango, β-carotene constituted the major carotenoid in the unripe (37. 47 %) and fully ripe mango (50. 64 %). cis-β-Carotene was present only in <b>the</b> fully <b>ripe</b> mango. Only <b>the</b> unripe mango contained ζ-carotene, whereas γ-carotene was present in all the 3 stages of ripening.
