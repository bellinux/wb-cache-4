2500|$|In January 2012, <b>Terry</b> <b>Anderson</b> {{established}} {{a company called}} Autonomous Tractor Corporation (ATC) located in North Dakota. The SPIRIT driverless tractor {{is a product of}} ATC. Anderson thought tractors were getting bigger and more expensive while not improving in quality. He thus came out of retirement to create the SPIRIT. The tractors Anderson helped create were initially made to follow a main tractor (that has a driver) but are now moving towards independent functioning. [...] Anderson tested half-scale models of his automated tractor design at his second home in Texas. He presented his model at the Big Iron Farm Show in September 2012. Anderson stated that his goal is to build 25 units of his automated tractor in 2013 and sell them at a discount price for farmers to test.|$|E
