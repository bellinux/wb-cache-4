5000|$|Allatius was {{a natural}} apologist for the Eastern communions in Eastern Europe, {{convinced}} {{as he was in}} himself that in the acts of union neither reasons of faith nor of doctrine were fundamental to the succession of the bishops, only a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdictions,</b> and he seems really to have believed that the [...] "Latin faith" [...] and the [...] "Greek faith" [...] were identical and that under [...] "Roman obedience" [...] they could still be Orthodox. So he argued in his contribution to the mid-17th century Uniate pamphlet De Ecclesiae occidentalis atque orientalis perpetua consensione libri tres ("The Western and Eastern Churches in perpetual Agreement, in Three Books") (1648). Such notions led to the final stipulations that the Eastern Churches were not to be merged with the Catholic Church but would retain their own hierarchical independence and traditional rituals.|$|R

(Previous anti-lynching bills had also failed to pass the Senate, which was dominated by the South since its disenfranchisement of blacks {{at the turn of the}} century.) A third proposal, a bill to permit a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> if a defendant believed he or she could not get a fair trial because of race or religion, was passed by a later Congress.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{motivating}} {{factors for}} the creation of the Manila Board of Health was traditional belief that the maintenance of public health required the isolation of cases of leprosy {{from the rest of the}} public.

On October 27, 1902 the Second Philippine Commission appropriated an initial $50,000 for the establishment of Culion under the Secretary of Interior Dean C. Worcester and Director of Health Victor G. Heiser. On August 22, 1904, Luke E.

5000|$|The Court's {{jurisdiction}} over disputed electoral returns {{can be traced}} to the practices of the United Kingdom Parliament. Until 1604, disputed returns were decided by the King in Chancery. From 1604 to 1868, the British House of Commons exercised the jurisdiction. The Grenville Act 1770 (UK) provided for the determination of disputes by a Select Committee of the House of Commons. Later, a committee of 11 members were chosen by ballot to report their decision to the House. In essence, the parliament had the jurisdiction to determine whether a person had been properly elected, rather than the Courts. In 1868, the Parliamentary Elections Act 1868 (UK) was passed conferring jurisdiction on two judges of the Queen's Bench. The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> from Parliament to the courts was hastened by a concern with the partisanship of Parliament in ruling on electoral disputes.|$|E

50|$|The Court's {{jurisdiction}} over disputed electoral returns {{can be traced}} to the practices of the United Kingdom Parliament. There were disputes between the Chancery Court and the House of Commons as to which body had the authority to determine who was rightly elected to Parliament. In 1770, the Grenville Act 1770 (UK) established a form of jury system in which a Select Committee of the House of Commons handled the determination of these disputes. Later, a committee of 11 members was chosen by ballot to report their decision to the House. In 1868, the Parliamentary Elections Act 1868 (UK) was passed conferring jurisdiction on two judges of the Queen's Bench to determine these issues. The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> from Parliament to the courts was hastened by a concern with the partisanship of Parliament in ruling on electoral disputes.
