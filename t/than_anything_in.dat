500|$|Following their {{successful}} partnership on All Things Must Pass in 1970, Harrison and co-producer Phil Spector {{turned their}} attention to resurrecting the career of Spector's wife Ronnie, formerly lead singer of the Ronettes. Since the break-up of the Ronettes in 1967, Ronnie Spector's only musical release had been [...] "You Came, You Saw, You Conquered", a 1969 single on A Records. Her signing to the Beatles' Apple record label was a condition of Phil Spector's deal with the company, one that Harrison and Lennon, as avowed fans of the Ronettes, were happy to honour. The plan was to produce a comeback album, with Harrison providing many of the songs, and issue it on Apple Records. In his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Williams quotes music publisher Paul Case as having said during this period: [...] "Phil wants a hit record with Ronnie again more <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the world. I think he'd give up all his worldly possessions for that." ...|$|E
500|$|The early {{screening}} of the first episode at New York Comic Con was met by a very positive reaction from the crowd. George Marston of Newsarama gave the first episode a 10 out of 10, saying the season [...] "strikes a balance between self-aware noir and Marvel’s first flirtations with psychological horror....not just another hit for Marvel and Netflix, but a landmark moment for female superheroes on TV." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN felt that [...] "Jessica Jones starts out with a strong premiere episode that...easily goes further <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the MCU in terms of sexuality." [...] He called Ritter [...] "a commendably tough, sardonic" [...] Jessica Jones and praised the supporting cast for the strong impressions they made, later scoring the episode an 8.5 out of 10. Evan Valentine of Collider.com gave the episode 5 stars out of 5, feeling that Tennant would [...] "ascend to {{the same level as}} Tom Hiddleston’s Loki and Vincent D'Onofrio’s Wilson Fisk as one of the cornerstones of villainy in the MCU". Katharine Trendacosta of io9 also had positive thoughts on [...] "AKA Ladies Night", highlighting the episode's use of light and color, especially with purple, and the way it portrays New York as how it [...] "actually looks—not overly bright and shiny and clean, but not suffering a never-ending power-outage either". Abraham Riesman noted the episode's presentation of sexuality, which [...] "was shockingly and refreshingly honest", compared to Marvel's other films and television series. He concluded by applauding the season's bringing up of the topics of rape and PTSD.|$|E
500|$|One {{day in the}} mid-1990s, Smith was at {{her home}} talking {{to one of her}} {{daughter}}s on the phone. After telling her mother {{what she was going to}} that night, her daughter asked Smith what her plans for that night were. Because she did not have anything fun planned, Smith lied so her daughter wouldn't have to worry about her. After the conversation ended, Smith realized that she didn't need her own children worrying about her at the start of their adult lives and decided that it was time to return to her career. With country artist Marty Stuart (whom she later married in 1997), acting as the album's main producer, Smith signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1996. Although the label preferred her to record an album of duets, Smith decided to go by her own terms and record a solo studio album. In October 1998 she released her second self-titled studio album. Consisting of ten tracks, nine of them were co-written by both Smith and Stuart. Although the album attracted little attention, it was given high critical praise for its traditional and contemporary style. Kurt Wolff of the book Country Music: The Rough Guide commented that the album sounded [...] "far gutsier <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the Reba and Garth mainstream". Thom Jurek of Allmusic gave the release four out of five stars, calling it [...] "a solid effort", also commenting, [...] "...it stands head and shoulders over most of the stuff that's come out of Nash Vegas in over a decade. Even if it doesn't sell a copy, it's a triumphant return for Smith. She hasn't lost a whit of her gift as a singer or as a writer." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1784 Catherine ordered {{construction}} of a country residence for her grandson, Alexander. The name, Pella Palace, invoked the memories of Alexander the Great and Pella, the capital of ancient Macedon. The message was clear: Alexander, then seven years old, was the new ruler, although legally Paul remained first in line for succession. Pella, designed by Ivan Starov, was the largest Russian imperial palace of the period, and more complex in composition <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> Russia. The core palace was encircled with twenty four smaller buildings in Palladian style connected with double-colonnaded galleries. Catherine called Pella [...] "rising phoenix", alluding to Alexander's ascension to power after her own death.|$|E

2500|$|As a German Romantic opera, Die Feen imitated {{the musical}} style of Carl Maria von Weber. According to Danilo Prefumo's notes {{to one of}} the {{recordings}} available, it also showed the influence of Italian opera, grand opera and opéra comique. On the other hand, Alan Blyth, Gramophone's regular Wagner reviewer, sees both Weber and Marschner as influences but says that, by avoiding the aping of Italian opera in Das Liebesverbot and of grand opera in Rienzi, the result was an opera more stylistically unified than its successors. [...] "The later works may contain individual passages that are more 'advanced' <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the youthfully imitative ways of Die Feen, but as entities they are less satisfying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nationally {{known and}} local writers have {{frequently}} remarked on the solitude and visual appeal of Church in the Wood.

[...] A description from 1874 stated simply that [...] "the Church is picturesquely situated in the heart of a romantic wood, having no hut or house of any kind within a quarter of a mile". [...] Diplock's Hastings Guidebook of 1845 stated [...] "t is the singularity of [...] situation, more <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the building itself, that generally attracts visitors ... it looks as if having been forsaken by all human visitants, a thicket had grown up and enclosed it like the Castle of the Sleeping Beauty in the old fairy tale".

2500|$|He (Rousseau's tiger) {{is derived}} from a motif found in the {{drawings}} and paintings of Eugène Delacroix. It was claimed, either by Rousseau himself or by his friends and admirers, that he had experienced life in the jungle during his time in Mexico in 1860, where he {{had served as a}} regimental bandsman. In fact he never left France, and it is thought that his inspiration came from the botanical gardens of Paris, such as the Jardin des Plantes (which included zoological galleries with taxidermy specimens of exotic animals), and from prints and books. The fin de siècle French populace was captivated by exotic and dangerous subjects, such as the perceived savagery of animals and peoples of distant lands (Morris & Green, 49–60). Tigers on the prowl had been the subject of an exhibition at the 1885 École des Beaux-Arts. Emmanuel Frémiet's [...] of 1887 depicting a gorilla carrying a woman exuded more savagery <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> Rousseau's canvases, yet was found acceptable as art; Rosseau's poor immediate reception therefore seems the result of his style and not his subject matter [...] (Morris & Green, 143).|$|E

2500|$|A {{conservative}} {{contributor to}} Ain't it Cool News said the film featured [...] "ingenious comedy that we remember from Airplane!" [...] and was [...] "funny and inventive." [...] Kathleen Parker of Washington Post Writers Group described {{the film as}} [...] " [...] The Best Movie You Ever Saw, but it’s something. It’s radical in its assault on the left wing; it’s brave given the risk of peer ridicule {{and the potential for}} career suicide. And it’s funny — if you like that sort of thing. Generally, I don’t." [...] Michael Brendan Doherty of The American Conservative considered the movie to be funny [...] "in parts", but concluded that [...] "Far from lampooning the Left, “Carol” insults conservatives by presuming that they are so simple as to be won over by fat jokes and flatulence. But the audience, imagining itself to be persecuted by Hollywood, is so grateful to be flattered by Zucker and company that they chuckle obediently at every cheap laff." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the movie one star out of five, called it [...] "jaw-droppingly awful," [...] and [...] "about as not-funny as a comedy can get." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote, [...] "Even if it weren't three years too late to parody Moore (ineptly played by Kevin Farley), Moore's ridiculous tribute to Cuban health care in Sicko is far funnier <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> this desperately laughless farce from David Zucker." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Gaskell {{repeated}} Charlotte's {{words about}} Anne in The Life of Charlotte Brontë, {{claiming that the}} subject of The Tenant [...] "was painfully discordant to one who would fain have sheltered herself from all but peaceful and religious ideas". In his essay on Emily Brontë, Algernon Charles Swinburne briefly mentioned The Tenant {{in the context of}} Branwell's decline as a novel [...] "which deserves perhaps a little more notice and recognition than it has ever received" [...] and added that [...] "as a study of utterly flaccid and invertebrate immorality it bears signs of more faithful transcription from life <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights". [...] Margaret Oliphant believed that Anne [...] "would have no right to be considered at all as a writer but for her association with [...] imperative spirits". Mary Ward, a novelist, who was widely known for her anti-feminist views, in her introduction to 1900 edition of The Tenant, accused Anne of [...] "the narrowness of view" [...] and absence of [...] "some subtle, innate correspondence between eye and brain, between brain and hand, [...] was present in Emily and Charlotte". She concluded that [...] "it is not as the writer of 'Wildfell Hall', but as the sister of Charlotte and Emily Brontë, that Anne Brontë escapes oblivion". May Sinclair, while famously saying that [...] "when [...] slammed the door of Mrs. Huntingdon's bedroom she slammed it in the face of society and all existing moralities and conventions", considered that she [...] "had no genius". Sinclair wrote about The Tenant: [...] "There are scenes, there are situations, in Anne's amazing novel, which for sheer audacity stand alone in mid-Victorian literature, and which would hold their own in the literature of revolt that followed... Her diagnosis of certain states, her realization of certain motives, suggests Balzac rather than any of the Brontës". In her introduction to the 1914 edition of the novel Sinclair was also ambivalent about Anne and her novel — while acclaiming it as [...] "the first presentment of that Feminist novel", she stated that [...] "it bores to tears". Her opinion of Helen was also mixed: [...] "If Agnes Grey is a little prig, Helen Huntingdon is a prig enormous... She is Anne Bronte's idea of noble womanhood, the first of the modern, large-souled, intellectual heroines".|$|E
