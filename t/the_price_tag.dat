Construction of the new facility was planned to start in 2005, costing $7 million. When construction bids were higher than expected, <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> went up to $8 million and the project was postponed to allow for planning to reduce costs. Construction started in late November 2006 after price concerns had been resolved. The building opened in early December 2007, with a total cost of $7.5 million. It was dedicated one day before the two-year anniversary of Gordon Parks's death. He died on March 7, 2006; the building was dedicated on March 6, 2008.|$|E

After Florida and Georgia accepted the renovations, agreeing to play the rivalry game in Athens, Georgia during the renovations, Jacksonville investors proposed expanding the renovation plan in order to attract a National Football League team. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> was revised upward—to $121 million—and the city successfully attracted a team. Shortly after Jacksonville was awarded its new franchise—the Jacksonville Jaguars—the final plans were unveiled.

25|$|In July 1954, the AERE was reorganised {{into the}} United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). Modifications to Harwell's Hangar 7 {{in order to}} house the machine began that year. Despite its {{advanced}} design, <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> was modest: about US$1million. By late 1956 {{it was clear that}} ZETA was going to come online in mid-1957, beating the Model C stellarator and the newest versions of the Perhapsatron and Columbus. Because these projects were secret, based on the little information available the press concluded they were versions of the same conceptual device, and that the British were far ahead in the race to produce a working machine.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the Logan branded as Renault Tondar 90 {{began to}} be marketed in Iran by Renault-Pars, {{manufactured}} by Pars Khodro and Iran Khodro.

Forty-nine percent of Renault Pars' shares is jointly held by Iran's Industrial Development and Renovation Organization, IKCO and Saipa Group. The company was established in 2003. In 2010, Pars Khodro started to produce CNG Tondar 90s which can run on both petrol and CNG. Pars Khodro stopped producing CNG models in 2012. In 2013 IKCO started to produce Tondar 90s with automatic gearbox. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> is about 3,400 dollars. IKCO also made the Tondar 90 comply with Euro IV standards.|$|E

25|$|Constructing the {{replacement}} Tacoma Narrows Bridge was delayed {{for nearly a}} decade primarily due to the demand on steel created by World War II, {{and the fact that the}} state had trouble arranging insurance for the new span. On April 30, 1947, Governor Mon Wallgren had announced that insurance had finally been arranged. It wasn't until August 1947 that Washington finally requested bids for the construction, and by that time, <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> for construction went from $8.5 million (US$ in present terms) to $11.2 million (US$ in present terms). On October 15, the state opened bids for the construction, with Bethlehem Pacific Steel Corporation bidding $8,263,904 (US$ in present terms) on construction of the superstructure, and John A. Roebling's Sons Company of San Francisco bidding $2,932,681 (US$ in present terms) for the construction of the suspension cable system.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 the RDAF {{requested}} {{information about}} the possible procurement of a replacement for the F-16 fighter aircraft from the producers of the Gripen, Rafale, Eurofighter and Joint Strike Fighter, to which the RDAF has been a partner since 1997. Due to this fact Rafale-producer, Dassault Aviation, decided {{not to participate in}} the information round as they considered it to be biased towards the JSF option. This also led to the withdrawal of the Eurofighter in 2007, reentering in 2012. Meanwhile, the Boeing F-18 Super Hornet entered the competition in 2008. After several delays, a request for binding information was sent to the four candidates in April 2014 expecting a final decision in mid-2015. On 9 June 2016, the Danish Defence Committee agreed to purchase 27 F-35As to succeed the F-16. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> is 3 billion USD.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Guilford Rail System {{purchased}} the D {{as part of}} a plan to operate a larger regional railroad from Maine and New Brunswick in the east, to New York City and the Midwest in the west, Montreal in the north, and the Philadelphia/Washington, D.C. area in the south. For only $500,000, Guilford {{purchased the}} entire railroad. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> reflected the horrid financial shape and the condition of the physical plant. At the time of the purchase, the D had little freight traffic, relying on Federal and State money to keep operating. Guilford's plans for expanded service did not come to fruition, and after two intense labor strikes, Guilford declared the D bankrupt in 1988, abandoning its operation.

25|$|Despite {{unmatched}} {{advantage in}} speed, the maglev has not gained widespread use in China's high-speed rail network {{due to high}} cost, German refusal to share technology and concerns about safety. <b>The</b> <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> of the Shanghai Maglev {{was believed to be}} $1.3billion and was partially financed by the German government. The refusal of the Transrapid Consortium to share technology and source production in China made large-scale maglev production much more costly than high-speed train technology for conventional lines. Finally, residents living along the proposed maglev route have raised health concerns about noise and electromagnetic radiation emitted by the trains, despite an environmental assessment by the Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences saying the line was safe. These concerns have prevented the construction of the proposed extension of the maglev to Hangzhou. Even the more modest plan to extend the maglev to Shanghai's other airport, Hongqiao, has stalled. Instead, a conventional subway line was built to connect the two airports, and a conventional high-speed rail line was built between Shanghai and Hangzhou.|$|E
25|$|Both {{countries}} {{signed a}} defence deal worth $2.9 billion during President Putin's visit to India in December 2012. The 42 new Sukhois, {{to be produced}} under licence by defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics, will add to the 230 Sukhois earlier contracted from Russia. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> for the 272 Sukhois - three of the over 170 inducted till now have crashed - stands at over $12 billion. The medium-lift Mi-17 V5 helicopters (59 for IAF and 12 for home ministry/BSF) will add to the 80 such choppers already being inducted under a $1.34 billion deal inked in 2008. The value of India's defence projects with Russia will further zoom north after the imminent inking of the final design contract for the joint development of a futuristic stealth fifth-generation fighter. This R contract is itself pegged at US$11 billion, to be shared equally by the two countries. So if India inducts over 200 of these 5th Gen fighters, as it hopes to do from 2022 onwards, the overall cost of this gigantic project for India will come to around US$35 billion since each of the jets will come for upwards of US$100 million at least.|$|E
25|$|Significant cost {{increases}} {{led to the}} project being mothballed by the George H. W. Bush administration. The General Services Administration refused to sign the draft lease, arguing that the building's rental costs were too high and would cost (rather than save) the government $18 million to $24 million a year. Although Pei Cobb Freed agreed to investigate design changes to make the project less costly, at least one member of Congress declared the project dead. In September 1990, the architectural team made changes which cut $82 million from {{the cost of the}} building (including the elimination of two theaters, scaling down the reception hall, using plaster rather than stone, substituting aluminum for bronze in the trim, and reducing the size of interior doors), reducing <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> to $656 million. Delta Partnership, a development consortium led by New York developer William Zeckendorf, Jr., was chosen to operate the building and lease it to the government. Another design change came in January 1991, when the number of parking spaces rose by 12.6 percent to 2,500 spaces. But the changes did not resolve the controversies enveloping the project. Design committee member Donald A. Brown quit the committee in late 1991, complaining that the Bush administration was meddling in the project's design. Two days later, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.'s delegate to Congress, repeated these charges. On January 19, 1992, even as the foundation for the trade center was being dug, the GSA said the building would not achieve financial self-sufficiency. A separate report commissioned by the Bush administration reached similar conclusions. On January 25, 1992, the Bush administration cancelled the international trade center construction project. Days later, a United States district court ruled that Delta Partnership had been chosen in violation of federal contracting guidelines, although the court also refused to overturn the award after finding no bias in the award process. Construction experts decried the decision, saying that the building's costs could balloon to more than $1.2 billion if construction were resumed at a later time.|$|E

25|$|Registration 1 {{sold for}} £7.25million {{and is the}} highest price paid for a plate – in the United Arab Emirates. It was {{purchased}} by Abu Dhabi businessman Saeed Abdul Ghaffar Khouri in 2008. As of 2014, the registration 25O broke a new record of being the highest priced plate sold at a DVLA auction. Registration 25O was purchased for £518,000 by Ferrari dealer John Collins in 2014; the plate now sits pride of place on a Ferrari 250 SWB once owned by rock star Eric Clapton. Registration F1 and RAC3R have been considered as the most desirable plates amongst supercar and Formula One fanatics. The registration RAC3R is a suffix style plate that was issued {{in the same year}} British racing driver James Hunt won the Formula One World Championship in 1976. The plate covers an endless list of all the different forms of racing, making it extremely desirable. Since there has been a big fuss over race related plates the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency has made a racer game for motorists to celebrate the huge profits made from the sales of private plates. The celebration took place at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2010. Unlike horse racing, Formula One racing has become more popular in the last few years, hence why the F1 plate was always going to sell well. On 25 January 2008 the registration F1 sold for £440,000 to Bradford Car design entrepreneur Afzal Kahn. The plate was previously owned and sold by Essex County Council and was sold to raise money for training young drivers. Today the F1 plate has a valuation less than the winning bid with <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>tag</b> stagnating on that particular plate. Originally the plate was affixed in 1904 to the Panhard et Levassor of the then County Surveyor. Previously, a few months before the F1 plate was purchased, the S1 plate sold for £397,500 at an auction in September 2007 by an anonymous buyer making it the second most expensive number plate ever sold in the UK. The S1 plate was originally owned by Sir John H A MacDonald, the Lord Kingsburgh and was Edinburgh's first ever number plate. Within the space of two years the S1 plate sold for £65,500 more than the M1 plate that sold at auction in Goodwood on 7 July 2006. Registrations 1D VIP1 51NGH K1NGS and 1O are also marked as considerably expensive plates that have sold publicly in excess of six figures.|$|E
