60|$|For {{the next}} few days {{accordingly}} Frank was all agog with this new excitement. He was running about all over the summit from morning till night, deeply engaged in the mysteries of tent-pegging, and absorbed in discussions of level, <b>theodolite,</b> <b>telescope,</b> and spectrum analysis. He was proud to display his knowledge of the volcano to his new friends. He showed the first lieutenant every path and gully round that terrific crater: leaped horrible fissures, yawning over abysses of liquid flame, with the junior midshipman; and made the good-humoured and easy-going sailors teach him marvellous knots, or instruct him in the art and science of splicing. As for me, I hobbled about lamely on my crutches as well as I could, envying him the ease with which he did it all, and longing for the time when I too might get about up and down the crater on my own two legs, without let or hindrance.|$|E
40|$|A {{moving target}} should be missing from a {{photoelectric}} theodolite tracker, when {{the clouds and}} other special conditions encountered {{in the course of}} a theodolite tracking a moving object, and this condition should cause the interruption of tracking process. In view of this problem, an algorithm based on the frame of parameter identification and rolling prediction to trajectory was presented to predicting the target trajectory when it missing. Firstly, the article makes a specification of photoelectric theodolite and it operating mechanism detailed. The reasons of flying target imaging disappear from the field of <b>theodolite</b> <b>telescope</b> and the traditional solution to this problem, the least square curve fitting of trajectory quadratic function of time, were narrated secondly. The algorithm based on recursive least square with forget factor, identify the parameters of target motion using the data of position from single theodolite, then the forecasting trajectory of moving targets was presented afterwards,in the filtering approach of past data rolling smooth with the weight of last procedure. By simulation with tracking moving targets synthetic corner from a real tracking routine of photoelectric theodolite, the algorithm was testified, and the simulation of curve fitting a quadratic function of time was compared at the last part. © COPYRIGHT SPIE 2015...|$|E
50|$|A {{theodolite}} may {{be either}} transit or non-transit. In a transit <b>theodolite,</b> the <b>telescope</b> can be inverted in the vertical plane, whereas the rotation {{in the same}} plane is restricted to a semi-circle in a non-transit theodolite. Some types of transit theodolites do not allow the measurement of vertical angles.|$|R
5000|$|Transit Ridge (...) is a ridge, 4 {{nautical}} miles (7 km) long, extending east from Royal Society Range between Spring Glacier and Mitchell Glacier, in Victoria Land. The name {{is one of}} a group in the area associated with surveying applied in 1993 by New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB). Named from transit <b>theodolite,</b> a <b>telescope</b> that can be rotated through the vertical position.|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} observatory {{procedure for}} determining a geomagnetic field's declination and inclination absolutely is the DI-flux measurement. The instrument {{consists of a}} non-magnetic theodolite equipped with a single-axis fluxgate magnetometer. Additionally, a scalar magnetometer is needed to provide all three components of the field. Using only 12 measurement steps, all systematic errors can be accounted for, but if {{only one of the}} readings is wrong, the whole measurement has to be rejected. We use a three-component sensor on top of the <b>theodolites</b> <b>telescope.</b> By performing more measurement steps, we gain much better control of the whole procedure: As the magnetometer can be fully calibrated by rotating about two independent directions, every combined reading of magnetometer output and theodolite angles provides the absolute field vector. We predefined a set of angle positions that the observer has to try to achieve. To further simplify the measurement procedure, the observer is guided by a pocket pc, in which he has only to confirm the theodolite position. The magnetic field is then stored automatically, together with the horizontal and vertical angles. The DI 3 measurement is periodically performed at the Niemegk Observatory, allowing for a direct comparison with the traditional measurements...|$|R
40|$|Theodolite ring lights {{have been}} invented to ease a {{difficulty}} {{encountered in the}} well-established optical-metrology practice of using highly reflective spherical tooling balls as position references. A theodolite ring light produces a more easily visible reflection and {{eliminates the need for}} an autocollimating device. A theodolite ring light is a very bright light source that is well centered on the optical axis of the instrument. It can be fabricated, easily and inexpensively, for use on a <b>theodolite</b> or <b>telescope</b> of any diameter...|$|R
50|$|During {{his time}} at Aarburg Castle he {{published}} many meteorological papers and created a cartographical drawing of the Alps as viewed from the castle. Without any modern equipment, such as a <b>theodolite</b> or <b>telescope</b> he instead used an eight-meter long gutter pipe, filled with water to measure levels and a small rod held in front of it, he could measure the heights of the peaks. He then used the Scheuchzer map of 1712 to calculate the distances away, and drew the first scientific panorama of the Alps.|$|R
40|$|The simple {{addition}} of a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera to a theodolite makes it safe to measure the pointing direction of a laser beam. The present {{state of the art}} requires this to be a custom addition because theodolites are manufactured without CCD cameras as standard or even optional equipment. A theodolite is an alignment telescope equipped with mechanisms to measure the azimuth and elevation angles to the sub-arcsecond level. When measuring the angular pointing direction of a Class ll laser with a theodolite, one could place a calculated amount of neutral density (ND) filters in front of the <b>theodolite</b> s <b>telescope.</b> One could then safely view and measure the laser s boresight looking through the <b>theodolite</b> s <b>telescope</b> without great risk to one s eyes. This method for a Class ll visible wavelength laser is not acceptable to even consider tempting for a Class IV laser and not applicable for an infrared (IR) laser. If one chooses insufficient attenuation or forgets to use the filters, then looking at the laser beam through the theodolite could cause instant blindness. The CCD camera is already commercially available. It is a small, inexpensive, blackand- white CCD circuit-board-level camera. An interface adaptor was designed and fabricated to mount the camera onto the eyepiece of the specific <b>theodolite</b> s viewing <b>telescope.</b> Other equipment needed for operation of the camera are power supplies, cables, and a black-and-white television monitor. The picture displayed on the monitor is equivalent to what one would see when looking directly through the theodolite. Again, the additional advantage afforded by a cheap black-and-white CCD camera is that it is sensitive to infrared as well as to visible light. Hence, one can use the camera coupled to a theodolite to measure the pointing of an infrared as well as a visible laser...|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, the {{observatory}} was built with a classroom, transit room (with a clamshell roof), and an office. A large backlit display case containing numerous astronomical slides was featured (and remains today) {{in the lobby}} of the building. Many civil engineering instruments were housed in Fuertes, including zenith <b>telescopes,</b> <b>theodolites,</b> sextants, transit instruments, and a chronograph. The transit room has since been converted into a museum to display many of the historic instruments.|$|R
50|$|Born in Madrid, Spain, Mouchez {{embarked}} on {{a career in the}} French Navy as an ensign in 1843. This was a period of relative international maritime peace and much of the navy's activities were dedicated to exploration and discovery. Mouchez was initially occupied on hydrographic studies along the coasts of Korea, China and South America, penetrating 320 km up the Paraguay River and exploring the Abrolhos Islands. He improved the practice of surveying at sea, adapting terrestrial instruments for naval use, and was especially concerned with the problems of determining longitude. He developed the use of the <b>theodolite</b> and meridian <b>telescope</b> to improve the error in establishing longitude from around 30″ to 3-4″.|$|R
5000|$|Consider {{tracking}} {{a helicopter}} flying towards the theodolite from the horizon. The <b>theodolite</b> is a <b>telescope</b> {{mounted on a}} tripod {{so that it can}} move in azimuth and elevation to track the helicopter. The helicopter flies towards the theodolite and is tracked by the telescope in elevation and azimuth. The helicopter flies immediately above the tripod (i.e. it is at zenith) when it changes direction and flies at 90 degrees to its previous course. The telescope cannot track this maneuver without a discontinuous jump in {{one or both of the}} gimbal orientations. There is no continuous motion that allows it to follow the target. It is in gimbal lock. So there is an infinity of directions around zenith for which the telescope cannot continuously track all movements of a target. Note that even if the helicopter does not pass through zenith, but only near zenith, so that gimbal lock does not occur, the system must still move exceptionally rapidly to track it, as it rapidly passes from one bearing to the other. The closer to zenith the nearest point is, the faster this must be done, and if it actually goes through zenith, the limit of these [...] "increasingly rapid" [...] movements becomes infinitely fast, namely discontinuous.|$|R
