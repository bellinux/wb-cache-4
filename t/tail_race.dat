This side of the site was also the location of the lime yard. The other half of the site, to the south-east of Exeter Hill, which was the location of the tan yard, is now the site of an Aldi supermarket.|$|E
25|$|Coldharbour Mill {{also had}} a small water turbine for {{electricity}} generation, which used the 14 foot head of water between the upper leat and the <b>tail</b> <b>race.</b> No references {{have been found to}} it in any register of Devon hydro-electric schemes, and it was unlikely to have generated any more than 3kW peak power. The exit is visible today in the <b>tail</b> <b>race</b> leat, but nothing else is believed to exist.|$|E
25|$|The main mill {{building}} was expanded at various times, with a two story extension {{added to the}} north; a fireproof stone staircase to the east; a wheelhouse; a fourth floor to the main building; and an adjacent combing shed built over the <b>tail</b> <b>race</b> leat flowing from the waterwheel.|$|E

25|$|The mill site {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of subsidiary buildings, including stabling, a linhay, a gas retort house (see below), a carpenter's workshop, an air raid shelter from WWII, worker's cottages, and the manager's house. The <b>tail</b> <b>race</b> which takes the water away from the waterwheel is unusual in that it runs under the combing shed in a wide culvert, before briefly reappearing and then running underground again for some 200 metres.|$|E
2500|$|The mill {{measures}} [...] wide by [...] long. A {{date stone}} on an exterior wall is marked [...] "Nathan'l Mary Newlin 1704." [...] The dam and the half-mile mill race, which provides {{the water that}} powers the mill, were built the same year. The original grindstone was imported from France. The mill was built of fieldstone into a hillside: the north side two stories, the south side one story high. The mill wheel was originally outside the mill and was probably breastshot. It was reconstructed in 1976, weighs [...] and measures , with 52 buckets. The water exits underground through the <b>tail</b> <b>race</b> and travels about [...] back to Chester Creek. The floors and mill machinery are supported by a hurst frame, an inner timber frame that is separated from the outer stone walls so that vibrations do not break the outer walls. The process of grinding the corn may be viewed at the mill or on video.|$|E
2500|$|This was a paper mill. There {{were two}} mills {{here in the}} thirteenth century, {{separated}} by a ford that passed through the <b>tail</b> <b>race</b> of the Upper Mill. The Upper Mill was removed c.1300 {{and as a result}} the ford became deep and impassable. In 1303, Henry de Cobham built a bridge at his own cost to replace the ford. This was swept away by a storm in 1337 and Thomas de Cobham (his son), erected a footbridge in its place. The Sheriff proceeded against Thomas for not rebuilding the bridge in its original form, and the Court agreed with the Sheriff. The site was used at one time as a fulling mill. A picture of the mill c.1850 can be seen [...] Paper from Chafford Mills was used to print postage stamps for Jamaica, The Transvaal and the Falkland Islands. The mill closed in 1913 and was demolished in 1930. It was latterly driven by a turbine.|$|E
50|$|The Perry-Carpenter Grist Mill is an {{historic}} mill at 364 Moonstone Beach Road in South Kingstown, Rhode Island. It is a small, single-story wood-frame structure {{set on a}} granite foundation close to {{the east side of}} the road. Its property includes the historic head and <b>tail</b> <b>races</b> which provide the water power for the mill. The mill was built c. 1716 by James Perry, and was moved to its present location sometime before 1789. It is the only one of four known mills of the period to survive, and is likely the oldest corn mill in the state that is still operational.|$|R
50|$|Baldwin's Mill is a {{historic}} grist mill and national historic district located near Pittsboro, Chatham County, North Carolina. The district encompasses one contributing building and three contributing structures. The mill was probably built by 1807, is a 1 1/2- to 2 1/2-story, heavy timber-framed structure approximately 30 feet by 40 feet. Associated with the mill are the mill dam, and mill and <b>tail</b> <b>races.</b> The property also includes a stretch of roadbed dates to about 1820, a blacksmith's shop site (c. 1880), and two log cabins (c. 1830) moved to the property in 1975. The mill ceased operation in the late 1920s. It was restored to working order in 1941.|$|R
50|$|This race {{featured}} a 3 car {{battle for the}} lead over {{the last half of}} the race. Ayrton Senna (Lotus-Renault), Nigel Mansell (Williams-Honda) and reigning World Champion Alain Prost (McLaren-TAG) all had opportunities to take the win, with close nose to <b>tail</b> <b>racing</b> around the circuit. Once Mansell pitted for fresh tyres he charged back into the fight making up over 19 seconds in the final 10 laps on his fresh rubber. It was not quite sufficient to take the win, but it was very close with Senna and Mansell taking the chequered flag almost side by side, Senna only 0.014 s in front of Mansell in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history.|$|R

50|$|Hockley Mill Farm, {{also known}} as Mt. Pleasant Mills and Frank Knauer Mill, is a {{historic}} home and grist mill located in Warwick Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. The farm has three contributing buildings and one contributing structure. They are the miller's house, -story stone-and-frame grist mill (1805), stone-and-frame bank barn (c. 1840), and the head and <b>tail</b> <b>races.</b> The house is a -story, five-bay, banked fieldstone dwelling with a gable roof. The foundation in the western section was built about 1725 to support a log dwelling. It was expanded with the present eastern section in 1735, and the log section replaced about 1780. A two-story, two-bay annex was built in 1935-40, and expanded in 1965. A shed-roofed addition was built to the north in 1990.|$|R
50|$|Water {{for the top}} of {{the canal}} was {{obtained}} from the <b>tail</b> <b>races</b> from Cyfarthfa ironworks, which had previously been fed back into the River Taff, so that it could be reused by the Plymouth ironworks. In order to safeguard this supply, all water discharged from the third lock was supposed to be fed into the Plymouth feeder, rather than the canal below it. This was a source of dispute for some years, with legal action instituted by both sides and the occasional bout of vandalism to ensure water actually flowed to the Plymouth works. The situation was eased {{with the opening of the}} Merthyr Tramroad, as there was less traffic on the upper section, and therefore less water used by the locks.|$|R
50|$|Before he was 17 years old, he was {{skilled at}} welding aluminum, and used this {{expertise}} {{to repair the}} aluminum <b>tail</b> cones of <b>racing</b> cars, which were powered by outboard motors. A frequent driver tactic created opportunity for him to practice his welding skills. Drivers would run a car onto the tail cone of the car ahead, rendering the lead car's steering inoperative and resulting in continuous damage to the aluminum <b>tail</b> cones. From <b>race</b> cars to aircraft was a logical step.|$|R

50|$|Initially a weir was {{proposed}} {{to divert the}} water coming out of <b>tail</b> <b>race</b> tunnel of Stage I and II. But it was later observed that the water still had a hydraulic head of about 120 m which could be used. To use this head, the Kolkewadi Dam was constructed at this location. It forms a balancing reservoir and maintains the head. This dam impounds the <b>tail</b> <b>race</b> water from Stage I and II. This water is drawn through penstocks and electricity is generated by four Francis turbine units with a capacity of 80 MW each. The <b>tail</b> <b>race</b> water from these stages then flows through a channel and joins the Arabian Sea near Chiplun.|$|E

5000|$|Yuruzh {{explains}} to Althea {{that he had}} followed the Ta'zu and quietly taken the ship. After sounding her out on her current plans and prospects, he proposes marriage, stating he has admired her since first laying eyes on her. He also reveals {{the secret of the}} Záva's intelligence; when younger, he had been taken to Earth and given the experimental [...] "Pannoëtic treatment", which turns lower primates into geniuses while driving human beings mad. (The rationale behind the treatment spoofs pseudo-scientific ideas current in the 1950s, particularly those of L. Ron Hubbard.) As a Krishnan and a hybrid between the advanced tailless and the primitive <b>tailed</b> <b>races,</b> Yuruzh might have gone either way, but in the event gained super-intelligence. Feigning that the treatment wore off, he was permitted to return to Krishna, where he has been uplifting his tailed compatriots by giving them the same treatment. He asks Althea to be his wife, and partner in his civilizing mission.|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, Kawasaki {{designers}} took {{a progressive}} leap forward in overall design appearance {{with the creation}} of the first <b>race</b> <b>tail</b> on the H2 {{as well as on the}} 350 cc S2 Mach II. The <b>race</b> <b>tail</b> covered most of the taillight assembly behind the seat and allowed for a less conspicuous rear fender it also provided a small storage space, like the tail fairings of sport bikes today. [...] This design innovation would be copied and seen on the 1977 Yamaha RD250 and 400 and nine 1978 Suzuki models, beginning with the GS1000 down to their 250 cc bikes.|$|R

50|$|The {{water in}} {{head race tunnel}} is {{directly}} drawn from the reservoir and delivered to the head surge tank. Then four pressure shafts take the water downward vertically. The four huge Francis turbine units of 250 MW each generate electricity and <b>tail</b> <b>race</b> water is taken into the Kolkewadi Dam reservoir through <b>tail</b> <b>race</b> tunnel.

50|$|A {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the people was their traditional nakedness. Among the Nilotic Kavirondo married men who are fathers wore {{a small piece of}} goat-skin (Sembe), which though practically useless as a covering was worn according to ethnic etiquette. Even among men who have adopted European clothing this goat-skin must still be worn underneath. Contact with whites has led to the adoption of European clothing by numbers of the men (who were better travelled), but the women (who were less travelled), more conservative, remained in nudity or the scanty covering which they wore before the advent of Europeans. Among the Bantu Kavirondo married women wear a short fringe of black string in front and a tassel of banana fibre suspended from a girdle behind, this tassel having at a distance the appearance of a tail. Hence the report of early travellers as to a <b>tailed</b> <b>race</b> in Africa. The Nilotic Kavirondo women wear the tail, but dispense with the fringe in front. For dandy they wear a goat-skin slung over the shoulders.|$|R

The light-brown body of the naked youth, all but hidden by the shaggy carcass of the killed ape, the red blood streaking his smooth hide, his muscles rolling, velvety, beneath.

50|$|A {{draft tube}} {{at the end}} of the turbine {{increases}} the pressure of the exiting fluid at the expense of its velocity. This means that the turbine can reduce pressure to a higher extent without fear of back flow from <b>tail</b> <b>race.</b> The Draft tube gives an advantage of placing the turbine above the <b>tail</b> <b>race</b> so that any required inspections can be made easily. Moreover, it also converts the wasteful kinetic energy at the exit of the runner into the useful pressure energy.|$|E
