5|$|After Gordon fends off a Combine {{attack on}} the base, Alyx gives Dr. Kleiner the message from Judith Mossman {{recovered}} at the Citadel. It contains footage and the coordinates of the Borealis, an Aperture Science research vessel which, Kleiner explains, vanished along with part of the surrounding drydock. Kleiner insists {{that it should be}} used to aid the Resistance effort, while Eli counters {{that it is impossible to}} control and must be destroyed. They agree that Alyx and Gordon will travel to the Borealis and attempt to find Mossman. Alyx unconsciously delivers the G-Man's message to her father, shaking him. Alone with Gordon, Eli reveals that it was the G-Man who provided the <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> that caused the Black Mesa incident, and that he whispered the same warning to him as Gordon entered the test chamber. He promises to explain more after the portal is closed.|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of production technology on mechanical properties of rubber <b>testing</b> <b>samples.</b> In practice, rubber <b>testing</b> <b>samples</b> are cut out from a compression molded sheet, also in case of testing of rubber compounds appointed for injection molding. However, the different way of the preparation of <b>testing</b> <b>samples</b> and the production itself may {{have a negative effect}} on the mechanical properties of the final product. Thus the article judges, to what extent the mechanical properties (tensile strength, extension, tear strength and microhardness) of <b>testing</b> <b>samples</b> from selected rubber materials are influenced by injection molding, and evaluates the possible divergence...|$|R
30|$|Noisy <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> of each dataset (TI- 20, TI-ALPHA, and Marathi Digits) were {{obtained}} by artificially adding stationary white Gaussian noise under {{a wide range of}} SNRs (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 dB) into the <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> of each dataset. Tests were carried out on clean as well as noisy <b>test</b> <b>samples.</b> For training and testing, diagonal covariance left-right CDHMM [2] with 4 -mixtures and 5 -states (as this combination yields best performance) was used as a classifier.|$|R

25|$|At , WMA 9 Pro {{delivered}} full-spectrum response at {{half the}} bit rate required for DTS in a comparative test done by EDN in October 2003. The <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> was a 48kHz, 5.1 channel surround audio track.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{ligand binding}} assay {{techniques}} were used extensively to quantify hormone or hormone receptor concentrations in plasma or in tissue. The ligand-binding assay methodology quantified {{the concentration of}} the hormone in the test material by comparing {{the effects of the}} <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> to the results of varying amounts of known protein (ligand).|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, to {{minimize}} the difficulties encountered in the surface profile and shape of <b>testing</b> <b>samples</b> in slake durability index <b>test,</b> a new <b>sample</b> preparation method that is called Pasha Method is used. In order to apply this new sample preparation method, marl block samples were collected at Tuncbilek open pit mine located at the Kutahya region in Turkey. Samples were prepared as two different profiles or shapes. The rounded <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> whose sharp sides were hammered and ground with abrasives were chosen first. These first <b>testing</b> <b>samples</b> were prepared according to both the ASTM and ISRM standard. The second <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> were equal-sized spheres that were prepared {{according to the new}} method. After sample preparation, these two different samples were subjected to the Slake durability index test. The test results of two different samples are presented in this paper. According to the test results, the highest slake durability index values were obtained from equal-sized sphere <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> that are prepared according to the new method when the sphere samples were compared to the rounded samples...|$|R
30|$|The ISOLET {{database}} has 676 {{samples of}} spoken English letters. It was constructed by 26 speakers. The ISOLET database {{was divided into}} 20 training <b>samples</b> and 6 <b>testing</b> <b>samples</b> for each class. The Isolated digits database (0 – 9, o) has 454 samples for each class. This was divided into 266 training <b>samples</b> and 188 <b>testing</b> <b>samples.</b> The Places database has eight classes that were names of eight places (caphe, dung, karaoke, khachsan, khong, matxa, tramatm, trolai) in Vietnamese. Each class has 485 training <b>samples</b> and 50 <b>test</b> <b>samples.</b>|$|R
30|$|According to the {{locating}} {{results of}} clean reads among the reference genome, duplicate reads were removed using the Picard tool ([URL] and GATK software (McKenna et al. 2010) {{was used to}} perform the local realignment and base recalibration to insure {{the accuracy of the}} SNP detecting. The SNP loci between the <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> and reference genome were obtained using the GATK software according to the best practices on the GATK website ([URL] All the SNP loci between the <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> were summarized according to the alignment results of <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> and the reference genome.|$|R
25|$|Using matrix matched {{calibration}} standards can compensate for ion suppression. Using this technique, {{calibration standards}} are prepared in identical sample matrix {{to that used}} for analysis (e.g. plasma) by spiking a normal sample with known concentrations of analyte. This is not always possible for biological samples, since the analyte of interest is often endogenously present in a clinically significant, albeit normal, quantity. For matrix matched calibration standards {{to be effective in}} compensating for ion suppression, the sample matrix must be free of the analyte of interest. Additionally, it is important that there is little variation in <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> composition since both the <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> and the prepared calibration sample must be affected in the same way by ion suppression. Again, in complex biological samples from different individuals, or even the same individual at a different time, there may be large fluctuations in the concentrations of ion suppressing species.|$|E
25|$|In 1857, when Nicholas and all men {{involved}} in pressing the Constantine rouble were already dead, general Fyodor Schubert (1789–1865) {{broke the silence}} and published {{a brief description of}} a Constantine ruble from his private collection. Schubert wrote that his coin was a <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> that was sent to Constantine's approval during the interregnum, and that press dies were destroyed upon accession of Nicholas I. Schubert's coin lacked edge lettering.|$|E
25|$|Spark {{testing is}} a method of {{determining}} the general classification of ferrous materials. It normally entails taking a piece of metal, usually scrap, and applying it to a grinding wheel in order to observe the sparks emitted. These sparks {{can be compared to}} a chart or to sparks from a known <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> to determine the classification. Spark testing also can be used to sort ferrous materials, establishing the difference from one another by noting whether the spark is the same or different.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPrincipal {{component}} analysis (PCA) and {{linear discriminant analysis}} (LDA) are two most widely used pattern recognition methods {{in the field of}} feature extraction,while PCA + LDA is often used in image recognition. Here,we apply PCA + LDA to gastric cancer image feature classification, but the traditional PCA + LDA dimension reduction method has good effect on the training sample dimensionality and clustering, the effect on <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> dimension reduction and clustering is very poor, that is, the traditional PCA + LDA exists Generalization problem on the <b>test</b> <b>samples.</b> To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved PCA + LDA method, which mainly considers from the LDA transform; improves the traditional PCA + LDA;increase the generalization performance of LDA on <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> and increases the classification accuracy on <b>test</b> <b>samples.</b> The experiment proves that the method can achieve good clustering...|$|R

25|$|Photometry / {{spectrophotometry}} When the absorbance of {{a specific}} wavelength of light while passing through a fixed path-length through a cuvette of liquid <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> is measured and the absorbance is compared with a blank and standards with graded amounts of the target compound. If the emitted light is {{of a specific}} visible wavelength it may be called colorimetry, or it may involve specific wavelength of light e.g. by use of laser and emission of fluorescent signals of another specific wavelength which is detected via very specific wavelength optical filters.|$|E
25|$|A {{bench grinder}} is usually {{used to create}} the sparks, but {{sometimes}} this is not convenient, so a portable grinder is used. In either case, the grinding wheel must have adequate surface velocity, at least 23m/s (4500surface feet per minute (sfpm)), but should be between 38 and 58m/s (7500–11,500sfpm). The wheel should be coarse and hard, therefore aluminium oxide or carborundum often are employed. The test area should be {{in an area where}} there is no bright light shining directly into the observer's eyes. Moreover, the grinding wheel and surrounding area should be dark so that the sparks can be observed clearly. The <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> is then touched lightly to the grinding wheel to produce the sparks.|$|E
25|$|When {{dealing with}} {{promotion}} a marketing manager must {{account for all}} the market complexities {{that are involved in}} a decision. As it is difficult to account for all aspects of the market, a manager should look to incorporate both experienced judgements from senior executives as well modifying these judgements in light of economically justifiable information gathering. An example of the application of Bayesian decision theory for promotional purposes could be the use of a <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> in order to assess the effectiveness of a promotion prior to a full scale rollout. By combining prior subjective data about the occurrence of possible events with experimental empirical evidence gained through a test market, the resultant data {{can be used to make}} decisions under risk.|$|E
40|$|In an {{automatic}} speaker verification (ASV) system, the equal error rate (EER) {{is a measure}} to evaluate the system performance. Usually it needs {{a large number of}} <b>testing</b> <b>samples</b> to calculate the EER. In order to estimate the EER without running the experiments using <b>testing</b> <b>samples,</b> a method of model-based EER estimation which computes likelihood scores directly from client speaker models and imposter models is proposed. However, the distribution of the computed likelihood scores is significantly biased against the distribution of likelihood scores obtained from <b>testing</b> <b>samples.</b> Here we propose a novel idea to manipulate the speaker models of the client speakers and the imposters so that the distribution of the computed likelihood scores is closer to the distribution of likelihood scores obtained from <b>testing</b> <b>samples.</b> Then a more reliable EER can be calculated by the speaker models. The experimental results show that the proposed method can properly estimate the EER...|$|R
40|$|The anomaly {{events are}} defined as the points that rare and diverse from the other points in feature space. Conventional anomaly {{detection}} methods usually find low-probability events with a learned a probability distribution model, or evaluate the <b>testing</b> <b>samples</b> with the local density of the <b>testing</b> <b>samples.</b> Multi-state system usually has multiple normal states, and state changes at unpredictable points caused by the daily operation such as feed, outlet, flow control, etc. For the multistate system, collecting enough data that contain all possible states are challenging or impossible to users. Furthermore, conventional anomaly detection methods {{are sensitive to the}} context of training datasets or the unpredicted phased changes of the testing datasets, or just consider the local density of the <b>testing</b> <b>samples.</b> Motivated by this problem, we transform the model learning problem to a distinction learning problem that learns the familiarity of each <b>testing</b> <b>samples.</b> In order to reduce the effects of the phased changes, we randomly shuffle the testing dataset and use a sliding window to evaluate the familiarity of the <b>testing</b> <b>samples</b> with one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. Our contributions include: (1) reducing the requirement of the prior knowledge; (2) handling the phased changes of the testing datasets, (3) considering the global familiarity of the <b>testing</b> <b>samples.</b> Our proposed method is evaluated on the synthetic datasets, and the real datasets, and experiments results show that our proposed method is superior than the state-of-theart methods...|$|R

[...] , however, indicates that Dr. Gina Cross is responsible for this task. Livingston admitted he did not play Decay, and thus {{was not aware of}} its storyline. He also stated that the comic takes place in the PC version of the Half-life continuity, and since Half-Life: Decay was never published for the PC, it does not affect the comic.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{development}} of the DU spectrophotometer, analysis of a <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> to determine its components was a long, costly, and often inaccurate process. [...] A classical wet laboratory contained a wide variety of complicated apparatus. Test samples were run through a series of awkward and time-consuming qualitative processes to separate out and identify their components. Determining quantitative concentrations of those components in the sample involved further steps. [...] Processes could involve techniques for chemical reactions, precipitations, filtrations and dissolutions. Determination of the concentrations of known impurities in a known inorganic substance such as molten iron could be done in under thirty minutes. The determination of complex organic structures such as chlorophyll using wet and dry methods could take decades.|$|E
500|$|Volume I of Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air {{outlined}} several discoveries: [...] "nitrous air" [...] (nitric oxide, NO); [...] "vapor {{of spirit}} of salt", later called [...] "acid air" [...] or [...] "marine acid air" [...] (anhydrous hydrochloric acid, HCl); [...] "alkaline air" [...] (ammonia, NH3); [...] "diminished" [...] or [...] "dephlogisticated nitrous air" [...] (nitrous oxide, N2O); and, most famously, [...] "dephlogisticated air" [...] (oxygen, O2) {{as well as}} experimental findings that showed plants revitalised enclosed volumes of air, a discovery that would eventually lead {{to the discovery of}} photosynthesis. Priestley also developed a [...] "nitrous air test" [...] to determine the [...] "goodness of air". Using a pneumatic trough, he would mix nitrous air with a <b>test</b> <b>sample,</b> over water or mercury, and measure the decrease in volume—the principle of eudiometry. After a small history of the study of airs, he explained his own experiments in an open and sincere style. As an early biographer writes, [...] "whatever he knows or thinks he tells: doubts, perplexities, blunders are set down with the most refreshing candour." [...] Priestley also described his cheap and easy-to-assemble experimental apparatus; his colleagues therefore believed that they could easily reproduce his experiments. Faced with inconsistent experimental results, Priestley employed phlogiston theory. This, however, led him to conclude that there were only three types of [...] "air": [...] "fixed", [...] "alkaline", and [...] "acid". Priestley dismissed the [...] of his day. Instead, he focused on gases and [...] "changes in their sensible properties", as had natural philosophers before him. He isolated carbon monoxide (CO), but apparently did not realise that it was a separate [...] "air".|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{computer}} models of inspection processes are emerging as important simulation tools in {{many aspects of}} applications of nondestructive evaluation. This work reports one such application {{to the design of}} <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> for studying the detection of hardalpha inclusions in titanium alloys. The infrequent occurrence of natural hard-alpha defects has necessitated extensive use of synthetic-hard-alpha (SHA) <b>test</b> <b>samples.</b> However, in manufacturing these titanium <b>test</b> <b>samples,</b> the traditional “trial and error” practice has proven to be costly and time-consuming. The current goal of designing a block simulating a titanium billet containing numerous SHA defects, with properties approximating those of natural hard-alpha defects, presents an even more complex challenge...|$|R

2500|$|Fitness-for-use (FFU) test; AKA, control sample: [...] {{since an}} EDD {{may fail to}} detect {{indentations}} when they are actually present (for a variety of reasons), {{it is important to}} check on the equipment's performance using a control sample (commonly called a FFU test) known to have indentations. [...] Recommendations include using a FFU <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> {{at the beginning and end}} of a series involving the examination of multiple questioned documents, or placing a small FFU <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> adjacent to each questioned document on the platen. [...] The FFU test can be prepared by hand using a similar writing instrument and similar paper. [...] Alternatively, a special device call the 'Gradient®' can be used to produce control indentations that vary in depth in a known manner thereby permitting the examiner to determine not only that the EDD is working but also the degree to which it is sensitive. It is not essential to precisely match the questioned document in terms of paper type or pen type since the objective is to show that the device is functioning properly.|$|E

2500|$|Gas chromatography–mass {{spectrometry}} (GC-MS) is {{an analytical}} method that combines {{the features of}} gas-chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify different substances within a <b>test</b> <b>sample.</b> Applications of GC-MS include drug detection, fire investigation, environmental analysis, explosives investigation, and identification of unknown samples, including that of material samples obtained from planet Mars during [...] probe missions {{as early as the}} 1970s. GC-MS can also be used in airport security to detect substances in luggage or on human beings. Additionally, it can identify trace elements in materials that were previously thought to have disintegrated beyond identification. Like liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, it allows analysis and detection even of tiny amounts of a substance.|$|E
