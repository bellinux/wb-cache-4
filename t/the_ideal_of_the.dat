5|$|Despite {{advances}} in relative social freedoms and legal rights, women were still {{expected to attend}} to the duties of the home. Along with child-rearing, women were responsible for spinning yarn, weaving cloth, sewing clothing, and cooking meals. Women who belonged to families that sold silk were especially busy, since their duties included coddling the silkworms, feeding them chopped mulberry tree leaves, and keeping them warm to ensure that they would eventually spin their cocoons. In the family pecking order, the dominant female of the household was the mother-in-law, who was free to hand out orders and privileges to the wives of her sons. Mothers often had strong ties with their grown and married sons, since these men often stayed at home. If a mother-in-law could not find sufficient domestic help from the daughters-in-law, there was a market for women to be bought as maids or servants. There were also many professional courtesans (and concubines brought into the house) who kept men busy in the pursuits of entertainment, relations, and romantic affairs. It was also common for wives to be jealous and conniving towards concubines that their wealthy husbands brought home. Yet two could play at this game. Most concubines were found in the families of feudal lords and kings. <b>The</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chaste, modest, and pious young woman was somewhat distorted in urban settings such as Hangzhou and Suzhou, where there were greedy and flirtatious women, as one author put it. This author stated that the husbands of these women could not satisfy them, and so took on as many as five 'complementary husbands'; if they lived close to a monastery, even Buddhist monks could suffice for additional lovers.|$|E

25|$|Italian Renaissance authors {{produced}} {{a number of}} important works. Niccolò Machiavelli's The Prince is one of the world's most famous essays on political science and modern philosophy, in which the effective truth is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. Another important work of the period, Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, continuation of Matteo Maria Boiardo's unfinished romance Orlando Innamorato, is perhaps the greatest chivalry poem ever written. Baldassare Castiglione's dialogue The Book of the Courtier describes <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perfect court gentleman and of spiritual beauty.

25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{principles}} of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of organised labour. <b>The</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self-made individual, who through hard work and talent could make his or her place in the world, seemed increasingly implausible. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by industrialisation and laissez-faire capitalism came from conservatives concerned about social balance, although socialism later became a more important force for change and reform. Some Victorian writers – including Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle and Matthew Arnold – became early influential critics of social injustice.|$|E
25|$|Abolitionist and {{suffrage}} movements spread, {{along with}} representative and democratic ideals. France established an enduring republic in the 1870s. However nationalism also spread rapidly after 1815. A mixture of liberal and nationalist sentiment in Italy and Germany {{brought about the}} unification {{of the two countries}} in the late 19th century. A liberal regime came to power in Italy, and ended the secular power of the popes. The Vatican, however, launched a counter crusade against liberalism. Pope Pius IX issued the Syllabus of Errors in 1864, condemning liberalism in all its forms. In many countries, liberal forces responded by expelling the Jesuit order.

500|$|In South and South-East Asia, merit-making was {{not only}} a {{practice}} for the mass, but was also practiced by the higher echelons of society. Kingship and merit-making went together. In the Tipiṭaka, ideas about good governance were framed in terms of <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'wheel-turning monarch' ( [...] ; [...] ), the king who rules righteously and non-violently according to Dharma. His roles and duties are discussed extensively in Buddhist texts. The Cakkavatti is a moral example to the people and possesses enough spiritual merit. It is through this that he earns his sovereignty, as opposed to merely inheriting it. [...] Also, the Buddha himself was born as a prince, and was also a king (Vessantara) in a previous life. Apart from the models in the suttas, Pāli chronicles such as the Mahāvaṃsa and the Jinakālamālī {{may have contributed to the}} ideals of Buddhist kingship. In these vernacular Pāli works, examples are given of royalty performing meritorious acts, sometimes as a form of repentance for previously committed wrongdoings.

500|$|The {{rebellion}} {{failed because}} the rebels {{had to fight}} against overwhelming odds— not only the Byzantines and the Mongols, but also much of the Bulgarian nobility. Although ultimately unsuccessful, the uprising of Ivaylo had achieved a recognition of its leader as emperor, an aim in which all other popular revolts in medieval Europe failed. In Socialist Bulgaria the rebellion was portrayed as a social movement against the iniquity of the feudal system and the foreign invaders. In modern Bulgaria Ivaylo is still revered as a fighter for freedom and social justice. However, {{there is no evidence}} that Ivaylo and his followers ever intended to conduct social reforms. The fact that the rebellion was supported by some nobles and that Ivaylo married the hated Empress Maria also indicates that the main factor was the incompetent rule of Emperor Constantine Tikh. The Bulgarian historians praise the heroism of the rebels and evaluate the uprising as a bright patriotic achievement of the Bulgarian people because Ivaylo was able to gather wide support from all social classes of Bulgaria to defend the then-troubled country against the external enemies. Ivaylo is remembered as a heroic ruler and a tragic figure who represented <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Good Tsar".|$|E

500|$|The {{fundamental}} idea of [...] "restoration" [...] or [...] "Christian Primitivism" [...] is that problems or {{deficiencies in the}} church can be corrected by using the primitive church as a [...] "normative model." [...] The call for restoration is often justified {{on the basis of}} a [...] "falling away" [...] that corrupted the original purity of the church. [...] This falling away is identified with the development of Catholicism and denominationalism. [...] New Testament verses that discuss future apostasy (...) and heresy (e.g., , , [...] ) are understood to predict this falling away. [...] The logic of [...] "restoration" [...] could imply that the [...] "true" [...] church completely disappeared and thus lead towards exclusivism. [...] Another view of restoration is that the [...] "true Church ... has always existed by grace and not by human engineering" [...] (italics in the original). [...] In this view the goal is to [...] "help Christians realize <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church in the New Testament– to restore the church as conceived in the mind of Christ" [...] (italics in the original). [...] Early Restoration Movement leaders did not believe that the church had ceased to exist, but instead sought to reform and reunite the church. [...] A number of congregations' web sites explicitly state that the true church never disappeared. [...] The belief in a general falling away is not seen as inconsistent with the idea that a faithful remnant of the church never entirely disappeared. Some have attempted to trace this remnant through the intervening centuries between the New Testament and the beginning of the Restoration Movement in the early 1800s.|$|E
500|$|There {{is little}} record of Cynicism in the 2nd or 1st centuries BC; Cicero (c. 50 BC), who was much {{interested}} in Greek philosophy, had little to say about Cynicism, except that [...] "it is to be shunned; for it is opposed to modesty, without which there can be neither right nor honor." [...] However, by the 1st century AD, Cynicism reappeared with full force. The rise of Imperial Rome, like the Greek loss of independence under Philip and Alexander three centuries earlier, {{may have led to}} a sense of powerlessness and frustration among many people, which allowed a philosophy which emphasized self-sufficiency and inner-happiness to flourish once again. Cynics could be found throughout the empire, standing on street corners, preaching about virtue. Lucian complained that [...] "every city is filled with such upstarts, particularly with those who enter the names of Diogenes, Antisthenes, and Crates as their patrons and enlist in the Army of the Dog," [...] and Aelius Aristides observed that [...] "they frequent the doorways, talking more to the doorkeepers than to the masters, making up for their lowly condition by using impudence." [...] The most notable representative of Cynicism in the 1st century AD was Demetrius, whom Seneca praised as [...] "a man of consummate wisdom, though he himself denied it, constant to the principles which he professed, of an eloquence worthy to deal with the mightiest subjects." [...] Cynicism in Rome was both the butt of the satirist and <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thinker.
