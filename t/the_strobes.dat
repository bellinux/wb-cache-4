50|$|When a round {{was fired}} it would {{penetrate}} the two beams in turn. Returns from both {{were sent to}} the same B-scope display, causing two blips to appear. When the first appeared, the operator would turn two hand wheels to move a horizontal and vertical lines on the display, <b>the</b> <b>strobes,</b> so they lay on top of the blip. They then waited for the round to appear in the upper beam, causing another blip to appear. This time they used a second set of wheels to move <b>the</b> <b>strobes</b> to the new location. The entire process takes as little as 20 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Another {{variation}} is {{the sharing of}} the same bus to transfer the strobe. In this case the strobe can only be transferred by the device that is sending the data and may require transmission of pre-ambles and post-ambles to indicate the start and end of <b>the</b> <b>strobes.</b> (Example: DDR2).|$|E
5000|$|David Doubilet {{explained}} his technique for split field images {{in an interview}} for Nikon Corporation. [...] "You {{need to use a}} D-SLR and a super wide-angle or fisheye lens and a sophisticated housing that has a dome, not a flat port. Underwater images are magnified by 25 percent, and the dome will correct for that. The technique requires a small f/stop—f/16 or smaller—for great depth of field, plus a lens capable of close-focus; you always focus on the subject below the water line. You also have to balance the light. I look for a light bottom—white sand is best—or a light underwater subject. I'll put <b>the</b> <b>strobes</b> down below and light the bottom and then expose for the top. If you shoot at, say, ISO 400, you'll have plenty of exposure for the top, and <b>the</b> <b>strobes</b> will take care of the bottom. Of course, you need subjects that suit the technique." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{approach}} path for runway 32 passes over Central Avenue. The strobe lights that direct planes onto the runway were a hazard for drivers due to glare, more noticeable during wet weather when the strobes' intensity increased and the roadways reflected the blinking lights. Baffles were installed on <b>the</b> <b>strobes</b> which block the lights from shining {{on the road}} while still giving visual guidance for aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|To help {{accurately}} position <b>the</b> <b>strobes,</b> a range-gate {{system could}} be used to magnify the display. This had the effect of moving the blips apart vertically, making the difference between them more pronounced. The system was also generally more accurate if it was pointed at a low angle, so the difference between the actual parabolic path and the straight line extrapolated by the computer was minimized.|$|E
50|$|A feature {{unique to}} the P40DC and P32AC-DM is a hostler stand {{at the rear of}} the {{locomotive}} providing increased visibility and reversing capabilities to the engineer while conducting reverse operations. When a unit is in operation from this stand it is limited to 10 mph and a dead man's switch protects against movement without an operator being present. Two unique features to the original P40DC are the two strobes above the cab and an emergency flasher between <b>the</b> <b>strobes.</b> When they were overhauled, those features were removed, likely due to complaints from engine crews.|$|E
50|$|In {{bi-directional}} {{data transfer}} buses, two opposing unidirectional strobes {{can be sent}} from each device. Often <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> is free running in this case. That is, <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> continues to toggle whether there is data being transferred or not.|$|R
50|$|An older {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the frequency of}} rotating or vibrating objects {{is to use a}} stroboscope. This is an intense repetitively flashing light (strobe light) whose frequency can be adjusted with a calibrated timing circuit. <b>The</b> <b>strobe</b> light is pointed at the rotating object and the frequency adjusted up and down. When the frequency of <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> equals <b>the</b> frequency of the rotating or vibrating object, the object completes one cycle of oscillation and returns to its original position between the flashes of light, so when illuminated by <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> <b>the</b> object appears stationary. Then the frequency can be read from the calibrated readout on the stroboscope. A downside of this method is that an object rotating at an integral multiple of <b>the</b> <b>strobing</b> frequency will also appear stationary.|$|R
5|$|A {{prototype}} of <b>the</b> automatic <b>strobe</b> unit {{was produced in}} October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> in these cases.|$|R
5000|$|The {{system could}} also be used with some {{capability}} against artillery that fired at a lower angle, like a howitzer. Since a shell from such a weapon might never climb high enough to cross both beams, the system had a second mode that used a single wider beam instead. In this [...] "single beam" [...] mode the shell would appear on the display and then disappear again after some time, resulting in a long streak instead of a small blip. The calculation was carried out as normal by positioning <b>the</b> <b>strobes</b> {{at either end of the}} streak.|$|E
50|$|It {{is common}} to find {{structures}} with white xenon flashers/white strobes during the daytime, and red lights at night. Red lights are commonly found {{to be used in}} urban areas, since it is easier for pilots to spot them from above. White strobes (that flash round the clock) may also be used in urban areas. However, it has been recommended that flashing white strobes should not be used in densely populated areas; the lights usually merge with background lighting at nighttime, making it difficult for pilots to spot them and thereby aggravating the hazard. In addition, residents near the lit structure will complain of light trespass. In rural areas, red beacons/strobes may also be used during nighttime. However, white strobes are (sometimes) preferred since they reduce the maintenance cost (i.e. no maintenance of painting, no red side lights) and there are no background lights that would blend with <b>the</b> <b>strobes.</b>|$|E
50|$|His colleague's {{interest}} in the new flash apparatus soon provoked Edgerton to improve upon the design. The mercury lamp's efficiency was limited by the coolest part of the lamp, causing them to perform better when very hot but poorly when cold. Edgerton decided to try a noble gas instead, feeling {{that it would not}} be as temperature dependent as mercury, and, in 1930, he employed the General Electric company to construct some lamps using argon instead. The argon tubes were much more efficient, were much smaller, and could be mounted near a reflector, concentrating their output. Slowly, camera designers began to take notice of the new technology and began to accept it. Edgerton received his first major order for <b>the</b> <b>strobes</b> from the Kodak company in 1940. Afterward, he discovered that xenon was the most efficient of the noble gases, producing a spectrum very close to that of daylight, and xenon flashtubes became standard in most large photography sets. It was not until the 1970s that strobe units became portable enough to use in common cameras.|$|E

He started a {{hardcore}} punk trio in high school called [...] "The Broken Kockamamies" [...] (The BK's, or BKS) who were noted for using eight-foot strobe lights on a darkened stage as their only prop. <b>The</b> <b>strobes</b> were affectionately called [...] "the pillars of fear."In 1989, Conn played guitar in the Chicago avant garde rock quartet Conducet (Conn/guitar, Rex Jenny/bass and vocals, DeShawn/drums and vocals, Le Deuce/loops, beats, and atmosphere). The eclectic Conducent sound was born from improv and raised on the [...] "open mic" [...] circuit, eventually growing into full maturity as a performance troupe, perhaps best known for the infamous [...] "Best Of Buddha" [...] tour. Conn went solo in 1994 after Conducent broke up. His first lineup consisted of ex-Conducent member DJ Le Deuce on turntables, as well as his future wife Julie Pomerleau (a.k.a. Monica BouBou) on electric violin. Conn went on to release six studio albums to date: Bobby Conn (1997), Rise Up! (1998), The Golden Age (2001), The Homeland (2004), King For A Day (2007) and Macaroni (2012), along with a live album Live Classics (2005) and an E.P. called Llovessonngs (1999).|$|E

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} when imaging paintings is recording total appearance, that is, the object 2 ̆ 7 s color, surface microstructure (gloss), and surface macrostructure (topography). In this thesis, various systems were used to achieve this task, and a psychophysical paired comparison experiment was conducted to evaluate their performance. A pair of strobe lights arranged at 60 ° from the normal {{on either side of}} the painting captured color information where <b>the</b> <b>strobes</b> produced either directional or diffuse illumination geometry. By adding a third strobe, arranging them 120 ° apart annularly, and cross polarizing, diffuse color and surface normal maps were measured. A fourth strobe was added and the four lights were rearranged 90 ° apart annularly, capturing similar data. This system was augmented by two scanning linear light sources arranged perpendicularly, facilitating the measurement of spatially varying BRDF and specular maps. A laser scanner was used to capture surface macrostructure and was combined with the diffuse color maps from the four-light configuration. Finally, a dome illumination system was used with software developed by Conservation Heritage Imaging to produce color maps. In all, eight different configurations were achieved and used to image three small paintings with a range of appearance attributes. Twenty-five naive observers compared computer-graphic renderings to the actual painting and judged similarity in terms of total appearance, gloss/shininess, texture, and color. Although the rankings varied with painting, two general trends emerged. First, the four-light configuration with or without the independent laser scanning produced images visually equivalent to conventional strobe illumination. Second, diffuse illumination was always ranked lowest...|$|E
40|$|In 1995, the Chief Joseph Kokanee Enhancement Project was {{established}} to mitigate the loss of anadromous fish due {{to the construction of}} Chief Joseph and Grand Coulee dams. The objectives of the Chief Joseph Enhancement Project are to determine the status of resident kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations above Chief Joseph and Grand Coulee dams and to enhance kokanee and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations. Studies conducted at Grand Coulee Dam documented substantial entrainment of kokanee through turbines at the third powerhouse. In response to finding high entrainment at Grand Coulee Dam, the Independent Scientific Review Panel (ISRP) recommended investigating <b>the</b> use of <b>strobe</b> lights to repel fish from the forebay of the third powerhouse. Therefore, our study focused on the third powerhouse and how strobe lights affected fish behavior in this area. The primary objective of our study was to assess the behavioral response of kokanee and rainbow trout to strobe lights using 3 D acoustic telemetry, which yields explicit spatial locations of fish in three dimensions. Our secondary objectives were to (1) use a 3 D acoustic system to mobile track tagged fish in the forebay and upriver of Grand Coulee Dam and (2) determine the feasibility of detecting fish using a hydrophone mounted in the tailrace of the third powerhouse. Within the fixed hydrophone array located in the third powerhouse cul-de-sac, we detected 50 kokanee and 30 rainbow trout, accounting for 47 % and 45 % respectively, of the fish released. Kokanee had a median residence time of 0. 20 h and rainbow trout had a median residence time of 1. 07 h. We detected more kokanee in the array at night compared to the day, and we detected more rainbow trout during the day compared to the night. In general, kokanee and rainbow trout approached along the eastern shore and the relative frequency of kokanee and rainbow trout detections was highest along the eastern shoreline of the 3 D array. However, because we released fish near the eastern shore, this approach pattern may have resulted from our release location. A high percentage of rainbow trout (60 %) approached within 35 m of the eastern shore, while fewer kokanee (40 %) approached within 35 m of the eastern shore and were more evenly distributed across the entrance to the third powerhouse cul-de-sac area. During each of <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> light treatments there were very few fish detected within 25 m of <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights. <b>The</b> spatial distribution of fish detections showed relatively few tagged fish swam {{through the center of the}} array where <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights were located. We detected 11 kokanee and 12 rainbow trout within 25 m of <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights, accounting for 10 % and 18 % respectively, of the fish released. Both species exhibited very short residence times within 25 m of <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights No attraction or repulsion behavior was observed within 25 m of <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights. Directional vectors of both kokanee and rainbow trout indicate that both species passed <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights by moving in a downstream direction and slightly towards the third powerhouse. We statistically analyzed fish behavior during treatments using a randomization to compare the mean distance fish were detected from <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights. We compared treatments separately for day and night and with the data constrained to three distances from <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> light (< 85 m, < 50 m, and < 25 m). For kokanee, the only significant randomization test (of 10 tests) occurred with kokanee during the day for the 3 -On treatment constrained to within 85 m of <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights, where kokanee were significantly further away from <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights than during the Off treatment (randomization test, P < 0. 004, Table 1. 5). However, one other test had a low P-value (P = 0. 064) where kokanee were closer to the lights during the 3 -On treatment at night within 85 m of <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights compared to the Off treatment. For rainbow trout, none of the 11 tests were significant, but one test had a low P-value (P = 0. 04), and fish were further away from <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights during <b>the</b> 6 -On treatment, within 50 m, during the day (Table 1. 5). During 2002, it is unclear whether tagged fish truly had little response to <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights, or whether too few fish near <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights and short residence times prevented us from detecting a behavioral response to <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights. Although fish tended to be slightly further away from <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights during 3 -On and 6 -On treatments compared to the Off treatment, only one of the 21 statistical tests indicated that these differences were significant. However, within 25 m of <b>the</b> <b>strobe</b> lights we may have had little power to detect a difference due to the few fish available for statistical comparison. We detected 32 kokanee and 7 rainbow trout in the tailrace of Grand Coulee Dam, accounting for 30 % and 12 %, respectively of the fish released...|$|R
