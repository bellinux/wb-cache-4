5|$|In 1994, {{an attempt}} was made to {{relocate}} the original quarry where A. fragillimus and other species had been found, using ground-penetrating radar in an attempt to image bones still buried in the ground. This attempt failed because the fossilized mudstone bones were the same density as the surrounding rock, making it impossible to differentiate the two. A study of the local topography also showed that the fossil-bearing rock strata was severely eroded, and probably was so at the time Lucas made his discovery of A. fragillimus, indicating <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skeleton was gone by the time the vertebra and femur were recovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{design was}} adopted by an Act of Parliament in 1813, which {{permitted}} the commissioners to borrow £600,000 for building and construction. The street was intended to have commercial purposes and it was expected <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> income would come from private capital. Nash took responsibility for design and valuation of all properties. Construction of the road resulted in demolishing numerous properties, disrupting trade and polluting the air with dust. Existing tenants had first offer to purchase leases on the new properties. The Treasury supported the proposal because, {{in the aftermath of}} the lengthy Napoleonic Wars, there was an urgent need for the government to create jobs. Government expenditure was low because the design relied heavily upon private developers, such as Nash himself. The buildings were to be let on 99-year leases, as was common at the time, and income could be recouped in the form of ground rent.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{developed}} {{over a period}} of 10 years by Atchison, {{who came up with the}} initial concept after seeing the 1994 Scripps National Spelling Bee and noting <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competitors came from good socioeconomic backgrounds. After completing the script in 1999, Atchison won one of the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting in 2000, which attracted producers Sid Ganis and Nancy Hult Ganis. After an initial inability to secure funding, the project got a second wind as a result of the success of the 2002 documentary film Spellbound. Lionsgate Films undertook the production in 2004 and in the following year it was filmed in South Los Angeles on a budget of over $6 million.|$|E

The people surveyed opined that the number of traffic blockage caused by bad weather has been decreased since the construction. The survey also found that 42% of the trucks using Meghna Bridge transport goods between Dhaka and Chittagong.|$|E

25|$|In 1966 the Taoiseach Seán Lemass visited Northern Ireland in secrecy, {{leading to}} a return visit to Dublin by Terence O'Neill; it had taken four decades to achieve such a simple meeting. The impact was further reduced when both {{countries}} joined the European Economic Community in 1973. With the onset of The Troubles (1969–98) a 1973 referendum showed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electorate in Northern Ireland did want to continue the link to Britain as expected, but the referendum was boycotted by Nationalist voters.|$|E
25|$|There are {{limitations}} {{to the operation}} of the rule of necessity, such as in the case where the disqualification of a member will still leave a quorum of an administrative agency capable of acting. It is also not applicable where the statute provides an alternative forum to the biased tribunal, or where the statute contemplates <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agency can reach a decision. There may perhaps also be a limitation that even the rule of necessity will not justify an adjudicator sitting where actual bias can be shown.|$|E
25|$|Polls {{taken in}} 2012 {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public opinion was still opposed to it, even though Nicolas Sarkozy {{and a few}} other prominent right-wing politicians like Philippe Séguin (candidate to the mayorship of Paris in 2001) Gilles de Robien and Jean-Louis Borloo have stated publicly that they personally supported it, but that they would respect the overwhelming opposition to it within their own parties. In January 2006 left-wing senators again tried to put the bill to allow foreigners to vote on the agenda, but the right-wing majority again blocked it.|$|E

25|$|In April 2006, the {{government}} announced it had completely paid off the last of $96billion of Commonwealth net debt inherited {{when it came to}} power in 1996. By 2007, Howard had been in office for 11 of the 15 years of consecutive annual growth for the Australian economy. Unemployment had fallen from 8.1% at the start of his term to 4.1% in 2007, and average weekly earnings grew 24.4% in real terms. During his Prime Ministership, opinion polling consistently showed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electorate thought his government were better to handle the economy than the Opposition.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} received varied response. A {{survey conducted}} by The Sunday Times found <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citizens were not convinced that frozen pork was as delectable as fresh pork, and opined that the difference in price was negligible. A small percentage of those interviewed were indifferent. According to the Singapore Pork Merchants' Association, about {{seventy percent of the}} pork-consuming population preferred fresh to frozen pork {{at the time of the}} campaign. The Frozen Pork Hotline was deemed a failed project, with virtually nobody calling it. On the other hand, foreign pork merchants from countries including Australia, New Zealand and the United States were very supportive of the campaign as it would help boost their pork sales.|$|E
25|$|In France, the Socialist Party has {{discussed}} extending {{the right to}} vote to foreigners since the early 1980s (it was the 80th proposition of the 110 Propositions for France electoral program of 1981), but as it needed a Constitutional change it was felt {{that it would have been}} blocked by the Senate. The alternative would have been a referendum, but as it was generally assumed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public opinion was against it, it could have resulted in a defeat of the government. On May 3, 2000, a bill was voted on by the National Assembly by the Left and 2 centrist Union for French Democracy deputies, but it was blocked by the Senate.|$|E

25|$|But de Gaulle {{offered to}} accept {{some of the}} reforms the demonstrators sought. He again {{considered}} a referendum to support his moves, but on 30 May, Pompidou persuaded him to dissolve parliament (in which the government had all but lost its majority in the March 1967 elections) and hold new elections instead. The June 1968 elections were a major success for the Gaullists and their allies; when shown the spectre of revolution or civil war, {{the majority of the}} country rallied to him. His party won 352 of 487 seats, but de Gaulle remained personally unpopular; a survey conducted immediately after the crisis showed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country saw him as too old, too self-centered, too authoritarian, too conservative, and too anti-American.|$|E
25|$|Discrimination {{regarding}} {{sexual orientation}} and gender identity and expression has been banned nationwide since 2004. Gays, lesbians and bisexuals {{have been allowed}} to openly serve in the military since 2002. Gender identity and intersex rights in Malta are of the highest standard in the world under the Gender Identity, Gender Expression And Sex Characteristics Act. Same-sex marriage has been legal since September 2017 and prior to that civil unions (which are equal to marriage in all but name, with the same rights and obligations including joint adoption rights) were enacted in April 2014. However assisted reproduction is pending and access to surrogacy is banned for all. A 2015 opinion poll indicated <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public support same-sex marriage, with a significant increase over a decade. Legislation allowing same-sex marriage was approved by the parliament on 12 July 2017.|$|E
25|$|The next day, the Arkansas Secession Convention {{convened in}} the State House in Little Rock. David Walker, who opposed secession, was elected president. The {{convention}} continued in session {{for two and}} a half weeks. Feeling ran high and many fiery speeches were made, but it soon became evident <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> members did not think that the situation at that time called for secession. The convention voted down a resolution condemning Lincoln's inaugural address, and defeated a conditional ordinance of secession. The opinion seemed to prevail that Arkansas should secede only if the Federal government made war on the Confederate States. Still hoping for a compromise settlement that would avoid war, the delegates agreed to go home until after the people had voted on the secession question at a special election to be held in August.|$|E

25|$|On 2 May 1945, Princess Juliana was {{returned}} {{with her mother}} to Dutch soil. Initially they lived in temporary quarters at Anneville just south of Breda. Juliana {{took part in the}} post-war relief operation for the people {{in the northern part of}} the country who had suffered through starvation during the Hunger Winter of 1944–1945, which had taken the lives of many of her countrymen. She was very active as the president of the Dutch Red Cross and worked closely with the National Reconstruction organization. Her down-to-earth manner endeared her to her people so much <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch people would soon want Queen Wilhelmina to abdicate in favour of her daughter. In the spring of 1946 Princess Juliana and Prince Bernhard visited the countries that had helped the Netherlands during the occupation.|$|E
25|$|Presenting a {{high-quality}} genome sequence {{of a female}} Altai Neanderthal, {{it has been found}} that the Neanderthal component in non-African modern humans is more related to the Mezmaiskaya Neanderthal (Caucasus) than to the Altai Neanderthal (Siberia) or the Vindija Neanderthals (Croatia). By high-coverage sequencing the genome of a 50,000-year-old female Vindija Neanderthal fragment, it was later found that the Vindija and Mezmaiskaya Neanderthals did not seem to differ in the extent of their allele-sharing with modern humans. In this case, it was also found that the Neanderthal component in non-African modern humans is more closely related to the Vindija and Mezmaiskaya Neanderthals than to the Altai Neandertal. These results suggest <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> admixture into modern humans came from Neanderthal populations that had diverged (about 80-100kya) from the Vindija and Mezmaiskaya Neanderthal lineages before the latter two diverged from each other.|$|E
25|$|In the 2011 federal {{election}} the NDP won a record 103 seats, becoming the Official Opposition {{for the first}} time in the party's history. The party had a historic breakthrough in Quebec, where they won 59 out of 75 seats. This meant <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party's MPs now came from a province where they had only ever had two candidates elected in the party's history (Thomas Mulcair and Phil Edmonston, and not concurrently) and had not been fully organized since 1990 (see below). The NDP's success in Quebec was mirrored by the collapse of the Bloc Québécois, which lost all but four of its 47 seats, and the collapse of the Liberal Party nationally, which was cut down to just 34 seats, its worst-ever result. This also marked the first time in history where the Liberal Party was neither the government nor the Official Opposition, as the NDP had taken over the latter's role.|$|E
