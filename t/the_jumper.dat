5|$|Myrmecia nigrocincta, {{commonly}} known as <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> ant or jumping jack, is an ant of the genus Myrmecia. The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858. Colonies of this ant are abundant in eastern Australia. Ants of this species {{are known for their}} ability to jump several inches, and they also have a powerful, venomous sting. Rather than foraging on the ground, M. nigrocincta prefer to forage in trees where they are known to pollinate certain flowers.|$|E
5|$|The current New Zealand {{jersey is}} entirely black (currently {{referred}} to as the 'blackest' jersey ever created) except the Adidas logo, the NZRU silver fern on the front and the AIG logo in the lower center (all of which are darkened from previously). The 1884 New Zealand tour to Australia was the first overseas New Zealand rugby tour, and featured clothing very different from today's jersey. Back then, the team donned a dark blue jersey, with gold fern on the left of <b>the</b> <b>jumper.</b> In 1893 the NZRU stipulated at its annual general meeting that the uniform would be black jersey with a silver fern and white knickerbockers. However historic photographs suggest white shorts may have been used instead during these early years. Sometime between 1897 and 1901 there was a change; by 1901 the team met NSW in a black jersey, a canvas top with no collar, and a silver fern.|$|E

25|$|Winmar donated <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> he {{was wearing}} in the {{photograph}} to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in 1998. Prior to the commission's disbanding in 2005, Geoff Clark, the chairman of ATSIC at the time, removed the framed jumper from the commission's offices in Canberra {{to his home in}} Warrnambool, Victoria. Clark was forced to return <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> to Winmar, which was later donated to the National Museum of Australia, where it featured in Off the Walls, an exhibit of Indigenous Australian art. In May 2012, <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> was auctioned by Sotheby's, but was passed in after the bidding reached A$95,000. In September of the same year, Museum Victoria purchased <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> for $100,000, with the intention to display it at the First Peoples exhibition at Melbourne Museum in July 2013. However, the authenticity of <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> has been questioned, with the St Kilda Football Club published a statement in March 2005 suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> given to ATSIC {{may not have been the}} actual jumper worn during the game, citing differences between sponsors' logos present on <b>the</b> <b>jumper.</b> Similar questions were raised prior to the jumper's auction in 2012.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>jumper</b> usually {{features}} 4–6 texture patterns each {{of which}} is about 5–10cm (2–4in) in width, that move down <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> in columns from top to bottom. Usually, the patterns are symmetrical to a centre axis extending down the centre of the front and back panel. The patterns also usually extend down the sleeves as well. The same textured knitting is also used to make socks, hats, vests, and skirts.|$|E
25|$|The 1995 World Cup saw {{the first}} change of the England strip {{in a number of}} years. Instead of the usual all-white kit, an offset red St George's Cross was added to both the front and back of <b>the</b> <b>jumper.</b>|$|E

During the retrial, T-shirts inspired by <b>the</b> <b>jumpers</b> were sold online. Reflecting the high level of public interest in his case, in 2009, Bain was found by Internet search engine Google to be the most-searched-for New Zealander of the past year.|$|R

25|$|Muscles (or other {{actuators}} in non-living systems) do physical work, adding {{kinetic energy}} to <b>the</b> <b>jumper's</b> body over <b>the</b> {{course of a}} jump's propulsive phase. This results in a kinetic energy at launch that {{is proportional to the}} square of <b>the</b> <b>jumper's</b> speed. <b>The</b> more work the muscles do, the greater the launch velocity and thus the greater the acceleration and the shorter the time interval of the jump's propulsive phase.|$|R
25|$|Since 2003, the AFL has marketed {{one round}} each {{year as the}} Heritage Round. Until 2006 Fremantle wore a white {{guernsey}} with 3 red chevrons, to emulate <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> worn by the original Fremantle Football Club in 1885. However, in 2007, the selected round had Fremantle playing Sydney, who also wear red and white. An alternative blue and white striped design was used, based on <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> worn by the East Fremantle Football Club in their 1979 WAFL Grand Final win over the South Fremantle Football Club. This Fremantle Derby still holds {{the record for the}} highest attendance at a football game of any code in Western Australia, with 52,781 attending at Subiaco Oval.|$|E
25|$|Lasca: A {{checkers}} variant on a 7×7 board, with 25 fields used. Jumped {{pieces are}} placed under <b>the</b> <b>jumper,</b> so that towers are built. Only the top {{piece of a}} jumped tower is captured. This variant was invented by World Chess Champion Emanuel Lasker.|$|E
25|$|Parachuting {{disciplines}} such as BASE jumping {{or those}} that involve {{equipment such as}} wing suit flying and sky surfing have a higher risk factor due to the lower mobility of <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> and the greater risk of entanglement. For this reason, these disciplines are generally practiced by experienced jumpers.|$|E

25|$|The main rule {{differences}} between the women's and men's versions of Australian football involves modified tackling rules. Typically aggressive slinging (swinging a player by <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> or throwing the player to the ground) of oppositions players in a tackle is not allowed. Like the men's game, head high contact is strictly not allowed.|$|E
25|$|The song is {{regarded}} {{with a great}} deal of derision from many opposition supporters and equally fierce loyalty from many fans. At the end of the 2010 season, there was speculation that the song would be changed at the same time as <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> and logo was changed, but only a review of the song was announced.|$|E
25|$|All jumping {{involves}} {{the application of}} force against a substrate, which in turn generates a reactive force that propels <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> away from the substrate. Any solid or liquid capable of producing an opposing force {{can serve as a}} substrate, including ground or water. Examples of the latter include dolphins performing traveling jumps, and Indian skitter frogs executing standing jumps from water.|$|E

25|$|Night jumpers {{should be}} made aware of the dark zone, when landing at night. Above 30 meters (100 feet) jumpers flying their canopy have {{a good view of the}} landing zone {{normally}} because of reflected ambient light/moon light. Once they get close to the ground, this ambient light source is lost, because of the low angle of reflection. The lower they get, the darker the ground looks. At about 100 feet and below it may seem that they are landing in a black hole. Suddenly it becomes very dark, and <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> hits the ground soon after. This ground rush should be explained to, and anticipated by, the first time night jumper. Recommendations {{should be made}} to <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> to utilize a canopy that is larger than they typically use on a day jump and to attempt to schedule their first night jump as close to a full moon as possible to make it easier to see the ground.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{promotion}} to the VFL in 1925, North Melbourne {{was forced to}} abandon its royal blue and white striped jumper as it was deemed <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> design clashed with other clubs. During this period a jumper with a V design was used for several years, before the club returned to using its striped jumper combination of royal blue and white which has been used continuously since 1932.|$|E
25|$|A {{skipping}} rope (British English) or jump rope (American English) {{is a tool}} used in the sport of jump rope where one or more participants jump over a rope swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are multiple subsets of jump rope including: single freestyle, single speed, pairs, three person speed (double dutch), and three person freestyle (double dutch freestyle). The events are often separated by gender and age. There are hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. There are a few major organisations that support jump rope as a sport as seen below, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and states do not sanction official events for high school or elementary school. In freestyle events, jumpers {{use a variety of}} basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> every time one of their feet hit the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes. <b>The</b> <b>jumper</b> is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.|$|E

25|$|A {{trampoline}} is a gymnastic {{and recreational}} device {{consisting of a}} piece of taut, strong fabric stretched over a steel frame using many coiled springs to provide a rebounding force which propels <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> high into the air. In a trampoline, the fabric is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs which connect it to the frame. While the trampoline is an old invention which relied on crude and flawed designs, the modern trampoline was invented by George Nissen and Larry Griswold around 1934.|$|E
25|$|The club's current home jumper {{design is}} black and {{features}} a yellow sash running from the top left of <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> to the bottom right. For away games against teams with dark coloured jumpers, the club wears a clash strip with a reverse of this design, a black sash on a yellow base. In its first season, Richmond wore a blue jumper with a thin yellow-and-black sash running from right to left. Between 2011 and 2016, the club guernseys were manufactured by sportswear company BLK, who were known as KooGa Australia prior to 2014, before it went into receivership in November 2016. Puma manufactures the club's on-and-off field apparel.|$|E
25|$|A jumper may {{be either}} {{stationary}} or moving when initiating a jump. In a jump from stationary (i.e., a standing jump), {{all of the}} work required to accelerate the body through launch is done in a single movement. In a moving jump or running jump, <b>the</b> <b>jumper</b> introduces additional vertical velocity at launch while conserving as much horizontal momentum as possible. Unlike stationary jumps, in which the jumper's kinetic energy at launch is solely due to the jump movement, moving jumps have a higher energy that results from {{the inclusion of the}} horizontal velocity preceding the jump. Consequently, jumpers are able to jump greater distances when starting from a run.|$|E

40|$|A hanging jumper beam of a {{transmission}} tower is adopted as a countermeasure against a short fault of jumper conductors under strong winds. However {{it is thought}} that <b>the</b> hanging <b>jumper</b> beam may cause the vibration of transmission tower members due to its weight when <b>the</b> hanging <b>jumper</b> beam starts to vibrate under strong winds. The authors have conducted an excitation test of a strain transmission tower with <b>the</b> hanging <b>jumper</b> beam to comprehend the dynamic behaviors of <b>the</b> hanging <b>jumper</b> beam.
