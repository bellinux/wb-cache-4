25|$|The aim of {{the project}} then is to explore the use of <b>touchless</b> {{interaction}} within surgical settings, allowing images to be viewed, controlled and manipulated without contact {{through the use of}} camera-based gesture recognition technology.

25|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} these problems, as of 2010, non-contact or <b>touchless</b> 3D fingerprint scanners have been developed. Acquiring detailed 3D information, 3D fingerprint scanners take a digital approach to the analog process of pressing or rolling the finger. By modelling the distance between neighboring points, the fingerprint can be imaged at a resolution high enough to record all the necessary detail.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Touchless</b> user {{interface}} is an emerging type {{of technology in}} relation to gesture control. <b>Touchless</b> {{user interface}} (TUI) {{is the process of}} commanding the computer via body motion and gestures without touching a keyboard, mouse, or screen. For example, Microsoft's Kinect is a <b>touchless</b> game interface; however, products such as the Wii are not considered entirely <b>touchless</b> because they are tethered to controllers. <b>Touchless</b> interface in addition to gesture controls are becoming widely popular as they provide the abilities to interact with devices without physically touching them.|$|E

60|$|And if, {{to take a}} case {{similar to}} one already assumed, we suppose a man {{deprived}} of every sense except vision, and of all motion except that of his eyes, it surely cannot be doubted {{that he would have}} a perfect conception of space; and indeed a much more perfect conception than he who possessed touch alone without vision. But of course our <b>touchless</b> man would be devoid of any notion of resistance; and hence space, for him, would be altogether geometrical and devoid of body.|$|E
6000|$|The {{sound of}} wheels died away, but Soames still stood intent; then, {{suddenly}} covering his ears, {{he walked back}} to the river. To come before its time like this, with no chance to foresee anything, not even to get her mother here! It was for her mother to make that decision, and she couldn't arrive from Paris till to-night! If only he could have understood the doctor's jargon, the medical niceties, so as to be sure he was weighing the chances properly; but they were Greek to him--like a legal problem to a layman. And yet he must decide! He brought his hand away from his brow wet, though the air was chilly. These sounds which came from her room! To go back there would only make it more difficult. He must be calm, clear. On the one hand life, nearly certain, of his young wife, death quite certain, of his child; and--no more children afterwards! On the other, death perhaps of his wife, nearly certain life for the child; and--no more children afterwards! Which to choose?.... It had rained this last fortnight--the river was very full, and in the water, collected round the little house-boat moored by his landing-stage, were many leaves from the woods above, brought off by a frost. Leaves fell, lives drifted down--Death! To decide about death! And no one to give him a hand. Life lost was lost for good. Let nothing go that you could keep; for, if it went, you couldn't get it back. It left you bare, like those trees when they lost their leaves; barer and barer until you, too, withered and came down. And, by a queer somersault of thought, he seemed to see not Annette lying up there behind that window-pane on which the sun was shining, but Irene lying in their bedroom in Montpellier Square, as it might conceivably have been her fate to lie, sixteen years ago. Would he have hesitated then? Not a moment! Operate, operate! Make certain of her life! No decision--a mere instinctive cry for help, in spite of his knowledge, even then, that she did not love him! But this! Ah! there was nothing overmastering in his feeling for Annette! Many times these last months, especially since she had been growing frightened, he had wondered. She had a will of her own, was selfish in her French way. And yet--so pretty! What would she wish--to take the risk. 'I know she wants the child,' he thought. 'If it's born dead, and no more chance afterwards--it'll upset her terribly. No more chance! All for nothing! Married life with her for years and years without a child. Nothing to steady her! She's too young. Nothing to look forward to, for her--for me! For me!' He struck his hands against his chest! Why couldn't he think without bringing himself in--get out of himself and see what he ought to do? The thought hurt him, then lost edge, as if it had come in contact with a breastplate. Out of oneself! Impossible! Out into soundless, scentless, <b>touchless,</b> sightless space! The very idea was ghastly, futile! And touching there the bedrock of reality, the bottom of his Forsyte spirit, Soames rested for a moment. When one ceased, all ceased; it might go on, but there'd be nothing in it! ...|$|E

These five factors are water quality, water temperature, chemistry, time, and water pressure generated by the equipment. If these factors are all set properly, vehicles will come out clean and shiny without the chance of vehicle damage caused by brushes.|$|E

Typical uses for Crunchfish <b>touchless</b> technology are devices in an intelligent home as smartphones, tablets, Digital TV, games and other home electronics that have a built-in standard camera. The gesture based functionality adds alternative options to a standard touch interface. The user can for example put a tablet in front of him/her and be free to do mid-air gesture {{with both hands and}} interacting with a media player without touching it. Smartphone users can answer and reject phone calls, start slideshows in photo gallery, use video scrubber etc. without touching the device.
