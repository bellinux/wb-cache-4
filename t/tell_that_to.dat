[...] Both follow simple hard-rock , trading heavy riffing with guitar fills and solos. [...] The album title derives from lyrics in [...] "Long Way to Go". [...] "Caught in a Dream" [...] was the album's second single and features irreverent, tongue-in-cheek lyrics such as [...] "I need everything the world owes me/ I <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> myself and I agree". [...] The first side closes with [...] "Black Juju" [...] by bassist Dunaway, a lengthy {{track in the}} vein of The Doors, and Pink Floyd's [...] "Interstellar Overdrive"—both bands Alice Cooper earlier had opened for—with an organ part derived from Pink Floyd's [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun". [...] The band named the song after a stray dog in Pontiac.|$|E
500|$|Nixon gave {{a speech}} from the rear {{platform}} of the train. He praised {{the size of the}} crowd, stating, [...] "There are four times as many people here than live in the town and more than the number that were here in 1960." [...] The candidate asserted that though his opponent, Vice President Humphrey, claimed that Americans had never had it so good, he should <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> the farmer. Nixon pledged that he would give special attention to agricultural issues and would make the Secretary of Agriculture a farmer's advocate to the White House. He promised to restore order: [...] "The most important civil right is the right to be free from [...] violence." [...] He noted the many youths in the crowd, stating, [...] "Young Americans know their future is at stake. They don't want four more years of the same." [...] He recalled that his father had hailed from Ohio: [...] "his roots are here and mine are too!" [...] As Nixon spoke, Cole observed him, and thought he was a good family man, looking warm and friendly and appearing much as she expected him to. She later stated that she did not even look at the sign until she was teased about it by a classmate, who suggested the sign, [...] "Bring Us Together Again" [...] was about boys, not politics. She kept the dress, but told the media she threw away the sign.|$|E
2500|$|Hawke later {{described}} the hanging as [...] "barbaric", a remark which chilled Australian relations with Malaysia. Relations {{between the two}} nations were reportedly affected for a decade afterwards. In response to the argument that no one has the right to take another's life, then-Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad replied, [...] "You should <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> the drug traffickers." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's true, too; boys, {{put me in}} mind of <b>telling</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> Josh, this evening. Yes, the {{greatest}} landlord in the land must hunt up his creditor, or be sued, all {{the same as the}} lowest tenant." ...|$|R

2500|$|Though {{silent and}} {{reserved}} in public, Wheatstone {{was a clear}} and voluble talker in private, if taken on his favourite studies, and his small but active person, his plain but intelligent countenance, was full of animation. Sir Henry Taylor tells us that he once observed Wheatstone at an evening party in Oxford earnestly holding forth to Lord Palmerston on the capabilities of his telegraph. 'You don't say so!' exclaimed the statesman. 'I must get you to <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> the Lord Chancellor.' And so saying, he fastened the electrician on Lord Westbury, and effected his escape. A reminiscence of this interview may have prompted Palmerston to remark that a time was coming when a minister might be asked in Parliament if war had broken out in India, and would reply, 'Wait a minute; I'll just telegraph to the Governor-General, and let you know.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Your {{mother would}} {{probably}} spank you for <b>telling</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> strangers. But who is Ted?" [...] I said, remembering that a loon is a water-bird that sets up an unearthly shrieking in {{the stillness of}} the night; and the urchin rebuked me with the cheerful disrespect for his seniors which characterizes the Colonial born.|$|R
5000|$|... {{and if it}} {{is cause}} of bitterness, <b>tell</b> me <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> get dressed in black and come.|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't go for to <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> a Bagnio slave like me, Mister Peter. Your greatness {{might have}} made you aware o' that," [...] {{returned}} the sailor quietly.|$|E
6000|$|... "True--true--it is {{very natural}} {{that you should}} prefer hearing me talk about Miss Merton, to hearing me talk about potatoes--I'll <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> Lucy, too, you may depend on it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no going}} on at all. If you <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> your friends they will say you are mad {{and put it in}} the papers. Suppose, now, you prosecute for libel." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'And <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> ME,' she added, 'with your shameful lips? Why don't they whip these creatures? If I {{could order}} {{it to be}} done, I would have this girl whipped to death.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> the monkeys, but you can't {{tell it to}} me," [...] growled Lemuel Husty. Then {{he raised}} his voice: [...] "I say, Baxter! I say, you fellows! Come over here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you have}} come to ask me why I lead this life," [...] said the Hermit, {{frowning}} in a stormy manner. [...] "I never <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> any human being. I will not be asked that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why couldn't you <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> woman <b>to</b> {{send the}} servants, without {{mentioning}} her legacy?" [...] Rothsay asked. [...] "My friend Lepel, {{you have done}} a very foolish thing." ...|$|R
