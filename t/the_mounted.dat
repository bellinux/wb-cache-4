5|$|Godley {{remained}} with the Fusiliers until 1896, {{at which time}} {{he was promoted to}} captain and appointed adjutant of <b>the</b> <b>Mounted</b> Infantry at Aldershot. Later that year he volunteered for service in Mashonaland, where he assisted in the suppression of a rebellion in the province. After serving with the Special Service Battalion of <b>the</b> <b>Mounted</b> Infantry, he returned to England the following year and was promoted brevet major.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mounted</b> police {{influenced}} {{the creation of}} other imperial units during the conflict. Lord Strathcona, the Canadian High Commissioner in London, raised a unit of mounted infantry modelled on the force, believing this would be particularly suitable for taking on Boer scouting parties. Thirty-three serving members of the police joined the unit, including Superintendent Samuel Steel, who became their commanding officer. The Strathconas wore <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> police's Stetson hat {{as part of their}} uniform, while in turn their distinctive boots were adopted by the police as their official footwear in 1901. The South African Constabulary was created in October 1900 to police the recaptured territories; it mirrored <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> police, with its members again wearing the force's Stetson hat; it incorporated forty-two members of <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> police and one of its divisions was commanded by Steele. <b>The</b> <b>mounted</b> police volunteers suffered seven casualties during the conflict. Sergeant Arthur Richardson, a member of the Strathconas, won the Victoria Cross for rescuing a Canadian soldier under heavy fire at Wolve Spruit. In 1904, the Crown renamed the force the Royal North-West Mounted Police to honour its contributions in the war.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel began {{training}} his brigade {{upon arrival}} in Egypt. He was noted for insisting on {{high standards of}} dress and bearing from his troops. The 1st Light Horse Brigade became part of Major General Alexander Godley's New Zealand and Australian Division, along with the 4th Infantry Brigade, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. When {{the rest of the}} Australian and New Zealand Army Corps departed for Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> brigades remained in Egypt â€“ the Gallipoli Peninsula being unsuited to mounted operations. Following heavy casualties {{in the early days of}} the Gallipoli Campaign, however, the light horse were called upon to provide 1,000reinforcements. The British commander in Egypt, Lieutenant General Sir John Maxwell, elected instead to ship <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> brigades to Anzac Cove intact.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, {{the force}} became {{the topic of}} many radio {{broadcasts}} and films. Radio series such as the Renfrew of <b>the</b> <b>Mounted</b> and Challenge of the Yukon continued the portrayal of <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> police as iconic heroes, Challenge later translating onto television in the 1950s as Sergeant Preston of the Yukon. Over 250 films were made about the force in the 20th century, including the highly successful 1936 musical Rose Marie. The popularity of these films finally waned in the 1970s, although this image of the force continued to influence late-20th century television portrayals of the modern Royal Canadian Mounted Police, such as the series Due South which centred on a mounted police constable from the Yukon.|$|E
5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although all agree that {{the position of the}} police in managing the strikes became more difficult as organised labour became better established. <b>The</b> <b>mounted</b> police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 Godley {{attended}} Staff College at Camberley but, {{following the}} outbreak of the Boer War in 1899, ended his studies early to volunteer for service in Africa. Along with other officers of the Special Service Battalion, he helped to raise irregular mounted regiments. Godley was later adjutant to Colonel Robert Baden-Powell and was present during the Siege of Mafeking. He was also chief staff officer to Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Plumer and later commanded the Rhodesian Brigade. In 1900, Godley transferred to the Irish Guards before being appointed to the staff at Aldershot as commander of <b>the</b> <b>Mounted</b> Infantry. Three years later he transferred to Longmoor Military Camp, commanding <b>the</b> <b>Mounted</b> Infantry there until 1906.|$|E

5|$|Many popular novels were {{published}} about <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> police from 1885 onwards, {{and in the}} 20th century over 250 films were made, along with radio and television portrayals. The police were depicted as courageous, disciplined and chivalrous, displaying a sense of fair-play as they brought their suspects to justice. Historians, working from initially limited public records and chronicles, wrote similarly eulogistic accounts of <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> police, but as new archives became available in the 1970s, more critical and analytic accounts of the force were produced. The force heavily influenced public perceptions of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which used the North-West Mounted Police's image and history {{to help make the}} modern police a popular Canadian national symbol.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Commissioner Perry had {{put forward}} three {{options for the}} future of <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> police: the force could be absorbed into the Canadian military; the remit of the force could be reduced to simply {{policing}} the far north; or the force could be assigned a much wider role in public and secret policing across the whole of Canada. Perry promoted the third option and Arthur Meighen, the acting Minister for Justice, therefore proposed merging <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> police and the Dominion Police, placing them under Perry's command. This idea was turned down by Borden, who believed, incorrectly, that the merger would be unacceptable to Perry, whom he thought still wanted a military future for the force.|$|E

40|$|Conodont {{data from}} the "Banded Mine Sequence" of <b>the</b> <b>Mount</b> Morgan gold-copper deposit shows the {{sequence}} to be late Eifelian (early Middle Devonian), {{the same age as}} the "Banded Mineralised Sequence" of the upper part of <b>the</b> <b>Mount</b> Warner Volcanics of the Dee Range, 14 km to the southeast. Data underpinning this correlation are presented. The very similar lithostratigraphy and now demonstrated chronologic identity of the mineralized sequences in the two areas implies that <b>the</b> <b>Mount</b> Warner Volcanics is a repetition of the Banded Mine Sequence of <b>the</b> <b>Mount</b> Morgan area; a single system of stratigraphic nomenclature may thus be utilized for both areas. Most importantly, this conclusion enhances the prospectivity of <b>the</b> comparatively underexplored <b>Mount</b> Warner Volcanics. Repetitions of <b>the</b> world-class <b>Mount</b> Morgan volcanic-hosted massive sulfide orebody might thus be anticipated to occur in <b>the</b> <b>Mount</b> Warner Volcanics.

5|$|Spanish {{weaponry}} {{and tactics}} differed greatly {{from that of}} the indigenous peoples. This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets, arquebuses and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Horses had never been encountered by the Maya before, and their use gave <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> conquistador an overwhelming advantage over his unmounted opponent, allowing the rider to strike with greater force while simultaneously making him less vulnerable to attack. <b>The</b> <b>mounted</b> conquistador was highly manoeuvrable and this allowed groups of combatants to quickly displace themselves across the battlefield. The horse itself was not passive, and could buffet the enemy combatant.|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{based on}} the 6 -DOF {{coupling}} vibration model of <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system, an optimization algorithm was used to extract the best design parameters of <b>the</b> <b>mounts,</b> thus rendering <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system fully decoupled and frequency well configured, and the optimal parameters were used to design <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system. Subsequently, <b>the</b> vibration response of <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system was simulated and analyzed, considering the influence of transmission excitation and road excitation. The analysis showed that the strength and dynamic characteristics of <b>the</b> front <b>mount</b> were to be improved, and the topological structure of the metal frame was optimized. Finally, the vibration bench {{test was used to}} verify the availability of vibration decoupling and structural topology optimization, with the analysis of acceleration signal and vibration transmissibility of <b>the</b> <b>mounting</b> system.|$|R

5|$|The First Nations in {{the north}} {{typically}} had some prior experience of Europeans, for example through contact with the Hudson's Bay Company, and there was little conflict between the police and these native communities, and few crimes committed. The First Nations typically {{did not like the}} police, however, and often blamed them for wider government policies; for their part, <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> police often regarded the First Nations with contempt. By comparison, <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> police got on much better with the Inuit, who had seen far less contact with Europeans. The force generally took a more liberal, paternalistic attitude towards them, often applying informal justice rather than official laws when the occasional Inuit crime was committed. Members of the First Nations and Inuit were employed to drive police dog sleds and cook for their patrols.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mounted</b> police {{assisted}} {{in the construction of}} the Canadian Pacific Railway, including relocating indigenous communities living along the route. The force established a wide network of posts and patrols, enabling them to protect and assist the ranchers who created huge cattle businesses across the prairies. The living conditions of the police on the prairies were spartan and often uncomfortable, and only slowly improved over the course of the century. Meanwhile, the railway enabled more settlers to migrate west, creating new towns and industries, while the force restricted the First Nations to the reservations. <b>The</b> <b>mounted</b> police faced challenges in adapting to the changing situation, especially when applying the unpopular prohibition laws to the white community. The force also became drawn into the growing number of industrial disputes between organised labour and company owners.|$|E

5|$|The new {{industrial}} workforce often {{lived and}} worked under very poor conditions, and enjoyed few employment rights. Workers who left their jobs in protest could find themselves arrested by <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> police {{under the terms of}} the Masters and Servants Act for deserting their employment, or alternatively detained under the vagrancy laws. Although the position of organised labour was weak in Canada â€“ the trade unions only had very limited legal rights â€“ the number of industrial disputes grew significantly over this period. The resulting lockouts and strikes sometimes required armed government intervention. The militia was most commonly used for this purpose, but <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> police were cheaper to deploy and were considered to be more politically reliable.|$|E
5|$|The {{same three}} brigades â€“ one mounted rifle, one light horse and one Yeomanry, with the 10th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) {{supporting}} the Yeomanry â€“ moved {{to attack the}} German and Ottoman position at Oghratina, but the rearguard position was again found to be too strong. Lacking the support of infantry or heavy artillery, <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> force {{was too small to}} capture this strong rearguard position, but the threat from <b>the</b> <b>mounted</b> advance was enough to force the hostile force to evacuate the position.
