40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In 1990 {{the skin}} source {{measuring}} bridge was proposed {{as a tool}} to measure (1) the distance between the interstitial implant and the overlying skin during brachytherapy boost treatment as well as (2) the distances between the lateral source end and the exit point of the guide needle. The present study reports on the clinical experience using the source skin measuring bridge with respect to incidence and grade of <b>teleangiectasia,</b> and their relation to source skin distances and doses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-two breast cancer patients (229 breasts) treated between 1983 and 1996 with breast conserving therapy including a brachytherapy boost were scored on the occurrence of <b>teleangiectasia.</b> The minimum distance between the sources (above implant and laterally) and the skin surface were measured. RESULTS: If no bridge was used the appearance of <b>teleangiectasia</b> in the epiderm above the implant is 77, 63 and 50 % for boost doses of 25, 20 and 15 Gy, respectively. For brachytherapy boost doses of 25 and 20 Gy and distances smaller than 10 mm between the implant and the overlying epiderm, as determined with the skin source measuring bridge, the appearance of <b>teleangiectasia</b> was 78 and 46 %, respectively. When respecting provisional dosimetry to spare the skin for a boost dose of 15 Gy, resulting in distances between 10 and 15 mm for the implant overlying skin and distances between 5 and 10 mm for the lateral skin, <b>teleangiectasia</b> can be reduced to a minimum (6. 3 % above and 3. 3 % laterally). While in a univariate analysis several parameters (use of the bridge, boost dose, boost modality, external beam therapy modality) were predictive factors, the use of the bridge remained the only significant variable in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The skin source measuring bridge reduces <b>teleangiectasia</b> after interstitial brachytherapy boost treatment. A hypothesis made previously relating <b>teleangiectasia</b> and source skin distances was verified and extended. Even when 3 D planning is used, the bridge allows for a provisional calculation of the security margins between source positions and the skin at the time of BT implantation to assure a correct needle positioning from the beginning, instead of correcting dwell times later on to avoid unnecessary high skin doses. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary hemorrhagic <b>teleangiectasia</b> (HHT) is {{a genetic}} disorder, {{characterized}} by abnormal vessel formation and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The so-called “Curaçao criteria” are most commonly employed {{for the purposes}} of clinical diagnosis. However, children may not exhibit the full magnitude of symptoms and the Curaçao criteria appear to be less sensitive in this setting. We describe a family, in which two members were clinically diagnosed with HHT and referred for genetic testing. As there were phenotypic features suggesting the high likelihood of combined syndrome of juvenile polyposis with hereditary hemorrhagic <b>teleangiectasia</b> (JPHT), we proceeded with genetic testing of SMAD 4 gene as initial step, which revealed a novel frameshift mutation. This case shows the variety of challenges that clinicians and genetic laboratories may face in complex cases such as combined JPHT syndrome.

Ukupno je analizirane 122 radnika zaposlenih u elektrolizi aluminija, 119 ljevača aluminija i rezultati su uspoređeni s onima dobivenim u 121 neeksponiranog radnika zaposlenog u prometnoj djelatnosti. Teleangiektazije su utvrđene u 47 % pregledanih radnika elektrolize aluminija, dok je postotak teleangiektazije među ljevačima aluminija bio značajno manji (16 %) i bio sličan onome među radnicima u prometu (14 %). Broj teleangiektazija bio je veći što je trajanje ekspozicije bilo duže. U radnika zaposlenih na elektrolizi aluminija, popratna pojava bila je i svrbež kože s pojačanim znojenjem što je vjerojatno povezano s povećanom ekspozicijom fluoridima, a čini se da je ta pojava reverzibilne prirode jer nestaje nakon kratkotrajnog izbivanja s radnog mjesta. Aluminium potroom {{workers are}} exposed to toxic effects of {{numerous}} technological resources. The most abundant and the most adngerous are fluorine and its compounds, especially hydrofluoride, which has toxic effects upon the body as a whole. Skin <b>teleangiectasias</b> develop {{as a result of}} these effects in a considerable number of workers, whereas heavy sweating and diffuse itching are less common. The paper deals with the results of a study carried out among 122 workers working in the electrolytic extraction of aluminium, 119 aluminium rolling mill workers and 121 non-exposed transportation workers. <b>Teleangiectasias</b> were found in 47 per cent of the examined electrolysis workers. Their percentage in rolling mill workers was significantly smaller (16 %) and comparable to the one in transportation workers (14 %). The percentage of <b>teleangiectasias</b> tended to increase with the duration of exposure. Another symptom present among the electrolysis workers was skin diching and heavy sweating which was probably a result of increased exposure to fluorides. The phenomenon seems to have been reversible because it tended to disappear after a short leave of absence from the workplace. Several features of skin <b>teleangiectasias,</b> which can be observed objectively, indicate that they are fully dependent on the concentration of fluorides released into the work atmosphere as well as on exposure time. Objective observation is not possible in cases of heavy sweating and diffuse Itching but there exist strong indications of the relation with fluorides, especially a spontaneous regression during a 7 - 10 -day sick-leave...|$|R

40|$|Inappropriate {{positioning}} of interstitial Iridium 192 implants, used as booster dose {{in the breast}} conserving treatment of mammary cancer, may cause disturbing <b>teleangiectasia</b> of the breast skin, when high radiation doses are delivered on the dermal blood vessels. Based on the localization of the vascular plexuses in human breast skin, and on the dose distribution around different types of interstitial implants, a method is described to avoid overlap between the high dose area of the implant and the {{blood vessels in the}} skin. The latter are demonstrated to run within the first 5 mm under the epiderm. For source lengths varying from 5 to 8 cm, simple mathematical relations exist between the maximal security margin (MSM) and intersource distance (E) for single plane implants (MSM = 0. 4 (E + 1)), double plane square implants (MSM = 0. 4 E) and double plane triangular implants (MSM = 0. 4 (E - 1)). We developed a device to measure precisely the distance between the radioactive wires and the overlying skin, along the whole source trajectory. Using this method, the occurrence of <b>teleangiectasia</b> in the breast skin after interstitial implants with Ir 192 may be significantly reduced. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Background: Blue rubber bleb nevus {{syndrome}} (BRBNS) is a {{rare disease}} characterized by vascular malformations mostly involving skin and gastrointestinal tract. This disease {{is often associated with}} sideropenic anemia and occult bleeding. Methods: We report the case of chronic severe anemia in an old patient under oral anticoagulation treatment for chronic atrial fibrillation. Results: At admission, the patient also presented fever and increased laboratory parameters of systemic inflammation (ferritin 308 mcg/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) 244 mg/L). A small bluish-colored lesion over the left ear lobe was observed. Fecal occult blood test was negative as well as other signs of active bleeding. Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed internal hemorrhoids and multiple <b>teleangiectasias</b> that were treated with argon plasma coagulation. Videocapsule endoscopy demonstrated multiple bluish nodular lesions in the small intestine. Unexpectedly, chronic severe anemia due to systemic inflammation was diagnosed in an old anticoagulated patient with BRNBS. The patient was treated with blood transfusions, hydration, antibiotic treatment, and long-acting octreotide acetate, without stopping warfarin. Fever and inflammation disappeared without any acute gastrointestinal bleeding and improvement of hemoglobin levels at three-month follow up. Conclusions: This is the oldest patient presenting with chronic anemia, in which BRNBS was also diagnosed. Surprisingly, anemia was mainly caused by systemic inflammation instead of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding. However, we would recommend investigating this disease also in old subjects with mild signs and symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Spontaneous {{recurrent}} epistaxis is {{the most}} common clinical manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic <b>teleangiectasia</b> (HHT). It occurs in more than 90 % of HHT patients and {{is the most}} distressing symptom. Nasal teleangiectasias tend to increase with age both in size and number, so epistaxis is heavier and more frequent. For patients with mild to moderate disease, there are many adequate treatment options. For those with severe disease, most treatments offer just a hemorrhage-free interval. Experienced otorhinolaryngologists who treat epistaxis in these patients often use the adage "to do as little as possible for as long as possible". Management of acute epistaxis. The recommendations for the management of acute epistaxis include: compression, use of topical antifibrinolytics, laser therapy, argon plasma coagulation therapy, fibrin sealant spray or gelatin sponge soaked in adrenaline. In cases of heavy acute epistaxis, an epistaxis balloon combined with artery ligation and/or embolization is the most effective treatment. Nasal packing and electrocauterisation should be avoided to prevent further trauma to the blood vessels. Treatment of recurrent epistaxis. Management of recurrent epistaxis includes topical application of laser energy (argon, Nd: YAG, KTP/ 532 and diode, not CO 2), argon plasma coagulation in combination with 0. 1 % estriol ointment, caustics, antifibrinolytics, bleomycin and sclerosing substances. Systemic estrogen-progesterone at doses used for oral contraception may eliminate bleeding in women with heavy epistaxis. Systemic antifibrinolitics (used with extreme precaution) and septal dermoplasty give good results. The only method which successfully and permanently solves the problem of severe refractory epistaxis in hereditary hemorrhagic <b>teleangiectasia</b> is closure of the nasal cavities. ...|$|E
40|$|Fabry disease (FD), {{which is}} also called {{angiokeratoma}} corporis difusum, ceramide trihexosidosis, and Anderson-Fabry disease, is an X-linked inborn error of metabolism of glycosphingolipid pathway. It {{is caused by the}} deficiency of the the lysosomal enzyme – hydro-lase α-galactosidase A, which results in the accumulation and subsequent tissue deposition of globotriaosylceramide, the glycolipid substrate for α-galactosidase A. The incidence of the disease varies between 1 : 17, 000 to 1 : 117, 000 males in the Caucasian populations. The disease is less common among women, and if present the symptoms are milder. Enzyme replacement therapy of the agalsidase-α or agalsidase-β offers a specific treatment for patients with FD. Since 2001 the ERT, using recombinant human a-galactosidase A, has become the most efficient and specific therapy, which address the underlying defect of FD. The guidelines on the ERT greatly vary among countries, the main reason being the high cost of this treatment. Pediatric patients firstly suffer from neurological involvement, manifesting as a persistent, neuropathic pain of the extremities, often misdiagnosed as a “growing pain”, as well as gastrointestinal disor-ders (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting). In the later stages other organs are becoming involved causing multi-organ failure renal insufficiency, cardiovascular impairment, cerebrovascular incidences, cutaneous changes (<b>teleangiectasias,</b> angiokeratomas and lymphoedema), mal-function of sensations organs (cornea verticillata, retinal vascular tortuosity) and other symptom like anhidrosis, sweating problems, hea...|$|R
40|$|In 1980, the American College of Rheumatology {{proposed}} the first criteria as tentative for {{the diagnosis of}} scleroderma systematica (SDS). These criteria were aimed at revealing the comprehensive picture of mainly the diffuse form of the disease. They could not timely make a diagnosis in the low manifestive forms of the disease or virtually reveal its early stages that were most therapeutically promising. The review traces the evolution of approaches to diagnosing SDS and considers the novel classification criteria elaborated to select patients for epidemiological surveys and clinical trials. They include 8 parameters, each having scores. Skin thickening on both hands above the metacarpophalangeal articulations was highest (9 scores). The clinical variants of skin thickening on the fingers as its swelling (2 scores) or sclerodactyly (4 scores) are estimated from the maximum scores, as digital ischemia (sores, 2 scores; cicatricles, 3 scores). <b>Teleangiectasias</b> and characteristic capillaroscopic changes, as well as leading lung injury (pulmonary hypertension and/or interstitial lung disease) are rated as 2 scores each.

40|$|AbstractMetageria is a {{generalized}} form of acrogeria {{belonging to the}} group of premature aging syndromes and is characterized by loss of subcutaneous fat, thinning of the dermis, multiple <b>teleangiectasias</b> and mottled hyperpigmentation. The skin changes present suggest that an altered formation of extracellular matrix might be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Fibroblasts obtained from the skin of a patient with this disease revealed a marked reduction of type I collagen expression to about 20 % of control levels both at the mRNA and protein level. In addition decreased decorin but unchanged type IV collagen and fibronectin mRNA levels were found. Similar although less pronounced changes were observed in fibroblasts obtained from the sister of this patient showing skin changes compatible with acrogeria. To further analyze the deficient expression of type I collagen run on analysis was performed revealing a decrease of transcription of type I collagen. Incubation of the cells with transforming growth factor-β, a strong inducer of type I collagen and extracellular matrix formation, restored type I collagen expression both at the mRNA and protein level to amounts comparable with normal skin fibroblasts. These results are consistent with a defect in type I collagen transcription that is readily reversed after incubation with transforming growth factor β. The deficient synthesis of type I collagen and decorin by dermal fibroblasts might thus contribute to an altered formation of the extracellular matrix resulting in the poikilodermic skin changes observed in this patient...|$|R

We report a face-transplant patient who developed cutaneous clinicopathologic changes suggestive of CR. Methods. The recipient was a 27 -year-old man with severe disfigurement of the lower face due to a pyrotechnic explosion. He received a facial allograft, including mandible, cheeks, lips, and chin, in November 2009. Immunosuppression included antithymocyte globulins and bone-marrow infusion then steroids, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Results. During the first posttransplant year the acute rejection episodes were characterized by reversible oedema and erythema of the graft. Subsequently, the patient developed primary asymptomatic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, followed by EBV+ B-cell lymphoma and hepatic EBV-associated posttransplant smooth muscle tumors; therefore, the immunosuppressive treatment was greatly reduced. Since the second posttransplant year, the allografted facial skin became progressively sclerotic and presented pigmented macules on a background of hypopigmentation and <b>teleangiectasias,</b> resulting in a poikilodermatous aspect. Skin biopsies showed epidermal atrophy, basal cell vacuolization, and diffuse dermal sclerosis in the absence of significant dermal cell infiltration. The dermal capillaries showed thickened walls and narrowed lumina, whereas the large vessels did not show significant alterations. Neither donor-specific antibodies nor vascular Cd 4 deposits were detected. A dysfunction of the graft functions occurred. It was evidenced by a decrease in mouth opening and modification of some phonemes although lip closure was still possible allowing food intake. Conclusions.

Diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome remains a challenge and it is often delayed. Objectives. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize patients with CS and define the most sensitive, primary diagnostic tools for CS. Material and methods. 26 consecutive patients admitted to the Department because of carcinoid-like symptoms. Diagnosis of CS was based on clinical findings and laboratory data (levels of 5 -hydroxyindoloacetic acid). Diagnosis of NEN was based on laboratory findings, imaging studies (US, CT, Gallium- 68 -DOTA TATE PET -CT) and histopathological analysis. CS due to NEN was diagnosed in 16 subjects (NEN –CS). Results. The most common symptoms in non-NEN were increased perspiration, flushes and diarrhea. CgA was elevated (40 %; n = 4) in this group. However, elevated levels of 5 -HIAA and liver lesions were not presented. In the NEN –CS symptoms were reported more often: flush (93. 7 %; n = 15), diarrhea (87. 5 %; n = 14), abdominal pain and teleangiectasis (81. 2 %; n = 13). Elevated CgA and 5 -HIAA were noted in 87. 5 % (n = 14) and 81. 2 % (n = 13) respectively. US and CT revealed liver metastases in all patients.

The neural phenotype of AT includes progressive cerebellar neurodegeneration, which results in ataxia, oculocutaneous <b>teleangiectasias,</b> immunodeficiency, recurrent infections, radiosensitivity and proneness to cancer. No therapies are available for this disease. Experimental studies on mice showed severe degeneration of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive, dopaminergic nigro-striatal neurons, and their terminals in the striatum. The aim {{of the current study}} was to investigate the effects of the levodopa therapy on motor and cognitive performance in AT patients using clinical and psychophysiological evaluation. 3 young AT-patients (age: 12 years) underwent a neurological evaluation and a CNV recording in basal condition (T 0) and at two times points after levodopa therapy (at 4 weeks – T 1 and 8 weeks – T 2). MICARS and UPDRS III scales were administered in order to assess clinical performance and disability. CNV amplitude (total and in two different temporal windows – W 1, W 2) was evaluated. Reaction times were also obtained. Total CNV amplitude (T 0 vs T 2 : Fz p= 0, 03; T 1 vs T 2 : Fz p= 0, 05 Cz p= 0. 07), W 1 (T 0 vs T 2 : Fz p= 0, 06; T 1 vs T 2 : Fz p= 0, 08) and W 2 -CNV areas (T 0 vs T 2 : Fz p= 0, 05, Cz p= 0, 05, Pz p= 0, 05; T 1 vs T 2 : Fz p= 0, 01, Cz p= 0, 04) were significantly higher after 8 weeks of levodopa therapy than during basal condition and at 4 weeks of levodopa therapy. UPDRSIII values significantly improved after 8 weeks of L-dopa therapy (T 0 vs T 2 : p= 0, 004). Our data suggest that levodopa treatment led to a significant improvement in motor performance in AT patients. Additionally, the ability to sustain attention during a double choice motor task appears to ameliorate after levodopa therapy. These results induce us to hypothesize the presence of a dopaminergic dysfunction likely related to a possible involvement of the subcortical networks in AT subjects as suggested by experimental studies. Moreover, from a clinical point of view, these evidences support the potential role of levodopa in the treatment of individuals with ataxia telangiectasia...|$|R

40|$|Hereditary {{haemorrhagic}} <b>teleangiectasia</b> (Rendu-Osler-Weber disease) is an {{inborn error}} of vascular structure with multiple manifestations. Its incidence is about 1 - 2 : 100 000 in the European population. The incidence of telangiectases and/or fistula formation {{was estimated to}} be 1 in 10 carriers of the Osler trait. The findings in the family reported herewith suggest a much higher incidence if angiography is more frequently performed. Apart from the skin and mucous membrane, teleangiectases and/or arteriovenous fistulas may be present in the lungs, intestinal tract, spleen, kidney, brain, and bones. The liver apparently is more involved than was orginally suspected. The vascular derangement includes teleangiectases, arteriovenous fistulas, and connective tissue formation with fibrosis and atypical cirrhosis. In intestinal bleeding laser coagulation seems to be very efficient. The pathogenesis of teleangiectases is not known but involves several factors such as special formation of venules, capillaries and arterioles, abnormal perivascular connective tissue and endothelial cells...|$|E
40|$|When DNA {{replication}} is stalled {{at sites}} of DNA damage, {{a cascade of}} responses is activated in the cell to halt cell cycle progression and promote DNA repair. A pathway initiated by the kinase Ataxia <b>teleangiectasia</b> and Rad 3 related (ATR) and its partner ATR interacting protein (ATRIP) {{plays an important role}} in this response. The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway is also activated following genomic stress, and defects in this pathway cause a cancer-prone hematologic disorder in humans. Little is known about how these two pathways are coordinated. We report here that following cellular exposure to DNA cross-linking damage, the FA core complex enhances binding and localization of ATRIP within damaged chromatin. In cells lacking the core complex, ATR-mediated phosphorylation of two functional response targets, ATRIP and FANCI, is defective. We also provide evidence that the canonical ATR activation pathway involving RAD 17 and TOPBP 1 is largely dispensable for the FA pathway activation. Indeed DT 40 mutant cells lacking both RAD 17 and FANCD 2 were synergistically more sensitive to cisplatin compared with either single mutant. Collectively, these data reveal new aspects of the interplay between regulation of ATR-ATRIP kinase and activation of the FA pathway...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Mastocytosis is a clonal {{mast cell}} proliferative disease, devided into {{cutaneous}} and systemic forms. The characteristic symptoms {{are caused by}} neoplastic mast cell infiltrations in different organs and/or the release of mediators. Aim: The aim of the authors was to summarize their clinical observations in patients with mastocytosis. Method: 22 adult patients diagnosed consecutively with mastocytosis {{were enrolled in the}} study. Skin and bone marrow biopsies were taken to establish the diagnosis and perform c-KIT mutation (D 816 V) analysis. Results: One of the 22 patients had <b>teleangiectasia</b> macularis eruptiva perstans, while 20 / 22 patients had urticaria pigmentosa. All patients had cutaneous lesions. In 12 patients iliac crest biopsy was performed and 9 of them had bone marrow involvement, classified as indolent systemic mastocytosis. The c-kit mutation D 816 V was found in one subject both in skin and bone marrow samples. The patients were treated with antihistamine, PUVA, interferon-alpha or imatinib. Conclusions: The authors draw attention to this rare disease in order to help recognition of relevant signs and symptoms and establish an early diagnosis. Orv. Hetil., 2013, 154, 1469 - 1475...|$|E
40|$|Recent data {{indicate}} that in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic <b>teleangiectasia</b> (HHT), low iron levels due to inadequate replacement after hemorrhagic iron losses are associated with elevated factor-VIII plasma levels and consecutively increased risk of venous thrombo-embolism. Here, we report a patient with HHT, low iron levels, elevated factor-VIII, and recurrent venous thrombo-embolism. A 64 -year-old multimorbid Serbian gipsy was diagnosed with HHT at age 62 years. He {{had a history of}} recurrent epistaxis, teleangiectasias on the lips, renal and pulmonary arterio-venous malformations, and a family history positive for HHT. He had experienced recurrent venous thrombosis (mesenteric vein thrombosis, portal venous thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis), insufficiently treated with phenprocoumon during 16 months and gastro-intestinal bleeding. Blood tests revealed sideropenia and elevated plasma levels of coagulation factor-VIII. His history was positive for diabetes, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, cerebral abscess, recurrent ischemic stroke, recurrent ileus, peripheral arterial occluding disease, polyneuropathy, mild renal insufficiency, and epilepsy. Following recent findings, hypercoagulability was attributed to the sideropenia-induced elevation of coagulation factor-VIII. In conclusion, HHT may be associated with hypercoagulability due to elevated factor-VIII associated with low serum iron levels from recurrent bleeding. Iron substitution may prevent HHT patients from hypercoagulability...|$|E
40|$|Piauçus (Leporinus macrocephalus), {{were raised}} in 300 m² ponds (density of 10 fish/m²) {{presenting}} asphyxia signals and daily mortality of 27 fishes. Specimens with 8 -cm total body length, were collected for necropsy. Mucus of body surface and pieces of organs were collected and examined microscopically, in wet mounts, stained or in histological sections. The smears examination showed the presence of several spores in the secondary lamellae of the gill filaments, identified as Henneguya leporinicola n. sp (Myxozoa: Myxobolidae). Histopatological study showed epithelial hyperplasia and fulfilling of the spaces between the secondary lamellae, congestion and <b>teleangiectasia</b> sinusoidal. It was also observed hyperplasia of the goblet cells and several cysts of parasite with 70. 3 mum diameter. Such cysts were situated among the secondary lamellae, covered or not by the hyperplasic epithelium. With this diagnostic, three applications of formalin solution 10 ml/m³ were carried out. Fifteen days after that, fish were examined again to ascertain whether the treatment was efficient on disease caused by the protozoa. The tissue alterations present in the gills after the treatment were just a moderate sinusoidal congestion and a slight epithelial hyperplasia {{on the base of}} the secondary lamellae...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: in Leber's {{hereditary}} optic neuropathy, increased {{optic nerve}} cupping {{has been reported}} by several authors. Recently, a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation at nucleotide 11778 typically associated with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) was identified in a patient treated for glaucoma but lacking typical signs of LHON. The question arises: should all normal-tension glaucoma patients be further evaluated for LHON? METHODS: we screened 54 unselected patients with normal-tension glaucoma (age range 20 - 96 years, 16 men and 38 women) for the primary mtDNA LHON mutations at nucleotides 3460, 11778 and 14484. RESULTS: none of the patients harboured the mtDNA mutations at nucleotides 3460, 11778 or 14484 (95 % confidence intervals for each mutation ranged from 0 % to 5. 3 %). CONCLUSIONS: primary LHON mtDNA mutations are rare or absent in unselected normal-tension glaucoma patients. Therefore, unselected normal-tension glaucoma patients should not be screened for these mutations. It is probable that only normal-tension glaucoma patients with atypical features (rapid progression, early deep central scotoma, pallor of neuroretinal rim, elevated disc, peripapillary <b>teleangiectasia)</b> or a positive family history of visual loss compatible with a matrilinear transmission should be further evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Among harmful {{environmental}} {{factors that contribute}} to extrinsic aging, long-term effects of repeated exposure to ultraviolet light are the most significant and are referred to as photoaging. Photoaging is a multisystem degenerative process that involves the skin and skin support system. It is a cumulative process and depends primarily on the degree of sun exposure and skin pigment. The epidermis and dermis are both affected by UVB, but the dermis is also affected to a significant extent by UVA. It has long been thought that the majority of human photo-lesions due to UVB rays, now it is believed that UVA play a substantial role in photoaging. Photoaging affects the sun-exposed areas and is characterized clinically by fine and coarse wrinkling, roughness, dryness, laxity, <b>teleangiectasia,</b> loss of tensile strength and pigmentary changes. There is also an increase in development of benign and malignant neoplasms on photoaged skin. During the years the {{progress has been made in}} understanding the photoaging in human skin. UV irradiation invokes a complex sequence of specific molecular responses that damage skin connective tissue. Restriction of UV irradiation and the use of high-protection, broad-spectrum sunscreens may slow progression of photoaging...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} interobserver agreement on Doppler ultrasonographic (US) diagnosis of liver vascular malformations (VMs) in hereditary hemorrhagic <b>teleangiectasia</b> (HHT) and on their severity grading. During the interobserver agreement study, three observers with at least seven years of specific experience using Doppler US for the diagnosis of liver VMs, judged about the presence/absence of liver VMs and their severity {{on a set of}} images and videoclips. Interobserver agreement was estimated with kappa statistics. One-hundred ten cases were reviewed during interobserver study (80 cases with liver VMs, 30 without). Very good kappa values of the interobserver agreement were found for all pairs concerning the distinction between presence and absence of hepatic VMs. All observers demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity in identifying hepatic VMs, with their respective areas under the curve ranging from 0. 97 to 0. 99. Interobserver agreement among the three investigators in staging the hepatic VMs in HHT patients was moderate (Kendall's coefficient of concordance = 0. 26). Study results indicate that Doppler US diagnosis of liver VMs in HHT has a high degree of agreement among ultrasonographers; a moderate agreement was found regarding severity staging...|$|E
40|$|Migraine is a {{recurrent}} disabling disorder predominantly affecting middle-aged women. Migraine occurs {{with or without}} aura symptoms. Several studies have shown an increased prevalence of right-to-left shunts (RLSs) in migraine with aura. The overwhelming majority of these shunts were due to a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Furthermore, migraine with aura is more prevalent in clinical entities associated with a RLS, e. g. cryptogenic stroke, decompression illness in divers, or in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic <b>teleangiectasia</b> and pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas. Retrospective studies have consistently shown that shunt closure {{was associated with a}} significant reduction in migraine frequency. Its beneficial effect seemed to exceed the efficacy of conventional migraine therapy. Several randomized clinical trials to prospectively assess the benefit of shunt closure in migraine patients have been initiated. The only one completed, the MIST trial (Migraine Intervention with STARFLEX Technology), showed a significant reduction of migraine with aura after device implantation, compared with controls. However, the benefit of PFO closure was more modest than expected. This review recapitulates the current data regarding PFO closure and migraine with aura and summarizes in brief the current knowledge regarding migraine pathophysiology and the link to a RLS...|$|E
40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} two DNA repair-defective siblings {{who did not}} belong to any complementation group of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) or Cockayne syndrome (CS). By surveying other photosensitive patients whose fibroblasts showed similar biochemical phenotypes, we found another nonconsanguineous Japanese patient belonging to the same complementation group as our previous cases. Postreplication repair of the cells derived from these patients was normal, indicating that they cannot be classified as XP variant. Neither transfection nor microinjection of the cells with the human DNA repair gene ERCC 1, which is known not to correct any complementation groups of XP or CS, failed to correct the defect of these cells, indicating that they do not belong to the rodent complementation group 1. However, the defect in recovery of RNA synthesis (RRS) after UV irradiation was restored by microinjection of HeLa cell extract. Although clinical manifestations of these patients [...] such as acute sunburn, dryness, freckling, pigmentation anomalies on sun-exposed skin, and <b>teleangiectasia</b> without neurological abnormalities or tumors [...] are similar to a mild XP phenotype, cellular characteristics such as UV sensitivity and defective RRS after UV irradiation with normal unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) are reminiscent of CS. On the basis of these results, we propose that these patients be included under a general category designated "UV-sensitive" (UVs) syndrome...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cutaneous granulomas {{can occur}} in {{patients}} with a primary immunodeficiency disorder. In some cases, an infectious cause cannot be revealed. The pathogenesis of these granulomas still remains to be elucidated. The {{aim of this study}} was to study differences or overlap between these rare granulomas and sarcoidosis-related granulomas. METHODS: Markers for T-cell subsets (CD 3, CD 4, CD 8 and CD 45 RO), Langerhans' cells (CD 1 a), macrophages (CD 68), B cells (CD 20) and NK cells (CD 56) were stained immunohistochemically. The amount of CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells in the granulomas was counted. Results were compared with the CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratio in peripheral blood. RESULTS: In the granulomas of two of three patients with a primary immunodeficiency disorder, the cytotoxic T cells (CD 8 +) outnumbered the T-helper cells (CD 4 +) with a counted CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratio 2. CONCLUSIONS: A lower CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratio was found in the cutaneous granulomas of patients with a primary immunodeficiency disorder (unclassified combined immunodeficiency, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and ataxia <b>teleangiectasia)</b> as compared with the patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis. The possible implications of these findings are discussed in this paper...|$|E
