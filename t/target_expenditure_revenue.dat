The permanently sustainable non-oil primary balance approach suggests the need for significant fiscal adjustment over the medium term, requiring a widening of the tax base. Cross-country comparisons highlight VAT and personal income tax (as well as tax administration) as key areas for reform. The paper also suggests the need for complementary expenditure-side measures in the areas of petroleum pricing and anchoring fiscal policy in non-oil indicators.

Two separate panel data sets that cover the years 1985 - 1992 for matching grants period and 1993 - 1999 for formula based grant period are used for all municipalities. The analysis is done using the VAR method for panel data. I find, first, that there are important dynamic interrelationships between the variables in question. Second, I find that during the matching grants period, <b>expenditures</b> Granger-cause <b>revenues</b> uni-directionally, whereas during the formula based grants system the <b>revenues</b> and <b>expenditures</b> Granger-cause each other.

From the evaluation of profit and PEs, we justify the economic benefit (profit) of DAS.
