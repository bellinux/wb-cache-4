500|$|At {{the end of}} his {{narrative}} of the Quest expedition, Wild wrote of the Antarctic: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> work there is done"; he never returned, closing a career which, like Shackleton's, had bracketed the entire Heroic Age. In 1923 he emigrated to South Africa where, after a series of business failures and dogged by ill health, he was employed in a succession of low-paid jobs. In March 1939 the British Government awarded him an annual pension of £170; Wild commented: [...] "I don't want to grumble, but I think it might have been made big enough for the poor old hero and his wife to live on". Wild died on 19 August 1939, aged 66, the cause of death recorded as pneumonia [...] and diabetes mellitus.|$|E

He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not {{originally intended to}} be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story. [...] "Even though there's {{a part of me}} that would like to go back and do the quick Izzie farewell, [...] " [...] she says, [...] "I also <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> last scene - where Meredith says to Izzie, 'Don't go, we're your family,' and Izzie's response was, 'No you're not, you're just a bunch of people I worked with, and I can find that anywhere' - was kind of tragic and appropriate all at the same time. When I was playing the scene I was really trying to convey that, for Izzie, that was a lie that she had to tell herself to have the courage to have to move on." ...|$|E

500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story.

2500|$|Despite criticisms that Gibson {{deliberately}} added {{additional material}} to the historical accounts of first-century Judea and biblical accounts of Christ's crucifixion, some scholars defend the film as not being primarily concerned with historical accuracy. Biblical scholar Mark Goodacre protested {{that he could not}} find one documented example of Gibson explicitly claiming the film to be historically accurate. Gibson has been quoted as saying: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> first duty is to be as faithful as possible in telling the story so that it doesn't contradict the Scriptures. Now, so long as it didn't do that, I felt that I had a pretty wide berth for artistic interpretation, and to fill in some of the spaces with logic, with imagination, with various other readings." ...|$|E

2500|$|One professor, Dale Brigham, was at {{the center}} of {{controversy}} when he chose to administer a planned exam for Nutritional Science 1034, saying, [...] "If you don’t feel safe coming to class, then don’t come to class... I will be there, and there will be an exam administered in our class," [...] while allowing students an option to take a make-up exam. After some students complained that the professor was not taking the threats seriously, Brigham apologized and offered his resignation, saying, [...] "If my leaders <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> leaving would help, I am all for it. I made a mistake, and I do not want to cause further harm." [...] However, the university turned down the resignation later that day.|$|E

He writes, [...] "There {{is a big difference}} between advocating something and discussing this as a grim likelihood. I am discussing the possible consequences of a hypothetical ethnicity-based spoils system." [...] Heidi Beirich claimed MacDonald blames the deaths of [...] "millions of people" [...] on [...] "the failure of Jewish assimilation into European societies". MacDonald rebutted that he contends that inter-group competition {{is at the root of}} anti-Semitism and bloody conflicts between Jews and non-Jews throughout history: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> critics essentially want me to assert that Jewish behavior is utterly irrelevant to anti-Semitism, and I cannot accept that point of view. I am hardly alone in supposing that Jewish behaviorvery often Jewish successmust be taken into account in any adequate theory of anti-Semitism." ...|$|E
2500|$|La Toya Jackson ended her estrangement {{with the}} entire Jackson family and {{returned}} home to Hayvenhurst.

And I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> father and my mother, they raised children the best way they know how." [...] According to La Toya, Michael knew that she was forced to attack him in the press against her will and he did not blame her. [...] "He never held any of that against me, I remember when I'd got away from this total hell I'd been through where I'd been beaten, abused, controlled and forced to say those terrible things about Michael, which I didn't for a moment believe, he held out his arms and just hugged me. I was crying saying: 'I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.' He just held me tight and said: 'I am your brother, I always knew it wasn't you saying those words." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hathaway {{said that}} [...] "anybody {{who was a}} role model for {{children}} needs a reprieve", although she noted that [...] "it's lovely to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> audience is growing up with me". She replaced Tara Strong and voiced Red Puckett in Hoodwinked!, and sang the song [...] "Great Big World". It is based on the Little Red Riding Hood folktale, which received mixed reviews by critics. Later, she starred in Barbara Kopple's drama film Havoc, as a spoiled socialite, appearing nude in some of its scenes. Although the content of the film was different from her previous films, Hathaway denied that her role was an attempt {{to be seen as a}} more mature actress, citing her belief that doing nudity in certain films is merely a part of what her chosen form of art demands of her; and because of that belief she does not consider appearing nude in appropriate films to be morally objectionable. The film was not released in theaters in the United States due to unfavorable critical reception.|$|E
2500|$|Sundaygar Dearboy {{was born}} in District 2, Grand Bassa County, Liberia. He {{is the father of}} two and the {{guardian}} of several others. Dearboy graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice from AME Zion College. He is the Project Manager for Liberia Trading & Investment Company (LINTRACO), one of Liberia's newest trading groups. Dearboy has a huge following among Liberians in the diaspora, particularly in the United States. In an interview posted on Oberia.net, Sundaygar said: [...] "Outside Liberia, my music is highly appreciated and supported by those who think my music helps virtually transport and reconnect them with their homeland. I find it gratifying that they support me. However, it is very disappointing that such support is not given to my music or artists locally. I also <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> music comes fore front as we rebuild our lives and try to reconsolidate our culture and tradition." [...] Speaking on the challenges currently facing the Liberian Music Industry, Dearboy said: [...] "Not many local artists listen to other music and try to emulate or learn from them. Plus, the local market is not accustomed to promoting what belongs to them. They prefer something from outside. Perhaps, the generally quality of production does not meet the standard as those produced in other countries." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare {{and other}} great writers would {{reference}} {{each other and}} each other's works in their own writing. [...] According to Felicia Jean Steele, Shakespeare uses Petrarchan imagery while actually undermining {{it at the same}} time. Stephen Booth would agree that Shakespeare references Petrarchan works however, Booth says that Shakespeare [...] "gently mocks the thoughtless mechanical application of the standard Petrarchan metaphors." [...] Felicia Steele and Stephen Booth agree that there is some referencing going on, they vary slightly in the degree of Shakespeare's mockery. [...] Steele feels much stronger about the degree in which Shakespeare is discounting Petrarchan ideas by observing that in 14 lines of Sonnet 130, [...] "Shakespeare seems to undo, discount, or invalidate nearly every Petrarchan conceit about feminine beauty employed by his fellow sonneteers." [...] The final couplet is designed to undo the damage Shakespeare has done to his reader's faith that he indeed loves his [...] "dusky mistress." [...] Steele's article offers Stephen Booth's paraphrasing of the couplet: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> love is as rare as any woman belied by false compare." [...] Helen Vendler, who is also referenced in Steele's article states that the final couplet would read; [...] "In all, by heaven, I think my love as rare/ As any she conceived for compare." [...] All three of these authors; Steele, Booth, and Vendler believe that in this couplet, Shakespeare is responding to Petrarchan imagery because other sonneteers actively misrepresent, or [...] "belie" [...] their mistress' beauty.|$|E
