40|$|It is {{well known}} that the long {{distance}} telecom service providers suffered heavy damage {{in the aftermath of the}} telecom bubble. What is it about the telecom industry that drove participants to fall victim of the bubble dynamics despite historical understanding of the destructive consequences of past bubbles? Was the bubble simply the result of a “perfect storm”, or was it an inevitable reflection of industry dynamics? To what degree did the bubble arise from irrational exuberance and misperception of demand growth, and to what degree did it simply reflect pathological emergent behavior arising from individually rational actors? The answer to such questions are interesting historically, but may also help provide insights for regulators and enterprises. The objective of the analysis described in this paper is firstly to use system dynamics to characterize the telecom bubble phenomena, secondly to analyze and understand the mechanism of the telecom bubble, and thirdly to utilize the model to make preliminary recommendations that may help to lower the risk of similar phenomena in the future. The model provided insight into the impact of factors such as <b>technological</b> <b>advancement,</b> misinformation concerning demand growth, competition among network service providers, and the impact of demand forecasting techniques. 1 lntroduction It {{is well known}} that the long distance telecom service providers suffered heavy damage in the aftermath of the telecom bubble.

40|$|Abstract iii The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present a {{specification}} language and its execution mechanism used to define tasks in a networked, distributed computing environment. Because of <b>technological</b> <b>advancements</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> computer hardware and software, computers are increasingly being connected into networks and systems. Machines in a computer network could be used more efficiently if a complex activity comprised of many sub-jobs could be divided and executed on multiple machines. A new type of command file is needed where the underlying interpreting mechanism takes advantage of resources network-wide, detects possibilities for parallel executions of subjobs, and executes them on separate machines. A specification language is presented here that allows a user to create such command files. This file is {{to be called a}} &quot;task file, &quot; and it contains information about which sub-jobs should be executed. It is similar to a batch command file; the difference lies i...|$|E

In addition, non-linear multi-degree-of-freedom bilateral teleoperators along with state observers have become an open research area. In this article, a model-free exact differentiator is used to estimate the full state along with a chattering-free second-order sliding mode controller to guarantee a robust impedance tracking under both constant and an unknown time delay of non-linear multi-degree-of-freedom robots. The robustness of the proposed controller is improved by introducing a change of coordinates in terms of a new nominal reference similar to that used in adaptive control theory. Experimental results that validate the predicted behaviour are presented and discussed using a Phantom Premium 1. 0 as the master robot and a Catalyst- 5 virtual model as the slave robot.

40|$|Constructors must {{effectively}} {{communicate with}} every party {{involved in the}} construction project, visually, orally, in writing, and graphically. In the course of executing their work, contractors use drawings, specifications, and other graphic documents extensively. As building designs have become more comple x and consequently buildings have become more difficult to build, and with increasing popularity of the design-build project delivery system, communicating as effectively as possible among the design/build team is imperative. <b>Technological</b> <b>advancements</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> hardware and software are providing powerful digital graphics tools capable of assisting constructors in this communication.

40|$|The primary gold {{telluride}} minerals {{are represented by}} three distinct species: calaverite (Au 0. 85 Ag 0. 15 Te 2), krennerite (Au 0. 75 Ag 0. 25 Te 2), and sylvanite (AuAgTe 4). All three of these mineral species are historically important ores of gold (and {{to a lesser extent}} silver), and are found in relative abundance within several of the world’s major telluride districts. Detailed studies on the atomic structure of the {{gold telluride}} minerals began in 1935 with work on calaverite. Additional research on krennerite and sylvanite was conducted in the following years. The mineral class was then revisited in 1984, yielding several redeterminations of crystal structure. Through <b>technological</b> <b>advancements</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> analytical technique and structure refinement algorithms, the author sought to again revisit the determination of crystal structure in an attempt to both verify the results of previous investigations, and to attempt to better resolve the atomic structure parameters in the literature. In the course of this research, several structure determinations were performed on euhedral sub-millimeter crystals of calaverite, krennerite, and sylvanite that were harvested from specimens within the University of Colorado’s mineral collection. Structurally, krennerite is the most ordered of these three species. Single crystal structural studies yielded several datasets, including a refinement of the krennerite structure with a reliability factor of 0. 024 - a significantly lower value than was attained in any of the previous studies. Atomic position coordinates derived from this dataset were resolved to a precision of nearly one order of magnitude over that of previous work. In addition to the primary structural studies, research into both crystal chemistry and paragenesis were performed using the specimen which provided the krennerite refinement discussed above. These latter studies provided information as to the specific crystal chemistries of the ore minerals found in the specimen, and also allowed for the determination of the mineralizing sequence of the hydrothermal fluids responsible for producing the krennerite used in the structural refinement. By combining the data derived in the structural study with observations made during these studies, a more coherent picture of the mineralizing system has emerged. Other original work contained in this thesis include the redetermination of the calaverite unit cell, as well as reanalysis of the crystal chemistry of an indeterminate gold telluride phase that contains silver concentrations which lie between the accepted values for either calaverite or krennerite...|$|E
40|$|Pitch {{perception}} {{plays an}} important role in both music and speech perception. <b>Technological</b> <b>advancements</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> hearing aids and cochlear implants (CIs) have helped to improve the speech perception abilities of the hearing impaired. However, pitch-related speech and music perception tasks remain a challenge to both hearing aid users and CI recipients. Existing research suggests that auditory training may be useful for enhancing these perceptual skills. This research developed a computerized pitch-perception training program and evaluated its effectiveness for improving the pitch-related speech and music perception skills of postlingually deafened adult CI recipients (CIA), postlingually hearing impaired adult hearing aid users (HA), and prelingually deafened pediatric CI recipients (CIC). The training program consisted of interactive listening activities using ‘real world’ natural musical instrument sounds and sung vowels. Two versions of the training program were developed, including the Version One training (V 1 T), which employed a fixed level approach and the Version Two training (V 2 T), which used an adaptive level approach. The training groups included 10 HA, eight CIA, and three CIC participants for V 1 T and seven HA, eight CIA, and two CIC participants for V 2 T. The normal hearing control groups included 19 normal hearing adults (NHA) and 12 normal hearing children (NHC). The training groups completed 10 weeks of training at home using the computerized pitch-perception training program. Both training and control groups undertook objective tests on various aspects of pitch-related speech and music perception before and after the training period. In addition, questionnaires were used to obtain the background information related to the participants’ music listening experiences. The training group also filled out a post-training evaluation questionnaire regarding their opinions about the efficacy of the training program. For the CIC group, some parts of the questionnaires were filled out by parents of the CIC participants only and some parts by both of the CIC participants and their parents. The results revealed that both CIA and HA groups showed an improvement following training with either V 1 T or V 2 T. However, V 2 T generally resulted in greater improvements than V 1 T. The pitch perception training from both versions of the program seems to have generalized to the performance of some pitch-related speech and music perception tasks. For both HA and CIA training groups, a statistically significant training effect on pitch-related speech and music perception test scores was observed (p < 0. 05). A general improvement in the subjective perception of the trainees’ abilities in performing the pitch-related speech and music tasks was also observed. The CIC training groups failed to show a significant improvement in any of the perceptual tasks except for the CNC-phoneme test. Overall, more challenging tasks, especially tasks that required more focused attention, resulted in a more noticeable training effect than easy tasks. Results from the subjective evaluation carried out through a post-training evaluation questionnaire generally agreed with the improvements observed in the objective tests. Based on these findings and the feedback from the participants regarding the training program, a final version of the program is being formalized...|$|E
