40|$|Abstract—A novel {{synthesis}} {{method for}} a class of time-domain passive filters that compensates for waveform distortion caused by frequency dependencies of the transmission properties of signal propagation paths, is formulated. The method {{is based on the}} linear response theory and mathematical properties of scattering matrices for passive circuits. This paper focuses on the formulation and theoretical consistency of the method. The causal transfer functions for the filters can be extracted by “regularizing ” the inverse of a transfer function of the path. To fulfill the necessary restrictions imposed on the causal functions, regularization is realized by multiplying the function of linear phase filters comprising a sufficient number of resonators by the inverse. <b>The</b> <b>filter</b> <b>circuits</b> are easily derived from the regularized transfer functions through numerical optimization techniques and the coupling matrix synthesis method to determine transmission poles and extract each lumped element value, respectively.

40|$|An {{oscillating}} overvoltage {{has become}} a common phenomenon at the motor terminal in inverter-fed variable-speed drives. The problem has emerged since modern insulated gate bipolar transistors have become the standard choice as the power switch component in lowvoltage frequency converter drives. Theovervoltage phenomenon {{is a consequence of}} the pulse shape of inverter output voltage and impedance mismatches between the inverter, motor cable, and motor. The overvoltages are harmful to the electric motor, and may cause, for instance, insulation failure in the motor. Several methods have been developed to mitigate the problem. However, most of them are based on filtering with lossy passive components, the drawbacks of which are typically their cost and size. In this doctoral dissertation, application of a new active du/dt filtering method based on a low-loss LC circuit and active control to eliminate the motor overvoltages is discussed. The main benefits of the method are the controllability of the output voltage du/dt within certain limits, considerably smaller inductances in <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> <b>circuit</b> resulting in a smaller physical component size, and excellent filtering performance when compared with typical traditional du/dt filtering solutions. Moreover, no additional components are required, since the active control of <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> <b>circuit</b> takes place in the process of the upper-level PWM modulation using the same power switches as the inverter output stage. Further, the active du/dt method will benefit from the development of semiconductor power switch modules, as new technologies and materials emerge, because the method requires additional switching in the output stage of the inverter and generation of narrow voltage pulses. Since additional switching is required in the output stage, additional losses are generated in the inverter {{as a result of the}} application of the method. Considerations on the application of <b>the</b> active du/dt <b>filtering</b> method in electric drives are presented together with experimental data in order to verify the potential of the method...|$|R
40|$|Brushless PM motors {{are used}} in many {{applications}} because they have advantages of high torque, small size and low maintenance {{due to the lack}} of brushes. Rotor position information is required for current commutation in the windings of brushless PM motors, and for servo feedback control. However, the use of shaft position sensors is not always possible at a reasonable cost. Therefore, a large amount of work has been done on the so-called sensorless control in which rotor position is estimated from the terminal voltages and currents of the motor. However, there are very few papers on design issues such as parameter selection, system stability and robustness, i. e., sensitivity to motor parameter errors. This thesis investigates two existing sensorless techniques of position estimation for surface-magnet brushless motors. The first technique is the one proposed by Barinberg, which is a variant of the well-known Matsui's technique. The thesis presents a practical implementation of the technique using a DSP system. The thesis also presents experimental, analytical and simulation based investigations into the stability and robustness of this system. In the light of these investigations, the thesis recommends some guidelines for the design of the estimator and the selection of its parameters.
