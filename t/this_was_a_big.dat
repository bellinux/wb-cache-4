5|$|In 1992–93, {{the inaugural}} {{season of the}} English Premier League, Norwich City led the league {{for much of the}} season, having been among the {{pre-season}} favourites for relegation, and were eight points clear of the field shortly before Christmas, before faltering in the final weeks to finish third behind the champions, Manchester United, and Aston Villa. They had shown that they were {{a force to be reckoned}} with from the very first day of the Premier League season, achieving an impressive 4–2 away win over an Arsenal side who were among the pre-season title favourites in a race finally won by Manchester United. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> surprise not least to the media and pundits who had tipped Norwich for a season of struggle.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} seven people, and took ten months to make. It was directed by Shu Takumi and produced by Atsushi Inaba, with music by Masakazu Sugimori, character design by Kumiko Suekane, and art by Tatsuro Iwamoto. In 2000, after Takumi had finished his work on Dino Crisis 2, his boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to. Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and felt that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> chance for him to make a mark as a creator.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Shu Takumi, who wrote and {{directed}} the first three games. The first game was conceived in 2000 when Takumi's boss at the time, Shinji Mikami, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to; Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and felt that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> chance {{for him to make}} a mark as a creator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. It was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work, and felt that the main setting of the game should be courtrooms.|$|E

The revelations caused the resignation of the archbishop, Cardinal Bernard Law, and resulted in a $85 million settlement with the victims. With the large Irish and Italian Catholic populations in Boston, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> concern. The diocese, under financial pressure, closed many of its churches.

25|$|Late in 2008 Jennings {{took over}} as head coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore, a team in the Indian Premier League owned by the {{business}} tycoon Vijay Mallya. He was now heading a unit that experienced a forgettable IPL 2008 after finishing 7th on the log among the 8 competing teams. Jennings brought the team together by making Anil Kumble {{the captain of the}} side for the second edition of the IPL that was to start in South Africa. Under Jennings, Royal Challengers Bangalore had success and made it to the finals of the league facing Deccan Chargers in 2009. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> turn around for the franchise and the team who had a bad run the previous season.

500|$|The Allied Air Forces {{had used}} 233,847 rounds of ammunition, and dropped 261 500-pound and 253 thousand-pound bombs. They claimed 19 hits and 42 near misses with the former, and 59 hits and 39 near misses from the latter. Of the 137 bombs dropped in low level attacks, 48, or 35percent, were {{claimed to have}} hit, but only 29, or 7.5percent, of the 387 bombs dropped from medium altitude. This {{compared}} favourably with efforts in August and September 1942 when only 3percent of bombs dropped were claimed to have scored hits. It was noted that the high and medium altitude attacks scored few hits but dispersed the convoy, while the strafing runs from the Beaufighters had knocked out many of the ships' anti-aircraft defences. Aircraft attacking from multiple directions had confused and overwhelmed the Japanese defences, resulting in lower casualties and more accurate bombing. The results therefore vindicated not just the tactics of mast height attack, but of mounting coordinated attacks from multiple directions. [...] The Japanese estimated that at least 29 bombs had hit a ship during the battle. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> improvement over the Battle of Wau back in January, when Allied aircraft attacked a Japanese convoy consisting of five destroyers and five troop transports travelling from Rabaul to Lae, but managed to sink just one transport and beach another.|$|E

The driving [...] "Another Night" [...] or [...] "Are You Ready" [...] are perfect examples of this technique. Nothing is spared to give the production zest". Continuing to give most credit to Hill, The Sunday Times said [...] "Andy Hill's catchy arrangements and slick production have produced a very fine album... {{there are quite a few}} more excellent tracks, especially [...] "Another Night" [...] and [...] "20th Century Hero", while [...] "Now Those Days Are Gone" [...] suggests that the group's vocal talent is a lot stronger than many of us imagined".
