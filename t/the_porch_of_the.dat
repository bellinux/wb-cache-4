5|$|Six {{victims of}} the {{shooting}} were carried to <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brewer house, which was shaded by a tall oak tree. The tree became famously known as the Tragedy Oak. It blew down in a storm in the early 1990s.

5|$|At daybreak on 8 August, six Japanese infiltrators {{hiding under}} <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former British colonial {{headquarters}} {{shot and killed}} three Marines. Within five minutes, other Marines killed the six Japanese with grenades. Later that morning, the Marines, after landing reinforcements {{in the form of}} the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines (2/2), surrounded Hill 281 and the ravine, pounded both locations with mortar fire throughout the morning, and then assaulted the two positions, utilizing improvised explosive charges to kill the Japanese defenders taking cover in the many caves and fighting positions spread throughout the hill and ravine. Employing the improvised explosives, the individual Japanese fighting positions were destroyed. Significant Japanese resistance ended by the afternoon, although a few stragglers were found and killed over the next several days. In the battle for Tulagi, 307 Japanese and 45 U.S. troops died. Three Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner.|$|E

40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} Compton Boulevard looking {{west from}} Alameda Boulevard in Compton, ca. 1885. A wide, dirt road is shown at center, lined heavily on the right by flat-faced two-story {{buildings}} reminiscent of western saloons. In the right foreground, two wheels of a horse-drawn cart can be seen, while farther in pedestrians can be seen exiting <b>the</b> <b>porches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various buildings, one <b>of</b> them holding <b>the</b> reigns <b>of</b> a horse.

25|$|This runestone is in {{the wall}} inside <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church of Roslags-Bro. It is in style Pr1, and it was raised in memory {{of a man who}} died in Virland (in Estonia). The style shows that it was made by the runemaster Torbjörn Skald.|$|E
25|$|The church {{follows the}} typical basilican plan, a nave divided from two lateral aisles, {{in this case}} by sixteen antique columns with pilasters. Other antique columns have been reused: four support the portico on {{the left of the}} nave that leads into the former Benedictine burial ground, planted with ancient cypresses, and four more have been reused by Flaminio Ponzio (1607) to support <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central oratory facing into the burial ground on the far side, which is still {{dedicated}} to Saint Andrew.|$|E
25|$|The {{cross is}} unique on Dartmoor for having spurred limbs {{of a type}} that were popular in the 14th century. It is badly damaged, only the head (missing one arm) being original. A well-preserved cross of the same design, but made of sandstone, is in <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village church in Ermington, about four miles to the south. Spurrell's Cross was {{restored}} with a new shaft by the Dartmoor Preservation Association in 1931, but was later knocked down. It was re-erected by the same organisation in 1954.|$|E

25|$|A {{man with}} a metal press did a fair sort of {{business}}. He set up for business on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotel. He had constructed a die depicting the Hunterdon County courthouse, surrounded by the legend, Hauptmann Trial, Flemington, N.J. On the stand beside the press lay several hundred bright new pennies and several fine strips of copper. By running the copper strips through the press, together with the pennies, he turned out Lincoln heads backed by the courthouse and the legend. The pieces sold for five cents each, three for a dime.|$|E
500|$|Catholic masses {{were held}} in a cottage near the {{cemetery}} from 1848 until {{the building of the}} first Catholic church in the town in Wych House Lane in 1864. [...] This church was enlarged to include the first Catholic school in the town in 1869. The church was later replaced by the modern St Mary's Catholic Church on New King Street (...) in 1890, with the stone cross from the church on Wych House Lane being kept within <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new church.|$|E
500|$|Sergeant Boston Corbett {{crept up}} behind the barn and shot Booth in [...] "the {{back of the head}} about an inch below the spot where his [...] shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln", {{severing}} his spinal cord. Booth was carried out onto the steps of the barn. A soldier poured water into his mouth, which he spat out, unable to swallow. Booth told the soldier, [...] "Tell my mother I die for my country." [...] Unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered his last words as he gazed at them: [...] "Useless... useless." [...] He died on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Garrett farm two hours later.

2500|$|The orchestral {{introduction}} {{is based}} on bell motifs.

As the people sing a great chorus of praise ("Like the beautiful sun in the sky, glory"), a solemn procession of boyars exits the cathedral. The people kneel. Boris appears on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathedral. The shouts of [...] "Glory!" [...] reach a climax and subside. Boris delivers a brief monologue ("My soul grieves") betraying a feeling of ominous foreboding. He prays for God's blessing, and hopes {{to be a good}} and just ruler. He invites the people to a great feast, and then proceeds to the Cathedral of the Archangel to kneel at the tombs of Russia's past rulers. The people wish Boris a long life ("Glory! Glory! Glory!"). A crowd breaks toward the cathedral. The police officers struggle to maintain order. The people resume their shouts of [...] "Glory!" ...|$|E

50|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marshy ground, a {{bell tower}} was not {{incorporated}} in the church building. The separate structure, which houses six bells, is near <b>the</b> north <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church. The structure has been shingled since 1936. Originally there was a single bell, in an open framework; in the 15th century the church bells were put in the framework, and a weatherboard roof was added.|$|R

2500|$|This runestone from c. 1100 is in {{the style}} RAK. It {{is in the}} wall of <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church of Vallentuna.

One interpretation proposed by Jansson is that it means the [...] "Novgorodian sea" [...] and refers to the Gulf of Finland. The runestone provides the earliest Swedish attestation of an end rhyme, whereas the earliest Old Norse attestation is Höfuðlausn composed by Egill Skallagrímsson.|$|E
