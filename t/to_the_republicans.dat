5|$|In 1898, Lane, {{running as}} a Democrat, {{was elected to the}} {{combined}} position of City and County Attorney, defeating California's sitting Attorney General, W. F. Fitzgerald, by 832votes in a year that otherwise saw most offices across the state fall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> He was re-elected in 1899 and 1901.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell {{had decided to}} run for {{political}} office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was a staunch supporter of Richard Nixon and secured victory along with the President in a year favorable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he was one of only a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the President on the judiciary committee.) The damage had already been done, and Bedell defeated Mayne in a 1974 rematch.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his service}} as governor, Fields {{returned}} to Olive Hill and {{was admitted to}} the bar in 1927. Sensing an opportunity for a political comeback in 1930, Fields launched a bid to regain his former seat in the U.S. House, which was now occupied by Republican Elva R. Kendall. Kendall had beaten Fields's successor, Fred M. Vinson in the 1928 Hoover landslide, which saw nine out of eleven (all but the two ancestrally Democratic western Kentucky) U.S. House seats go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E

5|$|Saudis and Jordanians {{provided}} an active {{support to the}} royalists through {{the first years of}} war. The September 1962 coup d'état in Yemen was perceived a threat to the monarchies in both Saudi Arabia and Jordan, prompting shipments of weapons to the royalists, beginning October 1. The support to the monarchists was quickly countered by the Egyptian aid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> rapidly spiraling the country into a full-scale war, as the Republicans called for general mobilization and the Egyptians dispatching troops. On November 4, with the war expanding across North Yemen, the Mecca Radio reported of Egyptian air force attacks on Saudi villages. The same day, a military alliance of Saudi Arabia and Jordan became widely known. Following the Egyptian raids on Saudi Arabia and the official Joint Defense Pact formed between Egypt and the Republicans, the Saudis decided to launch attacks on the Republicans in North Yemen.|$|E
5|$|The next year, 1894, saw {{pay cuts}} and labor disturbances, {{including}} a massive strike by the {{workers at the}} Pullman Company. A group of unemployed workers, known as Coxey's Army, marched on Washington that spring. Weaver met with them in Iowa and expressed sympathy with the movement, {{so long as they}} refrained from lawbreaking. He then returned to the campaign trail, stumping for Populist candidates in the 1894 midterm elections. The election proved disastrous for the Democrats, but most of the gains went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> rather than to the Populists, who gained a few seats in the South but lost ground in the West. During the election, Weaver became friendly with William Jennings Bryan, a Democratic Congressman from Nebraska and a charismatic supporter of free silver. Bryan had lost his bid for the Senate in the election, but his reputation as an exciting speaker made him a presidential possibility in 1896.|$|E
25|$|Carney won {{the seat}} by 16 points, 57%-41%, and took office on January 3 of 2011. His victory {{was one of}} the three seats gained by the Democrats in a year where they {{suffered}} a net loss of 63 seats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E

25|$|Staten Island {{politics}} differ {{considerably from}} the rest of the city, being far friendlier <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> than other boroughs, although Democrats have a substantial plurality in registration. According to the New York State Board of Elections, as of April 1, 2005, there were 119,601 registered Democrats in Staten Island versus only 82,193 registered Republicans.|$|E
25|$|Carr {{had been}} {{considered}} part of the Connally wing of the Democratic Party prior to Connally's surprise defection in 1973 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> A Distinguished Alumnus of Texas Tech, Carr was appointed by his former opponent, Governor Smith, to the university's board of regents and served from 1969 to 1972. He also was state commander of the American Legion.|$|E
25|$|Todd's days in Congress {{would prove}} to be limited, however, as in 1898 his bid for {{re-election}} would be narrowly defeated at the polls by an energized opposition in the predominantly Republican district. Todd dedicated his efforts to an effort to create a liberal state opposition party <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> sitting on the State Central Committee of the Michigan Union Silver Party in 1899.|$|E

25|$|Historian Reinhard H. Luthin {{documents}} {{the importance of}} the Morrill Tariff <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> in the 1860 presidential election. Abraham Lincoln's record as a protectionist and support for the Morrill Tariff bill, he notes, helped him to secure support in the important electoral college state of Pennsylvania, as well as neighboring New Jersey. Lincoln carried Pennsylvania handily in November, as part of his sweep of the North.|$|E
25|$|A rebel force under Colonel Alfonso Beorlegui Canet, sent by General Mola and Colonel Esteban García, {{undertook}} the Campaign of Gipuzkoa from July to September. The {{capture of}} Gipuzkoa isolated the Republican provinces in the north. On 5 September, the Nationalists closed the French border <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{in the battle}} of Irún. On 15 September San Sebastián, home to a divided Republican force of anarchists and Basque nationalists, was taken by Nationalist soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Even after covert {{support by}} France <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> ended in December 1936, the {{possibility}} of French intervention against the Nationalists remained a serious possibility throughout the war. German intelligence reported to Franco and the Nationalists that the French military was engaging in open discussions about intervention in the war through French military intervention in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. In 1938 Franco feared an immediate French intervention against a potential Nationalist victory in Spain through French occupation of Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and Spanish Morocco.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} in Rossio, with the pouring {{of the populace}} into the streets, was very confusing but advantageous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>republicans,</b> given the obvious public support. Machado Santos spoke to General Gorjão Henriques and invited him to keep the role of commandant of the division, but he refused. António Carvalhal, {{known to be a}} republican sympathiser, then received command. Soon afterwards, at 9 o'clock in the morning, the Republic was proclaimed by José Relvas from the balcony of the Paços do Concelho. A provisional government was then nominated, presided by members of the Portuguese Republican Party, with the purpose to govern the nation until a new constitution was approved.|$|E
25|$|The Cowboy Democrats {{did well}} in the 1978 {{election}} and demanded a strong presence on the committees. Martinez turned them down. During the opening session of the House on 16 January 1979 thirty Democrats and three rogue Republicans voted for Martinez. In an unusual move, eleven conservative Democrats allied with twenty-six Republicans to elect the conservative Democrat Gene Samberson speaker by thirty seven votes. Samberson appointed nine Democrats to committee positions. Martinez refused to chair the Votes and Elections Committee, effectively giving control of this committee <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Five of the Democrats who had backed Martinez refused appointments as vice-chairs of committees. The Mama Lucy Gang was out of power.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Teruel {{was fought}} {{in and around}} the city of Teruel during the Spanish Civil War. The combatants fought the battle between December 1937 and February 1938, during the worst Spanish winter in twenty years. The battle was one of the bloodier actions of the war with the city {{changing}} hands several times, first falling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> and eventually being re-taken by the Nationalists. In the course of the fighting, Teruel was subjected to heavy artillery and aerial bombardment. The two sides suffered over 140,000 casualties between them in the two-month battle. It was a decisive battle of the war, as Francisco Franco's use of his superiority in men and material in regaining Teruel made it the military turning point of the war.|$|E

25|$|Richthofen {{employed}} these learned {{tactics and}} operational methods during the Battle of Bilbao, which defeated the Republican {{forces in the}} north of Spain. The motorised logistics also helped during the rapid redeployment to the south, after the surprise Republican offensive at Brunete in July 1937. The air support was vital in defeating the offensive, which was supported by modern aircraft sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> from the Soviet Union. German types like the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter, which replaced the Heinkel He 51, the Do 17 and He 111 helped win and hold air superiority and interdict the battlefield. The Republicans had spent most of their Gold reserves on buying Soviet equipment. With most of that equipment used up, the Condor Legion and Nationalists gained the technological edge.|$|E
25|$|Brown was California's first African American Speaker of the Assembly, {{and served}} in the office from 1981 to 1995. In 1990, Brown helped {{negotiate}} an end to a 64-day budget standoff. In 1994, Brown gained the vote of a few Republicans to maintain the Speakership when the Democrats {{lost control of the}} Assembly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> led by Jim Brulte. Brown regained control in 1995 by making a deal with Republican defectors Doris Allen and Brian Setencich, both of whom were elected Speaker by the Democratic minority. During their tenures, Brown was the de facto Speaker. During the 1990s, Brown dated Kamala Harris, then an Alameda County Deputy District Attorney. There was speculation the two would marry, but Brown broke up with her shortly after being elected Mayor of San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|Though General Secretary Joseph Stalin {{had signed}} the Non-Intervention Agreement, the Soviet Union contravened the League of Nations embargo by {{providing}} material {{assistance to the}} Republican forces, becoming their only source of major weapons. Unlike Hitler and Mussolini, Stalin tried to do this covertly. Estimates of materiel provided by the USSR <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> vary between 634 and 806 aircraft, 331 and 362 tanks and 1,034 to 1,895 artillery pieces. Stalin also created Section X of the Soviet Union military to head the weapons shipment operation, called Operation X. Despite Stalin's interest in aiding the Republicans, the quality of arms was inconsistent. Many rifles and field guns provided were old, obsolete or otherwise of limited use (some dated back to the 1860s) but the T-26 and BT-5 tanks were modern and effective in combat. The Soviet Union supplied aircraft that were in current service with their own forces but the aircraft provided by Germany to the Nationalists proved superior {{by the end of}} the war.|$|E
