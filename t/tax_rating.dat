40|$|The paper {{shows how}} <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> cuts can {{increase}} revenues by improving tax compliance. The intuition is that tax evasion has externalities: tax evaders protect each other, because they tie down limited enforcement capacity.

40|$|This paper assembles a new dataset on {{corporate}} income tax regimes in 50 emerging and developing economies over 1996 - 2007 and analyzes their impact {{on corporate}} tax revenues and domestic and foreign investment. It computes effective <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> {{to take account of}} complicated special regimes, such as partial tax holidays, temporarily reduced rates and increased investment allowances. There is evidence of a partial race to the bottom: countries have been under pressure to lower <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> in order to lure and boost investment. In the case of standard tax systems (i. e. tax rules applying under normal circumstances), the effective <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> reductions have not been larger than those witnessed in advanced economies, and revenues have held up well over the sample period. However, a race to the bottom is evident among special regimes, most notably in the case of Africa, creating effectively a parallel <b>tax</b> system where <b>rates</b> have fallen to almost zero.

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} use of <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> variables in both micro and macro-economic research, measurement of income <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> has largely been ignored. When tax returns are unavailable, income variables are used to compute <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> Measurement error in income and unobserved deductions, exemptions and credits make these inherently noisy measures of true rates. This dissertation reports new survey measures of average (ATR) and marginal (MTR) income <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> from the Cognitive Economics Study (CogEcon). Survey measures are interpreted as <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> perceptions, which are used to correct for survey noise when imputing true rates and then to characterize heterogeneity in misperceptions. Chapter 1 advances a new survey methodology for measuring income <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> Data come from a panel of respondents' reported marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rates,</b> average <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> and income in two subsequent waves of CogEcon. The individual measures of tax beliefs display heterogeneity, even after accounting for income and potential survey noise. Respondents systematically overestimate average <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> and exhibit substantial heterogeneity. Perceptions of marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> are accurate at the mean, but exhibit mean reversion and substantial heterogeneity. Perceptions of marginal and average <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> (conditional on the true rates) vary depending on cognitive ability, general financial knowledge and use of professional tax assistance. Chapter 2 uses a finite mixture model to uncover heterogeneous income <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> perceptions. This paper establishes four new results. First, almost half of respondents do not distinguish between marginal and average <b>tax</b> <b>rates.</b> Second, roughly 30 percent of respondents know the statutory marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> schedule (and answer questions accordingly). Third, among respondents who think all income is taxed at the same rate, roughly 40 percent think all of their income is taxed at the statutory marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rate.</b> Finally, respondents with higher cognitive ability {{are more likely to}} report statutory marginal <b>tax</b> <b>rates,</b> but only among respondents who prepare their own income tax returns...|$|R
