50|$|Adrian D.

5|$|Solar power towers use {{thousands}} of individual sun-tracking mirrors (called heliostats) to reflect solar energy onto a central receiver located {{on top of}} a tall tower. The receiver collects the sun's heat in a heat-transfer fluid that flows through the receiver. The U.S. Department of Energy, with a consortium of utilities and industry, built the first two large-scale, demonstration solar power <b>towers</b> <b>in</b> the desert near Barstow, California.|$|E

5|$|The Rochefoucaulds, who {{had played}} a major role in the fight against the English, now began to ravish Angoulême. Charles VII returned, and this time {{destroyed}} the castle, largely by fire. However, the stones were recovered and the castle rebuilt. In 1446 the Rochefoucaulds managed to obtain the king's pardon and permission to build a defensive wall and two <b>towers</b> <b>in</b> Verteuil to restore the traditional refuge of the villagers. Under this pretext they made the castle among the best defended in France.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} part of Clifton Hall is {{the early}} 16th-century tower wing of the hall, {{often referred to as}} a pele tower. Despite this label, its construction date is relatively late compared to similar fortifications, and it is less robustly designed than equivalent <b>towers</b> <b>in</b> the region.|$|E
5|$|The outer bailey is {{the southernmost}} {{feature of the}} castle; it is {{pentagon}} shaped and there are five towers spaced along the wall, three of which are at corners. North of the outer bailey is the middle bailey which is an irregular polygon; like the outer bailey, {{the wall of the}} middle bailey is studded with towers. The towers allowed the garrison to provide enfilading fire. In the fashion of the time, most of the <b>towers</b> <b>in</b> the curtain walls of the middle and outer baileys were cylindrical. Château Gaillard {{was one of the first}} castles in Europe to use machicolations—stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall. Machicolations were introduced to Western architecture as a result of the Crusades. Until the 13thcentury, the tops of <b>towers</b> <b>in</b> European castles had usually been surrounded by wooden galleries, which served the same purpose as machicolations. An Eastern innovation, they may have originated in the first half of the 8thcentury.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} species are doing well in the {{increasingly}} urbanized Massachusetts. Peregrine falcons utilize office <b>towers</b> <b>in</b> larger cities as nesting areas, and the population of coyotes, whose diet may include garbage and roadkill, has been increasing in recent decades. White-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas {{in the western part}} of Massachusetts, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|A quadrangular castle, Bodiam {{is roughly}} square-shaped. This type of castle, {{with a central}} {{courtyard}} and buildings against the curtain wall, was characteristic of castle architecture in the 14th century. Bodiam Castle {{has been described by}} military historian Cathcart King as the most complete surviving example of a quadrangular castle. There are circular towers at each of the four corners, with square central <b>towers</b> <b>in</b> the south, east, and west walls. The main entrance is a twin-towered gatehouse in the north face of the castle. There is a second entrance from the south; the postern gate is through a square tower {{in the middle of the}} south wall. The towers are three storeys high, taller than the curtain walls and the buildings in the castle which are two storeys high.|$|E
50|$|Construction of the World Trade Center's North <b>Tower</b> began <b>in</b> August 1968, and the South <b>Tower</b> <b>in</b> 1969.

The first tenants moved into the North <b>Tower</b> <b>in</b> December 1970 and into the South <b>Tower</b> <b>in</b> January 1972. Four other low-level buildings were constructed as part of the World Trade Center in the 1970s, and a seventh building was constructed in the mid-1980s.|$|R

5|$|Angkor Wat is {{decorated}} with depictions of apsaras and devata; {{there are more than}} 1,796 depictions of devata in the present research inventory. Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images (–) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately –) more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high <b>towers.</b> <b>In</b> 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewellery and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period.|$|E
5|$|Besides, {{there were}} a number of small posterns. The heads and limbs of {{executed}} criminals were regularly displayed above the ports. Of the six ports, the Netherbow was the only one which took the form of a large fortified gateway. Repairs to the Netherbow are recorded in 1538, and a drawing of 1544 shows the Netherbow as a wide arched gate flanked by two round <b>towers.</b> <b>In</b> 1571, the gateway between the towers was rebuilt, and a central clock tower was added above the gateway, topped by an octagonal stone spire. This structure was repaired in the early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Clock <b>towers</b> <b>in</b> Western Europe in the Middle Ages {{were also}} {{sometimes}} striking clocks. The most famous original still standing is possibly St Mark's Clock {{on the top}} of St Mark's Clocktower in St Mark's Square in Venice, assembled in 1493 by the clockmaker Gian Carlo Rainieri from Reggio Emilia. In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell on which every definite time-lapse is beaten by two mechanical bronze statues (h. 2,60 m.) called Due Mori (Two Moors), handling a hammer. Possibly earlier (1490) is the Prague Astronomical Clock by clockmaster Jan Růže (also called Hanuš) – according to another source this device was assembled as early as 1410 by clockmaker Mikuláš of Kadaň and mathematician Jan Šindel. The allegorical parade of animated sculptures rings on the hour every day.|$|E
