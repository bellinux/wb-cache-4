Fort Crawford was reoccupied, as was Fort Dearborn in Chicago, which had been abandoned in 1823. A new outpost, Fort Winnebago, was built in October 1828 at the portage between the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the bombardment of Ancona was to delay the Italian Army from deploying its forces {{along the border with}} Austria-Hungary by destroying critical transportation systems. The surprise attack on Ancona succeeded in delaying the Italian deployment to the Alps for two weeks. This delay gave Austria-Hungary valuable time <b>to</b> <b>strengthen</b> <b>its</b> Italian border and re-deploy some of its troops from the Eastern and Balkan fronts.|$|E

5|$|Georgia Tech's {{undergraduate}} and graduate programs are divided into six colleges. Collaboration among the colleges is frequent, as mandated {{by a number of}} interdisciplinary degree programs and research centers. Georgia Tech has sought <b>to</b> <b>strengthen</b> <b>its</b> {{undergraduate and}} graduate offerings in less technical fields, primarily those under the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts. That particular College has seen a 20% increase in admissions. Also, even in the Ivan Allen College, the Institute does not offer a Bachelor of Arts degree, only a Bachelor of Science.|$|E
5|$|In late July 1918, Bulgarian {{commander-in-chief}} Nikola Zhekov sent German Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg {{a message}} regarding a rumored Entente offensive, and detailed Bulgaria's inability to adequately defend the Vardar {{portion of the}} front. Zhekov requested that Germany immediately reinforce the Balkan Front, hinting that Austria-Hungary would also be required <b>to</b> <b>strengthen</b> <b>its</b> positions in Albania. On 17 August, Hindenburg pledged to provide Bulgaria with support once the situation on other front permits it. Hindenburg's reluctance to support Bulgaria was also manifested by the early September redeployment of the last German Jäger battalion stationed in Macedonia back into Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{set about}} creating a regional alliance against Rosas, sending a delegation to the region led by Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão (later the Marquis of Paraná), who held plenipotentiary authority. He was assisted by José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later the Viscount of Rio Branco). Brazil signed a treaty with Bolívia in which Bolivia agreed <b>to</b> <b>strengthen</b> <b>its</b> border defenses to deter any attack by Rosas, though it declined to contribute troops to a war with Argentina.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack on}} Ancona was an immense success, and the Austro-Hungarian ships were largely unopposed {{during the entire}} operation.

The newly reformed ACWF was able <b>to</b> <b>strengthen</b> <b>its</b> ability to set up local chapters, but, while other federations were able to resume work in the early 1970s, he ACWF did not resume work {{on a national level}} until 1978.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Lithuania and Germany {{maintained}} a relatively normal relationship {{as they were}} united by anti-Polish sentiment. In January 1928, after long and difficult negotiations, Germany and Lithuania signed a border treaty, which left Klaipėda on the Lithuanian side. However, tensions began rising in the 1930s after the Weimar Republic was replaced with Nazi Germany. An especially tense period came in February 1934 when the Lithuanian government arrested dozens of pro-Nazi activists. In response to these arrests and trials, Germany declared a boycott of Lithuanian agricultural imports. The boycott caused an economic crisis in Suvalkija (southern Lithuania), where farmers organized violent protests. However, after the plebiscite in Saar most of the pro-Nazi prisoners received amnesty. In {{the wake of the}} amnesties, Lithuanian prestige suffered both abroad and in Klaipėda, allowing Germany <b>to</b> <b>strengthen</b> <b>its</b> influence in the region.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 12 July, Vatutin ordered Soviet forces to prevent any further German advance on Prokhorovka, destroy German forces that had {{advanced}} along the northern bank of the Psel River, and stop the III Panzer Corps from making further progress. Orders issued by the German command for 13 July instructed Totenkopf to consolidate its gains of the previous day and then attack into the flank and rear of the Soviet forces around Prokhorovka. Leibstandarte was <b>to</b> <b>strengthen</b> <b>its</b> front line and co-ordinate its attack on Prokhorovka from the south with Totenkopfs attack from the northwest.

5|$|Plagis's {{first major}} {{operation}} was Operation Spotter, {{the first of}} many British endeavours to reinforce the besieged island of Malta in the face of German and Italian assaults during the Battle of the Mediterranean. Malta was considered to be of vital strategic importance, and its defence was looking increasingly precarious in March 1942. Spotter was a plan <b>to</b> <b>strengthen</b> <b>its</b> British garrison with 16 new Spitfire Mk Vs, which would be carried part of the way from Gibraltar on the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle, then flown to Malta; the pilots would then become part of the severely depleted No. 249 (Gold Coast) Squadron. The team of pilots comprised eight British airmen, four Australians, two New Zealanders and two Southern Rhodesians—Plagis and his close friend Pilot Officer Doug Leggo.|$|E

5|$|Abir's rubber {{gathering}} practices made it {{the most}} notorious of all the concession companies for human rights abuses in the Congo Free State. Abir was only involved with primary resource gathering and, despite being owned by European industrialists, operated in a style similar to warlords such as Tippu Tip. Abir was supported in its operations by the Free State which required the enormous profits generated <b>to</b> <b>strengthen</b> <b>its</b> control over the country during its formative years. The concession companies gave the Free State the time and revenue required to secure the Congo and to plan a long-term and more stable program of colonisation. Abir ultimately failed as its harvesting process valued high production over sustainability and it doomed to live out its own boom and bust cycle. Despite this the Abir production model {{was used by the}} French government as the basis for its concession system in the French Congo.|$|E
5|$|By late June and {{throughout}} July, northern Dalmatia saw daily armed skirmishes but no actual combat. Nonetheless, the increasing {{intensity of the}} conflict in the region and elsewhere in Croatia led to the preparation of bomb shelters in Zadar by city officials. Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina (SAO Krajina) authorities called up three Territorial Defence units in the Zadar hinterland on 11 July, one day after another fatal shooting of a Croatian police patrol in the Zadar area, while the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps conscripted the local Serb population in Benkovac <b>to</b> <b>strengthen</b> <b>its</b> ranks {{by the end of the}} month. In late July, a paramilitary group, led by Miro Barešić and formally subordinated to the Croatian Ministry of Defence, conducted several sabotages in the Benkovac area. On 1 August, Croatia deployed two battalions of the ZNG 4th Guards Brigade to Kruševo near Obrovac. Two days later they engaged in combat against the SAO Krajina Territorial Defence and police forces, marking the first such engagement of the Croatian War of Independence in the region. On 26 August, the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps openly sided with the SAO Krajina forces as they jointly attacked Kijevo, expelling all Croats from the village. Another significant setback for Croatia in the region was JNA capture of the Maslenica Bridge on 11 September. That severed the last overland road link between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia. On 1113 September, an attack in the area of Skradin cut water and power supply to Šibenik.|$|E
5|$|From late June through July, {{northern}} Dalmatia saw daily armed skirmishes but {{no actual}} combat; nonetheless, the conflict's increasing intensity {{in the region}} (and elsewhere in Croatia) caused residents of Zadar to build bomb shelters. SAO Krajina authorities called up three TO units in the Zadar hinterland on 11 July (a day after the fatal shooting of a Croatian police patrol in the Zadar area), {{and at the end}} of July the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps began conscripting the Serb population in Benkovac <b>to</b> <b>strengthen</b> <b>its</b> ranks. On 1 August, Croatia deployed two battalions of the ZNG 4th Guards Brigade to Kruševo (near Obrovac); they were involved in combat with the SAO Krajina TO and police forces two days later, the first engagement of the Croatian War of Independence in the region. Growing appetites of the SAO Krajina were announced in mid-August, when Milan Martić, one of its leaders, spoke of a planned conquest of Zadar. Later that month, the JNA openly sided with the SAO Krajina. On 26 August the 9th (Knin) Corps troops and artillery (commanded by chief of staff Colonel Ratko Mladić) attacked the village of Kijevo, advancing with SAO Krajina forces to expel all Croats from the village. Another regional setback for Croatia was the 11 September JNA capture of the Maslenica Bridge, cutting the last overland road link between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia.|$|E
