5|$|Internazionale {{had won the}} European Cup {{in two of the}} {{previous}} three seasons, 1964 and 1965. Pre-match talk focused on Internazionale winning a famous tripletta of European Cups and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> strong favourites going into the game.|$|E
5|$|Today {{those songs}} are {{classics}} but, at that time, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> cutting edge. Eventually I realized {{that most of}} them are threaded by the songwriting tradition of our country. They are Argentine songs. The real avant-garde revolutionizes what it inherits. Almendra was heir to the best Argentine music, and combined its elements without prejudice.|$|E

50|$|In Vedic mythology, Rudras are {{described}} as loyal companions of Rudra, who later was identified with Shiva. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>considered</b> as friends, messengers and aspects of Rudra. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> fearful in nature. The Satapatha Brahmana mentions that Rudra is the prince, while Rudras <b>are</b> his subjects. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>considered</b> as attendants of Shiva in later mythology.|$|R
5|$|A {{large part}} of Mercator's income came from the sales of his {{terrestrial}} and celestial globes. For sixty years <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> to be the finest in the world, and they were sold in such great numbers {{that there are many}} surviving examples. This was a substantial enterprise involving making the spheres, printing the gores, building substantial stands, packing and distributing all over Europe. He was also renowned for his scientific instruments, particularly his astrolabes and astronomical rings used to study the geometry of astronomy and astrology.|$|E
5|$|Croatia {{was first}} {{subdivided}} into {{counties in the}} Middle Ages. Counties were first introduced in Croatia during the House of Trpimirović's rule. The exact number and borders of these early counties are difficult to determine accurately; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> to encompass areas subordinated to a single centre of local authority, but the possessions of significant nobles had a legal status separate from local authority.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, the 27-year-old Rimsky-Korsakov became Professor of Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration) at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, as well {{as leader}} of the Orchestra Class. He {{retained}} his position in active naval service, and taught his classes in uniform (military officers in Russia were required to wear their uniforms every day, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> to be always on duty).|$|E
50|$|Koi {{have been}} accidentally or {{deliberately}} {{released into the}} wild in every continent except Antarctica. They quickly revert to the natural coloration of common carp within a few generations. In many areas, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>considered</b> an invasive species and pests. In the state of Queensland in Australia, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>considered</b> noxious fish.|$|R
50|$|Tramway systems {{also have}} {{departmental}} vehicles, however they sometimes operate under different rules. For example, in Germany, whilst <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>considered</b> secondary vehicles by the railways, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>considered</b> regular vehicles by the tramways and trolleybuses {{and have to}} be operated under the normal regulations that govern the construction and operation of tramways.|$|R

5|$|It is {{so similar}} in {{morphology}} and habits to the carrion crow (Corvus corone), {{for many years}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> by most authorities to be geographical races of one species. Hybridization observed where their ranges overlapped added weight to this view. However, since 2002, the hooded crow has been elevated to full species status after closer observation; the hybridisation was less than expected and hybrids had decreased vigour. Within the hooded crow species, four subspecies are recognized, with one, the Mesopotamian crow, possibly distinct enough to warrant species status itself.|$|E
5|$|Later British super-dreadnoughts, principally the , {{dispensed}} with the midships turret, so weight and volume were freed for larger, oil-fired boilers. The new 15-inch (381-mm) gun gave greater firepower {{in spite of}} the loss of a turret, and there were a thicker armour belt and improved underwater protection. The class had a 25-knot (46-km/h) design speed, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> the first fast battleships.|$|E
5|$|North American forecasters, however {{surprised}} as <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> <b>considered</b> this storm a hurricane immediately upon reviewing the satellite-derived evidence. Since Catarina {{had a clear}} eyewall structure bounded by deep convective, dense central overcast, well-defined spiral outer bands and outflow structure, warm water temperatures of 79°F (26°C), little shear, a warm core low, overall tropical characteristics, and occurred in March (equivalent to September in the Northern Hemisphere, the peak of hurricane season), it {{was considered to be}} a hurricane by the National Hurricane Center in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Sources {{conflict}} on {{the number}} of torpedo tubes originally included in the ships, but it is clear they were located on the berth deck and had above-water ports located on the extreme front and aft and midships. Located too close to the waterline to allow use while moving and vulnerable to gunfire when opened, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> useless and were quickly reduced in number, and removed entirely before 1908.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} {{been implicated in}} the spread of weeds by {{consuming}} and dispersing fruit and seed. In {{the first half of}} the twentieth century, pied currawongs were shot as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> pests of corn and strawberry crops, as well as assisting in the spread of the prickly pear. They were also shot on Lord Howe Island for attacking chickens. However, they are seen as beneficial in forestry as they consume phasmids, and also in agriculture for eating cocoons of the codling moth.|$|E
5|$|Three warrant {{officers}} survived: the gunner and carpenter were spared because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> {{useful to}} the ship, and Southcott the master was spared so he could navigate. Southcott lived {{to be a key}} witness, along with Casey, who was also spared, and their eyewitness accounts and testimony were key to the trials of many of the mutineers. Three petty officers joined the mutiny, one midshipman, Surgeon's Mate Cronin, and Master's Mate Turner.|$|E

30|$|None of the negators and intensifiers is {{included}} in the sentiment lexicon. Consequently, if they appear in a sentence surrounded by only neutral text, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>considered</b> as neutral words. However, if they appear in a neighbourhood of positive or negative words <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>considered</b> as non-neutral given that they influence the final sentiment of a sentence.|$|R
5|$|Today {{herbs are}} {{typically}} {{thought of as}} culinary plants, but in the traditional cottage garden <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> to be any plant with household uses. Herbs were used for medicine, toiletries, and cleaning products. Scented herbs would be spread on the floor along with rushes to cover odors. Some herbs were used for dyeing fabrics. Traditional cottage garden herbs included sage, thyme, southernwood, wormwood, catmint, feverfew, lungwort, soapwort, hyssop, sweet woodruff, and lavender.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Army Material Command (AMC) {{conducted}} a study {{to determine if the}} development objectives were feasible and also established a program office for the Fire-support Aerial System (FAS). AMC recommended to narrow the competition to compound helicopters, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> the only helicopter configuration at the time capable of being developed to meet the objectives. In March 1964, the Secretary of the Army advised DDRE that modification of existing aircraft would not approach the required performance of the FAS program; the Army would continue using the armed UH-1B until development of the FAS could proceed.|$|E
5|$|Captain Merrill T. Kinnecommander of the Port Chicago {{facility}} {{at the time}} of the explosionhad served in the Navy from 1915 to 1922 and had returned to the Navy from civilian life in 1941 to be posted aboard a general cargo ship. Prior to his being sent to command Port Chicago, Kinne had no training in the loading of munitions and very little experience in handling them. White loading officers serving underneath Kinne had not been trained in supervising enlisted personnel or in handling munitions until they had been posted to Mare Island Navy Yard, after which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> adequate to the task by the Navy.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} their large size and similar {{appearance}} to other dangerous sharks like Bull Sharks, there are very few, if any attacks attributed to sandbar sharks and so <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>considered</b> not to <b>be</b> dangerous to people. As a result, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>considered</b> {{one of the safest}} sharks to swim with and are popular sharks for aquariums.|$|R

5|$|Glass beads for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, {{the daughter of the}} prophet Muhammad. Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E
5|$|Han society {{below the}} level of kings was divided into twenty ranks, which awarded certain {{privileges}} such as exemption from certain laws, the nineteenth being a marquess and the twentieth being a full marquess—the difference being the former was only given a pension while the latter was given a marquessate (houguo 侯國)—typically the size of a county. If the kings' sons were grandsons of the emperor, they were made full marquesses; if not, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> commoners. However, this rule was changed in 127 BC so that all the kings' sons were made full marquesses. It is unknown whether early Western-Han marquessates enjoyed the same level of autonomy as early Western-Han kingdoms; by 145 BC, all marquessates' staff were appointed by the central government. The marquess had no administrative role over his marquessate; he merely collected a portion of the tax revenues. His Chancellor was the equivalent of a county Prefect.|$|E
5|$|In England, ruined medieval castles became fashionable {{again in}} the middle of the 18th century. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> an {{interesting}} counterpoint to Palladian classical architecture, and gave a degree of medieval allure to their owners. Some keeps were modified to exaggerate this effect: Hawarden, for example, was remodelled to appear taller but also more decayed, the better to produce a good silhouette. The interest continued and, in the late 18th and 19th century, it became fashionable to build intact, replica castles in England, resulting in what A. Rowan has called the Norman style of new castle building, characterised by the inclusion of large keeps; the final replica keep to be built in this way was at Penrhyn between 1820 and 1840.|$|E
