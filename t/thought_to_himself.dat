Wanderone and Mosconi {{ultimately}} played a one-on-one game of seven-ball; Wanderone won the match. During the exhibition, {{a very quiet}} and genteel Mosconi blocked Wanderone's rough-and-tumble banter by wearing ear plugs; yet that failed to stop Wanderone from putting on a show for his fans. In an interview, Wanderone was asked about his strategy to defeat Mosconi, and replied that he had <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "I'll make [...] on the break and end it... then I'll help carry Willie out on a stretcher." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{that first}} mission, Tibbets saw in {{real-time}} that his bombs were falling on innocent civilians. [...] At the time, he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "People are getting killed down there that don't have any business getting killed. [...] Those are not soldiers." [...] But {{then he thought}} back to a lesson he had learned during his time at medical school from his roommate who was a doctor. [...] This doctor explained to him about his former classmates who failed the program {{and ended up in}} drug sales. [...] The reason why they had failed the program was because [...] "they had too much sympathy for their patients", which [...] "destroyed their ability to render the medical necessities". [...] It dawned on Tibbets that: ...|$|E

I never {{finished}} it", he explained. Afterwards he got a call to provide something to the soundtrack, the singer saw some scenes of [...] "Breaking Dawn" [...] and <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "that song I started might be perfect for this". He admitted to have the tune halfway done before visualizing an early cut of the film and, inspired by its characters, put together the finishing touches. In an interview with Billboard, he went on detail [...] "I just had this melody in my head and basically laid it down after I saw the film." [...] He had to watch [...] "most of the movie" [...] to feel [...] "the vibe", as well as its direction.|$|E

500|$|Jean became show runner of The Simpsons at {{the start}} of the third season (1991) {{together}} with Reiss. A show runner has the ultimate responsibility of all the processes that an episode goes through before completion, including the writing, the animation, the voice acting, and the music. When Jean began his tenure as show runner, the only thing he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> every day was [...] "Don't blow it and screw up this thing everyone loves." [...] The first episode Jean and Reiss ran was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] (aired September 19, 1991), and they felt a lot of pressure on them to make it good. They were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script in order to improve its humor. Jean said he [...] "kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough.'" [...] Reiss added that [...] "we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this." ...|$|E
500|$|Another memorable {{race that}} year for Prost {{was at the}} San Marino Grand Prix. He was {{cruising}} to victory when his car began {{to run out of}} fuel three corners from the chequered flag. Frantically weaving the car back and forth to slosh the last drops of fuel into the pickup, he managed to keep it running just long enough to creep over the line and win the race (Prost commented after the race that when his car started running dry he immediately <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "shit, I am going to lose this race again", referring to his 1985 disqualification at Imola). It happened again at the German Grand Prix: while running in fourth position, Prost's car ran out of fuel on the finishing straight of the last lap. Instead of retiring at a time in the season when points were critical, Prost got out of his car and tried to push it to the finish, to great applause from the crowd. The finish line was too far, though, and he never reached it. He was eventually classified sixth in the race, as the seventh-placed car (the Brabham-BMW of Derek Warwick) was a lap behind.|$|E
500|$|After Obama {{secured the}} nomination, Bayh {{endorsed}} the Senator from Illinois and was {{mentioned as a}} possible running mate. He was included on the initial shortlist, which was then whittled down to four names: Bayh, Senator Joe Biden of Delaware, Governor Tim Kaine of Virginia and Governor Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas. On August 22, the eve of Obama's scheduled unveiling of his running mate, NBC News reported that Bayh and Kaine had been informed {{that they were not}} chosen. Obama opted instead for Biden. Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe later wrote in his book The Audacity to Win, which was published in November 2009, that Bayh had been a [...] "coin toss" [...] away from becoming Obama's running mate. Plouffe and David Axelrod had interviewed the finalists and Plouffe said that Bayh's answers were [...] "substantively close to perfect, if cautiously so." [...] He recalled {{that at the time of}} the interview he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "there's no way this guy will color outside the lines... Bayh's up side and down side are probably the closest spread of the three", compared to Biden, who could [...] "reach higher heights but could cause us real pain." [...] As Obama approached a decision, he told Plouffe [...] "it's a coin toss now between Bayh and Biden, but Kaine is still a distinct possibility." [...] On August 17, Obama told Axelrod simply, [...] "I've decided. It's Biden." ...|$|E

Letterman, who knew Williams for nearly 40 years, recalls seeing him first perform as a new comedian at the Comedy Store in Hollywood, where Letterman and other comedians had already been doing stand-up.

2500|$|Rabbi Johanan {{taught that}} when Jacob {{explained}} his rapid success in obtaining the meat by saying in [...] {{that it was}} [...] "because the Lord your God sent me good speed," [...] {{he was like a}} raven bringing fire to his nest, courting disaster. For when Jacob said [...] "the Lord your God sent me good speed," [...] Isaac <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> that he knew that Esau did not customarily mention the name of God, and if the person before him did so, he must not have been Esau but Jacob. Consequently, Isaac told him in [...] "Come near, I pray, that I may feel you, my son." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{film that}} had a lasting {{impression}} on Panahi was Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948). Panahi has {{said that when he}} first saw this film he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "here is a film that does not lie to me." [...] At the same time Panahi began experimenting with photography and making short films with an 8mm film camera. He also acted in one film and assisted Kanoon's library director in running a program that taught children how to operate a film camera. Starting at the age of twelve, Panahi would work after school in order to afford to go see films. His impoverished childhood helped form his humanistic worldview that would later manifest itself in his films.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1995 autobiography, In the Arena, written {{after he}} became a {{conservative}} Republican, Heston wrote that while driving back from the set of The War Lord, he saw a [...] "Barry Goldwater for President" [...] billboard with his campaign slogan [...] "In Your Heart You Know He's Right" [...] and <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "Son of a bitch, he is right." [...] Heston later said that his support for Goldwater was the event that helped turn him against gun control laws. Following the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, Heston, Gregory Peck, Kirk Douglas, and James Stewart issued a statement in support of President Johnson's Gun Control Act of 1968. The Johnson White House had solicited Heston's support. He endorsed Hubert Humphrey in the 1968 Presidential election.|$|E

Multiple {{requirements}} including the ability for post-Olympics use, a retractable roof, and low maintenance costs, were required of each design. The entry list was narrowed to thirteen final designs. Of the final thirteen, Li Xinggang of China Architecture Design and Research Group (CADG), said after he placed {{the model of the}} [...] "nest" [...] proposal at the exhibition hall and saw the rival entries he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "We will win this."

2500|$|A Midrash {{compared}} {{the words of}} [...] "God led the people about," [...] to a merchant who bought a cow for use in his home and not for slaughter. As the merchant's house was near the slaughterhouse, he <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> that he had better lead the new cow home by another route, for if he led the cow past the slaughterhouse and it saw the blood there, it might turn tail and flee. Similarly, as the inhabitants of Gaza, Ashkelon, and {{the land of the}} Philistines were ready to rise against the Israelites on their departure from Egypt, God thought that the Israelites must not see the battle, lest they return to Egypt, as God says in [...] "Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt." [...] So God led them by another route.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{noted that}} [...] reports that Abraham sent Eliezer to woo Rebekah with ten camels and [...] "having all goodly things of his master's in his hand," [...] but Jacob {{traveled}} to Haran {{without a single}} ring or bracelet. Rabbi Haninah taught that Isaac sent Jacob away empty-handed. Rabbi Joshua, however, taught that Isaac sent Jacob well provided, but Esau arose and stripped him of all he had. The Midrash taught that Jacob then <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> {{that he would not}} lose confidence in God, for as [...] teaches, his help would come from God. As [...] teaches, God would not suffer his foot to be moved ( [...] , la-mot) and the Midrash taught that this meant that God would not allow Jacob to die (la-mayt). As [...] teaches, God would keep him from all evil, and thus from the evil Esau and Laban. And [...] teaches, God would guard his going out, and thus as [...] reports, [...] "Jacob went out from Beer-sheba." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{noted that}} God had already {{informed}} Moses that Pharaoh {{would not allow}} the Israelites to go, as in [...] God told Moses, [...] "I know that the King of Egypt will not allow you to go," [...] and in [...] God told Moses, [...] "I will harden his heart." [...] But Moses did not keep this in mind, but came instead to doubt the wisdom of God's decree, and began to argue with God, saying in [...] "Lord, why have You dealt ill with this people?" [...] For this reason, the Attribute of Justice sought to attack Moses, as [...] says: [...] "And God spoke to Moses" [...] (employing the name of God ( [...] , Elohim) indicative of God's Justice). But when God reflected that Moses only asked this because of Israel's suffering, God retracted and dealt with Moses according to the Attribute of Mercy, as [...] says: [...] "And He said to him: ‘I am the Lord'" [...] (employing the name of God ( [...] , the Tetragrammaton) indicative of God's Mercy). The Midrash viewed the question of Moses in [...] as an application of Ecclesiastes [...] "And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness and folly; for what can the man do who comes after the King? even that which has been already done." [...] The Midrash taught that [...] refers to both Solomon and Moses. The Midrash taught that [...] refers to Solomon, for God gave some commandments for kings, as it says in [...] "Only he shall not multiply horses to himself [...] [...] [...] Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away; neither silver and gold." [...] Solomon read in [...] that the reason of God's decree was [...] "that his heart turn not away." [...] The Midrash taught that Solomon thus <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> that he would multiply his wives but still not allow his heart to turn away. And the Midrash taught that [...] refers to Moses because Moses began to argue with God in [...] "Lord, why have you dealt ill with this people?" [...] On account of this, the Midrash taught that {{at that point the}} wisdom and knowledge of Moses was only (in the words of [...] ) [...] "madness and folly." [...] The Midrash asked what right Moses had to question God's ways and in the words of [...] "that which had been already done" [...] that God had revealed to him.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Hiyya {{said that}} Abram's father Terah {{manufactured}} idols (as [...] implies), and once Terah went away and left Abram {{to mind the}} store. A man came and asked to buy an idol. Abram asked the man how old he was. The man replied that he was 50 years old. Abram exclaimed {{that it was a}} shame that a man of 50 would worship a day-old object. The man became embarrassed and left. On another occasion, a woman came with a plate of flour and asked Abram to offer it to the idols. Abram took a stick, broke the idols, and put the stick in the largest idol's hand. When Terah returned, he demanded that Abram explain what he had done. Abram told Terah that the idols fought among themselves to be fed first, and the largest broke the others with the stick. Terah asked Abram why he made sport of him, for the idols had no consciousness. Abram replied by asking Terah to listen to what he had just said. Thereupon Terah seized Abram and delivered him to Nimrod, king of Shinar. Nimrod proposed that they worship the fire. Abram replied that they should rather worship water, which extinguishes fire. Nimrod agreed to worship water. Abram replied that they should rather worship clouds, which bear the water. Nimrod agreed to worship the clouds. Abram replied that they should rather worship the winds, which disperse the clouds. Nimrod agreed to worship the wind. Abram replied that they should rather worship human beings, who withstand the wind. Nimrod then accused Abram of just bandying words, and decreed that they would worship nothing but the fire. Nimrod cast Abram into the fire, challenging Abram's God to save him from it. Haran was standing there undecided. Haran <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> that if Abram survived, then Haran would say that he was of Abram's faith, but if Nimrod was victorious, then Haran would say that he was on Nimrod's side. When Abram descended into the fiery furnace, God saved him. Nimrod then asked Haran whose belief he shared. Haran replied that he shared Abram's faith. Thereupon Nimrod cast Haran into the fire, and he died in his father's presence, as [...] reports, [...] "And Haran died in the presence of ( [...] , al pene) his father Terah." ...|$|E
