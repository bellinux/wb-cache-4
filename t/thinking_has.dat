25|$|Convergent {{thinking}} {{is often used}} in conjunction with divergent thinking. Divergent thinking typically occurs in a spontaneous, free-flowing manner, where many creative ideas are generated and evaluated. Multiple possible solutions are explored in a short amount of time, and unexpected connections are drawn. After the process of divergent <b>thinking</b> <b>has</b> been completed, ideas and information are organized and structured using convergent thinking to decision making strategies are used leading to a single-best, or most often correct answer. Examples of divergent thinking include using brainstorming, free writing and creative thinking {{at the beginning of the}} problem solving process to generate possible solutions that can be evaluated later. Once a sufficient number of ideas have been explored, convergent thinking can be used. Knowledge, logic, probabilities and other decision-making strategies are taken into consideration as the solutions are evaluated individually in a search for a single best answer which when reached is unambiguous.|$|E

25|$|A foreign {{intelligence}} service, {{similar to the}} Central Intelligence Agency of the United States and MI6 of the United Kingdom, has never been established in Canada. However, {{through a number of}} agencies and through its Foreign Affairs postings, it has provided considerable political and economic intelligence to Ottawa decision makers. Whether most Canadians recognize it or not, this has very much blurred the boundaries as to what is required before a {{foreign intelligence}} service (FIS) is said to exist. For better or for worse, the debate on this topic has not received as much attention in Canada as it has around the world. <b>Thinking</b> <b>has</b> been that, {{due to the lack of}} clear and present danger to Canada, the high cost and political risk involved, such an agency is not a necessity. However, supporters of a dedicated Canadian agency noted that Canada could not rely on its interests coinciding with those of the UK and USA which supplied its intelligence, in contrast to the Cold War period when they shared a common enemy. A dedicated agency might also boost Canada's international standing and increase its global influence.|$|E
500|$|Musically, Remain in Light {{has been}} {{described}} as featuring new wave, post-punk, worldbeat, dance-rock, and different types of funk, specifically afrofunk and avant-funk. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the album as a [...] "dense amalgam of African percussion, funk bass and keyboards, pop songs, and electronics." [...] It contains eight songs that possess a [...] "striking free-associative feel" [...] according to psychoanalyst Michael A. Brog, in that there is no long-lasting coherent thought process that can be followed in the stream-of-consciousness lyrics. David Gans instructed Byrne to be freer with his lyrical content by advising him that [...] "rational <b>thinking</b> <b>has</b> its limits". The frontman included a bibliography with the album press kit along with a statement that explained how the album was inspired by African mythologies and rhythms. The release stressed that the major inspiration to the lyrics was Professor John Miller Chernoff's African Rhythm and African Sensibility, which examined the musical enhancement of life in the continent's rural communities. The academic travelled to Ghana in 1970 to study native percussion and wrote about how Africans have complicated conversations through drum patterns. One of the songs, [...] "The Great Curve", exemplifies the African theme by including the line [...] "The world moves on a woman's hips", which Byrne used after reading Professor Robert Farris Thompson's book African Art in Motion. He additionally studied straight speech, from John Dean's Watergate testimony to the stories of African American former slaves.|$|E

2500|$|Critical thinking: Consists of {{a mental}} process of [...] or {{evaluating}} information, particularly statements or propositions that people have offered as true.

[...] away the extraneous accidents and technology, you are left with {{only a limited number}} of social moods, which tend to recur in a fixed order.

2500|$|The idea of {{convergent}} <b>thinking</b> <b>has</b> been critiqued {{by researchers}} {{who claim that}} not all problems have solutions that can be effectively ranked.

The problem is that when one is dealing with more complex problems, the individual {{may not be able}} to appropriately rank the solutions available to them. [...] In these instances, researchers indicate that when dealing with complex problems, other variables such as one’s gut feeling or instinctive problem solving abilities also have a role in determining a solution to a given problem.|$|E
2500|$|Friedrich Nietzsche, in Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks, {{claimed that}} Anaximander was a pessimist who {{asserted}} that the primal being {{of the world was}} a state of indefiniteness. In accordance with this, anything definite has to eventually pass back into indefiniteness. In other words, Anaximander viewed [...] "...all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance".

2500|$|Deistic <b>thinking</b> <b>has</b> existed since ancient times.

[...] Plato envisaged God as a Demiurge or 'craftsman'. Outside ancient Greece many other cultures have expressed views that resemble deism in some respects.

Bannon has also cited Alexander Dugin's variant of Traditionalism called Eurasianism. Bannon {{has been described as a}} [...] "policy intellectual".|$|E
2500|$|The {{legal status}} of {{targeted}} killing has, in recent decades, become a subject of contention. Historically, {{at least since the}} mid-eighteenth century, Western [...] <b>thinking</b> <b>has</b> generally considered the use of assassination as a tool of statecraft illegal. [...] Some academics, military personnel and officials describe targeted killing as legitimate within the context of self-defense, when employed against terrorists or combatants engaged in asymmetrical warfare. They argue that drones are more humane and more accurate than manned vehicles, and that targeted or [...] "named killings" [...] do not occur in any context other than a declared state of war.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, {{convergent}} <b>thinking</b> <b>has</b> {{also been}} said to devalue minority arguments. [...] In a study where experimental manipulations {{were used to}} motivate subjects to engage in convergent or divergent thinking when presented with either majority or minority support for persuasive arguments, a pattern emerged under the convergent thinking condition where majority support produced more positive attitudes on the focal issue. Conversely, minority support for the argument {{had no effect on}} the subjects. The convergent thinkers are too focused with selecting the best answer that they fail to appropriately evaluate minority opinion and could end up dismissing accurate solutions.|$|E

[...] Nevertheless, the Romanian campaign ended in massive defeat, forcing the Romanian Army and the entire administration to evacuate the southern areas, Bucharest included, in front of a German-led occupation. Iorga's home in Vălenii de Munte was among the property items left behind and seized by the occupiers, and, according to Iorga's own claim, was vandalized by the Deutsches Heer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{notion of}} {{critical}} understanding {{is closely related}} to the concept of Critical Thinking, described as, ‘reasonable reflective thinking focused on deciding what to believe or do.’ Critical <b>thinking</b> <b>has</b> also been described as, ‘thinking about thinking’, specifically in relation to John Dewey’s work on ‘the problem of training thought’. Critical understanding {{has its roots in the}} notion of pluralism, the idea of multiple approaches, methods and interpretations in which dialogue plays an important role. In a pedagogical sense it is closely linked to the theory of Education for Critical Consciousness, outlined by Paulo Freire, Brazilian educator and critical theorist, who wrote, ‘Only dialogue, which requires critical thinking, is also capable of generating critical thinking. Without dialogue there is no communication, and without communication there can be no true education.’ ...|$|E
