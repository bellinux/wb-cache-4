5|$|Isaac Newton, in his Principia Mathematica of 1687, {{proved that}} an object moving under the {{influence}} of gravity must trace out an orbit shaped like one of the conic sections, and he demonstrated how to fit a comet's path through <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> a parabolic orbit, using the comet of 1680 as an example.|$|E

50|$|The manaul is {{a mythical}} king {{who became a}} bird. He was {{believed}} to have caused the seas and <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> <b>to</b> fight against each other. The clash between <b>the</b> seas and <b>skies</b> resulted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> formation of the Philippine islands.|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} animal can {{integrate}} cues of different types to orient themselves and navigate effectively. Insects and birds are able to combine learned landmarks with sensed direction (from the earth's magnetic field or from <b>the</b> <b>sky)</b> <b>to</b> identify {{where they are and}} so to navigate. Internal 'maps' are often formed using vision, but other senses including olfaction and echolocation may also be used.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, and flew to <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.|$|E

50|$|During daylight, <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> appears <b>to</b> be blue because air {{scatters}} more blue sunlight than red. At night, <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> appears <b>to</b> be {{a mostly}} dark surface or region spangled with stars. During the day, the Sun {{can be seen}} in <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> unless obscured by clouds. In <b>the</b> night <b>sky</b> (and <b>to</b> some extent during the day) the Moon, planets and stars are visible in <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Some of <b>the</b> natural phenomena seen in <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> are clouds, rainbows, and aurorae. Lightning and precipitation can also be seen in <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> during storms. Birds, insects, aircraft, and kites are often considered <b>to</b> fly in <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Due <b>to</b> human activities, smog during the day and light pollution during the night are often seen above large cities.|$|R

5|$|Captain Nikos– Featured in the God of War comics #2, #3, and #4, Captain Nikos was a Spartan who Kratos met {{after he}} had slain the Hades Phoenix. Captain Nikos and his men {{assisted}} Kratos in his search for the Ambrosia of Asclepius. Nikos was injured in battle against Poseidon's champion Herodius, but survived. Hades later sent fireballs from <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> stop the Spartan army. As a fireball was about to strike Kratos, Nikos sacrificed himself to save him. Before dying, he passed the rank of Captain to Kratos. During Kratos' second journey, Nikos' corpse, {{and those of other}} Spartans, were reanimated by Hades, but Kratos easily defeated them.|$|E
5|$|In {{interstellar}} astronomy, visible spectra {{can appear}} redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon {{referred to as}} interstellar reddening – similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes the rest of <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> have a blue color. This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects {{and there is an}} additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered {{in and out of the}} line-of-sight.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} of the day between noon and evening. It {{is the time}} when the sun is {{descending}} from its zenith in <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west direction. In human life, it occupies roughly {{the latter half of the}} standard work and school day. It is also associated with a number of concerns related to health, safety, and economic productivity: generally, the early afternoon, after most people have eaten lunch, corresponds to decreased work performance, decreased alertness, and a higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents. It is usually from 12 PM to 6 PM, but during winter it may be from 12 PM to 4 PM and during summer it may be from 12 PM to 8 PM.|$|E

Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship. In Tamil, the word Arunam means red or fire and Asalam means hill. Since Shiva manifested himself in the form of fire in this place, this name Arunachalam came to be associated with Annamalai hill and the town. The first mention of Annamalai is found in Tevaram, the seventh century Tamil Saiva canonical work by Appar and Tirugnanasambandar.|$|E
5|$|It {{seemed to}} the besieged Christians as if arrows were {{shot out of}} <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> strike and humble {{the pride of the}} infidels who rapidly died with marks on their bodies and lumps in their joints and several part, {{followed}} by putrid fever; all advice and help of the doctors being of no avail. Whereupon the Tartars, worn out by this pestilential disease, and falling on all sides as if thunderstruck, and seeing that they were perishing hopelessly, ordered the corpses to be placed upon their engines and thrown into the city of Kaffa. Accordingly were the bodies of the dead hurled over the walls, so that the Christians were not able to hide or protect themselves from this danger, although they carried away as many dead as possible and threw them into the sea. But soon the whole air became infected, and the water poisoned, and such a pestilence grew up that scarcely one out of a thousand was able to escape.|$|E

25|$|The modern ETH— specifically, the {{implicit}} linking of unidentified aircraft and lights in <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> alien life— took root {{during the late}} 1940s and took its current form during the 1950s. It drew on pseudoscience, as well as popular culture. Unlike earlier speculation of extraterrestrial life, interest in the ETH was also bolstered by many unexplained sightings investigated by the U.S. government and governments of other countries, as well as private civilian groups, such as NICAP and APRO.|$|E

25|$|The {{heat of the}} {{explosion}} causes air in the vicinity to become ionized, creating the fireball. The free electrons in the fireball affect radio waves, especially at lower frequencies. This causes a large area of <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> become opaque to radar, especially those operating in the VHF and UHF frequencies, which is common for long-range early warning radars. The effect is less for higher frequencies in the microwave region, as well as lasting a shorter time – the effect falls off both in strength and the effected frequencies as the fireball cools and the electrons begin to re-form onto free nuclei.|$|E
25|$|The columned porch, or talar, {{seen in the}} rock-cut tombs near Persepolis, {{reappear}} in Sassanid temples, and in late Islamic {{times it}} {{was used as the}} portico of a palace or mosque, and adapted even to the architecture of roadside tea-houses. Similarly, the dome on four arches, so characteristic of Sassanid times, is a still to be found in many cemeteries and Imamzadehs across Iran today. The notion of earthly towers reaching up toward <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>to</b> mingle with the divine towers of heaven lasted into the 19th century, while the interior court and pool, the angled entrance and extensive decoration are ancient, but still common, features of Iranian architecture.|$|E
25|$|The greatly {{expanded}} participation {{of government in}} land management and soil conservation was an important outcome from the disaster. Different groups took many different approaches to responding to the disaster. To identify areas that needed attention, {{groups such as the}} Soil Conservation Service generated detailed soil maps and took photos of the land from <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> <b>To</b> create shelterbelts to reduce soil erosion, groups such as the United States Forestry Service’s Prairie States Forestry Project planted trees on private lands. Finally, groups like the Resettlement Administration, which later became the Farm Security Administration, encouraged small farm owners to resettle on other lands, if they lived in dryer parts of the Plains.|$|E
