40|$|Noelle Malcles's three-volume Les Sour-ces du travail bibliographique, {{which is}} {{in a general way}} the French {{counterpart}} to the other two works. Winchell, Walford, or Malcles? Large libraries need not make a choice; they can afford to have them all on-hand. The smaller library picks Winchell first, Walford next, and Malcles last ·or not at all (for reasons of cost and emphasis). But does any one of them do all that a general guide to reference materials could and should? What are {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each? As a step toward evaluation, a comparative study was made of the three works. Indexing is vitally important to such books as these. All had scatterings of mis-prints, misspellings, and in some cases in-correct page numbers. Apart from these common faults, the differences, in an area in which there should be standardized quality, are startling. Winchell's index is the most satisfac-tory of the three. She usually has both au-thor and title entries, and subject entries are scattered throughout, as they are in all three guides. Walford sometimes gives both author and title entries, but he is equally likely to give just author entries. Occasionally where an author entry would be expected, he will have a <b>title</b> <b>entry</b> in-stead. Both of these books follow the author entry in the index with the title of each work in the book and its page number...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{document}} was issued {{under the authority}} of another institution, not NPS. At the time it was written, a copy was added to the NPS Library collection for reasons not now known. It has been included in the digital archive for its historical value to NPS. Not believed to be a CIVINS (Civilian Institutions) <b>title.</b> <b>Entry</b> of astronautical vehicles into planetary atmospheres is examined in this thesis with respect to interactions of the guidance function, vehicle performance, trajectory prediction, and mission objectives. All entry missions which originate from planetary reconnaissance orbits are classified into two broad categories: the direct entry profile and the degenerate orbital profile. These classifications are distinguished by the fact that some form of thrust generating mechanism is required to effect controlled entry in the direct entry profile, while engines are not required for controlled entry in the degenerate orbital profile. Approximate analytical solutions of guidance parameters and constraints are derived for both classes of profiles. As used in this thesis, guidance parameters include: (1) Predicted values of distance flown, range, range-to-go, altitude, velocity, time of flight, and specific force level; (2) Sensitivity of the foregoing quantities to errors and characteristics of the vehicle, density characteristics of the atmosphere, magnitude and direction of the engine thrust vector. Constraints are defined as trajectory limitations resulting from: (1) permissible specific force levels of the vehicle and its human occupants; (2) heat flow rates to the skin of the vehicle, and stagnation point temperatures; (3) radiation hazards. A major shortcoming of numerical studies performed in the conceptual and early design phases of astronautical entry systems is that an infinite number of possible trajectories and guidance schemes must be explored. In order that the engineer understand the the effect of changing various design parameters and in order to compare different guidance schemes, simple analytical results, even though only approximate, can be far more informative than a long series of machine computations. The philosophy advanced in this thesis, therefore, emphasizes the use of dynamical approximations, with specified limitations, to derive simple analytical solutions of important guidance quantities. It is shown in this thesis that the trajectories of both the direct and degenerate orbital profiles possess three distinct operational regimes, defined as the Keplerian, Intermediate and Gas-dynamic phases. A parameter, called the Conservation Parameter, is defined to specify precisely the boundary conditions between these operational phases. The Conservation Parameter is an index of the influence of the operating environment on vehicular motion and may be used as a switching function for the guidance computer and as an orbital aid for adaptive control of the vehicle. Three-dimensional dynamical equations of motion are developed for entry of lifting or non-lifting vehicles in banking or wings-level flight with variable thrust capabilities into the atmosphere of oblate, rotating planets with or without atmospheric winds. The figure of the planet, the gravitational model, and the atmospheric model for important bodies of the solar system are summarized. Special problems associated with first-time entry into the atmospheres of strange planets are discussed. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
