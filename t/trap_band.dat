Most of them were former prisoners and supported the Democratic Party and had thought that on 28 March 1997, there would be a gathering of the Salvation Committee, and decided to go South and kill all the participants along with Zani Çaushin, their protector. At this moment comes into play Agim Shehu and Milto Kordha. They were the ones who assaulted them, and weren't killed by the Roma.|$|E
40|$|Thiol-capped CdTe nanocrystals with cubic {{zinc blende}} {{structure}} are synthesized in aqueous solution. Their steady-state and time-resolved luminescence characteristics are studied at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures. A strong exciton luminescence peak at 2. 3 eV dominates the emission spectrum of CdTe nanocrystals {{at room temperature}}, whereas the <b>trap</b> <b>band</b> centered at 2. 0 eV undergoes substantial temperature quenching. Luminescence excitation spectra reveal different channels leading to radiative recombination via either excitons or traps. The mean luminescence decay time of CdTe nanocrystals at room temperature decreases from 120 ns at 1. 94 eV to 20 ns at 2. 43 eV. Luminescence decay kinetics of CdTe nanocrystals are strongly nonexponential and are described by extremely broad lifetime distributions lying within the range from a few hundred picoseconds to a few hundred nanoseconds...|$|E
30|$|Here, Se-doped NCs, {{in which}} the dopant atoms form a defect state, {{spatially}} localizes only the holes and traps electron. Hole wave function overlaps with carriers in valence band, which enhances the electronic potential and shifts up the position of valence band. With more Se incorporation, simple trapping states evolutes to a <b>trapping</b> energy <b>band.</b> One of the optical transition routes always happened between conduction band minimum (CBM) and {{the highest level of}} <b>trapping</b> <b>band.</b> When Se dopant concentration achieves a critical value, <b>trapping</b> energy <b>band</b> will merge into valance band maximum (VBM). The band gap decreases because of stronger overlap of the hole wave functions due to more Se dopant.|$|R

50|$|The University of Washington studied this {{phenomenon}} with crows, acknowledging the evolutionary tradeoff between acquiring costly information firsthand and learning that information socially with less {{cost to the}} individual but {{at the risk of}} inaccuracy. The experimenters exposed wild crows to a unique “dangerous face” mask as they <b>trapped,</b> <b>banded,</b> and released 7-15 birds at five different study places around Seattle, WA. An immediate scolding response to the mask after trapping by previously captured crows illustrates that the individual crow learned the danger of that mask. There was a scolding from crows that were captured that had not been captured initially. That response indicates conditioning from the mob of birds that assembled during the capture.|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} results, {{we know that}} the {{variations}} in forward voltage are similar to the turn-on voltages of the NiO/TZO heterojunction diodes. In the high forward voltage region (III), the voltages are large 4.7, 1.3, and 2.1 V for TZO thin film deposition powers of 100, 125, and 150 W, respectively, and those results are dominated by the SCLC mechanism. The transition region (II), between regions (I) and (III), often appears in SCLC-dominated I-V characteristics when traps are used. The presence of <b>trap</b> <b>bands</b> with different energies is responsible for different slopes in the different regions of the I-V characteristics. The results obtained in this study indicate that the charge transport mechanism of the investigated diodes can be influenced by the SCLC.|$|R

Its isolation from natural populations of codling moth is difficult {{and only a few}} isolates have been described in the world, because diseased larvae usually rupture and disintegrate and can not be found on the trees. So, in this survey, lots of corrugated cardboard <b>trap</b> <b>bands</b> were placed around the trunks of apple trees in different regions of Iran and they were surveyed for codling moth larvae infected by CpGV. At least, 11 natural isolates from Northwest and Northeast of Iran were collected and surveyed. Viruses from single or pooled infected larvae were isolated and propagated in the fourth in star larvae of the codling moth. Light and electron microscopy studies confirmed the presence of granulovirus in codling moth populations of the above mentioned regions...|$|R

Changes in red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) numbers and hawk/aircraft strikes were studied in relation to translocation of raptors at Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska from March 1999 through March 2000. The effect of distance on translocation success was also studied. Hawks were captured with pole <b>traps,</b> <b>banded,</b> and released approximately 80, 160, and 240 km from the airport. Two bird surveys were conducted at bimonthly intervals from April 1998 through March 1999, after which surveys were conducted at weekly intervals. These surveys provided an index of hawk numbers on the airfield. Strike data {{were used to determine}} if the number of hawk/aircraft strikes had declined. Forty-one red-tailed hawks were translocated from the airfield. No banded birds were recaptured or observed on the airfield. The number of red- tailed hawks on the airfield declined following peak capture periods (3 ̆e 2 hawks per week). There was a 49...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{transient}} during planar solidification of dilute binary alloys is {{studied in}} the framework of the boundary integral method that leads to the non-linear Volterra integral governing equation. An analytical solution of this equation is obtained for the case of a constant growth rate which constitutes the well-known Tiller's formula for the solute transient. The more physically relevant, constant ramping down temperature case has been studied both numerically and analytically. In particular, an asymptotic analytical solution is obtained for the initial transient behavior. A numerical technique to solve the non-linear Volterra equation is developed and the solution is obtained for a family of the governing parameters. For the rapid solidification condition, growth rate spikes have been observed even for the infinite kinetics model. When recirculating fluid flow is included into the analysis, the spike feature is dramatically diminished. Finally, we have investigated planar solidification with a fluctuating temperature field as a possible mechanism for frequently observed solute <b>trapping</b> <b>bands...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pacific Habitat Services, Inc. (PHS), under {{contract}} with the Port of Portland (Port), <b>trapped,</b> <b>banded,</b> and relocated red-tailed hawks at the Portland International Airport (PDX) in Portland, Oregon, beginning in October 1999. Although the Port has a program to deal with wildlife hazards to aircraft operations, raptor prey base management and hazing hadn’t effectively reduced wildlife hazards. Nineteen birdstrikes occurred in September, 1999. Prior to this season, birdstrikes ranged from 0 to 11 within a one-month period. Thus, immediate action was needed to reduce raptor abundance on the airfield. In fall and winter of 1999, PHS captured and relocated fifteen hawks, primarily red-tailed. Six were adult birds and 9 were hatch-year birds. A minimum of 5 adult and 4 hatch-year hawks returned after relocation. This rate of return {{is much higher than}} that reported by Wernaart et al. (1999), who reported a return rate of only 4 % with birds moved similar distances at Canadian Airports. A low return rate was also reported by wildlife personnel at Chicago O’Hare Airport. A likely factor in the high initial return rates is the geography of the PDX area. Hawks may navigate using landscape features such as the Columbia River, the Willamette River and the Cascade Mountains. Continued wildlife surveys on the airfield and color banding also suggest that PDX may support a higher population of resident, non-migratory hawks than airports in other locations...|$|R
