25|$|In the 1830s several {{technologies}} {{came together}} to allow an important shift in wooden building construction. The circular saw (1777), cut nail machines (1794), and steam engine allowed slender pieces of lumber such as 2"x4"s to be efficiently produced and then nailed together in {{what became known as}} balloon framing (1832). This {{was the beginning of the}} decline of the ancient method of <b>timber</b> <b>frame</b> <b>construction</b> with wooden joinery.|$|E

50|$|The use of brick, laid in English {{bond and}} {{including}} the masonry embellishment is an expensive one. However, from c.1600 <b>timber</b> <b>framed</b> <b>construction</b> was already increasingly replaced by mass-construction (brick or masonry) at this level of society, at first reserved for publicly visible elevations, but later as the material became more common and less expensive, for new extensions such as this.|$|R

40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: Since the {{settlement}} of New Zealand there have been significant advances in the seismic design of houses. The influences of the country’s English heritage led {{to the construction of}} unreinforced masonry houses by the early settlers until it was discovered that earthquakes could demolish such structures with little effort. Subsequent to the 1848 Wellington earthquake, it was realised that <b>timber</b> <b>framed</b> <b>construction</b> had a better resilience than the traditional unreinforced masonry construction. Significant but incremental changes have subsequently been made to <b>timber</b> <b>framed</b> <b>construction.</b> The advent of NZS 3604 in 1978 introduced an engineering approach to ensure gravity, wind and earthquake loads could be appropriately resisted. This paper traces the development of the house construction standards for earthquake resistance over the years to the present day and also comments on the types of damage that have occurred in significant earthquakes over that time and how these deficiencies have been addressed in the standards. A prediction is made of the expected performance of the current building stock {{in the event of a}} major earthquake. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe use of <b>timber</b> <b>frame</b> <b>constructions</b> in {{dwellings}} {{is gaining}} popularity in Belgium. Continuous improvement of EPBD requirements causes a low heating demand {{resulting in an}} increasing risk on overheating in these lightweight dwellings. Designers lack easy-to-use guidelines ensuring robust thermal summer comfort. Therefore, a parametric study with building energy simulations (BES) is conducted for a typical Flemish (Belgian) dwelling. Main design parameters {{and the effect of}} boundary conditions are analysed. The results demonstrate the critical role of effective solar protection and increased ventilation rates during occupation. The significant impact of boundary conditions shows the sensitivity of the design parameters...|$|R
