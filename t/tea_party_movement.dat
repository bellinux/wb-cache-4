Perennial candidate Gatewood Galbraith sought the governorship as an Independent after collecting the requisite 5,000 signatures from registered voters requesting that his name be added to the ballot.|$|E
5|$|Branch's music {{regularly}} expresses {{religious and}} political themes emphasizing American exceptionalism. Her music has been well received among conservative commentators {{and members of the}} <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movement</b> for its political message. The use of Branch's music in the campaigns of Cain and Santorum has been seen as an indication of its appeal among outsider candidates. She has released nine singles and an EP, and is working on her debut album for release in 2013.|$|E
5|$|During {{her visit}} to the United States, Marine Le Pen met two Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives {{associated}} with the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movement,</b> Joe Walsh, {{who is known for}} his strong Islamophobic stance, and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul, whom Le Pen complimented for his stance on the gold standard.

50|$|The largely {{negative}} public {{response to}} Clinton's initiatives {{has been compared}} to the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movement's</b> response to U.S. President Barack Obama's efforts to enact Health care reform in the United States. Obama has used strategies similar to those used during the Health Security Express, such as reporting the stories of individual citizens, but the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was successful compared to Clinton's 1993 plan.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} an {{examination}} of the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movement's</b> effects on the 2010 midterm elections. The <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> proves to be a grassroots movement that was initially spurred by economic crisis and gradually pulled within the Republican Party. While a handful of experienced conservative interest groups—and the Republican Party itself—managed to use the energies of <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> sentiment to effect a Republican takeover of the House of Representatives, the movement's decentralized and independent nature prevented grassroots <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> groups from being a significant force in the election. While <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> supporters continue to resist organization, the effective translation of their political concerns into policy change seems very unlikely. Moreover, in the absence of severe economic crisis, their fortunes seem certain to be determined by the Republican Party...|$|R
5|$|The Republicans won {{control of}} both houses of the {{legislature}} {{for the first time}} in decades, while Dayton narrowly defeated Republican candidate Tom Emmer with 44% of the vote. Many of the newly elected Republican legislators were affiliated with the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movement</b> and had more anti-government positions than the Republican establishment. Both Dayton and Republican legislators claimed a popular mandate for their positions.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Bevin {{announced}} he would challenge Kentucky's senior U.S. Senator, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, in the 2014 Republican primary. Although he gained the support of various groups aligned with the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>Movement,</b> McConnell attacked him repeatedly for inconsistencies in his public statements and policy positions and defeated him by almost 25 percentage points. After announcing he would seek the governorship in 2015, Bevin emerged from a four-way Republican primary, besting his nearest competitor, Agriculture Commissioner James Comer by 83 votes. On November 3, 2015, he defeated the state's attorney general, Democrat Jack Conway, in the general election.|$|E
5000|$|Operation Vigilant Eagle {{exists as}} part of a larger {{national}} security effort to target individuals associated with [...] "Left Wing" [...] and [...] "Right Wing" [...] extremist groups. Example include members of (<b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movements),</b> citizen militia (Occupy movements), and other anti-government groups. In certain cases targets have been labeled as mentally ill with [...] "oppositional-defiance disorder", and more cases show that veterans are being targeted since the beginning of Operation Vigilant Eagle and the cause could be as simple as posting controversial song lyrics and political views on Facebook.|$|R
50|$|The Bill of Federalism {{is a list}} of ten {{proposed}} {{amendments to}} the United States Constitution by Barnett. It would enshrine in the Constitution certain ideas based on states' rights and free market libertarianism. Barnett drafted the bill in response to the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movement's</b> emphasis on limiting federal powers. The present draft of the document was published on May 13, 2009 and incorporated much of the feedback that Barnett had received in response to the previous draft. The document is an expansion of an earlier 'Federalist Amendment' that Barnett composed as part of an article he wrote in the Wall Street Journal.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movement’s</b> {{effect on}} local and {{regional}} planning in Virginia has received little study. This work identifies how conservative political activism has impacted planning in the Commonwealth and how planners have responded. The study relies on a qualitative approach involving 22 semi-structured interviews with activists, planners, and citizens, as well as textual analyses of planning documents, {{local and regional}} news reports, and <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> social media. The resultant findings show that <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> activism is rooted in deep seated ideals about private property rights and individualism. It also reveals that planning processes that increased the amount of public input {{had the effect of}} mitigating the impact of activism. The study concludes by suggesting that strategies based in the communicative style of planning offer an effective way to overcome such opposition while enhancing the many benefits of having significant citizen input in the planning process...|$|R
5|$|With {{incumbent}} U.S. Representative Bill Delahunt {{choosing to}} retire, Keating declared his candidacy in the 2010 congressional election. In order {{to run for}} Delahunt's 10th district seat, Keating moved from his longtime home in Sharon (located in the neighboring 4th district) to a rental property in Quincy. On September 14, he won the Democratic primary against state senator Robert O'Leary. Keating faced Republican state Representative Jeff Perry in the general election. In {{the wake of the}} <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movement</b> and the election of Republican U.S. Senator Scott Brown, the campaign was unusually close for a modern Massachusetts race, which would normally skew heavily Democratic. The Keating campaign largely focused on a 1991 incident during Perry's tenure as a police sergeant, in which a teenage girl had been illegally strip-searched by another officer while Perry was on the scene. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran a widely aired advertisement highlighting the incident and challenging Perry's character. With 47 percent of the vote, Keating defeated Perry (42 percent) and two independents in the November 2 election.|$|E

50|$|Although Grant was {{generally}} known {{as being a}} conservative, he was a critic of hard-line conservative advocates in primary races, including the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movement's</b> candidates. This was a frequent debate topic between Grant and his callers {{over the past few}} years. During the fall election of 2010, Grant criticized candidates, such as Christine O'Donnell, Rand Paul, and Sharron Angle. Grant endorsed Charlie Crist over Marco Rubio on a July 10, 2010 broadcast for the Florida senate primary. On a May 8, 2011 broadcast, Grant informed his audience that he supported the moderate Jon Huntsman, Jr. for the Republican nomination for president, although he would later go on to support Mitt Romney.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 112 - 113) Illustrating the maxim {{that the}} more things change the more they stay the same, my thesis, Kindling, focuses on two outsiders, a Swiss vagabond and a traumatized Slavic peasant woman, who seek refuge in an abandoned German church from the chaotic world around them. As their relationship develops, the two are {{caught up in the}} Great Peasant Rebellion of 1525, an incendiary eruption of class warfare that is fueled by the 16 th century equivalency of the Occupy and <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movements.</b> The play draws a comparison between the Reformation era and today by employing humor, satire, incongruity, tragedy, pathos, a hearty dose of anachronism, and an overall sense of absurdity...|$|R

40|$|Populism {{seems to}} be a {{pervasive}} phenomenon in the contemporary world. Many intellectuals are asking themselves whether the Occupy Wall Street and <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movements</b> in the U. S. or the indignados in Spain are examples of populist uprisings. Answering this question is not straightforward, since there is an ongoing debate about how to define populism and study its impact on democracy. This article sheds light on this discussion by undertaking a critical revision of the Latin American debate on populism. Two key arguments are developed. First, populism should be conceived of as a set of ideas characterized by a moral understanding of the world, according to which the people form a homogenous and virtuous community, and the elite a pathological entity. Second, populism is not necessarily an authoritarian force, but rather an ideology that takes for granted the existence of a unified popular will, and that is at odds with deliberative and liberal conceptions of democracy...|$|R
40|$|This project {{revolves}} around the new social <b>movements</b> <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> and Occupy. It specifically discusses whether the American two-party system constitutes a democratic problem {{and the role of}} the two-party system in the mobilisation of the social movements. Several theories are used in the consideration of the mobilisation of these movements including Manuel Castells' theory of identity and Sidney Tarrow's Political Opportunity theory. David S. Meyer's criticism of Tarrow’s theory is also taken into consideration in order to provide a balanced view of the theory and its use. The theories are merged in order to provide a connection between the American two-party system and the mobilisation of the social <b>movements</b> <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> and Occupy. Also the socio-economic consequences of the Financial Crisis are taken into consideration when dealing with the possible causes for the mobilisation of <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> and the Occupy-movement at this time. In order to maintain the balanced view of this study the empirical material is provided by many sources including statistical material from official sources, written literature by strong supporters of the Tea Party-movement, news articles, scientific articles and the written material from the various internet homepages of the Occupy and <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movements.</b> Lastly the project is put into perspective by suggesting a further look at the recent protests in the Middle East and Europe the last few years and examining the possibility of working further to find the political and social outcomes of the emergence of the chosen social movements...|$|R

50|$|In an {{interview}} with Yellowhammer News, Brooks touted his conservative record, stating that during the last session of Congress, Heritage Action ranked {{him as one of}} the Top Ten Best Congressmen on issues involving the “principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.” The American Conservative Union ranked his record in the top 20% of all Congressmen, with an overall A-Grade during the last session of Congress, on issues relating to “liberty, personal responsibility, traditional value, and a strong national defense.” The National Taxpayers Union ranked his record {{at the top of the}} Alabama Congressional delegation, tied with Congressmen Bradley Byrne and Gary Palmer, on issues relating to “tax relief and reform, lower and less wasteful spending, individual liberty, and free enterprise.” The Club for Growth ranked his record in the top 20% of all Congressmen on “economic policies that strengthen our nation’s economy and shrink the size of the federal government.” He was the <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movement's</b> preferred candidate.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "Nationwide Chicago Tea Party" [...] protest was coordinated across {{more than}} 40 {{different}} cities for February 27, 2009, thus establishing {{the first national}} modern <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> protest.

5000|$|A {{report by}} analyst David Gergen in CNN {{suggested}} that despite serious differences between left-leaning Occupy movements and the right-leaning <b>Tea</b> <b>Party</b> <b>movements,</b> {{there was considerable}} agreement on both sides that money plays [...] "far too large a role in politics." [...] Scholars such as Richard Labunski, Sanford Levinson, Lawrence Lessig, Glenn Reynolds, Larry Sabato, newspaper columnist William Safire, and activists such as John Booth of the Dallas movement RestoringFreedom.org have called for constitutional changes that would curb the dominant role of money in politics. Scholar Stein Ringen in his book Nation of Devils suggested that only a [...] "total overhaul" [...] of the constitution could fix the [...] "years of accumulated damage and dysfunction," [...] {{according to a report}} in the Economist in 2013. French journalist Jean-Philippe Immarigeon suggested in Harper's magazine that the [...] "nearly 230-year-old constitution stretched past the limits of its usefulness". A report in USA Today suggested that 17 of 34 states have petitioned Congress for a convention to deal with the issue of a balanced budget amendment. A report in CNN suggested that 30 state legislatures are considering resolutions either calling for a constitutional convention or else proposing changes to the Constitution. David O. Stewart suggested that possible topics for Constitutional amendments might include the elimination of the electoral college and switching to direct election of the president, a ban on procedures in the United States Senate which utilize a supermajority vote requirement as a means to prevent minorities or powerful Senators from blocking legislation, term limits for Senators and Representatives, and a balanced budget amendment.|$|R
