40|$|In {{over twenty}} years of {{operations}} the Canadian Innovation Centre has evaluated, through its Inventor's Assistance Program (IAP), the commercial potential of over 12, 000 early stage inventions. Prior to 1989, the Canadian Innovation Centre (CIC) used {{a version of the}} Preliminary Innovation Evaluation System (PIES), developed by Gerald Udell at the Oregon Innovation Center in 1974, to evaluate the commercial potential of early stage inventions. Since 1989, the CIC has used a modified version of PIES in their evaluation process. I first estimate the ability of this program's analysts to forecast the probability that an invention will become commercialized. I also estimate a model to predict the probability that an invention will become commercialized based on the IAP's evaluation of several underlying early stage characteristics of the invention. I find that such a statistical model is based on a limited set of variables and predicts future commercial success almost as well as the IAP's forecast of success. I then use factor analysis to determine if the ratings provided by the CIC evaluation service are representative of the underlying <b>theoretical</b> <b>variable</b> structure of PIES or their modified version. Factor analysis is applied to two distinct periods that are separated by a distinct alteration of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>variable</b> structure in 1989. While I find that the factor analysis provides evidence that the post 1989 theoretical structure does provide interpretation of some of the dimensions in the ranking variables, when a combination of the post 1989 and the pre 1989 structure are examined interpretability of the extracted factors is significantly improved. Finally, I compare the model estimated on the underlying early stage characteristics with a model estimated on the extracted factors. When the predictive accuracy of the two models is compared, I find that both procedures produce models that predict almost equally well. The models and the IAP perform better than R&D managers' predictions of their own R&D projects' successes.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} proxy-variable search procedure, {{based on a}} {{sensitivity}} analysis framework, aiming to provide {{a useful tool for}} the applied researcher whenever he faces measurement or proxy-variable uncertainties. Extending from the sensitivity analysis literature it proposes two main methodological innovations. The first relates to the usage of a proxies grouping process to obtain averaged coefficient estimators for theoretical explanatory variables that have more than one possible measure. The second is a proposal of using the actual empirical distribution of the available data to base the inference over the confidence probabilities in choosing each possible measure as proxy for a <b>theoretical</b> <b>variable.</b> This is done using the widely known bootstrapped residuals technique. Besides the methodological main focus, an empirical application is presented in the context of cross-country growth regressions. This empirical application provided favorable evidence to the neoclassical view about the specification of the human capital effect on growth. The results also emphasized how neglecting educational quality differentials might lead to wrong conclusions about the robustness of the relationship between human capital accumulation and economic growth. proxy-variable search, sensitivity analysis, estimation uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|The Authors {{present a}} new {{approach}} to the modelling of human driving behaviour, which describes driving behaviour as the result of an optimization process within the formal framework of hybrid automata. In contrast to most approaches, the aim is not to construct a (cognitive) model of a human driver, but to directly model driving behaviour. We assume human driving to be controlled by the anticipated outcomes of possible behaviours. These positive and negative outcomes are mapped onto a single <b>theoretical</b> <b>variable</b> - the so called reinforcement value. Behaviour is assumed to be chosen {{in such a way that}} the reinforcement value is optimized in any given situation. To formalize our models we use hybrid automata, which allow for both continuous variables and discrete states. The models are evaluated using simulations of the optimized driving behaviours. A car entering a freeway served as the scenario to demonstrate our approach. First results yield plausible predictions for car trajectories and the chronological sequence of speed, depending on the surrounding traffic, indicating the feasibility of the approach...|$|E

SV functions as a domain-general currency for decision making. A large number of neuroimaging experiments have investigated the neural encoding of SV. There is evidence for both direct [2] and nonlinear [3] effects of SV on regional BOLD signal. SV signals are expected to show a linear pattern and to be similar across modalities of reward and stages of the decision process. Areas of striatum and VMPFC showed the expected conjunction of effects. We categorized the results of BOLD contrasts comparing levels of SV. Positive effects involve greater BOLD for higher SV.

Experimental manipulations of the likelihood of name remembrance (experiment 2) and need for self-enhancement (experiment 3) provide results consistent with a complimentary explanation for the findings.

40|$|Advances in {{technology}} have altered {{data collection and}} popularized large databases in areas including education. To turn the collected data into knowledge, effective analysis tools are required. Traditional statistical approaches have shown some limitations when analyzing large-scale data, especially sets {{with a large number}} of variables. This dissertation introduces to educational researchers a new data analysis approach called data mining, an analytic process at the intersection of statistics, databases, machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI), and computer science, that is designed to explore large amounts of data to search for consistent patterns and/or systematic relationships between variables. To examine the usefulness of data mining in educational research, one specific data mining technique [...] the Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) based in Bayesian probability [...] is used to construct an analysis model in contrast to the traditional statistical approaches to answer a pseudo research question about faculty salary prediction in postsecondary institutions. Four prediction models [...] a multiple regression model with <b>theoretical</b> <b>variable</b> selection, a regression model with statistical variable extraction, a data mining BBN model with wrapper feature selection, and a combination model that used variables selected by the BBN in a multiple regression procedure [...] are expounded to analyze a data set called the National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty 1999 (NSOPF: 99) provided by the National Center of Educational Services (NCES). The algorithms, input variables, final models, outputs, and interpretations of the four prediction models are presented and discussed. The results indicate that, with a nonmetric approach, the BBN can effectively handle a large number of variables through a process of stochastic subset selection; uncover dependence relationships among variables; detect hidden patterns in the data set; minimize the sample size as a factor influencing the amount of computations in data modeling; reduce data dimensionality by automatically identifying the most pertinent variable from a group of different but highly correlated measures in the analysis; and select the critical variables related to a core construct in prediction problems. The BBN and other data mining techniques have drawbacks; nonetheless, they are useful tools with unique advantages for analyzing large-scale data in educational research...|$|E

40|$|Developmental {{psychologists are}} aimed to identify, {{describe}} and explain psychological changes from one age to the other. Nevertheless, research {{can not reach}} all these aims in the same time. In any case, according to D’Odorico (1995), all these empirical levels are equally important and can be considered successive steps to reach the understanding of a given phenomenon. What we argue is {{that the nature of}} these steps is not mono-directional but circular. In other words, explanation of change needs a description of phenomena changing. On the other hand, the observation of psychological phenomena depends on the identification of those conceptual variables, derived from the theoretical background adopted to explain change. What is often ignored is that, as an operative variable must be operationally defined, also a <b>theoretical</b> <b>variable</b> should be rigorously and objectively conceptually defined, so that researchers should be able to identify it in a univocal way without misunderstandings. Do not recognise conceptual differences implies serious conceptual confusions. Although authors from different theoretical background can use the same vocabulary, the same labels are often differently used to signify different phenomena. This imply that researchers don’t debate the same phenomena, and what is more serious is that they are not conscious of it. For these reasons, in last years several developmental psychologists felt the need of a common scientific terminology. Surely, the lack of a common vocabulary constitutes a serious problem for psychology in general and for developmental psychology in particular. Without any agreement with definitions, the comparison between different psychological theories is hard and often impossible. According to Parisi (1996), a possible way to get round this problem consists in referring to the most rigorous and objective terminology used by neuroscientists. Nevertheless, in our opinion, this way of proceeding is restrictive and strongly depends on a particular epistemological approach not shared by all the psychologists. In fact, this approach suggests an epistemological, although not ontological, reductionism not accepted by every researcher in psychology. In other words, the problem is deeper in nature than simply using the same vocabulary. What often is not clear, is that using the same words is not sufficient {{to solve the problem of}} the incommunicability among theories. Instead, in our opinion, the main issue is to find an objective way to define conceptual variables intended to be described and explained. What we propose is that this theoretical impasse can be solved through two reasoning property largely studied by developmental psychologist: reversibility and decentralisation of thought. To clarify this point a brief digression about the scientific way of proceeding in acquiring knowledge on a given phenomenon is useful. An observable phenomenon can never be studied in its own complexity. For this reason, it becomes crucial for researcher to establish which aspect of reality he is interested to. In order to study a particular aspect of reality, every researcher must reduce phenomena in variables. A variable is defined as any measurable object’s or event’s propriety. By reducing a phenomenon in variables, scientist pays attention to some specific events, deciding to ignore all the others, although connected with it. It’s plain that this choice is a fundamental step in research proceeding, because it determines the kind ok knowledge the research will obtain about a phenomenon. Usually, conceptual variables are chosen on the basis of researcher theoretical background. Different theoretical backgrounds stress different topics to be investigated in order to understand a given phenomenon. Conceptual variables must be transformed in operative variables, relative (related) to observable events. The degree of correspondence between conceptual and operative variables determines the validity of the operational definition construct. It’s evident this validity runs out both when an inadequate measure as regards theoretical construct is used and when construct itself is wrong. In other words, when results found through particular measures are in contrast with the hypothetical correspondent conceptual variable, while other measures confirm it, if the error is due to theoretical construct or to operational definition of the conceptual variable is hardly detectable. On the other hand, discover the inadequacy of the operational definitions is probably simpler than demonstrating the conceptual variables are wrong. Different authors with different theoretical backgrounds often refer the adequacy of their own operational definitions claiming the inadequacy of operational definitions of other authors from antagonist theory. Nevertheless, it is, at the best hypotheses, a fruitless way of proceeding. What we wish is that every researcher, in front of contrasting findings by other authors, performs the peculiar action of reversible thought, that is de-operationalising operative variables and define, if possible, the conceptual variable according to his own theory. If the conceptual variable can de defined in such a way, the theory acquires power respect the antagonist theory, on the contrary one of the following logic conclusions has to be reached: 1) 	or both the theories are partially valid, that is a) they have adequately defined the phenomenon but two complementary aspects of it are detected, b) they have defined two different phenomena, so that each one are not able to describe and explain the aspect detected by the other theory. In any case, the effort should be building a theory able to define, interpret, describe, explain the two aspect of phenomena or the two phenomena. An implication of these way of proceeding is a researchers collaboration in define conceptual variables. It’s not obvious that an accord will be reached, because the starting points of antagonist researchers are often in antinomy as regard mental structure and function. 2) 	Or both theories are wrong, that is they have non adequately defined the phenomenon. In this case, a researcher collaboration is wished to solve the discrepancy. 3) 	Or only one of the two theories is wrong not having adequately defined the phenomenon. Nevertheless, in this case it’s not possible to decide which of two theories is right till the conceptual variable explained by one theory is not defined by the other. In all the three cases, it’s indispensable every researcher studies the antagonist theory, changes his own point of view and understands phenomena it studies and it can describe and explain, wondering which utility it can have for theoretical and practical purposes. Over the time, this way of proceeding means to build a common conceptual language inside the psychology, avoiding the often useless academic discussions, in which everyone follows his own idea without consider, taking advantage, the numerous findings annually reached by the scientific-psychological community. Nevertheless, according to Lakatos (1970) the power of a theory or a research program should be firstly valued on the basis of the number of phenomena it is able to explain in a coherent and organised way, and only in a second time by the number of empirical researches it produces. Not proceeding in this way means to fragment psychology in a lot of disorganised and isolate sub-disciplines, that soon or later will confront each others to proceed to a unitary and complete knowledge of its own investigation object: Mind...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} {{influence of}} extralegal characteristics {{on the outcome}} of post-Furman capital cases (1972) has been a focus of criminal justice researchers and legal scholars. Much of this literature has assessed the impact of victim and defendant race on the likelihood of receiving the death penalty while a relatively underdeveloped body of research focuses on how victim sex may affect capital sentencing decisions. The present study uses focal concerns theory and the chivalry hypothesis to test the potential mediating effect of <b>theoretical</b> <b>variables</b> on the relationship between victim sex and juror capital sentence decision-making. In addition, it uses victim sex specific logistic regression models to examine if different <b>theoretical</b> and/or control <b>variables</b> are important predictors of receiving the death penalty for male victim cases versus female victim cases. Findings demonstrate that victim rape mediates the relationship between victim sex and juror death penalty decision-making. In addition, findings reveal that sex specific models better explain juror decision making than the full model including victims of both sexes and that different extralegal and legal characteristics predict juror decision to choose the death penalty in cases with male victims versus female victims. Theoretical and legal implications as well as directions for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Why, {{we have to}} ask, have putatively {{inadequate}} ‘Western’ IR theories {{been applied}} {{over and over again}} to explain and understand Asian international relations? How can we develop more satisfying explanations of the international politics of Asia? In relation to such questions, this article demonstrates how academic disciplinary socialisation entails competition and selection, which tends towards the elimination of approaches or explanations that do not fit into the socialised practice, without generating new ones. It is argued here that interweaving existing IR theories with Asia's empirical material and remoulding the theories through gathering empirical evidence on the regional reality and converting it into <b>theoretical</b> <b>variables,</b> comparable in the field of IR, should be our goal. In order to apprehend Asian international relations better and to contribute to advancing the discipline of IR, we need an accumulation of theoretical knowledge sensitive to and attentive to local difference. ...|$|R
40|$|Background. Several {{theories}} have been advanced to explain {{variation in the}} intensity of regret. Thus far, these {{theories have}} been tested in isolation. Aim: To compare the effects of several key <b>theoretical</b> <b>variables</b> on regret intensity: The time since the regretted event, whether the regret was one of action or inaction, the level of justification felt, {{and whether or not}} the regretted decision violated the participant’s personal life rules. Method: A postal survey of 429 New Zealand adults. Conclusions: Contradicting folk wisdom and previous research, action regrets were felt more intensely than inaction regrets. The passing of time led to action regrets being felt even more intensely (in comparison to regrets of inaction), falsifying a prediction of the temporal theory of regret. The strongest predictor of regret intensity was the domain of regret: Regrets in intimate domains were felt more intensely than regrets in non-intimate domains. falsefalsefalsefalsefalsefalsePublishedPublishedNew ZealandNew Zealan...|$|R
40|$|Gang {{crime and}} {{resulting}} public fear {{became a major}} policy focus during the 1990 s, yet few studies specifically focus on fear of gang crime. Guided by social disorganization theory, we test three theoretical models about the individual thought processes leading to fear of gang crime. Using structural equation models, we find {{that each of these}} three theoriesFdiversity, disorder, and community concernFis an important predictor of gang-related fear. In addition, we find that the indirect relationships between demographic characteristics, <b>theoretical</b> <b>variables,</b> and fear depend upon which model is tested. Fear of Gangs and Crime Policy Crime has been a major focus of political campaigns for years (Johnson 1997; Warr 1995, 2000), but during the 1990 s, policy-makers routinely cited gang violence and the fear it invoked in the public as a primary justification for harsher laws and punishment policies (e. g., Clinton 1997; Senate 1994). Throughout the 1990 s...|$|R
