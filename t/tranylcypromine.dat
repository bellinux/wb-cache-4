25|$|Phenelzine is {{more prone}} than <b>tranylcypromine</b> {{and most other}} {{antidepressant}} to causing liver damage.|$|E
25|$|Concomitant {{treatment}} with irreversible MAO inhibitors (e.g. <b>tranylcypromine</b> (Parnate), phenelzine (Nardil), >10mg selegiline) or digitalis glycosides {{is an absolute}} contraindication.|$|E
25|$|Marmite {{should be}} avoided if a person takes a MAOI antidepressant, such as {{phenelzine}} (Nardil) or <b>tranylcypromine</b> (Parnate), as yeast extracts interact negatively with these types of medications due to their tyramine content.|$|E
25|$|Clinical reports {{indicate}} that interaction between sertraline and the MAOIs isocarboxazid and <b>tranylcypromine</b> may cause serotonin syndrome. In a placebo-controlled study in which sertraline was co-administered with lithium, 35% of the subjects experienced tremors, while none of those taking placebo did.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{statistical}} or meaningful clinical differences in remission rates, response rates, or times to remission or response among {{any of the}} medications compared in this study. These included bupropion sustained release, bupropion, citalopram, lithium, mirtazapine, nortriptyline, sertraline, triiodothyronine, <b>tranylcypromine,</b> and venlafaxine extended release.|$|E
25|$|Iprindole {{has been}} shown to be a potent {{inhibitor}} of the aromatic hydroxylation and/or N-dealkylation-mediated metabolism of many substances including, but not limited to octopamine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, fenfluramine, phenelzine, <b>tranylcypromine,</b> trimipramine, and fluoxetine, likely via inactivating cytochrome P450 enzymes. It also inhibits its own metabolism.|$|E
25|$|On December 22, 2011, Covis Pharma, a {{specialty}} pharmaceutical company owned by affiliates of Cerberus, {{announced that it}} had agreed to acquire full commercial rights for Fortaz (ceftazidime), Zinacef (cefuroxime), Lanoxin (digoxin), Parnate (<b>tranylcypromine</b> sulfate), and Zantac Injection (ranitidine hydrochloride) in the United States and Puerto Rico from GlaxoSmithKline.|$|E
25|$|Contraindications include prior {{treatment}} (within {{the past}} two weeks) with MAOIs such as phenelzine and <b>tranylcypromine,</b> due to the potential for serotonin syndrome. Its use should also be avoided in those with known hypersensitivities to fluoxetine {{or any of the}} other ingredients in the formulation used. Its use in those concurrently receiving pimozide or thioridazine is also advised against.|$|E
25|$|This {{inhibition}} of MAO-A allows DMT to diffuse unmetabolized past the membranes {{in the stomach}} and small intestine, and eventually cross the blood–brain barrier (which, by itself, requires no MAO-A inhibition) to activate receptor sites in the brain. Without RIMAs or the non-selective, nonreversible monoamine oxidase inhibition by drugs like phenelzine and <b>tranylcypromine,</b> DMT would be oxidized (and thus rendered biologically inactive) by monoamine oxidase enzymes in the digestive tract.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine {{has serious}} {{interactions}} {{that can be}} dangerous with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., furazolidone, isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, procarbazine, selegiline, <b>tranylcypromine).</b> Such patients may suffer agitation, delirium, headache, convulsions, and/or hyperthermia. Fatal interactions have been reported including the death of Libby Zion. It {{is thought to be}} caused by an increase in cerebral serotonin concentrations. It is probable that pethidine can also interact with a number of other medications, including muscle relaxants, some antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and ethanol.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} drug {{interactions}} can occur between MDMA and other drugs, including serotonergic drugs. MDMA also interacts with drugs which inhibit CYP450 enzymes, like ritonavir (Norvir), particularly CYP2D6 inhibitors. Concurrent use of MDMA high dosages with another serotonergic drug {{can result in}} a life-threatening condition called serotonin syndrome. Severe overdose resulting in death has also been reported in people who took MDMA in combination with certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as phenelzine (Nardil), <b>tranylcypromine</b> (Parnate), or moclobemide (Aurorix, Manerix).|$|E
25|$|Although {{ketamine}} is a {{very weak}} ligand of the monoamine transporters (Ki > 60,000nM), {{it has been suggested}} that it may interact with allosteric sites on the monoamine transporters to produce monoamine reuptake inhibition. However, no functional inhibition (IC50) of the human monoamine transporters has been observed with ketamine or its metabolites at concentrations of up to 10,000nM. Moreover, animal studies and at least three human case reports have found no interaction between ketamine and the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) <b>tranylcypromine.</b> Collectively, these findings shed doubt on the involvement of monoamine reuptake inhibition in the effects of ketamine in humans. Ketamine has been found to increase dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain, but instead of via dopamine reuptake inhibition, this may be via indirect/downstream mechanisms, namely antagonism of the NMDA receptor.|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{primidone}} with {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitors (MAOIs) such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), procarbazine (Matulane), selegiline (Eldepryl), <b>tranylcypromine</b> (Parnate) or {{within two weeks}} of stopping {{any one of them}} may [...] the effects of primidone or change one's seizure patterns. Isoniazid, an antitubercular agent with MAOI properties, has been known to strongly inhibit the metabolism of primidone.|$|E
2500|$|Clomipramine may {{interact}} {{with a number}} of different medications, including the monoamine oxidase inhibitors which include isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, selegiline and <b>tranylcypromine,</b> antiarrhythmic agents (due to the effects of TCAs like clomipramine on cardiac conduction. There is also a potential pharmacokinetic interaction with quinidine {{due to the fact that}} clomipramine is metabolised by CYP2D6 in vivo), diuretics (due to the potential for hypokalaemia (low blood potassium) to develop which increases the risk for QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes), the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; due to both potential additive serotonergic effects leading to serotonin syndrome and the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with the SSRIs that inhibit CYP2D6 [...] ) and serotonergic agents such as triptans, other tricyclic antidepressants, tramadol, etc. (due to the potential for serotonin syndrome). Its use is also advised against in those concurrently on CYP2D6 inhibitors due the potential for increased plasma levels of clomipramine and the resulting potential for CNS and cardiotoxicity.|$|E
5000|$|For level four, {{the average}} {{remission}} rate was 13%, with {{no statistically significant}} difference between <b>tranylcypromine</b> and the venlafaxine/mirtazapine combination. [...] More patients receiving <b>tranylcypromine</b> left the study due to side effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tranylcypromine</b> {{has also}} been shown to inhibit the histone demethylase, BHC110/LSD1. <b>Tranylcypromine</b> {{inhibits}} this enzyme with an IC50 < 2 µM, thus acting as a small molecule inhibitor of histone demethylation with an effect to derepress the transcriptional activity of BHC110/LSD1 target genes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tranylcypromine</b> {{acts as a}} nonselective and {{irreversible}} inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Regarding the isoforms of monoamine oxidase, {{it shows}} slight preference for the MAOB isoenzyme over MAOA. In addition, <b>tranylcypromine</b> functions as a norepinephrine and dopamine releasing agent with approximately 1/10 the potency of amphetamine.|$|E
50|$|HMT (histone demethylase) inhibitors also act on histones. They {{prevent the}} {{demethylation}} of the H3K4 histone protein {{and open up}} {{that part of the}} chromatin. <b>Tranylcypromine,</b> an antidepressant, has been shown to have HMT inhibitory properties, and in a study, treatment of patients with schizophrenia with <b>tranylcypromine</b> showed improvements regarding negative symptoms.|$|E
50|$|At {{least one}} {{case of the}} abuse of <b>tranylcypromine</b> has been noted.|$|E
5000|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) {{including}} moclobemide, phenelzine, <b>tranylcypromine,</b> selegiline and {{methylene blue}} ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Tranylcypromine</b> was {{originally}} developed as an analog of amphetamine. Although {{it was first}} synthesized in 1948, its MAOI action was not discovered until 1959. Precisely because <b>tranylcypromine</b> was not, like isoniazid and iproniazid, a hydrazine derivative, its clinical interest increased enormously, as it was thought it might have a more acceptable therapeutic index than previous MAOIs.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of <b>tranylcypromine</b> {{overdose}} {{are generally}} more intense manifestations of its usual effects.|$|E
50|$|In addition, <b>tranylcypromine</b> is a non-hydrazine {{containing}} irreversible inhibitor of MAO {{which is}} also available.|$|E
50|$|MAO inhibitors within 14 days. MAO inhibitors include isocarboxazid, linezolid, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, and <b>tranylcypromine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Level four {{consisted}} of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor <b>tranylcypromine</b> {{or a combination of}} venlafaxine and mirtazapine.|$|E
50|$|Cases of suicidal {{ideation}} and suicidal behaviours {{have been reported}} during <b>tranylcypromine</b> therapy or early after treatment discontinuation.|$|E
50|$|Tranylcypromine/trifluoperazine (brand names Parstelin, Parmodalin, Jatrosom N, Stelapar) is a {{combination}} formulation of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant drug <b>tranylcypromine</b> and the typical antipsychotic drug trifluoperazine {{that has been used}} in the treatment of major depressive disorder. It contains 10 mg <b>tranylcypromine</b> and 1 mg trifluoperazine. The drug has been in clinical use since at least 1961. It is still available in Italy with the name of Parmodalin.|$|E
50|$|Cycloalkylamines are {{chemical}} compounds featuring a cycloalkyl group and an amine. Some examples include propylhexedrine, cyclopentamine, cypenamine, and <b>tranylcypromine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Curtius {{rearrangement}} {{is used in}} the syntheses of {{the drugs}} <b>tranylcypromine,</b> candesartan, bromadol, terguride, benzydamine, gabapentin, igmesine and tecadenoson.|$|E
5000|$|Concomitant {{treatment}} with irreversible MAO inhibitors (e.g. <b>tranylcypromine</b> (Parnate), phenelzine (Nardil), >10 mg selegiline) or digitalis glycosides {{is an absolute}} contraindication.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tranylcypromine</b> is used {{to treat}} major {{depressive}} disorder, especially {{when there is an}} anxiety component, typically as a second line treatment.|$|E
50|$|In the past, {{trifluoperazine}} {{was used}} in fixed combinations with the MAO inhibitor (antidepressant) <b>tranylcypromine</b> (tranylcypromine/trifluoperazine) to attenuate the strong stimulating effects of this antidepressant. This combination was sold under the brand name Jatrosom N. Likewise a combination with amobarbital (potent sedative/hypnotic agent) for the amelioration of psychoneurosis and insomnia existed under the brand name Jalonac. In Italy the first combination is still available, sold under the brand name Parmodalin (10 mg of <b>tranylcypromine</b> and 1 mg of trifluoperazine).|$|E
50|$|Drugs {{that should}} be avoided while on {{artesunate}} are the drugs that inhibit the liver enzyme CYP2A6. These drugs include amiodarone, desipramine, isoniazid, ketoconazole, letrozole, methoxsalen, <b>tranylcypromine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Combining {{tolcapone}} with non-selective {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitors such as phenelzine or <b>tranylcypromine</b> is contraindicated. Tolcapone is also contraindicated {{for people with}} liver diseases or increased liver enzymes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tranylcypromine,</b> a {{structurally}} unrelated MAOI introduced {{around the}} same time as the hydrazines, was originally advertised as non-hydrazine as a result of its diminished propensity for causing hepatotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} prodrugs of {{amphetamine}} and/or methamphetamine exist, and include amfecloral, amphetaminil, benzphetamine, clobenzorex, D-deprenyl, dimethylamphetamine, ethylamphetamine, fencamine, fenethylline, fenproporex, furfenorex, lisdexamfetamine, mefenorex, mesocarb, prenylamine, selegiline, and <b>tranylcypromine.</b>|$|E
