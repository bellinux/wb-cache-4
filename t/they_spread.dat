5|$|Scorpions perform non-bluffing threat displays, as {{they have}} {{powerful}} defences, but various predators still eat them. When provoked, <b>they</b> <b>spread</b> their pincers {{and in some cases}} raise their abdomens, their tails standing near-erect with the sting ready for immediate use. Some scorpions in addition produce deimatic noises by stridulating with the pedipalps and first legs.|$|E

5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{existed in}} China from about 1st century AD {{and in the}} West from the High Middle Ages. <b>They</b> <b>spread</b> from the region around Namur in Wallonia (Belgium) in the late 15th century, being introduced to England in 1491. The fuel used in these was invariably charcoal. The successful substitution of coke for charcoal is widely attributed to Abraham Darby in 1709. The efficiency of the process was further enhanced by the practice of preheating the combustion air (hot blast), patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after peaking in strength, Cindy {{began to}} {{interact}} with the mountains of nearby Hispaniola. The high terrain disrupted its circulation, causing it to weaken to a tropical depression at 21:00UTC on August16. The depression made landfall near Barahona, Dominican Republic, with winds of 35mph (55km/h). It became increasingly disorganized over land, prompting the NHC to declassify it as a tropical cyclone on August17. The remnants proceeded inland near the border with Haiti and emerged into the Atlantic, where <b>they</b> <b>spread</b> across the Bahamas before eventually dissipating the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Sheffield Rules was {{a code of}} {{football}} devised and played in the English city of Sheffield between 1857 and 1877. They were devised by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest {{for use by the}} newly founded Sheffield Football Club. The rules were subsequently adopted as the official rules of Sheffield Football Association upon its creation in 1867. <b>They</b> <b>spread</b> beyond the city boundaries to other clubs and associations in the north and midlands of England making them {{one of the most popular}} forms {{of football}} during the 1860s and 70s.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} fossils {{from this}} genus {{are from the}} early Miocene (20-25 mya), and are from Africa, so it is proposed that they originated there. Then by the middle to late Miocene (5-13 mya) <b>they</b> had <b>spread</b> to Eurasia. By about 12 mya they had evolved into the larger size {{of which we are}} familiar. By this time <b>they</b> had <b>spread</b> to Mongolia and, later, South Africa.|$|R

To rebuild the city and clean up the Barren River, the city council of New Phlan has decided to recruit adventurers to drive the monsters from the neighboring ruins. Using bards and publications, <b>they</b> <b>spread</b> tales of the riches waiting to be recovered in Phlan, which draws the player's party to these shores by ship.|$|E
5|$|Downburst winds {{can produce}} {{numerous}} hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms. Downburst winds are generally very powerful, {{and are often}} mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes, due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight-horizontal characteristic. Downburst winds can be hazardous to unstable, incomplete, or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings. Agricultural crops, and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged. Aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash. Automobiles can be displaced by the force exerted by downburst winds. Downburst winds are usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it, due to their higher density. When these downdrafts reach the surface, <b>they</b> <b>spread</b> out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{enemies are}} already {{adapted to the}} habitat and to the target pest, and their {{conservation}} can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) that farmers sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5%. Predators of aphids were similarly found {{to be present in}} tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in England, but <b>they</b> <b>spread</b> too slowly to reach the centres of fields. Control was improved by planting a metre-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centres, enabling aphid predators to overwinter there.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans prized saffron as a perfume or {{deodoriser}} {{and scattered}} it about their public spaces: royal halls, courts, and amphitheatres alike. When Nero entered Rome <b>they</b> <b>spread</b> saffron along the streets; wealthy Romans partook of daily saffron baths. They {{used it as}} mascara, stirred saffron threads into their wines, cast it aloft in their halls and streets as a potpourri, and offered it to their deities. Roman colonists took saffron {{with them when they}} settled in southern Roman Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until the AD 271 barbarian invasion of Italy. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th-century Moors or with the Avignon Papacy in the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{ancestor}} of these used in France and England {{was in the}} Namur region {{in what is now}} Wallonia (Belgium). From there, <b>they</b> <b>spread</b> first to the Pays de Bray on the eastern boundary of Normandy and from there to the Weald of Sussex, where the first furnace (called Queenstock) in Buxted was built in about 1491, followed by one at Newbridge in Ashdown Forest in 1496. They remained few in number until about 1530 but many were built in the following decades in the Weald, where the iron industry perhaps reached its peak about 1590. Most of the pig iron from these furnaces was taken to finery forges for the production of bar iron.|$|E
5|$|The {{fires in}} Yellowstone left {{a mosaic of}} areas greatly {{affected}} and others less so. Inside fire perimeters, large expanses of forest were completely untouched. There were three major types of burning. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the most destructive fires were the canopy crown fires that in many places obliterated entire forests. Crown fires accounted for about 41percent of all the area that burned. Mixed fires burned both the canopy and vegetation on the ground, or burned {{one or the other}} as <b>they</b> <b>spread</b> through the forest. Ground fires spread slowly along the ground, consuming smaller plants and dead plant material; some ground fires burned for longer duration and intensity, contributing to the loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly burned.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the Spanish flu pandemic, and the {{relationship}} between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where <b>they</b> <b>spread</b> the disease. Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} events were also {{present at the}} Panhellenic Games in Greece around this period, and <b>they</b> <b>spread</b> to Rome in Italy around 200 BC. After the period of Classical antiquity (in which the sport was largely Greco-Roman influenced) new track and field events began {{developing}} in parts of Northern Europe in the Middle Ages. The stone put and weight throw competitions popular among Celtic societies in Ireland and Scotland were precursors to the modern shot put and hammer throw events. One of the last track and field events to develop was the pole vault, which stemmed from competitions such as the Fierljeppen contests in the Northern European Lowlands in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Well over 200 virus strains are {{implicated in}} the cause of the common cold; the rhinoviruses are the most common. <b>They</b> <b>spread</b> through the air during close contact with {{infected}} people and indirectly through contact with objects in the environment followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to daycare, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. Symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. People with influenza often show similar symptoms as people with a cold, though symptoms are usually more severe in the former. Influenza is less likely to result in a runny nose.|$|E

5|$|Determined {{to prevent}} the Dutch from {{refloating}} the grounded ships, Admiral Pellew ordered landing parties to assemble in the boats of his squadron alongside Terpsichore. From there, under distant covering fire from the British frigates, Fleetwood Pellew led the boats against Phoenix, coming under fire from the grounded vessels and gun batteries ashore. Passing through the bombardment from the shoreline, Pellew's men boarded Phoenix {{to find that the}} Dutch crew had just abandoned the vessel, scuttling the frigate as they departed. Although now useless as a ship, Phoenixs guns were turned on the other beached vessels to cover the British boats as <b>they</b> <b>spread</b> out to board and burn them. This operation was followed by the destruction of 20 grounded merchant ships in the harbour, although two others were successfully refloated and captured. In a final act before withdrawing to the squadron offshore, Captain Pellew set fire to the wreck of Phoenix, burning the ship to the waterline. The entire operation was conducted under heavy fire from the shore, but British casualties were only one Royal Marine killed and three men wounded.|$|E
5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} {{observed}} in captivity {{and in the}} wild are most active during the day. In captivity, the loggerheads' daily activities are divided between swimming and resting on the bottom. While resting, <b>they</b> <b>spread</b> their forelimbs to about midstroke swimming position. They remain motionless with eyes open or half-shut and are easily alerted during this state. At night, captives sleep {{in the same position}} with their eyes tightly shut, and are slow to react. Loggerheads spend up to 85% of their day submerged, with males being the more active divers than females. The average duration of dives is 15–30 min, but they can stay submerged for up to four hours. Juvenile loggerheads and adults differ in their swimming methods. A juvenile keeps its forelimbs pressed to the side of its carapace, and propels itself by kicking with its hind limbs. As the juvenile matures, its swimming method is progressively replaced with the adult's alternating-limb method. They depend entirely on this method of swimming by one year old.|$|E
5|$|Neither can the oblique {{trend of}} the drapery, belt-high in the {{silhouette}} (in profile) of the elder, be explained … without accepting that she was seated, her left forearm resting on her thigh. Only thus could the dice be handled. Only thus, moreover, can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder, pleats {{that would have to}} fall vertically in a non-seated figure, become understandable. On the right, let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward, so that they pass the centerline of the stele, marked by the high, triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands. For the maiden on the left, although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct—as appropriate to a standing posture—some of them, curiously arched, turn forward as well, for example at the left armhole. They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman. The folds of Kore’s sleeve, which in 1939 I drew a little too short in the descent, carry on to Demeter’s lap, where <b>they</b> <b>spread</b> out.|$|E
