25|$|A {{panel of}} The Heart Rhythm Society, a {{specialist}} {{organization based in}} Washington, DC {{found that it was}} legal and ethical to honor requests by patients, or by those with legal authority to make decisions for patients, to deactivate implanted cardiac devices. Lawyers say that the legal situation is similar to removing a feeding tube, though there is currently no legal precedent involving pacemakers in the United States of America. A patient in the United States is thought to have a right to refuse or discontinue treatment, including a pacemaker that keeps him or her alive. Physicians have a right to refuse <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> but are advised by the HRS panel that they should refer the patient to a physician who will. Some patients believe that hopeless, debilitating conditions, like those brought on by severe strokes or late-stage dementia, can cause so much suffering that they would prefer not to prolong their lives with supportive measures, such as cardiac devices.|$|E
500|$|Despite these {{regional}} differences, Hampton credits Illmatic {{with providing}} a common artistic ground for rappers on the West Coast and East Coast rap scenes. In the 2009 essay [...] "Born Alone, Die Alone," [...] she recounts the album's impact on West Coast artist, Tupac Shakur. While {{working as a}} journalist for The Source in 1994, Hampton covered three court cases involving Tupac. Around this time, she received an advance-copy of Illmatic and immediately dubbed a cassette version for Tupac, who became [...] "an instant convert" [...] of the album. The next day, she writes, Tupac [...] "arrived in his assigned courtroom blasting Illmatic so loudly that the bailiff yelled at him <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> before the judge took his seat on the bench." [...] In her essay, Hampton implies that Nas' lyricism might have influenced Tupac's acclaimed album, Me Against the World, which was recorded that same year.|$|E

500|$|Lyricist and {{composer}} Jeffrey Comanor recorded [...] "We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again" [...] for the album A Rumor in His Own Time, which debuted in September 1976. Produced by John Boylan and released on Epic Records, both the album {{and the single}} failed to chart. [...] "We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again" [...] describes a couple that spends a night together, one which the narrator wishes [...] "would never end". Comanor, who wrote the song, stated that his lyrical inspiration originated from a girl he dated who owned a wooden KLH radio that continued to play music quietly when he attempted <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> When Comanor's next girlfriend, Molly, left the city where he lived, he remembered their last night together and how he [...] "hated that night to end": {{a combination of the}} two memories formed the introductory lyrics of the song.|$|E

2500|$|Season 6, the final, follows two timelines. In {{the first}} timeline, the {{survivors}} {{are sent to}} the present day, as the death of Jacob allows for his brother, the Man in Black, the human alter-ego of the Smoke Monster, {{to take over the}} island. Having assumed the form of John Locke, the Smoke Monster seeks to escape the island and forces a final war between the forces of good and evil. The second timeline, called [...] "flash-sideways" [...] narrative, follows the lives of the main characters in a setting where Oceanic 815 never crashed, though additional changes are revealed as other characters are shown living completely different lives than they did. In the final episodes, a flashback to the distant past shows the origins of the island's power and of the conflict between Jacob and the Man in Black, who are revealed to be twin brothers, with Jacob desperate to keep his brother from leaving the island after he is transmogrified by the power of the island and becomes the Smoke Monster. In this season, we finally discover Jacob's machinations: everyone was pushed by fate and his manipulation to be on the Oceanic flight as many {{of the members of the}} flight were deemed [...] "candidates" [...] by Jacob to be the new protector of the island after his passing. The Man in Black's mission since the beginning of the series: kill all of the candidates, thereby allowing him to leave the island once and for all. The ghost of Jacob appears to the last-of-the-surviving candidates, and Jack is appointed as the new protector. Jack catches up with The Man In Black, who says that he wants to go to the [...] "heart of the island" [...] <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> and, therefore, finally leave the island. They reach the place, but after doing this, The Man In Black becomes mortal. The Man In Black is killed by Kate, but Jack is seriously injured. Hurley, one of the survivors, becomes the new caretaker of the island. Several of the survivors die in the conflict or stay on the island, and the remaining escape in the Ajira Plane once and for all. Jack returns to the [...] "heart of the island" [...] and turns it on again, saving it. Hurley, as the new protector, asks Ben to help him in his new job, which he agrees. After having saved the island, Jack dies peacefully in the same place in which he woke up when he arrived on the island. The series finale reveals that the flash-sideways timeline is actually a form of limbo in the afterlife, where some of the survivors and other characters from the island are reunited after having died. In the last scene, the survivors are all reunited in a church where they [...] "move on" [...] together.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{automation}} system where users can use voice commands {{to control their}} electrical appliances, such as light, fan, television, heater etc. The main aim is {{to help make the}} life of people more comfortable, especially for the elderly and disabled as they will not have to be actually present near an appliance <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> on or <b>off.</b> The system focuses on using a Digital Signal Processor to process the voice commands and accordingly control the required appliance. XBee transceivers are used to eliminate the need for large amount of wiring between the processor and the appliances. Experimental results show that the system has a good response and is cost effective. We conclude that this system provides solutions for the problems faced by home owners in daily life and make their life easier and more comfortable by proposing a cost effective and reliable solution...|$|R

50|$|Advertising {{also uses}} {{this as a}} way to build {{excitement}} for an item. For example, cell phone advertisements will neglect to advertise every little detail of their product, but instead only show the newest or most unusual aspect, highlighting the new camera or voice feature, instead of how <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> on and <b>off.</b> This makes the consumer more likely to purchase the item, by seeing what is advertised to come out in the future. Advertisers may use this strategy to persuade consumers to buy the company's products by highlighting the higher level and more central aspects of the item. Due to construal level effects, promotional message that include a warning of risky side effects (cigarette ads that warn of risks associated with cancer, for example) can ironically increase consumer buying when there is a delay between the time consumers decide whether to choose and the time they expect to consume the product.|$|R
50|$|The kill {{probability}} (Pk) {{is determined by}} several factors, including aspect (head-on interception, side-on or tail-chase), altitude, {{the speed of the}} missile and the target, and how hard the target can turn. Typically, if the missile has sufficient energy during the terminal phase, which comes from being launched at close range to the target from an aircraft with an altitude and speed advantage, it will {{have a good chance of}} success. This chance drops as the missile is fired at longer ranges as it runs out of overtake speed at long ranges, and if the target can force the missile <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> might bleed <b>off</b> enough speed that it can no longer chase the target. Operationally, the missile, which was designed for beyond visual range combat, has a Pk of 61.1% (18 missiles for 11 kills). The targets included six MiG-29s, a MiG-25, a MiG-23, a Su-22, a Galeb and a US Army Blackhawk that was targeted by mistake.|$|R
5000|$|Effects {{are often}} {{incorporated}} into amplifiers {{and even some}} types of instruments. Electric guitar amplifiers typically have built-in reverb and distortion, while acoustic guitar and keyboard amplifiers tend to only have built-in reverb. Some acoustic instrument amplifiers have reverb, chorus, compression and equalization (bass and treble) effects. Vintage guitar amps (and their 2010-era reissued models) typically have tremolo and vibrato effects, and sometimes reverb. The Fender Bandmaster Reverb amp, for example, had built-in reverb and vibrato. Built-in effects may offer the user less control than standalone pedals or rackmounted units. For example, on some lower- to mid-priced bass amplifiers, the only control on the audio compression effect is a button or switch <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> on or <b>off,</b> or a single knob. In contrast, a pedal or rackmounted unit would typically provide ratio, threshold and attack knobs and sometimes [...] "soft knee" [...] or other options to allow the user to control the compression.|$|R

6000|$|Jack's triumph {{would have}} been complete, only that it was ludicrous to {{those who could not}} but think, as I did, of the very little matter as to which the contest had been raised;--just a game of cricket which two sets of boys had been playing, and which should have been {{regarded}} as no more than an amusement,--as a pastime, by which to refresh themselves between their work. But they regarded it as though a great national combat had been fought, and the Britannulists looked upon themselves as though they had been victorious against England. It was absurd to see Jack as he was carried back to Gladstonopolis as the hero of the occasion, and to hear him, as he made his speeches at the dinner which was given on the day, and at which he was called upon to take the chair. I was glad to see, however, that he was not quite so glib with his tongue as he had been when addressing the people. He hesitated a good deal, nay, almost broke down, when he gave the health of Sir Kennington Oval and the British sixteen; and I was quite pleased to hear Lord Marylebone declare to his mother that he was [...] "a wonderfully nice boy."

5000|$|It is {{a singing}} toy whose body is shaped like an eighth note (it also {{somewhat}} resembles a tadpole, [...] "otamajakushi" [...] being Japanese for [...] "tadpole"), with sound {{emerging from a}} [...] "mouth" [...] on the notehead. It requires two hands to play: while one hand holds and squeezes the [...] "head", the other hand controls the pitch of the tune by placing the finger on a ribbon controller on the stem; a higher position on the stem creates a lower sound. The ribbon controller is deliberately delinearized to resemble a guitar, {{so there is a}} shorter distance between higher notes than between lower ones. Varying the pressure on the head (thereby opening and closing the [...] "mouth" [...] of the instrument) creates a wah-wah effect, and shaking the neck (and thereby slightly changing pressure on the head) creates a vibrato effect.

40|$|We study {{theoretically}} electron spins in nanowire {{quantum dots}} placed inside a transmission line resonator. Because of the spin-orbit interaction, the spins couple {{to the electric}} component of the resonator electromagnetic field and enable coherent manipulation, storage, and read-out of quantum information in an all-electrical fashion. Coupling between distant quantum-dot spins, in {{one and the same}} or different nanowires, can be efficiently performed via the resonator mode either in real time or through virtual processes. For the latter case we derive an effective spin-entangling interaction and suggest means <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> on and <b>off.</b> We consider both transverse and longitudinal types of nanowire quantum-dots and compare their manipulation timescales against the spin relaxation times. For this, we evaluate the rates for spin relaxation induced by the nanowire vibrations (phonons) and show that, as a result of phonon confinement in the nanowire, this rate is a strongly varying function of the spin operation frequency and thus can be drastically reduced compared to lateral quantum dots in GaAs. Our scheme is a step forward to the formation of hybrid structures where qubits of different nature can be integrated in a single device...|$|R
