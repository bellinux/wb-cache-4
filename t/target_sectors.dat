30|$|Here, N is {{the total}} number of beans, T is the number of red beans, and N−T is the number of black beans. In our context, an {{investigator}} searches T <b>target</b> <b>sectors</b> (red beans) obtained by splitting a target file out of an urn that contains N sectors (red and black beans) in n random samplings. Thus, p is the probability that at least one sector of T <b>target</b> <b>sectors</b> will be found in the n random samplings. For example, an investigator searches the sectors of a 100 MiB video file out of a set of 512 -byte sectors that are obtained from many drives that contain 100 TiB of data in total. If the 5, 000, 000 sectors are randomly sampled, p≈ 0.9915 (N= 214, 748, 364, 800, T= 204, 800, and n= 5, 000, 000).
