"That {{which was}} 'before the beginning' haunts {{it like an}} {{invisible}} ghost, and it tries to bury it, or deny it, but fails. <b>The</b> <b>beginning's</b> attempt to hide what is before it is the true beginning, precisely like the attempt of 'the end' to hide what is after it, in order to seal that same beginning, is the true 'ending'. i.e the beginning is in need, right from the start, of a certain illusion of it being 'the beginning'; <b>The</b> <b>beginning's</b> illusion of itself {{is the start of}} the beginning, and this illusion takes a spacial form.

5|$|Modern scholar Peter Davies surmises that Eusebius is {{referring}} to the same event as Lactantius, but that he heard of the event through public rumors and knew nothing of the privileged discussion at the emperor's private religion ceremony that Lactantius had access to. Since it was Galerius's army {{that would have been}} purgedDiocletian had left his in Egypt to quell continuing unrestAntiochenes would understandably have believed Galerius to be its instigator. The historian David Woods argues instead that Eusebius and Lactantius are referring to completely different events. Eusebius, according to Woods, describes <b>the</b> <b>beginnings</b> of the army purge in Palestine, while Lactantius describes events at court. Woods asserts that the relevant passage in Eusebius's Chronicon was corrupted in the translation to Latin and that Eusebius's text originally located <b>the</b> <b>beginnings</b> of the army persecution at a fort in Betthorus (El-Lejjun, Jordan).|$|E

40|$|PLATELET FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON FIFTEEN PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL CARCINOMA: A) PREOPERATIVELY, B) DURING ANAESTHESIA AND C) 30 MINUTES AND THREE HOURS AFTER <b>THE</b> <b>BEGINNING</b> OF <b>THE</b> OPERATION. THE FOLLOWING TESTS WERE APPLIED: 1. PLATELET COUNT. 2. BLEEDING TIME (MIELKE ET AL 1969). 3. PLATELET ADHESIVENESS TEST (SALZMAN'S METHOD, MODIFIED). 4. PLATELET AGGREGATION BY ADP, COLLAGEN AND ADRENALINE. 5. "ADP RELEASE" FROM PLATELETS BY COLLAGEN. IT WAS FOUND THAT: A) DURING THE ANAESTHESIA PERIOD THE PLATELET ADHESIVENESS, PLATELED AGGREGATION AND ADP-RELEASE WERE SLIGHTLY REDUCED. B) AT 30 MINUTES AFTER <b>THE</b> <b>BEGINNING</b> OF <b>THE</b> OPERATION THE PLATELET AGGREGATION SHOWED A FURTHER SLIGHTREDUCTION AND THE BLEEDING TIME WAS SLIGHTLY PROLONGED. C) THREE HOURS AFTERTHE <b>BEGINNING</b> OF <b>THE</b> OPERATION THE PLETELET AGGREGATION WAS FURTHER REDUCED AND THE BLEEDING TIME WAS FURTHER PROLONGED. THE PROLONGATION OF THE BLEEDING TIME THE REDUCTION OF PLATELET AGGREGATION BY ADP AND THE PROLONGATION OF THE DELAY PERIOD OF THE COLLAGEN-INDUCED AGGREGATION AT 3 HOURS AFTER <b>THE</b> <b>BEGINNING</b> OF <b>THE</b> OPERATION COMPARED TO THE ANAESTHESIA PERIOD WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT.

DATA ON THE REPRODUCTIVE PHENOLOGY CONCERN <b>THE</b> <b>BEGINNING</b> AND DURATION OF EACH REPRODUCTIVE PHASE. SEEDS OF ALYSSUM AKAMASICUM, FERULAGO CYPRIA, ORIGANUM CORDIFOLIUM, PHLOMIS CYPRIA AND PHLOMIS BREVIBRACTEATA MATURE IN THE END OF SUMMER WHILE DISPERSAL TAKES PLACE MOSTLY AFTER <b>THE</b> <b>BEGINNING</b> OF <b>THE</b> RAINY SEASON, IN THE MIDDLE OF AUTUMN (BRADYCHORY). THE DISPERSAL MECHANISM IS OMBROHYDROCHORY. SEED GERMINATION IS FAVOURED BY RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURES. THE COMBINATION OF BRADYCHORY, OMBROHYDROCHORY, AND GERMINATION IN LOW TEMPERATURES IS BENEFICIAL BECAUSE THE SEEDS ARE PROTECTED INSIDE THE REPRODUCTIVE STRUCTURES AND ARE EXPOSED ON THE SOIL AT THE MOST APPROPRIATE PERIOD, AS FAR AS GERMINATION AND SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENTARE CONCERNED.

5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound {{can be considered}} a {{musical instrument}}—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to <b>the</b> <b>beginnings</b> of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E

However, historian Donald Wagner questions Hartwell's method used to estimate these figures (i.e. by using Song tax and quota receipts).|$|E
