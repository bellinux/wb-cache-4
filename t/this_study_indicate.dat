The study found that when Copper Transporter 1 (CTR1) levels are decreased, the BRAF-related signaling and tumorigenesis levels decrease, also. Next, when human cells are transformed by BRAF or resistant to its inhibition, copper chelators used to treat Wilson's disease can help lessen tumor growth.

50|$|A study {{undertaken}} in 1983 {{sought to investigate}} if individuals who regularly participated in binge drinking, or were alcohol dependent, had a more distorted self perception than those individuals who were not abusing alcohol. The study measured the relative rate of body image distortion by asking participants in both a control, non-alcoholic abusive group {{and a group of}} alcohol dependent individuals to estimate the length and width of 22 different body parts, including the shoulders, arms, chest etc. The results showed that those individuals who were alcohol abusers saw their body parts as much larger than they actually were, indicating a distorted perception of self. The results from <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> {{that there may be a}} link between those who are predispositioned to engage in alcohol dependant or binge drinking behavior and a distorted perception of self which would help psychiatrists and clinical practitioners establish an at risk population and further would aid in better understanding and treating Drunkorexia.|$|E
5000|$|Fathead minnows {{have also}} been found to produce fewer {{epidermal}} alarm substance cells (and therefore less schreckstoff) when {{in the presence of}} familiar shoalmates. [...] The results of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> one of two scenarios, neither of which is compatible with the hypothesis that schreckstoff evolved by kin selection. First, if schreckstoff evolved by kin selection, more epidermal alarm substance cells would be expected to be produced in the presence of kin than nonkin. This means familiar shoalmates in fathead minnows should be closely related kin and schreckstoff production should be increased when in shoals with familiar individuals. The study did not find this to be the case. [...] Second, these results indicate individuals either do not associate with kin at all or production of schreckstoff varies depending on how familiar the focal fish is with the individuals with which it shoals. In conclusion, evidence does not support the hypothesis that schreckstoff evolved because it bolstered the inclusive fitness of the sender through increased survival of kin.|$|E

5000|$|The {{results of}} <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> that {{attention}} to threat (attention given, by the toddler to the feared stimuli) predicts social inhibition in kindergarten. Further, {{if the child}} approaches the feared stimuli, the relation to later social inhibition is not significant. When a child's behavior is to keep more than two {{feet away from the}} threatening stimulus, their behavior can be seen as linked to later social inhibition. Another important factor that the researchers found when looking at the prediction of social inhibition is the child paying a significant amount of attention to a feared or threatening stimuli in the presence of other, enjoyable activities. Mainly, if the child's duration of attention to the threatening stimuli is significant even when there are other enjoyable activities available for them to interact with, the link to later social inhibition is stronger {{due to the fact that}} [...] "toddler-aged children have increased motoric skill and independence in exploring their environments; so they are capable of using more sophisticated distraction techniques, such as involvement with other activities" [...] (Kopp, 1982 PG 199).|$|E
50|$|Christopher deCharms (of Omneuron in San Francisco) in {{conjunction}} with Stanford University School of Medicine has developed a real-time fMRI {{for the purpose of}} training the brain to activate its own endogenous opiates. Dr. deCharms believes this will revolutionize the treatment of chronic pain. The patient can control his own pain by visually looking at his rtfMRI, watching his own reactions in real time, and then blocking the pathways causing pain. deCharms mentions that clinical trials with rtfMRI is measuring a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain. With 8 participants in the study, deCharms et al.(2005) demonstrated that subjects can control the pain of heat stimulus, by visually observing in real time their brain activity. The subjects were instructed to use techniques such as changing the focus of their attention to the pain, and changing the emotional value of the pain. Then while viewing their own fMRI in real time the subjects could observe the effect of their thoughts {{on the part of the}} brain called the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). When the subject 'controlled the pain' the virtual flame on the fMRI got dimmer. Results from <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> two things: 1. That subjects can learn to voluntarily control brain activity in a specific region of the brain, and 2. There is a significant increase in the ability of healthy subjects to control their pain with repeated training. This study was then repeated with 8 patients with chronic intractable pain. The results showed that these patients were successful in reducing their pain rating by 64% (using the McGill Pain Questionnaire). The authors state that this is not yet a 'treatment', but still under serious investigation.|$|E
5000|$|Research {{has shown}} that mothers of infants who have Kewpie doll-like {{appearances}} show more affection, play more often with, and spend more time engaged with their baby than mothers of less attractive babies, despite the common belief that parents will treat their child the same, regardless of appearance. Psychologists compared the mother-infant interactions of three-month-old babies with craniofacial abnormalities and normal infants and observed that the mothers of the infants with abnormalities engaged their baby with smiles less often than the mothers of normal babies, spoke to their infants less, and were less responsive to their infants than were the mothers of the normal infants. The results of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>indicate</b> that the appearance, attractiveness, and facial configuration of an infant is a strong predictor of maternal affection and behavior toward the child. Recent research {{has shown that}} the phenomenon of decreased responsiveness and attention was not limited to infants with mild to severe head and face deformities. Families of low socioeconomic status with healthy newborn infants were selected to participate. Photos of their newborns were rated on attractiveness by a panel of university students. Researchers observed mother-infant interactions and recorded the [...] "affectionate interaction" [...] between the baby and mother (how often the mother kissed, smiled at, cuddled, held the baby), {{the amount of time spent}} on [...] "routine care-giving" [...] (fed, changed, cleaned up after the baby), and how often the mothers [...] "attended to others" [...] while with the baby. The researchers compared attractive and unattractive babies and showed that the mothers of more attractive infants had more affectionate interactions with their infants than the mothers of less attractive infants while the mothers of unattractive infants spent more time on routine care-giving and attended to others more often. The researchers believe they have established a relationship between the attractiveness of an infant and his or her treatment by the caregiver for normal children of different attractiveness.|$|E
