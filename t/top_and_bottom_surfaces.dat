5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E
25|$|The wing is of single-spar {{construction}} that {{passes through the}} aircraft's fuselage. The wingspan and total length of the Canberra are almost identical at just under 20 metres. Outboard of the engine nacelles, the wing has a leading edge sweep of 4° and trailing edge sweep of −14°. All flight controls are manual, using push-rods rather than cables, but are otherwise conventional. These actuate the aircraft's flight control surfaces, including shrouded-nosed ailerons, four-section conventional split-type flaps, and atypical airbrakes which comprise 40 hydraulically-raised fingers located on the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the wings. Swept-wings were considered, but not adopted, since the expected operational speeds did not warrant them and because they could have introduced new aerodynamic problems into what was otherwise anticipated to be a straightforward replacement for RAF Hawker Typhoon and Westland Whirlwind fighter-bombers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As for the {{impinging}} jets {{of single}} group slot nozzles, the heat {{transfer of the}} <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> strip <b>surface</b> is uneven which is mainly caused by the various jet distances of the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> nozzle to the strip surface {{and the effect of}} gravity. In this study, the convective heat transfer process of the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> strip <b>surface</b> due to single group slot nozzles in the ultra-fast cooling (UFC) system was studied by the fluid-structure interaction finite element method. The distributions of the flow field and heat transfer for the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> strip <b>surfaces</b> were obtained under the various parameters. The results showed that, the difference value of the average Nusselt numbe for the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> strip <b>surface</b> was decreased with the increase of the jet velocity, but when the jet velocity was up to 5 m/s it remained almost the same. The uniformity of the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> was improved by the jet impingement height (h) for the h < 45 mm. It was found that for h = 25 mm, the heat transfers of the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> down surfaces were more evenly, and the different value of average Nusselt number for the decreased by about 12. 6 %- 28 % as the jet impingement height increased from 25 mm to 45 mm when the slot width was 5 mm...|$|R

2500|$|Bernoulli's {{principle}} {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the lift force on an airfoil, if the behaviour of the fluid flow {{in the vicinity of the}} foil is known. [...] For example, if the air flowing past the top surface of an aircraft wing is moving faster than the air flowing past the bottom surface, then Bernoulli's principle implies that the pressure on the surfaces of the wing will be lower above than below. This pressure difference results in an upwards lifting force. Whenever the distribution of speed past the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>surfaces</b> of a wing is known, the lift forces can be calculated (to a good approximation) using Bernoulli's equations – established by Bernoulli over a century before the first man-made wings were used for the purpose of flight. Bernoulli's principle does not explain why the air flows faster past the top of the wing and slower past the underside. See the article on aerodynamic lift for more info.|$|E

30|$|After {{measuring}} {{two different}} mix design (0 – 19  % glass bead by total weight of aggregate) concrete slabs’ surface temperatures {{during the day}} in summer, it was obtained that, concrete surface temperature was higher than air temperature between 08 : 00 and 16 : 00  h. Top surface temperature differences were higher than bottom ones. Using glass beads reduced top surface temperature of concrete. The biggest temperature difference between <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> of standard C 30 / 37 strength class concrete was 14  °C at 14 : 00 while the difference was 3.5  °C for the concrete with 19  % glass beads in its mixture. Temperature differences between <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> of the concrete slab decrease by using glass beads in concrete mix design. Concrete road mix design specifications need to be regulated according to regions and climates to reduce the temperature gradient values and waste glass, which is needed {{to be used in}} sustainability, can also be used in concrete pavement mixture design in this purpose.|$|R
