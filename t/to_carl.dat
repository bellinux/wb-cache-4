5|$|According to a post-war {{account by}} Karl Strölin, the Oberbürgermeister of Stuttgart at that time, {{he and two}} other conspirators, Alexander von Falkenhausen and Carl Heinrich von Stülpnagel, began efforts to bring Rommel into the anti-Hitler {{conspiracy}} in early 1944. On 15 April 1944 Rommel's new chief of staff, Hans Speidel, arrived in Normandy and reintroduced Rommel to Stülpnagel. Speidel had previously been connected <b>to</b> <b>Carl</b> Goerdeler, the civilian leader of the resistance, {{but not to the}} plotters led by Stauffenberg, and only {{came to the attention of}} Stauffenberg due to his appointment to Rommel's headquarters. The conspirators felt they needed the support of a field marshal on active duty, and gave instructions to Speidel to bring Rommel into their circle.|$|E

5|$|Casting for {{the episode}} was difficult, as the {{production}} team wanted real Africans. They auditioned every one they could find, including an African theater troupe that was passing by. The role of Marcus Duff eventually went <b>to</b> <b>Carl</b> Lumbly, {{who was known}} for his role on CBS's Cagney & Lacey. The role of Aboah went to Willie Amakye, a Ghanaian Olympic runner who had just returned to his home in Southern California from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. To appear albino, Amakye's skin underwent several layers of cover-up cream, layers of white powder, and a little pink powder for color. He also wore contacts for the transparent pink eyes. Amakye's hair was dyed orange for post-production special effects to change it back and forth from black and white. As revealed on his resident alien card, Aboah's birthday is September 25, a reference to the birthday of Gillian Anderson's daughter.|$|E

5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate <b>to</b> <b>Carl</b> {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|During the session, {{in where}} drivers ran in packs and drafted off each other, Juan Pablo Montoya {{made contact with}} Kahne and sent his car {{spinning}} into the grass on the front stretch, tearing off some of its nose. Kahne was required to use a backup car {{for the rest of}} Speedweeks. Because the qualifying grids were chosen by the order in which drivers qualified in Daytona 500 pole position qualifying, the pole was given <b>to</b> <b>Carl</b> Edwards in the first race and to Biffle in the second. Edwards was joined on the grid's front row by Dale Earnhardt, Jr., with Ambrose in third. Stenhouse and Bayne started in fourth and fifth positions respectively. Biffle was joined by Mears on the front row for the second race, with Jeff Gordon in third. Martin Truex, Jr. started fourth, and was followed by Martin in fifth.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} member of Institut International de la Paix in 1913. He was a {{consultant}} for the Norwegian Nobel Institute from 1904 to 1913, with the task of examining proposed candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize. From 1918 to 1942 he served on the Norwegian Nobel Committee. In 1931, he gave the Award Ceremony Speech for the Nobelists Jane Addams and Nicholas Murray Butler, but was absent in the decisive meeting in 1936 that awarded the Nobel Peace Prize <b>to</b> <b>Carl</b> von Ossietzky. He was also absent while serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, not wishing to combine the two roles. He returned briefly afterwards, before leaving again in 1942. Another reason for his inactivity was that he had not lived in Norway since 1940, but either way the Prize was not awarded in any of the years from 1939 to 1943.|$|E

He was drafted in 1915 {{and sent to the}} front, where he was wounded. After being mustered out in 1918, he returned to Elberfeld.|$|R
