5|$|The Demi-Virgin is a three-act play {{written by}} Avery Hopwood. Producer Albert H. Woods staged it on Broadway, {{where it was}} a hit during the 1921–22 season. The play is a bedroom farce about former couple Gloria Graham and Wally Deane, both movie actors, whose {{marriage}} was so brief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> speculated about whether Gloria was still a virgin. She attempts to seduce Wally when {{they are forced to}} reunite for a movie, but after playing along he surprises her by revealing that their divorce is not valid.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{occurred at a}} time of unusually strained relations between the Muslim world and the West. This was a result of decades of Muslim immigration to Europe, recent political struggles, violent incidents such as September 11 and a string of Islamist terrorist attacks and Western interventions in Muslim countries. The cartoons were used as a tool by different political interests {{in a wide variety of}} local and international situations. Some debate surrounded the relationship between Islamic minorities and their broader societies, and the legal and moral limits <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> should observe when commenting on that minority or any religious minority group.|$|E

25|$|Franklin saw the {{printing}} press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain. It {{was more than a}} business venture, for like many publishers since, he believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> had a public-service duty.|$|E

25|$|The government's tone grew {{increasingly}} conciliatory as Zhao Ziyang returned from Pyongyang on April 30 and resumed his executive authority. In Zhao's view, the hardliner approach was not working, and concession {{was the only}} alternative. Zhao asked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> be opened to report the movement positively, and delivered two sympathetic speeches on 3–4 May. In the speeches, Zhao said that the student's concerns about corruption were legitimate, and that the student movement was patriotic in nature. The speeches essentially negated the message presented by April 26 Editorial. While some 100,000 students marched {{on the streets of}} Beijing on 4 May to commemorate the May Fourth Movement and repeat demands from earlier marches, many students were satisfied with the government's concessions. On 4 May, all Beijing universities except PKU and BNU announced the end of the class boycott. Subsequently, the majority of students began to lose interest in the movement.|$|E
