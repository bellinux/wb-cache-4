40|$|The {{opportunity}} to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> white lie (i. e., a lie that benefits another person) generates a moral conflict between two opposite moral dictates, one pushing towards telling always {{the truth and}} the other pushing towards helping others. Here we study how people resolve this moral conflict. What does <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> white lie signal about a person's pro-social tendencies? To answer this question, we conducted a two-stage 2 x 2 experiment. In the first stage, we used a Deception Game to measure aversion to <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> Pareto white lie (i. e., a lie that helps both the liar and the listener), and aversion to <b>telling</b> <b>an</b> altruistic white lie (i. e., a lie that helps the listener {{at the expense of}} the liar). In the second stage we measured altruistic tendencies using a Dictator Game and cooperative tendencies using a Prisoner's dilemma. We found three major results: (i) both altruism and cooperation are positively correlated with aversion to <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> Pareto white lie; (ii) both altruism and cooperation are negatively correlated with aversion to <b>telling</b> <b>an</b> altruistic white lie; (iii) men are more likely than women to <b>tell</b> <b>an</b> altruistic white lie, but not to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> Pareto white lie. Our results shed light on the moral conflit between pro-sociality and truth-telling. In particular, the first finding suggests that a significant proportion of people have non-distributional notions of what the right thing to do is: irrespective of their economic consequences, they tell the truth, they cooperate, they share their money.
