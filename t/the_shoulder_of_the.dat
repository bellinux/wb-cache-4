5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road. Thereafter he {{frequently}} walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E
5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} appears on <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dying Cú Chulainn, and {{could also be}} a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is {{associated}} with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E

5|$|Pork steaks are {{generally}} cut from <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pig, {{but can also}} be cut from the loin or leg of the pig. Shoulder steaks are cut from the same primal cut of meat most commonly used for pulled pork, and can be quite tough without long cooking times due to the high amount of collagen in the meat; therefore, pork shoulder steaks are often cooked slower than a typical beef steak, and may be stewed or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking.|$|E
5|$|While at Celtic, Hooper {{struck up}} an {{excellent}} partnership with fellow striker Anthony Stokes. They scored over 40 goals {{between them in}} their first season together and {{were considered to be}} Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, Georgios Samaras was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes. In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short to get the ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes to a deeper one, they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role. This made it very hard for defenders to mark them.|$|E

5|$|The team's {{original}} alternate logo was <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> a Sasquatch/Bigfoot and {{was seen}} on <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Avalanche's {{home and away}} jerseys. The logo was used on their jerseys since 1995; however, prior to <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2015 NHL Entry Draft, the club unveiled a new alternate logo. The new logo features the insignia taken from the Colorado state flag and re-colored to match the team's color scheme. The logo will be featured on a patch located on <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team's uniforms, along with a 20th anniversary logo, for the 2015–16 season.|$|R
25|$|The body rotates {{about its}} long axis with every arm stroke so that <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{recovering}} arm {{is higher than}} <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pushing/pulling arm. This makes the recovery much easier and reduces the need to turn the head to breathe. As one shoulder {{is out of the}} water, it reduces drag, and as it falls it aids the arm catching the water; as the other shoulder rises it aids the arm at end of the push to leave the water.|$|E

25|$|Paths - Pathways {{should never}} be straight. They should meander like a stream. This helps deepen the {{landscape}} by adding layers. The path can be the river, or a path along it, or the tracing of the sun through the sky over <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain. The concept is to never create inorganic patterns, but instead to mimic the patterns that nature creates.|$|E
50|$|The {{pitchfork}} {{is often}} used in satire of Christian demonology in popular media, especially in early humorous cartoons where a popular joke was a caricature of an angel and a pitchfork-wielding devil sitting on <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protagonist.|$|R

25|$|The fell is ascended {{either from}} Braithwaite or Stair in the Newlands Valley; the ascent from Stair uses an old mine road up Stoneycroft Gill which crosses <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fell at {{a height of}} 460m (1,510ft) from where the walker then strikes northerly to attain the summit. The direct route from Braithwaite follows Barrow Gill south {{westerly}} before going west to the highest point. The fell is often climbed along with the adjoining fell of Barrow {{to which it is}} connected by a ridge.|$|E
25|$|Cross – A powerful, {{straight}} punch thrown {{with the}} rear hand. From the guard position, the rear hand is thrown from the chin, crossing {{the body and}} traveling towards the target in a straight line. The rear shoulder is thrust forward and finishes just touching {{the outside of the}} chin. At the same time, the lead hand is retracted and tucked against the face to protect the inside of the chin. For additional power, the torso and hips are rotated counter-clockwise as the cross is thrown. A measure of an ideally extended cross is that <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> striking arm, the knee of the front leg and the ball of the front foot are on the same vertical plane.|$|E
25|$|Pin diamond:The pins {{are laid}} out in a diamond or 'frame', the lead or 'front' pin and behind it the middle or 'fat Annie' which is {{slightly}} wider at the girth {{than the rest of the}} pins, and the back pin- identical to the front pin. On each shoulder of the front pin are the 'quarters'- left and right, front and back. On <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quarters are the outside 'copper' pins, left and right. In Bristol skittles, the front pin and the back pin are painted with a red band, top and bottom. The quarter pins are painted with a white band, top and bottom and the middle pin a single red band around the girth. The coppers are unpainted. There is enough of a gap between all the pins for the balls to pass through without knocking anything down.|$|E

25|$|The Hungarian {{plan of the}} Spring Campaign, {{elaborated}} by Antal Vetter, {{was that}} the 7th corps, under the lead of András Gáspár, had {{to attract the attention}} of Windisch-Grätz on his troops by making and attack from the direction of Hatvan, while the other three corps (I., II., III.) would encircle the Austrian forces from South West, and cut them from the capital cities (Pest and Buda). According to the plan, the 7th corps had to stay at Hatvan until 5 April, than on 6th it had to reach Bag. The attack on the Austrian forces had to occur on 7 April at Gödöllő, from two directions, while the I. corps would advance to Kerepes, and fell on the Austrians from behind, preventing them to retreat towards Pest. The key of this very risky plan was that the Austrians would not discover the Hungarian movements until they completed the encirclement. This is why on <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian commander of the VIIth Corps, András Gáspár, lied a very big responsibility to lead his troops in a way which will not betray the campaigns strategy. This meant that he had to make the enemy commander who faced him, to think that he is face to face with the whole Hungarian army, distracting his attention about the I., II., and III. Hungarian corps, which in the meanwhile, were advancing towards Gödöllő from South-East. If Gáspár would have failed this task, Windsich-Grätz could been sent huge troops to destroy him, which would have been open before them the way to the interim Hungarian capital, Debrecen.|$|E
500|$|Before any {{cylinder}} is filled, {{verification of}} {{inspection and testing}} dates and a visual examination for external damage and corrosion are required by law in some jurisdictions, and are prudent even if not legally required at other places.

Shell bracelets made from <b>the</b> top <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body whorls <b>of</b> cone shells (Conus litteratus) are characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Late Neolithic Age. The natural spiral found along <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shell serves as a decorative motif.|$|R
