5|$|Chris Carter {{had envisioned}} Lance Henriksen portraying the {{character}} of Frank Black, long before he was ever contacted. Although Carter's colleagues responded positively to the selection, the Fox Network wanted someone younger to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> part.

Soon afterwards, Liverpool scored again as Šmicer beat Dida with a long-range {{shot into the}} bottom left-hand corner to leave Liverpool a goal behind.

5|$|Ali Aaltonen was {{replaced}} by Eero Haapalainen. He in turn was displaced by the Eino Rahja, Adolf Taimi and Evert Eloranta triumvirate. The last Red Guard commander in chief was Kullervo Manner. Some talented men with a high sense of responsibility such as Hugo Salmela in Tampere rose up to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> {{but they could not}} change the course of the war. The Reds achieved some local victories, as they retreated from southern Finland toward Russia, e.g. against German troops in the fierce Battle of Syrjäntaka on 28–29 April in Tuulos.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} quarter of the game, the Mean Green led the Midshipmen by as much as 18 points.

The Midshipmen rallied around a strong rushing offense to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> at the beginning of the third quarter, and the Mean Green's offensive momentum sputtered during the second half. Navy held the lead for the remainder of the game.|$|E
5|$|In early 1955 Hordern {{was asked}} by the British theatre manager and {{producer}} Binkie Beaumont to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> in André Roussin's comedy Nina, directed by Rex Harrison. The play, which starred Edith Evans, Lockwood West, and James Hayter, transferred from Oxford to the Theatre Royal in Brighton. Beaumont's request came at short notice because Hordern's predecessor had proved inadequate. The play was cursed with bad luck: Evans fell ill and was replaced midway by an understudy who neglected to learn her lines; Harrison frequently upset the cast, which resulted in reduced morale. When Evans did return, she walked off stage and left after seeing empty seats in the front row.|$|E

5|$|Less than 30seconds {{after the}} {{subsequent}} kick-off, United forced another corner, but Schmeichel stayed in his penalty area this time under instruction from Ferguson. Beckham again swung the corner in, finding {{the head of}} Sheringham, who nodded the ball down {{across the face of}} goal. Solskjær reacted fastest, shot out a foot and poked the ball into the roof of the Bayern goal for United to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead.</b> The goal was timed at 90+2:17'. Solskjær celebrated by sliding on his knees, mimicking Basler's earlier celebration, before quickly being mobbed by the United players, substitutes and coaching staff. Schmeichel, in his own penalty area, cartwheeled with glee.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside McLaren driver David Coulthard. Barrichello began from third, alongside Coulthard's teammate Mika Häkkinen. The front two of Michael Schumacher and Coulthard battled {{for first place}} until Coulthard served a ten-second stop-go penalty on lap 14 as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the race began. Just before half distance, Michael Schumacher made an early pit stop allowing Barrichello to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> until his own pit stop on lap 43. By this time rain began to fall causing drivers to make the switch to wet-weather tyres. Michael Schumacher retained his lead throughout and took the victory 0.1 seconds ahead of Barrichello.|$|E
5|$|Nebraska {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the game but Maurice Purify fumbled on the first play from scrimmage. Oklahoma recovered the ball at the Nebraska 2-yard-line and scored a touchdown to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> 70 with 48seconds expired off the clock. It was the fastest score in Big12 Championship Game history. With 5:35 {{left in the first}} quarter, Oklahoma's quarterback completed a touchdown pass to Malcolm Kelly to go up 140. With 4:37 left in the first half, Nebraska's Zach Taylor threw a touchdown pass and the extra point shaved Oklahoma's lead to 147, which was still the score as the game went to half-time.|$|E

50|$|The {{historic}} Monaco Grand Prix was {{the scene}} of an ultra-exciting race - as Piquet led for most of the race distance, and crashed out at Tabac. Jones <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> but had fuel feed problems, and Gilles Villeneuve in a poor-handling Ferrari <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> and won.|$|R
50|$|The NASCAR Convertible Series ran {{two races}} at North Wilkesboro. In 1957, Ken Rush won the pole {{and led the}} first 21 laps before Glen Wood <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> for <b>the</b> next 42 laps. Paul Goldsmith <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on Lap 64 and led {{the rest of the}} 160-lap race. In 1958, Roz Howard won the pole but never led a lap. Billy Myers <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on Lap One and {{continued}} until Lap 82 when he was passed by Gwyn Staley. Billy Myers retook <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on Lap 119 and <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> rest of the race.|$|R
5|$|Pittsburgh's first inter-conference {{opponent}} of the season was the Philadelphia Eagles. The Steelers scored on their first drive, with a Jeff Reed field goal. The Eagles offense drove 85yards to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on a touchdown pass from Donovan McNabb to Correll Buckhalter. The Eagles defense sacked Ben Roethlisberger eight times throughout the game, two of which resulted in fumbles. Bryant McFadden intercepted his second pass of the season which allowed Reed to add his second field goal of the day—this one from 53-yards. The field goal brought the half time score to 10–6.|$|E
5|$|Reserve Tom Watson {{replaced}} Partridge in {{goal and}} Hallam {{returned to the}} forward line for {{the second round of}} the Birmingham Cup, at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Wheldon scored with two minutes left to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> but the Wanderers still had time to tie the scores at 3–3. After consulting both captains, the referee ordered half-an-hour's extra time, but Wanderers, whose players had already returned to the dressing-rooms, refused to play, so Jenkyns claimed the game for Small Heath.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1964, {{a series}} of {{in-depth}} discussions took place between the governments of France and Great Britain on prospective collaborative military aviation programs; these involved talks between Handel Davies, the co-chairman of an Anglo-French committee, and his French counterpart, Ingénieur-General Lecamus, negotiating the launch of two new military combat aircraft. According to these negotiations, the French would <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> role in developing a new light ground-attack/trainer, while the British was to assume the leadership of a multirole fighter project. This multirole aircraft was to be equipped with a variable geometry wing and was intended to perform the strike, reconnaissance, and interceptor roles.|$|E
