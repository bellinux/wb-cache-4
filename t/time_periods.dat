5|$|Time Gal is a FMV-based game {{which uses}} {{pre-recorded}} animation rather than sprites {{to display the}} on-screen action. Gameplay is divided into levels, referred to as <b>time</b> <b>periods.</b> The game begins in 4001 AD with the theft of a time travel device. The thief, Luda, steals the device {{to take over the}} world by changing history. Reika, the protagonist also known as Time Gal, uses her own time travel device to pursue him; she travels to different <b>time</b> <b>periods,</b> such as 70,000,000 BC, 44 BC, 1588 AD, and 2010 AD, in search of Luda. Each time period is a scenario which presents a series of threats that must be avoided or confronted. Successfully navigating the sequences allows the player to progress to another period.|$|E

5|$|A later La Brea pits study {{compared}} tooth breakage of dire {{wolves in}} two <b>time</b> <b>periods.</b> One pit contained fossil dire wolves dated 15,000YBP and another dated 13,000YBP.

The study concluded that between 15,000–14,000YBP prey availability was less or competition was higher for dire wolves, and that by 13,000YBP, as the prey species moved towards extinction, predator competition had declined and therefore the frequency of tooth breakage in dire wolves had also declined.|$|E

5|$|During the {{production}} of his previous directorial venture Kites (2010), the director Anurag Basu wrote a two-page short story which was later developed to the script of Barfi!. The film script that Basu wrote alternated between two <b>time</b> <b>periods,</b> and he retained the nonlinear narrative structure. He said that the script required a 30-year time span for the characters' love to grow and thus set {{the backdrop of the}} film in the 1970s.|$|E

30|$|The {{problems}} of selecting the <b>time</b> <b>period</b> and selecting {{the pool of}} users are interdependent. As time goes on, more and more users either drop from the study or become non-compliant. Hence, selecting a longer <b>time</b> <b>period</b> {{would lead to a}} smaller user pool. However, selecting a shorter <b>time</b> <b>period</b> would encompass less temporal information about users’ SMS and health-related behaviors. Thus, we need to find a balance between the length of the <b>time</b> <b>period</b> {{and the size of the}} user pool, which we do as follows. We say that a user is active if they send or receive an SMS. From the SMS data, we extract information about each user’s first activity date and last activity date, i.e., the user’s “active time interval”. Then, for a given <b>time</b> <b>period</b> T during the study, we examine: 1) how many users are active during <b>time</b> <b>period</b> T (i.e., the users’ active time intervals “cover” the entire <b>time</b> <b>period</b> T), 2) how many users are active in the given week of T, for each week, and 3) how many users have dropped from the study prior to the end of <b>time</b> <b>period</b> T. We want to select a <b>time</b> <b>period</b> T such that items 1 and 2 are satisfied by as many users as possible, while item 3 is satisfied by as few users as possible.|$|R

Owing to the fall of Cocoon at the end of XIII and the {{collapse}} of its government (the Sanctum), at the start of XIII-2, most of Cocoon's inhabitants have moved down onto Gran Pulse, and some have learned magical abilities. Over the course of the game, a scientific body called the Academy becomes a new technocratic government. While the game starts off in the year 3 AF ('AF' being a new timescale set up after the fall of Cocoon), the story of XIII-2 jumps around several different <b>time</b> <b>periods,</b> and even parallel versions of different places, accessed via the Historia Crux. While most of the game takes place on Gran Pulse and inside Cocoon, there are two other major locations. One is the Void Beyond, a limbo between <b>time</b> <b>periods.</b> The other location is Valhalla, the capital of the goddess Etro. This place is a realm at the end of time where the goddess keeps a dark energy called Chaos from escaping and destroying the timeline.|$|E
5|$|Ancestors of {{contemporary}} salamanders were likely able to disperse and migrate into habitats of the Rocky Mountains and surrounding areas by the Eocene. Mesic forests {{were established in}} western North America by the mid Eocene and attained their contemporary range distributions by the early Pliocene. The temperate forest valleys and montane environments of these <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> (Paleogene to Neogene) would have provided the physiographic and ecological features supporting analogs {{of contemporary}} Ambystoma macrodactylum habitats. The Cascade Range rose during the mid Pliocene and created a rain shadow effect causing the xerification of the Columbia Basin and also altered ranges of temperate mesic ecosystems at higher elevations. The rise of the Cascades causing the xerification of the Columbia Basin is a major biogeographic feature of western North America that divided many species, including A.macrodactylum, into coastal and inland lineages.|$|E
