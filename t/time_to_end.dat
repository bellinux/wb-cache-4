5|$|In 1930, M-57 was {{designated}} from M-66 (now M-91) near Langston to M-47 (now M-52) in St. Charles. By the mid 1936, the section between Ithaca and St. Charles {{was removed from}} the state highway system when the designation was shifted south to run between Ashley and Chesaning. In the process, M-57 was run concurrently along US27 between Ithaca and Ashley. The western section was similarly shifting by May 1938. The new routing started at a junction with US131 between Rockford and Cedar Springs and continued through Greenville and Carson City to Ashley. The eastern end was also extended from Chesaning to the Clio area. It was extended a second time by early 1941 to a junction with Belsay Road. By the middle of 1946, the eastern end was extended a third <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> in Otisville. M-57 was lengthened after a western extension in late 1948 or early 1949. The highway was routed concurrently with US131 to Cedar Springs and then west to M-37 at Kent City.|$|E

25|$|Next up came {{a trip to}} Portugal for the Algarve Challenge Cup. The mini-league format {{would see}} 3 points awarded for a win and 1 for a draw, with an extra point for every goal scored.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of June 10, 1964, Senator Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) {{completed}} a filibustering address that he had begun 14 hours and 13 minutes earlier opposing the legislation. Until then, the measure had occupied the Senate for 60 working days, including six Saturdays. A day earlier, Democratic Whip Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, the bill's manager, concluded he had the 67 votes required at that <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> the debate and end the filibuster. With six wavering senators providing a four-vote victory margin, the final tally stood at 71 to 29. Never in history had the Senate been able to muster enough votes to cut off a filibuster on a civil rights bill. And only once in the 37 years since 1927 had it agreed to cloture for any measure.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the merger}} of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and the Canadian Alliance to create the Conservative Party of Canada in 2003, the provincial Progressive Conservatives have not been {{formally}} affiliated with {{a party at the}} federal level. Under Premier Williams the party's relationship with federal Conservatives, led by Stephen Harper, was often tenuous. After Harper reneged on a promise made to Williams during the 2006 federal election, regarding equalization payments, Williams launched the Anything But Conservative (ABC) campaign. The ABC campaign encouraged people to vote for any other party but the Conservatives, with a goal of making sure no Conservative was elected in the next federal election in Newfoundland and Labrador. The campaign, which was supported by all but one member of Williams' caucus, crippled the federal party's ability to find candidates and volunteers. On election night the campaign was successful, the Conservative Party lost the three seats they had held prior to the election, and won only 17 {{percent of the popular vote}} in the province. Despite being shut out of Newfoundland and Labrador the Conservatives did manage to win a second minority government. Following the election Williams announced that it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> his battle with Ottawa, and both he and Harper signalled a willingness to work with each other.|$|E

500|$|McDonald {{announced}} his retirement as a player on August 28, 1989, stating {{in a press conference}} that he made the determination before the 1988–89 season began that it would be his last. He also revealed that he had received an offer from another, unnamed, team to play in 1989–90 but felt that it was the right <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> his career. The Flames made McDonald their Vice President in Charge of Corporate and Community Affairs. [...] He chose the corporate position partly due to a fascination with the business world, and partly to remain close to his family as a role in hockey operations would have necessitated more travel. [...] His interest in business grew following his trade to Calgary as he was featured in numerous commercials and signed endorsements throughout southern Alberta. He had also previously served as {{a vice president of the}} NHLPA in the early 1980s. McDonald changed roles in 1992 as he was named the team's Vice President of Marketing. After serving four years in that position, McDonald became the Vice President of Corporate Development in 1996.|$|E
500|$|On 20 September, {{a public}} {{memorial}} service, introduced by Russell Crowe, {{was held in}} Australia Zoo's 5,500-seat Crocoseum; this service was broadcast live throughout Australia, the United States, the UK, Germany, and Asia, and it is estimated to have been seen by over 300 million viewers worldwide. The memorial included remarks by Prime Minister Howard; Irwin's father Bob and daughter Bindi; his associates Wes Mannion and John Stainton; and celebrities from Australia and around the world. Anthony Field of The Wiggles partly hosted the service, often sharing the screen with various animals, from koalas to elephants. Australian music star John Williamson sang [...] "True Blue", which was Irwin's favourite song. In a symbolic finish to the service, Irwin's truck was loaded up with gear and driven out of the arena {{for the last time}} as Williamson sang. As a final tribute, Australia Zoo staff spelled out Irwin's catchphrase [...] "Crikey" [...] in yellow flowers as Irwin's truck was driven from the Crocoseum for the last <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> the service.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{resolution}} of the character at season four and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast, Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season, and [...] "it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> the character's story". But, they changed his original [...] "violent, morbid" [...] sendoff to a relatively happy one, citing their likability of actor and character as the reason. Also it was [...] "nice to give someone a happy ending for once." [...] Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff, particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted: [...] That to me is the soul of the character. The name of the show is Angel so it all comes back to him. For Connor, everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz, and when we got the opportunity for him to let that out, I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity. He showed that he was hurt by his father and that he was hurt by Holtz. The last scene of Angel watching memory-wiped Connor dine with his new family and slipping away quietly was Whedon's idea, derived from 1937's classic movie Stella Dallas: [...] "I've given up my child. I see my child is happy, and does not know me, and I'm happy. That is the thing that made Stella Darlas the greatest, the thing that made this episode work." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, {{the leaders}} in {{attendance}} gather for what is officially known as the APEC Leaders' Family Photo. A long-standing tradition for this photo involved the attending leaders dressing in a costume that reflects the culture of the host member. The tradition dates back to the first such meeting in 1993 when then-U.S.President Bill Clinton outfitted the leaders in leather bombardier jackets. However, at the 2010 meeting, Japan opted to have the leaders dress in smart casual rather than the traditional kimono. Similarly, when Honolulu was selected in 2009 as the site for the 2011 APEC meeting, U.S.President Barack Obama joked that he looked forward to seeing the leaders dressed in [...] "flowered shirts and grass skirts". However, after viewing previous photos, and concerned that having the leaders dress in aloha shirts might give the wrong impression during a period of economic austerity, Obama decided that it might be <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> the tradition. Leaders were given a specially designed aloha shirt as a gift but were not required to wear it for the photo. However at the 2013 conference in Bali, Indonesia, leaders are toned with Batik outfit.|$|E
