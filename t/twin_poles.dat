2500|$|In olden {{days the}} <b>twin</b> <b>poles</b> of Australian cricket - Melbourne and Sydney - each hosted two Tests in a season, {{but now that}} Brisbane {{received}} a Test they took it in turns to host the extra Test and the Australian XI game. The selectors chose Test hopefuls under the Australian vice-captain Neil Harvey; Grahame Thomas, Bobby Simpson, Barry Shepherd, Ian McLachlan, Frank Misson, Bob Cowper, Tom Veivers, Johnny Martin, [...] Barry Jarman, Colin Guest and 12th man Jack Potter. Harvey must have had bitter memories of the match four years before which cost him the Australian captaincy; Peter May made 140 and 114, Laker and Lock took 12 wickets and the MCC won by 345 runs. Ted Dexter won the toss and after the loss of Geoff Pullar at 35/1 Dexter marched out and thrashed 102 off 110 minutes, hitting 2 sixes and 13 fours, and {{the hands of the}} fielders were left bruised and burning. [...] "There was a drive off Vievers which sent the ball soaring over the sightboard". John Woodcock [...] of The Times wrote [...] "I doubt if it is possible to hit a cricket ball any harder than Dexter did today. Melbourne is a huge ground and no one who hits a six here is likely to forget it. Against Veivers, an off-spinner, Dexter twice cleared the sight screen, once by a good 20 yards." [...] After his departure Colin Cowdrey began to caressed the ball through the covers for 88, Ken Barrington a highly efficient 122 not out, Fred Titmus 37 and Barry Knight hit the 57 not like a good all rounder and the MCC make 458/5 in a day. Dexter carried on the innings for most of the next day, seeing Barrington make his first first-class double century (219 not out) and Knight 108, adding 209 for the sixth-wicket. He finally declared 40 minutes for tea for 633/7, had he waited any longer tea would have been taken early, but lost the advantage due to rain. It was the highest score by the MCC or England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the highest by the MCC since Douglas Jardine and company racked up 634/9 against South Australia back in 1932-33. The best bowler was Bobby Simpson who took 3/153 and now made 130 in response, adding 72 for the first-wicket with Thomas (27), 100 for the second with Harvey (51) and 67 for the third with Shepherd (114). Shepherd and McLachlan (55) added another 115 for the fourth-wicket, but David Larter (3/80) took three quick wickets and the Australian XI fell from 415/5 to 451 all out on the fourth and final day. Dexter was 182 runs ahead and could have enforced the follow on, but decided to give his bowlers a rest and batted again, but not very well. Colin Guest took 3/22 in some compensence for his first innings hammering and Dexter declared on 68/5, leaving the Australians 160 minutes to make 251 runs to win. They reached 201/4 thanks mainly to 91 not out from Shepherd and 68 from McLachlan. Dexter had used negative field placings throughout the match, which rather killed the sporting declaration, and the game died on its feet.|$|E

To support this claim, it teases out small shifts in the twentieth century's episteme that collectively contributed to the early 1970 s emergence of what it terms pornography's performatistic screen, or the base, plotted structure of bodily performance and engagement underpinning sexual displays as enacted over time in orgasmically-oriented hard core film. This project starts with the <b>twin</b> Foucaultian <b>poles</b> of law and "humansciences" as represented by the metonyms of American obscenity jurisprudence and sexology, finding in both a late 1960 s pivot to issues of social construction and utility as tethered to narrative. Following this, it narrows focus to look at increasing rates of oral sex in American sexual practice and the changing production and exhibition of filmedpornography. After analyzing then-contemporary concepts of desire in readerly narrative, it finishes by proposing a model for how plotted sex works both within and alongside broader narrative. In all of these analyses, this project pays {{particular attention to the}} shifting role narrative occupies in matrices of power, knowledge, and pleasure. It argues that narrative plotting, when applied to sex, increasingly functions as a tool for both policing and reduplicating social and cultural norms...|$|R
40|$|The Antarctic Tropospheric Chemistry Investigation (ANTCI) {{was carried}} out from late November to December 2003 with both {{extended}} ground-based and tethered balloon studies at Amundsen Scott Station, South Pole. ANTCI 2003 {{was the first of}} two Antarctic field studies with the primary goal of further exploring the active photochemistry of the South Pole region that was first identified in the previous Investigation of Sulfur Chemistry in the Antarctic Troposphere (ISCAT) program. Since ISCAT was fully ground-based, ANTCI 2003 goals included expanding chemical studies both vertically upward to investigate mixing and horizontally to better understand large-scale plateau NO, production and transport. Thus, in addition to ground-based experiments at South <b>Pole,</b> <b>Twin</b> Otter aircraft sampling took place out to hundreds of kilometers in several directions from the South Pole. These were designed to specifically address the issue of how representative past South Pole chemical measurements are of the surrounding high plateau region. The Twin Otterwas also used to make transects along the coast both north and south of McMurdo Station. The present paper summarizes the overall setting and results of this investigation and highlights the many new findings that were obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is the development of high strength, high conductivity copper films. Pure copper is soft and traditional strengthening mechanisms cause substantial decrease in conductivity. To address the challenge, epitaxial nanotwinned copper films are synthesized on HF etched Si (110) substrates. These films show high hardness (~ 2. 8 GPa) due to high density of coherent twin boundaries (CTBs) which effectively block the motion of dislocations similar to grain boundaries (GBs). Resistivity of CTBs is calculated to be an order of magnitude lower than that of GBs. Hence, conductivity of nanotwinned copper is still comparable to that of pure copper. In addition, it is shown that average twin spacing can be controlled by adjusting deposition rate. Analytical studies together with experimental evidence show that nanotwins can improve the strength-to-resistivity ratio significantly in copper. In general, nanocrystalline metals suffer from low ductility. To study plastic deformation via rolling, thick polycrystalline nanotwinned copper foils are sputtered on SiO 2 and then peeled off the substrate. Despite the high strength, room temperature rolling experiments show that nanotwinned copper films exhibit stable plastic flow with no shear localization or fracture even at thickness reduction of over 50 %. Postdeformation studies of microstructure reveals that the plastic deformation is facilitated by the migration of CTBs normal to the twin boundary plane due to the glide of twinning dislocations in the <b>twin</b> plane. X-ray <b>pole</b> figure measurements show insignificant out of plane rotation as a result of 50 % rolling thickness reduction. Thermal stability of nanocrystalline metals is also a concern. Free standing nanotwinned polycrystalline copper films show remarkable thermal stability after annealing at 800 degrees C. The driving force for twin growth is much lower than that for grain coarsening because the energy stored in CTBs is an order of magnitude lower than that of GBs. As a result, the average twin spacing stays below 20 nm after annealing. Such high thermal stability of nanotwins leads to the retention of hardness of 2. 2 GPa. Low energy twin boundary may provide a unique way to achieve both high strength and high temperature thermal stability in certain metallic materials...|$|R
