5|$|Because Jupiter {{is not a}} solid body, {{its upper}} {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. <b>The</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5minutes longer {{than that of the}} equatorial atmosphere; three systems are used as frames of reference, particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies from the latitudes 10°N to 10°S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55m 40.6s.

5|$|Deep Impact {{observed}} Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) from February 20 to April 8, 2012, {{using its}} Medium Resolution Instrument, {{through a variety}} of filters. The comet was 1.75–2.11 astronomical units (AU) (2.62–3.16×108 km) from the Sun and 1.87–1.30 AU from the spacecraft. It was found that the outgassing from the comet varies with a period of 10.4 hours, which is presumed to be due to <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> its nucleus. The dry ice content of the comet was measured and found to be about ten percent of its water ice content by number of molecules.|$|E
5|$|Early radio {{telescope}} interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> the Earth to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very long baseline interferometry.|$|E

40|$|This {{study shows}} that the common {{practice}} in existing frame methods <b>of</b> assuming <b>the</b> <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coupling beams at beam-wall joints to be equal to <b>the</b> <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizontal rigid arms would lead to incompatibility between the beam and wall elements at their joints and eventually errors in the effective stiffness of the coupling beams. It is postulated that to resolve the problem, the rotational DOF at the beam-wall joints should be changed to <b>the</b> <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertical fibres there. This would, however, necessitate the use of frame elements with two rotational DOF at each end or solid wall elements with rotational DOF at each node to model the structure. Such required frame and solid wall elements are developed in this paper based on a Timoshenko beam element with two rotational DOF at each end. The resulting new frame method is much more accurate and versatile than the existing frame methods. © 1992. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit – where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation – rises as expected in the east but slowly. Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos, 2.7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer, as it slowly falls behind <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> Mars.|$|E
