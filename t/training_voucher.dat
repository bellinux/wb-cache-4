Using the population of female job returners who receive a <b>training</b> <b>voucher</b> to participate in training courses and a randomly selected control group from German administrative data, we analyze the effectiveness of training on the employment probability, monthly earnings and job quality. The {{results suggest that the}} receipt of a <b>training</b> <b>voucher</b> translates into a higher employment probability and higher monthly earnings. We find an positive impact on the job quality, e. g. the probability to be full-time employed increases significantly. In contrast, the probability to be marginally employed decreases by 5 percentage points in the long-run. We count this as an indicator for employment stability. The investigation of effect heterogeneity reveals some interesting insights regarding the vocational degrees, and the different types of training courses. The effectiveness of vocational training increases with the provided human capital in the courses. Several robustness checks support a causal interpretation of the results and highlight the importance of vocational training for the very special sub-group of female job-returners...|$|E

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to describe the variation between the award intensity of one important program of ALMP between local employment agencies. Besides structural differences in the unemployment stock and regional conditions, parameters that are likely to incorporate the policy style of employment agencies are taken as explanatory information to learn more about the source of the variation in the use of <b>training</b> <b>vouchers.</b> We use data provided by the German Federal Employment Agency, including the precise numbers of awarded <b>training</b> <b>vouchers</b> between 2005 and 2010 at the level of local employment agencies. We combine this data set with variables describing local labor market conditions and regional characteristics to take into account regional effects and effects that stem from the composition of the unemployment stock. In a further step, we explain the inter-regional variation by parameters related to the policy style of employment agencies regarding the use of <b>training</b> <b>vouchers.</b> The reform of the provision of further training for unemployed individuals in 2003 and 2005 led to substantial organizational changes within the employment agencies that affected the work content and requirements as well as caseworkers’ and managers’ attitudes regarding further training programs. We use a unique set of survey data that includes information about caseworkers’ and managers’ attitudes towards the reform in further training as well as information about the organizational structures within the agencies and their cooperative and communicative behavior.|$|R

Our results show that participation in training programs had a positive impact on employment prospects already before the reform. Results for the relative short observation period since the reform are pointing to a further increase of effectiveness. The driving force behind this seems to come from reducing the duration of training programs, which has decreased the lock-in effect without affecting the program effect...|$|R

40|$|A crucial change {{brought about}} by the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998 has been the {{requirement}} that local workforce agencies use training vouchers, known as Individual Training Accounts (ITAs), to provide training to their customers. Training vouchers are intended to maximize customer choice in training decisions. Theoretically, if individuals use vouchers to choose the training occupations and providers they value the most, the use of training vouchers should also generally maximize social welfare. However, the success of training vouchers in maximizing social welfare depends on individuals making sensible choices based on reliable information. In an actual training market, it may be difficult for individuals to collect reliable information about occupational opportunities and training providers or to use this information effectively in making sensible training choices. Hence, the use of a pure, unrestricted <b>training</b> <b>voucher</b> with no further government role is probably unrealistic. Instead, the government trainin...|$|E
