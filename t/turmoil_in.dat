5|$|Concurrently, Bangui {{also became}} the key centre {{for social and}} {{cultural}} activity in the region, when new institutions were established in the city. However, political <b>turmoil</b> <b>in</b> the country, rampant corruption, and the dictatorial rule of President Bokassa centred in the city, brought in economic recession in the 1970s exacerbated by a fall in international prices for its major exports. This caused impoverishment {{of the people and}} severe conflict, further compounded by refugees migrating from troubled neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|Fleeing {{religious}} persecution and political <b>turmoil</b> <b>in</b> Britain, the Priestleys {{emigrated to the}} United States in 1794 seeking a peaceful life. Hoping to avoid the political troubles that had plagued them in Britain and the problems of urban life they saw in the United States, the Priestleys built a house in rural Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, political disputes and family troubles dogged Priestley during {{the last ten years}} of his life.|$|E

5|$|Luperón would {{eventually}} arrive in Paris as a named ambassador, but Betances' {{connections in the}} city proved to be key to whatever success Luperón had as a diplomat in France. They would assume this role until political <b>turmoil</b> <b>in</b> the Dominican Republic forced Luperón to return and lead yet another revolt, which had another Puerto Plata native, Ulises Heureaux, installed as president. Betances sought support for Luperón's efforts, and gave him tactical and financial assistance from France.|$|E
5|$|The war {{had also}} led to {{political}} tensions, revolution and <b>turmoil.</b> <b>In</b> Russia, the conflict resulted in revolution and civil war between 1917 and 1923, and the rise to power of the Communist Bolshevik government. The German Empire had seen revolution break {{out at the end}} of the war, with vicious street fighting in the major cities, including Berlin; some Germans felt that this experience was too quickly forgotten in the post-war years. Romania almost descended into revolution as well. There was <b>turmoil</b> <b>in</b> Ireland; 210,000 Irish served in the war as part of the British forces, but the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916 led in turn to the Irish War of Independence and the later civil war. Elsewhere the war exposed simmering ethnic and religious divisions. In Canada, for example, the distinctions between the English, largely Protestant, and French speaking, predominantly Catholic, parts of the country become increasingly apparent, with conscription becoming a major political issue.|$|E
5|$|The year 1968 {{had seen}} <b>turmoil</b> <b>in</b> the United States, {{including}} riots and {{the assassination of}} civil rights leader Martin Luther King. Prior to the Olympics in Mexico City in October 1968, some African Americans, led by activist Harry Edwards, had urged a boycott of the Games, but found little enthusiasm among athletes, reluctant to waste years of effort. The atmosphere was made more tense by unrest in Mexico City before the Games which left dozens dead.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{political}} <b>turmoils</b> <b>in</b> Guatemala, in 2015, Ambassador Carrera requested publicly for the resignation of president Perez Molina. After manifesting it in an opinion editorial, he presented his resignation to his post at the UN on August 25, 2015.|$|R
50|$|Sally Belfrage (October 4, 1936 - March 14, 1994) was a United States-born British-based 20th century non-fiction {{writer and}} {{international}} journalist.

50|$|The {{following}} year <b>turmoils</b> <b>in</b> Perugia brought {{power to the}} Ruspanti ("Rough") party against the Beccherini, who were of noble origin. The latter were exiled while a commission of 25 asked Michelotti to lead the new government. He therefore became Signore of the city.|$|R
5|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1990, after the first {{democratic}} elections in Croatia, the municipal government finally approved the project. An architectural competition was planned for January 1991. Political <b>turmoil</b> <b>in</b> the country, followed by the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995), caused the project {{to be put on}} hold again. In 1994 President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman said to Jakov Bienenfeld, Council member of the Zagreb Jewish community, that they should build the new synagogue {{at the site of the}} former synagogue, which will be funded by the Croatian government. Bienenfeld declined the offer believing to be inappropriate when 1800 Catholic churches are left destroyed at the time, during Croatian War of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Carney was {{appointed}} U.S. Ambassador to Sudan on 27 June 1995 {{during a period}} of <b>turmoil</b> <b>in</b> U.S.-Sudan relations. Osama bin Laden had fled Saudi Arabia for the safe confines of Khartoum a few years earlier, and Sudan's alleged harboring and abetting of Muslim extremists on its soil was attracting attention of counterterrorism experts in the United States and abroad. Carney's tenure as ambassador followed a tumultuous period during which his predecessor, Donald K. Petterson, had been forced to draw down embassy staff by half and send their families back to America when terrorist threats were made against U.S. diplomats stationed in Khartoum.|$|E
5|$|Champollion, {{a liberal}} and {{progressive}} minded man, {{lived in a}} period of political <b>turmoil</b> <b>in</b> France which continuously threatened to disrupt his research in various ways. During the Napoleonic wars he was able to avoid conscription, but his Napoleonic allegiances meant that he was considered suspect by the subsequent Royalist regime. His own actions, sometimes brash and reckless, did not help his case. His relations with important political and scientific figures of the time, such as Joseph Fourier and Silvestre de Sacy helped him, although in some periods he lived exiled from the scientific community.|$|E
50|$|With the <b>turmoils</b> <b>in</b> summer 1956, {{more and}} more Hungarians fled to the west over the border to Austria. Even though {{it was just a}} small, wooden bridge over a small river, the bridge at Andau was the escape route for about 70,000 Hungarian people during the Hungarian Revolution.|$|R

50|$|Unlike other Red Cross and Red Crescent {{societies}} worldwide, {{which are}} notable for their humanitarian effort, Hong Kong Red Cross {{is better known}} for blood transfusion in Hong Kong. This {{may be due to}} a few disasters threatening and political <b>turmoils</b> <b>in</b> the territory, also its long history of service from 1952. The blood transfusion service runs under the Hospital Authority.|$|R
5|$|Concerned {{about the}} {{continuing}} <b>turmoil</b> <b>in</b> Russia, Euler left St. Petersburg on 19 June 1741 {{to take up}} a post at the Berlin Academy, which he had been offered by Frederick the Great of Prussia. He lived for twenty-five years in Berlin, where he wrote over 380 articles. In Berlin, he published the two works for which he would become most renowned: The Introductio in analysin infinitorum, a text on functions published in 1748, and the Institutiones calculi differentialis, published in 1755 on differential calculus. In 1755, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.|$|E
5|$|From 872 to 877 {{there was}} {{apparently}} {{a period of}} calm, since the sources are silent on any military operations in Sicily. This was probably chiefly due to internal <b>turmoil</b> <b>in</b> Muslim Sicily, with six governors reported as having taken office during this period, {{as well as the}} weakness of the Aghlabid government on the Ifriqiyan metropolis. In Italy, Muslim raids continued, but the Byzantines had a major success in 875 or 876, after the death of Louis II, when they took possession of Bari.|$|E
5|$|In December 1817, Edwards, {{responding}} to a movement for statehood led by his ally Daniel Pope Cook, recommended to the legislature that Illinois apply for admission to the Union. He also recommended that a census first be taken of the territory, a standard practice, but the legislature rejected this. Legislators, particularly those opposed to slavery, feared that any delay would allow Missouri to apply for statehood before Illinois, and that since Missouri was a slave state, this would cause so much <b>turmoil</b> <b>in</b> Congress that it would delay Illinois' admission even longer.|$|E

Proposals of Galaxy <b>in</b> <b>Turmoil</b> falling under the paywall of Electronic Arts, and ideas of Lucasfilm giving Frontwire Studios a Star Wars IP licence were both rejected due to an agreement between Electronic Arts and Lucasfilm. Although Frontwire Studios may have fallen within Fair Use laws, legal conflict was avoided and the fan made Star Wars inspired project was canceled. There is a playable alpha that contains assets from Free Radical Design that was released to the public then removed early on within Galaxy <b>in</b> <b>Turmoil's</b> lifetime.

5|$|Jordan {{is a key}} ally of the USA and UK and, {{together}} with Egypt, {{is one of only}} two Arab nations to have signed peace treaties with Israel, Jordan's direct neighbour. Jordan views an independent Palestinian state with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest. The ruling Hashemite dynasty has had custodianship over holy sites in Jerusalem since 1924, a position re-inforced in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. <b>Turmoil</b> <b>in</b> Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque between Israelis and Palestinians created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role in protecting the Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Parker next {{performed}} {{in a pair of}} low budget movies: Felon and Tunnel Rats. Despite these early light roles, Parker's onscreen charisma and general je ne sais quoi showed, earning Parker comparisons to Paul Newman. In Felon, Parker played a rookie guard dealing with inner <b>turmoil.</b> <b>In</b> 2008's The Secret Life of Bees, Parker played the good-hearted love interest of Alicia Keys' character. Parker's character has to deal with the challenges of spurned love. The movie was written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood based on the book of the same name by Sue Monk Kidd.|$|E
5|$|Political <b>turmoil</b> <b>in</b> Ireland {{continued}} as the Nationalists fought for independence; George expressed his horror at government-sanctioned killings and reprisals to Prime Minister David Lloyd George. At the opening {{session of the}} Parliament of Northern Ireland on 22 June 1921, the King appealed for conciliation in a speech part drafted by General Jan Smuts and approved by Lloyd George. A few weeks later, a truce was agreed. Negotiations between Britain and the Irish secessionists led to {{the signing of the}} Anglo-Irish Treaty. By the end of 1922, Ireland was partitioned, the Irish Free State was established, and Lloyd George was out of office.|$|E

5|$|The Avalanche's success came amid {{considerable}} <b>turmoil</b> <b>in</b> {{the front}} office. COMSAT's diversification into sports ownership was proving {{a drain on}} the company. In particular, cost overruns associated {{with the construction of}} Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent to Liberty Media. However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.|$|E
5|$|The Second Arab {{siege of}} Constantinople in 717–718 was a {{combined}} {{land and sea}} offensive by the Muslim Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate against {{the capital city of}} the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople. The campaign marked the culmination of twenty years of attacks and progressive Arab occupation of the Byzantine borderlands, while Byzantine strength was sapped by prolonged internal <b>turmoil.</b> <b>In</b> 716, after years of preparations, the Arabs, led by Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, invaded Byzantine Asia Minor. The Arabs initially hoped to exploit Byzantine civil strife and made common cause with the general Leo III the Isaurian, who had risen up against Emperor Theodosius III. Leo, however, tricked them and secured the Byzantine throne for himself.|$|E
5|$|The Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} {{lives in}} both lowland and highland secondary rainforest, swamps, and cloud forests. It inhabits hilly areas close to water, particularly steep upper valleys with copious undergrowth. The Sumatran rhinoceros once inhabited a continuous range {{as far north}} as Burma, eastern India, and Bangladesh. Unconfirmed reports also placed it in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. All known living animals occur in Peninsular Malaysia, the island of Sumatra, and Sabah, Borneo. Some conservationists hope Sumatran rhinos may still survive in Burma, though it is considered unlikely. Political <b>turmoil</b> <b>in</b> Burma has prevented any assessment or study of possible survivors. The last reports of stray animals from Indian limits were in 1990s.|$|E
50|$|The E 14 {{section was}} kept {{separate}} {{from the rest of}} the Norwegian Intelligence Service of Norway and its existence were known to very few individuals in Norway.

The enemy scenario in the Balkans became more difficult as NATO took overall command of the United Nations. To secure Norwegian personnel in the area, it was necessary to have a tighter and better intelligence.|$|R
