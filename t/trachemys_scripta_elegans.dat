40|$|Vestibular {{hair cell}} bundles {{in the inner}} ear contain a single kinocilium {{composed}} of a 9 + 2 microtubule structure. Kinocilia {{play a crucial role}} in transmitting movement of the overlying mass, otoconial membrane or cupula to the mechanotransducing portion of the hair cell bundle. Little is known regarding the mechanical deformation properties of the kinocilium. Using a force-deflection technique, we measured two important mechanical properties of kinocilia in the utricle of a turtle, <b>Trachemys</b> (Pseudemys) <b>scripta</b> <b>elegans.</b> First, we measured the stiffness of kinocilia with different heights. These kinocilia were assumed to be homogenous cylindrical rods and were modeled as both isotropic Euler–Bernoulli beams and transversely isotropic Timoshenko beams. Two mechanical properties of the kinocilia were derived from the beam analysis: flexural rigidity (EI) and shear rigidity (kGA). The Timoshenko model produced a better fit to the experimental data, predicting EI= 10, 400 pN μm 2 and kGA= 247 pN. Assuming a homogenous rod, the shear modulus (G= 1. 9 kPa) was four orders of magnitude less than Young's modulus (E= 14. 1 MPa), indicating that significant shear deformation occurs within deflected kinocilia. When analyzed as an Euler–Bernoulli beam, which neglects translational shear, EI increased linearly with kinocilium height, giving underestimates of EI for shorter kinocilia. Second, we measured the rotational stiffness of the kinocilium insertion (κ) into the hair cell's apical surface. Following BAPTA treatment to break the kinocilial links, the kinocilia remained upright, and κ was measured as 177 ± 47 pN μm rad– 1. The mechanical parameters we quantified are important for understanding how forces arising from head movement are transduced and encoded by hair cells...|$|R

50|$|The Jamaican slider {{is listed}} as Vulnerable in the 2007 IUCN Red List but is not {{currently}} listed under CITES. The populations in both Jamaica and the Bahamas are largely effected by introduced predators to those islands. These include dogs, cats, raccoons, rats, pigs and mongooses. In the Bahamas, habitat loss is an ever increasing threat to the Jamaican Slider and this includes Cat Island. On many islands in the Bahamas fresh water is relatively scarce and therefore the contamination of fresh water ponds with salt water particularly after hurricanes, has a devastating effect. However in the Bahamas, the biggest cause for concern is the continued importation of the red-eared slider <b>Trachemys</b> <b>scripta</b> <b>elegans</b> for the pet trade. They are very popular as pets in the Bahamas but once the animal has out grown its welcome they are released into nearby ponds. The island of New Providence, and nearby Paradise Island, have very diluted stocks and this is possibly true {{for some of the}} other islands also. It is known, however, that the red-eared slider <b>Trachemys</b> <b>scripta</b> <b>elegans</b> has not been released onto Cat Island to date.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{large group}} {{including}} many common domestic and introduced species, {{many of which are}} regarded as pests. It includes numerous land mammals and birds, three species of Australian Litoria tree frogs, the Australian rainbow skink (Lampropholis delicata) and the North American red-eared slider turtle (<b>Trachemys</b> <b>scripta</b> <b>elegans).</b> The only species on this list that occur naturally in New Zealand are the southern black-backed gull and the spur-winged plover (masked lapwing), both of which present a significant risk of bird strike.|$|E
50|$|The Jamaican slider {{is found}} in many {{different}} areas {{on the island of}} Jamaica and on a few islands in the Bahamas. In the Bahamas about 60% of its population can be found on Cat Island (which is why it is known as the Cat island slider in the Bahamas) and smaller populations can also be found on the islands of Eleuthera, Andros Island, Exumas and New Providence. However, the population on New Providence (and nearby Paradise Island) and Exuma is a hybrid between the red-eared slider <b>Trachemys</b> <b>scripta</b> <b>elegans</b> and the Inagua Slider T. stejnegeri malonei from Great Inagua.|$|E

Illustration from Schoepff (1792 : pl. 3, figs. 4 – 5), {{showing the}} holotype of Testudo scripta Thunberg in Schoepff 1792 (also Testudo scabra L. sensu Thunberg in Schoepff) (presently <b>Trachemys</b> <b>scripta</b> scripta).

50|$|Four {{species of}} lizard and {{two species of}} turtle {{comprise}} Bermuda's non-marine reptilian fauna. Of the lizards, the Bermuda rock skink (Plestiodon longirostris), is the only endemic species. Once very common, the Bermuda skink is critically endangered. The Jamaican anole (Anolis grahami) was deliberately introduced in 1905 from Jamaica and is now {{by far the most}} common lizard in Bermuda. The Leach's anole (Anolis leachii) was accidentally introduced from Barbados about 1940 and is now common. The Barbados anole (Anolis extremus) was accidentally introduced about 1940 and is rarely seen. The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) is native to Bermuda. The red-eared slider (<b>Trachemys</b> <b>scripta</b> <b>elegans)</b> was introduced as a pet, but has subsequently become invasive.|$|E
50|$|Northern {{map turtles}} inhabit an area from south Quebec and Ontario to {{northern}} Vermont where it {{lives in the}} St. Lawrence River drainage basin. Its range extends west through the Great Lakes and into southern Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota, west of the Appalachians, south to Kansas and northwestern Georgia. It also occurs in the Susquehanna River system in Pennsylvania and Maryland and the Delaware River. Also, a small European population occurs in the Czech Republic, which was formed from escaped or released turtles and their descendants. In the Czech Republic, this turtle is considered an alien species, but is threatened together with Czech native turtles, other reptiles and amphibians by a large population of another invasive turtle, <b>Trachemys</b> <b>scripta</b> <b>elegans.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the past, Tivoli Pond was {{a living}} place of {{numerous}} native fish, like the Danube roach (Rutilus pigus), the tench (Tinca tinca), the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), the zander (Sander lucioperca), the European perch (Perca fluviatilis), to the European crayfish (Astacus astacus), to amphibians such as the European tree frog (Hyla arborea), to birds such as the black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), the common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), and the little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus). The ecosystem was severely hurt by several renovations {{and the introduction of}} non-native fish species by fishing clubs as well as by individual visitors. In addition, the red-eared slider (<b>Trachemys</b> <b>scripta</b> <b>elegans)</b> and other pet turtles have been introduced, ousting the native European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis).|$|E
5000|$|Red-eared sliders {{get their}} {{name from the}} small red stripe around their ears.. The [...] "slider" [...] in their name comes from their ability to slide off rocks and logs and into the water quickly. This species was {{previously}} known as Troost's turtle in honor of an American herpetologist; <b>Trachemys</b> <b>scripta</b> troostii is now the scientific name for another subspecies, the Cumberland slider.|$|R
5000|$|Troost is {{credited}} with describing, as new species, two North American reptiles: the alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii [...] ) and the western cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma). He is honored by having a subspecies of turtle named after him, the Cumberland turtle (<b>Trachemys</b> <b>scripta</b> troostii [...] ). The reddish-colored crystals {{of a variety of}} willemite found in New Jersey are known as troostite.|$|R
40|$|The slider turtle (<b>Trachemys</b> <b>scripta)</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular pet reptiles. The high {{mortality}} of young turtles shortly after hatching is a main problem in captivity. This may be partly attributed to infections of the gastrointestinal tract. In many cases, turtles are asymptomatic carriers of many pathogenic bacterial strains including Salmonella sp. posing a threat to these animals and their keepers. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of selected probiotics on growth performance, body condition score and the gastrointestinal tract development in turtles. Forty young yellowbellied sliders (<b>Trachemys</b> <b>scripta</b> scripta) were divided into four groups: CON – control without probiotics, A – with and addition of Bacillus subtilis PB 6, B – with mix of probiotic strains, C – with Bacillus subtilis C- 3102. In the course of the performed experiment, growth performance parameters and morphology of gastrointestinal tract were measured using electronic caliper and laboratory weight. Tested probiotics did not significantly (P > 0. 05) affect the growth performance and body condition of turtles, as well as morphometric parameters of their gastrointestinal tract. It indicates that probiotics did not disturb their natural rate of development and may be used as safe feed additive for this group of animals...|$|R
