2500|$|Permanent implant {{brachytherapy}} is {{a popular}} treatment choice for patients with low to intermediate risk features, can be performed on an outpatient basis, and is associated with good 10-year outcomes with relatively low morbidity. [...] It involves the placement of about 100 small [...] "seeds" [...] containing radioactive material (such as iodine-125 or palladium-103) with a needle through {{the skin of the}} perineum directly into the tumor while under spinal or general anesthetic. These seeds emit lower-energy X-rays which are only able to travel a short distance. Although the seeds eventually become inert, they remain in the prostate permanently. The risk of exposure to others from men with implanted seeds is generally accepted to be insignificant. However, men are encouraged <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> doctors about any special temporary precautions around small children and pregnant women.|$|E
2500|$|In the Olympics {{or other}} highly {{competitive}} meets, many divers will have {{nearly the same}} list of dives as their competitors. [...] The importance for divers competing at this level {{is not so much}} the DD, but how they arrange their list. Once the more difficult rounds of dives begin it is important to lead off with a confident dive to build momentum. They also tend to put a very confident dive in front of a very difficult dive to ensure that they will have a good mentality for the difficult dive. Most divers have pre-dive and post-dive rituals that help them either maintain or regain focus. Coaches also play a role in this aspect of the sport. Many divers rely on their coaches to help keep their composure during the meet. In a large meet coaches are rarely allowed on the deck <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> athlete so it is common to see coaches using hand gestures or body movements to communicate.|$|E

2500|$|The U.S. {{embassy in}} Georgia {{organized}} an evacuation convoy {{to leave for}} Yerevan on August 10 and scheduled a second one for August 11 and invited American citizens {{in the region to}} join them, while it also issued a travel warning. With coordination from embassy employees in Yerevan and the United States Marine embassy guards, the convoy's progress was followed and documented along their travel route. Embassy personnel in Yerevan made lodging arrangements for the evacuated family members and United States citizens coming from Georgia. The United States Marine embassy guards who stayed in Tbilisi along with the embassy's essential staff were in constant communication with the Marines in Yerevan, and the two posts served as a communications hub for embassy personnel in Tbilisi <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> family members. The two embassy posts were able to maintain constant communication and relay up-to-date information regarding the safety and well-being of all embassy personnel that remained behind to secure the embassy and vital classified material.|$|E

[...] Nissenthall and his bodyguards failed to enter the radar station due to strong defences, but Nissenthall was able to crawl up {{to the rear of the}} station under enemy fire and cut all telephone wires leading to it. This forced the crew inside to resort to radio transmissions <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> commanders, transmissions which were intercepted by listening posts on the south coast of England. The Allies were able to learn a great deal about the location and density of German radar stations along the channel coast thanks to this one single act, which helped to convince Allied commanders of the importance of developing radar jamming technology. Of this small unit, only Nissenthall and one other returned safely to England. After the war Jack Nissenthall shortened his surname to Nissen.|$|E

40|$|Although phenomenological {{surveys have}} {{established}} the typical properties of auditory verbal hallucinations, {{little research has}} examined the key issues associated with hearing voices over time. To explore this, interviews with six young adults with psychosis who heard voices were conducted and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Six themes emerged, and an experiential journey through voices was discerned. Voices typically emerged after negative life events ("Negative Trigger"), and were at first rejected as {{being part of the}} self ("The Rejection Phase"). Crisis events ("Crisis-induced Change") could then lead to either positive changes (e. g., the voice-hearer opening up <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> friends and services about their voices) or negative ones (e. g., voices becoming more critical/abusive). Voice-hearers could enter a phase involving "Discovering, Adjusting and Trying to Cope" with the voices, based on three key resources: themselves, others, and services. Finally, a "New Understanding" phase could be reached where participants changed from simply rejecting <b>their</b> voices <b>to</b> different understandings, such as that their voices were a part of them, and were potentially there for the long-term. However, many struggled with these potential new understandings. Implications for clinical practice and the direction of future research are examined. 12 page(s...|$|R

60|$|The whole {{being at}} discretion, I beg leave just to suggest some matters for your consideration:--Whether the {{government}} in Church or State {{is likely to be}} more secure by continuing causes of grounded discontent to a very great number (say two millions) of the subjects? or whether the Constitution, combined and balanced as it is, will be rendered more solid by depriving so large a part of the people of all concern or interest or share in its representation, actual or virtual? I here mean to lay an emphasis on the word virtual. Virtual representation is that {{in which there is a}} communion of interests and a sympathy in feelings and desires between those who act in the name of any description of people and the people in whose name they act, though the trustees are not actually chosen by them. This is virtual representation. Such a representation I think to be in many cases even better than the actual. It possesses most of its advantages, and is free from many of its inconveniences; it corrects the irregularities in the literal representation, when the shifting current of human affairs or the acting of public interests in different ways carry it obliquely from its first line of direction. The people may err in their choice; but common interest and common sentiment are rarely mistaken. But this sort of virtual representation cannot have a long or sure existence, if it has not a substratum in the actual. The member must have some relation to the constituent. As things stand, the Catholic, as a Catholic, and belonging to a description, has no virtual relation to the representative,--but the contrary. There is a relation in mutual obligation. Gratitude may not always have a very lasting power; but the frequent recurrence of an application for favors will revive and refresh it, and will necessarily produce some degree of mutual attention. It will produce, at least, acquaintance. The several descriptions of people will not be kept so much apart as they now are, as if they were not only separate nations, but separate species. The stigma and reproach, the hideous mask will be taken off, and men will see each other as they are. Sure I am that there have been thousands in Ireland who have never conversed with a Roman Catholic in their whole lives, unless they happened <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> gardener's workmen, or to ask their way, when they had lost it in their sports,--or, at best, who had known them only as footmen, or other domestics, of the second and third order: and so averse were they, some time ago, to have them near their persons, that they would not employ even those who could never find their way beyond the stable. I well remember a great, and in many respects a good man, who advertised for a blacksmith, but at the same time added, he must be a Protestant. It is impossible that such a state of things, though natural goodness in many persons will undoubtedly make exceptions, must not produce alienation on the one side and pride and insolence on the other.|$|E
