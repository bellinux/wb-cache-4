40|$|A {{synergistic}} {{process was}} developed to study the vertical distributions of aerosol optical properties and their effects on solar heating using data retrieved from ground-based radiation measurements and radiative transfer simulations. Continuous MPLNET and AERONET observations were made at a rural site in northern Taiwan from 2005 to 2007. The aerosol vertical extinction profiles retrieved from ground-based lidar measurements were categorized into near-surface, mixed, and two-layer <b>transport</b> <b>types,</b> representing 76 % of all cases. Fine-mode (Angstrom exponent, alpha, approx. 1. 4) and moderate-absorbing aerosols (columnar single-scattering albedo approx. 0. 93, asymmetry factor approx. 0. 73 at 440 nm wavelength) dominated in this region. The column-integrated aerosol optical thickness at 500 nm (tau(sub 500 nm)) ranges from 0. 1 to 0. 6 for the near-surface <b>transport</b> <b>type,</b> but can be doubled {{in the presence of}} upper-layer aerosol transport. We utilize aerosol radiative efficiency (ARE; the impact on solar radiation per unit change of tau(sub 500 nm)) to quantify the radiative effects due to different vertical distributions of aerosols. Our results show that the ARE at the top-of-atmosphere (- 23 W/ sq m) is weakly sensitive to aerosol vertical distributions confined in the lower troposphere. On the other hand, values of the ARE at the surface are - 44. 3, - 40. 6 and - 39. 7 W/sq m 38 for near-surface, mixed, and two-layer <b>transport</b> <b>types,</b> respectively. Further analyses show that the impact of aerosols on the vertical profile of solar heating is larger for the near-surface <b>transport</b> <b>type</b> than that of two-layer <b>transport</b> <b>type.</b> The impacts of aerosol on the surface radiation and the solar heating profiles have implications for the stability and convection in the lower troposphere...|$|R

40|$|Is high peritoneal {{transport}} rate an independent {{risk factor for}} CAPD mortality?BackgroundPatients with high peritoneal transport display the lowest serum albumin (SAlb) and the highest peritoneal protein loss. An association between high peritoneal membrane permeability and diabetes mellitus (DM) has been suggested. As malnutrition, hypoalbuminemia, and DM cause high mortality, {{it is probable that}} a high peritoneal {{transport rate}} is associated with high mortality on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The aim {{of the study was to}} identify whether a high peritoneal transport rate is an independent risk factor for mortality on CAPD. MethodsWe included 167 patients with a peritoneal equilibration test that was performed between January 1994 and July 1997. The endpoint was the patient's status (alive, dead, or lost) in December 1997. Survival analysis was done by the Kaplan–Meier method and multivariate Cox proportional-hazard model. ResultsDM was significantly more frequent in the high (H) peritoneal <b>transport</b> <b>type</b> (20 out of 33) and was less frequent in the low (L) transport group (3 out of 18). SAlb (g/dL) was significantly lower as the peritoneal <b>transport</b> <b>type</b> was higher [H 2. 7 ± 0. 5, high average (HA) 2. 9 ± 0. 7, low average (LA) 3. 2 ± 0. 6, and L 3. 6 ± 0. 5]. Serum creatinine (SCr) was significantly higher in the L <b>transport</b> <b>type</b> (12. 0 ± 4. 3 mg/dL) than in the other transport groups (H 8. 7 ± 3. 1, HA 8. 6 ± 3. 7, and LA 9. 6 ± 4. 5). No other differences were found between peritoneal <b>transport</b> <b>types.</b> In the univariate analysis, high peritoneal transport rate, DM, low SCr, low SAlb, and older age significantly predicted mortality. However, in the multivariate analysis (k; 2 = 40. 55, P < 0. 0001), only DM (b = 1. 34, P = 0. 0001), low SCr (b = - 0. 11, P = 0. 02), and high peritoneal transport rate (b = 2. 6, P = 0. 06) were shown as mortality risk factors. ConclusionsDM was the most important risk factor for mortality on CAPD. A high peritoneal transport rate also predicted mortality, yet its role seems to be related to the presence of DM. The role of higher SCr predicting a better survival might have been associated with a better nutritional status. Hypoalbuminemia, previously shown as risk factor for mortality, did not play an important role in this study, probably because of its collinearity with DM...|$|R
