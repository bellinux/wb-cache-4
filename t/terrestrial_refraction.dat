50|$|<b>Terrestrial</b> <b>refraction,</b> {{sometimes}} called geodetic refraction, {{deals with the}} apparent angular position and measured distance of terrestrial bodies. It is of special concern {{for the production of}} precise maps and surveys. Since the line of sight in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>refraction</b> passes near the earth's surface, the magnitude of refraction depends chiefly on the temperature gradient near the ground, which varies widely at different times of day, seasons of the year, the nature of the terrain, the state of the weather, and other factors.|$|E

This corrects for both apparent dip and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>refraction.</b> For example, for an observer at 10,000 feet, add (-115°/60°) or about -1.92° to -0.83°.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} both author’s {{independent research}} and joint, with other scientists, studies of atmospheric {{influences on the}} results of angular and electronic distance measurements in polar regions and, in particular, in Antarctica. A short description of structure peculiarities of atmospheric boundary layer is given. A special attention was given to thermal stratification and caused by it influences {{on the results of}} astrogeodetic measurements. Investigation of astronomic refraction was conducted on the basis of aerological data. An integral of refraction was computed at different zenith angles for several Antarctic and Arctic stations. Refractive anomalies were calculated by means of refraction tables. The results of the theoretical and experimental investigations of the <b>terrestrial</b> vertical <b>refraction</b> in polar regions are given. Analysis of atmospheric influences on the electronic distance measurements were carried out by means of the refraction index calculation for light-and radio waves. The data of aerological soundings and meteorological gradients in the lowest atmospheric layers were used as initial materials. It should be noted that microwave distance measurements in Central Antarctica ensure a reliable accuracy in consequence of the very small air humidity. As regards the electronic distance measurements to satellites the existent models do not quite ensure the reliable results for laser- and microwave distance measurements in consequence of peculiarities of the meteorological parameter distributions in atmospheric lower layers in polar regions and in Central Antarctica, in particular. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} early {{geological}} {{history of the}} southern Kerguelen Plateau (Indian Ocean) using ocean bottom seismometer ((ORS), multichannel seismic (MCS), and Ocean Drilling Program data. Velocity-depth models in the sedimentary Raggatt Basin are constrained by near-range OBS data (refractions and reflections, including multiples and converted shear waves) and migrated MCS data. The models elucidate the significance of Lower Cretaceous lava flows, Albian to Coniacian/Santonian terrestrial and terrigenous sediment, and Maastrichtian and Paleocene seismic sequences. The Albian/Aptian basaltic basement complex consists of an upper and a lower series. The upper series {{is characterized by a}}verage Vps of 4. 6 - 4. 7 km/s, an upward increase of intercalated terrestrial sediment and altered flowtops, and a concomitant decrease in flow thickness; the lower series is marked by average Vps of 5. 3 - 5. 5 km/s, and contains thicker flows and less sediment. A volcanic center in the Raggatt Basin shows relatively low Vps (3. 7 - 3. 9 km/s for the upper series, 4. 7 - 4. 9 km/s for the lower series), and dipping reflections on the Raggatt Basin's flanks are also recorded as <b>refractions.</b> <b>Terrestrial</b> and terrigenous sediment of the Raggatt Basin, immediately overlying basement, is characterized by a seismic low-velocity layer with Vps ranging from 2. 2 - 2. 9 km/s and a thickness of greater than 1100 m in the central basin. Nearby source regions (e. g. Banzare Bank and other elevated areas south of the basin) account for a terrestrial and terrigenous sediment volume of approximately 12, 500 km 3, deposited over approximately 20 m. y. The depocenter of the Raggatt Basin began shifting in Santonian to early Maastrichtian time, and concluded by early late Paleocene time. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
50|$|As {{a common}} approximation, <b>terrestrial</b> <b>refraction</b> is {{considered}} as a constant bending of the ray of light or line of sight, in which the ray {{can be considered as}} describing a circular path. A common measure of refraction is the coefficient of refraction. Unfortunately there are two different definitions of this coefficient. One is the ratio of the radius of the Earth to the radius of the line of sight, the other is the ratio of the angle that the line of sight subtends {{at the center of the}} Earth to the angle of refraction measured at the observer. Since the latter definition only measures the bending of the ray at one end of the line of sight, it is one half the value of the former definition.|$|E

40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{empirical}} studies have investigated the characteristics of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>refraction.</b> However, only few of these are concerned with short-term fluctuations of refraction influences. The aim of the present work is to analyze the short-term characteristics (amplitudes and variations at scales of minutes to hours) of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>refraction</b> in the lower atmosphere around 1. 8 m above the grass surface. We apply the known method of simultaneous reciprocal vertical angle measurements to derive time series of the refraction coefficient k as a measure for refraction. Our study uses a new setup of two pairs of total stations for parallel observations of the refraction coefficient along adjacent lines of sight. Such a controlled experiment not only allows us to determine refraction coefficients independently but also to assess measurement errors from the residuals between refraction coefficient pairs. Over five observation days {{in the summer of}} 2008, a total of 33 h of parallel observation data of the refraction coefficient were collected at sampling frequencies of 1 min. On one observation day, unique parallel observations of the refraction coefficient along three lines of sight with a total of six total stations were possible. For mostly sunny days, we found wave-like and sawtooth-like fluctuations of the refraction coefficient with amplitudes of 1 – 1. 5 at time scales of 10 – 30 min. On cloudy days, the amplitudes of fluctuations were on the order of 0. 5. Our refraction experiments show a variation range of k between − 4 and + 16 near the ground on sunny summer days. This equates to vertical temperature gradients between − 0. 5 and − 0. 1 K/m during the day and 1 – 2 K/m shortly after sunset. Cloud cover reduces the variability of k to a range of − 2 to + 5. Our results show that the frequently used Gaussian refraction coefficient of + 0. 13 is not suited for describing refraction effects in the lower atmosphere. As a conclusion, our results may be helpful to better assess the role of refraction in near-ground precision surveys, such as geometric levelling or trigonometric heighting...|$|E
