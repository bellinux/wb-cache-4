40|$|Equivalent single- and multi-degree-of-freedom {{models have}} been {{developed}} for a flexible cam-follower mechanism. Both transverse and axial flexibility of the follower and return spring, as well as transverse and torsional flexibility of the camshaft have been included. In the multi-degree-of-freedom model, the camshaft is assigned two rotational degrees of freedom, one at the cam and the other at the flywheel. The follower mass has a degree of freedom in the axial as well as the transverse direction of the follower rod. The analytical models take into account the fluctuating camshaft angular speed as the input excitation. The governing equations of motion, with time-periodic coefficients, have been systematically developed. The return spring was believed to influence the follower response in ways previously not understood, necessitating a closer examination of its kinematics of deformation. An analytic expression for the transverse stiffness of a closed-coiled helical spring with an axial, transverse and end moment, has been derived. A closed-form expression is obtained when the ends are constrained to remain parallel. Such constraints, and the varying transverse flexibility of the return spring with axial deflection led to a newly described phenomenon of moment stiffening. A sideways <b>tracking</b> of the <b>follower</b> roller on the cam surface is observed, in an experimental cam-follower mechanism, for both the rise and return motions of the follower. It results from the camshaft deflection, causing the cam to exert a thrust load on the <b>follower</b> roller. The <b>tracking</b> gives rise to erroneous experimental cam rise and return profiles.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the study of decentralized coordination algorithms of multiple autonomous vehicles. Here, the term decentralized coordination is used to refer to the behavior that a group of vehicles reaches the desired group behavior via local interaction. Research is conducted towards designing and analyzing distributed coordination algorithms to achieve desired group behavior in the presence of none, one, and multiple group reference states. Decentralized coordination {{in the absence of any}} group reference state is a very active research topic in the systems and controls society. We first focus on studying decentralized coordination problems for both single-integrator kinematics and double-integrator dynamics in a sampled-data setting because real systems are more appropriate to be modeled in a sampled-data setting rather than a continuous setting. Two sampled-data consensus algorithms are proposed and the conditions to guarantee consensus are presented for both fixed and switching network topologies. Because a number of coordination algorithms can be employed to guarantee coordination, it is important to study the optimal coordination problems. We further study the optimal consensus problems in both continuous-time and discrete-time settings via an linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) -based approach. Noting that fractional-order dynamics can better represent the dynamics of certain systems, especially when the systems evolve under complicated environment, the existing integer-order coordination algorithms are extended to the fractional-order case. Decentralized coordination in the presence of one group reference state is also called coordinated tracking, including both consensus tracking and swarm tracking. Consensus tracking refers to the behavior that the <b>followers</b> <b>track</b> the group reference state. Swarm tracking refers to the behavior that the followers move cohesively with the external leader while avoiding inter-vehicle collisions. In this part, consensus tracking is studied in both discrete-time setting and continuous-time settings while swarm tracking is studied in a continuous-time setting. Decentralized coordination in the presence of multiple group reference states is also called containment control, where the followers will converge to the convex hull, i. e., the minimal geometric space, formed by the group references states via local interaction. In this part, the containment control problem is studied for both single-integrator kinematics and double-integrator dynamics. In addition, experimental results are provided to validate some theoretical results...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is to control and {{synchronize}} sphere-shaped spacecrafts in a leader-follower synchronization scheme. In order to achieve this objective, a nonlinear mathematical model of the vehicles has been developed. The design is based on rigid body dynamics where the vessel is actuated by means of three orthogonally mounted reaction wheels. The attitude dynamics is derived using Euler parameters. In the pursuit of reaching the main goal of controlling and synchronizing the satellites, it is natural to rst develop control algorithms for single vehicle control. A sliding mode controller and a backstepping controller have been derived for this matter, and are compared for optimality. Both controllers are based on nonlinear control theory and are designed to control the angular velocity of the satellite. The system in combination with both the controllers is proven to be asymptotically stable. Due to cases where the spacecraft does not have angular velocity measurements, an estimator for the angular velocity is derived. Using LaSalle's theorem, asymptotic stability is proven for the observer in the time-invariant case, while Matrosov's theorem is utilized for system explicitly dependent on time. For operational assignments where it is not sufficient with only one satellite, a synchronizing scheme for several satellites has been proposed. The scheme is based on a leader-follower synchronization design, and is derived assuming that none of the satellites are equipped with angular velocity measurements. It is therefore possible to implement and utilize the nonlinear observer for angular velocity estimation in each vehicle. The controllers are designed in a similar manner for both the leader and the follower using backstepping control. The leader is set to follow an arbitrarily smooth trajectory, while the follower's objective is to track the leader's attitude, given by measurements and estimations. The various systems are tested in a lab setup with the AUVSAT. The AUVSAT is a sphere shaped, autonomous underwater satellite actuated by means of three orthogonally reaction wheels. The experiments are performed when the AUVSAT is submerged in a water tank, making it possible to emulate a gravity free environment equal to what a satellite traveling in space is experiencing. The AUVSAT build up is presented where hardware and software components are chosen with respect to simplicity, cost and space restrictions. Several experiments are carried out using the AUVSAT to evaluate the performance of the controllers, observer and the synchronization scheme. For all cases, the system tracks a time-varying sinusoidal reference signal in addition to a squareshaped sequence. In this way, one can truly validate transient responses, steady-state and tracking maneuvers to determine the performance of the various systems. The experiments show that the sliding mode controller and backstepping controller works quite similar and with a satisfactorily behavior throughout the experiments. However, there are some lack of performance of the combined observer and controller system when tracking the sinusoidal time-varying reference. In the synchronization scheme, the leader follows the desired trajectory and the <b>follower</b> <b>tracks</b> the leader's attitude to some extent.
