5|$|The {{first use}} of CS gas on the UK {{mainland}} that {{was not part of}} military training was carried out in 1944 during a hostage siege at a north London address. Soldiers were asked to throw CS grenades through <b>the</b> <b>skylight</b> in hope of bringing the incident to a speedy conclusion, but the hostage-taker had brought his civilian-issue gas mask with him, negating the effect.|$|E
5|$|The two SAS teams on-scene, Red Team and Blue Team, {{were ordered}} to begin their {{simultaneous}} assaults, under the codename Operation Nimrod, at 19:23. One group of four men from Red Team abseiled from the roof down {{the rear of the}} building, while another four-man team lowered a stun grenade through <b>the</b> <b>skylight.</b> The detonation of the stun grenade was supposed to coincide with the abseiling teams detonating explosives to gain entry to the building through the second-floor windows. Their descent had not gone according to plan and the staff sergeant leading the abseilers became entangled in his rope. While trying to assist him, one of the other soldiers had accidentally smashed a window with his foot. The noise of the breaking window alerted Oan, who was on the first floor communicating with the police negotiators, and he went to investigate. The soldiers were unable to use explosives for fear of injuring their stranded staff sergeant, but managed to smash their way into the embassy.|$|E

The lighting from <b>the</b> <b>skylights</b> was considered perfect, with an even distribution of natural light on the walls. This {{was made possible by}} a translucent ceiling of white muslin lay-lights below <b>the</b> <b>skylights.</b> Inside <b>the</b> gallery, four large pillars stand, which can be removed to create one hall.|$|R

60|$|The battery or {{fortress}} is in {{the centre}} of the ship, and fills up about one-third of her length and three-fourths of her breadth. The surrounding deck is flush, its surface being broken only by <b>the</b> <b>skylights,</b> which are three in number. <b>The</b> <b>skylights</b> allow but a scant and dim light to penetrate to the officers' and seamen's quarters below; but even this is wanting in time of action, when a shot-proof shield takes the place of the glass windows.|$|R
25|$|These {{suggestions}} {{were followed}} in 1946–47, by similar calls by the Brotherhood, {{referring to the}} deterioration of the main portal and sacristy. In addition, there were references to deteriorating windows, falling stucco from the vaulted-ceiling and degradation of <b>the</b> <b>skylight</b> in the choir. But, even as the DGEMN interevened in 1947, the church's condition worsened the following year, with rainfall that invaded the church, and a broken pipe in the sacristy, that resulted in the rotting of the wood floors that had to be replaced.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} {{feature of the}} facade is the light well along the front facade; unlike Burhham's nearby Ford Buildings where the well is {{invisible}} from the front, the light well of the Dime Building faces Griswold. The lower two floors of the building are clad in brown granite that was applied during a 1950s renovation; the upper floors are clad in the original terra cotta. The upper three stories are differeintialed from {{the main body of}} the building by a different window treatment. The building that has become Chrysler House was fully renovated in 2002, including an impressive treatment of <b>the</b> <b>skylight</b> opening up to the light well.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, <b>the</b> <b>skylight</b> was repaired; {{improvements}} made to {{the electrical}} system were made in order to install a projector; reconstruction of the wood structures and stuccoing of the ceilings; construction of hydraulic rigging and screed in the pavement; painting of the walls with water-based paints. There was a proposal by the LNEC and IJF to study the area in order to treat the deteriorating stoneworks {{at the end of}} the 1970s. But, in 1978, the facade panel was partially destroyed through the restoration attempts of the IJF. By the end of 1979, there was a further reassessment of the roofing in the registry, altar and lateral chapels for repairs; demolition and reconstruction of the framework and pavement of the lateral chapels; substitution and assessment of the zinc eavestroughs and flaps; and repair and cleaning of the roof.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of opening in 1910, the {{addition}} was of French Renaissance design, carried out {{in a general way}} in the interior though there was a slight leaning toward the Spanish in the exterior details. The addition and the older structure were connected with a large courtyard between the two buildings, forming an angle at this point. The ground floor contained a large lobby. To its right was the main dining room and to the left, the Broadway Cafe. Just underneath the Broadway Cafe, down a flight of marble stairs, was the Grill. The Broadway Cafe contained walls of light, artificial stone and its ceiling was treated in the Italian Renaissance style, ornamented in low relief. The corridor walls were of Greek Skyros marble in gray and yellow with a slight veining of purple. The coffered ceiling carried out this color scheme. The large dining room was modelled after the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre. The first floor contained a foyer in Louis XIV style, with carved, dark oak woodwork and walls completely covered in tapestries of the period. From this foyer opened out the Tea Room whose walls of artificial stone were covered with wooden grillage, painted green while <b>the</b> <b>skylight</b> over the entire room was concealed by rafters and grillage with entwined vines. Adjoining this was a Flemish-style Banquet Room in dark oak. Carved wooden doors were set with panelled mirrors in the foyer hall. Elevator doors were of bronze.|$|E
25|$|Duncan MacLeod and Tessa Noel {{have been}} living in a city in the Pacific North West for several years, where they run an {{antiques}} store. One night, a young street punk called Richie Ryan breaks into the shop whilst they are celebrating Tessa's birthday but is caught by MacLeod, who threatens to cut off his head with a sword. Stunned by MacLeod's seeming over-reaction, Richie watches as another man jumps in through <b>the</b> <b>skylight</b> and challenges the antiques dealer, only to be disconcerted by the appearance of a third man with a Japanese sword, who is in turn hunting him. The intruder is Slan Quince, who is hunting Duncan, unaware that he is himself the target of Duncan's kinsman, Connor MacLeod. Intrigued, the kid follows the MacLeods, only to see first Connor, then Duncan, fight Slan. He sees Connor defeated but escape, leaving Duncan to behead Quince. Amazed, he watches Duncan caught at the centre of lightning and explosions as he witnesses, for the first time, a Quickening. Before he leaves, Connor tells Duncan that he must watch Richie, which Duncan does by taking in the boy, who has no family, and employing him in the antiques store. MacLeod also tells Richie the truth about himself and the others - that he is 400 years old and he, like them, is Immortal. As the series progressed, MacLeod encountered Immortals like Howard Crowley whom he killed in revenge for killing an Immortal friend of his and framing an innocent man for it, Kiem Sun and taking in an Immortal student Felice Martens. He even saves Tessa from Immortals like survivalist Caleb Cole (for the only time in the series, Tessa sees Duncan caught in the power of a Quickening) and Andrew Ballin, who wanted to kill her after she witnessed him killing his former lover. Alexei Voshin, with whom he has an old score to settle, and Walter Reinhardt, another immortal he had crossed paths with before.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, {{the entrances}} were renovated {{to include a}} more modern appearance, {{a fresh coat of}} paint was added {{throughout}} the mall, and additional accent lighting near <b>the</b> <b>skylights</b> was installed. <b>The</b> basic architecture remains the same with <b>the</b> same <b>skylights</b> and overall ceiling design original to the 1977 structure. Again that year, the mall added a TV area during the opening of Nordstrom.|$|R

500|$|In October 1987, Simon {{announced}} a $15 million expansion and {{renovation of the}} University Mall structure. The renovation was handled by the Vratsinas Construction Co. of Tulsa and started in 1988, ending about a year later. The expansion would add [...] to existing [...] in the mall. Several existing tenants also said they would spend another $3 million on remodeling and expansion. MM Cohn updated their store and added a mall entrance on their second floor. The J.C. Penney store was enlarged. This expansion gave the mall its most distinctive feature, the unusual Teflon-coated tent-like structure over {{part of the new}} concourse. It was referred to as <b>the</b> <b>skylight</b> because it let so much light in. <b>The</b> <b>skylight</b> reached nine stories high and a height variance had to be sought for its construction. The concourse was expanded to two levels connected by escalators and an elevator. The new upper level had a cantilevered walkway overlooking the bottom level and a [...] food court. A multi-level parking garage was also built {{on the north side of}} the mall.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game’s events, Sanctus is giving a sermon to the packed Opera House during the Festival of the Sword celebration, when suddenly, Dante himself crashes through <b>the</b> <b>skylight</b> above, and murders Sanctus {{in full view of the}} congregation, plunging the Opera House into chaos. As Nero fights Dante, Credo leads Kyrie and the others to safety, whereupon Nero is shocked to discover a latent demonic power in himself, which transforms his entire arm. From there on, Dante recognizes that Nero is [...] "different from the others," [...] and begins to influence Nero’s journey.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, this {{concourse}} was renovated by Lucien Lagrange Associates. [...] Included was a {{renovation of}} the Great Hall, and the restoration of <b>the</b> <b>skylight,</b> which had been blacked-out {{during the war and}} not restored. [...] Restoration of Union Station continues. Numerous spaces within the station have yet to be renovated, and many sit unused, especially within the headhouse.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding Callas's soft singing, Celletti says, [...] "In these soft passages, Callas {{seemed to}} use another voice altogether, because it {{acquired}} a great sweetness.

[...] Professional baseball players have looked at the distance and disputed it, but the tradition stands, nonetheless." ...|$|E
60|$|Jimmy felt Miss Merril's gaze upon him, and, as had {{happened}} before, his ingenuity failed him. Her smile vaguely suggested comprehension, and, for no ostensible reason, that disturbed him. He also saw Louis grinning {{down at him}} through <b>the</b> <b>skylights.</b>|$|R
