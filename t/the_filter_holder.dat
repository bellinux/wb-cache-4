40|$|Using Bloom filters {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{efficient}} lookup methods in P 2 P networks. A Bloom filter is a representation of data item indices, which achieves small memory requirement by allowing one-sided errors (false positive). In the lookup scheme besed on the Bloom filter, each peer disseminates a Bloom filter representing indices of the data items it owns in advance. Using the information of disseminated Bloom filters as a clue, each query can find a short path to its destination. In this paper, we propose an efficient extension of the Bloom filter, called a Deterministic Decay Bloom Filter (DDBF) and an index dissemination method based on it. While the index dissemination based on a standard Bloom filter suffers performance degradation by containing information of too many data items when its dissemination radius is large, the DDBF can circumvent such degradation by limiting information according to the distance between <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> and the items holders, i. e., a DDBF contains less information for faraway items and more information for nearby items. Interestingly, the construction of DDBFs requires no extra cost above that of standard filters.

40|$|International audienceTransmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) offers a very comprehensive tool for individual particle analysis allowing {{the determination of}} size, morphology, specific surface, and elemental composition. This information is needed in aerosol studies, especially {{in the field of}} nanomaterials. However, observations with TEM require a controlled sampling on an adapted analysis support, namely TEM grid. Techniques allowing sampling on TEM grids are of great interest to aerosol analysis. Indeed, sample preparation is not required, thereby gaining time and avoiding a risk for the sample to be altered. The present study evaluates the efficiency of a new particle collection technique based on filtration through one class of TEM-dedicated supports, namely TEM porous grids. Two types of porous grids, considered as the best on the market for this application, have been put to the test: the 'Quantifoil' type porous grid, which has a regular structure, and the 'Holey' type (Agar Scientific, Stansted, Essex, England). A filter holder has been developed specifically for this application, the MPS (Mini-Particle Sampler, Ecomesure, Janvry, France). Experimental tests have been carried out with a flow rate of 0. 3 L min- 1. They show that the collection is operational in the 5 -nm to 150 -nm size range, with a minimum efficiency of 15 - 18 % around 30 nm.

40|$|The work {{conducted}} {{in this thesis}} had the following objectives: (1) to develop improved methods for a better discrimination between organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) using the thermal-optical transmission (TOT) technique; (2) to deploy improved collection procedures for carbonaceous aerosols, whereby the sampling artifacts are better controlled or can be corrected for; (3) to perform detailed carbonaceous aerosol characterisation studies in Belgium and at urban and forested sites throughout Europe and (4) in the Brazilian Amazon basin, the tropical Atlantic Ocean, and at Amsterdam Island in the Indian Ocean. With regard to objective (1), the OC/EC split in three different temperature programs was examined for samples from widely different origins. This study confirmed that the OC/EC split in TOT depends upon the temperature program used, particularly {{that in the first}} phase of the analysis (in pure He). As to objective (2), a denuded sampling setup (with upstream of <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> with two quartz fibre filters a denuder for volatile organic compounds and oxidising inorganic gases) and the tandem filter method (with two quartz fibre filters in series without denuder) were used in parallel for low-volume PM 2. 5 collections in several campaigns since 2002. It was found that subtracting the back filter OC from the front filter OC yields “artifact-free” particulate OC data. With regard to objective (3), the median PM 2. 5 EC concentrations at our various sites in Europe ranged from 0. 07 μg/m 3 in the 2007 campaign at Hyytiälä, Finland, to 3. 3 μg/m 3 during the 2002 campaign at a kerbside site in Budapest. There was a general increasing trend for EC levels from forested sites, to urban sites, and to kerbside sites, reflecting the increasing impact of local anthropogenic emissions, especially those from traffic. For OC, however, there was no clear spatial trend. As to objective (4), the OC and EC data from a 2006 oceanic cruise in the northern hemisphere contrasted substantially with those found for Amsterdam Island. At the latter site, EC was below the detection limit (of 10 ng/m 3) and total OC was around a factor of 4 lower than during the northern hemisphere cruise...|$|E
40|$|Reliable {{gravimetric}} analysis of particulate matter filters {{is of great}} importance in exposure and risk assessment in industrial hygiene and environmental health, especially for light weight fine particles like PM 2. 5. Weighing bias {{may be caused by}} a number of environmental and operating factors. Among them, the humidity effect is most often addressed. This study proposes a cost-effective weighing chamber with humidity control by using a saturated magnesium chloride solution to meet the USEPA requirements for filter weighing. To exclude the interference of electrostatic charges, filter samples are treated with a radioactive source, Am 241, on a microbalance pan before weighing. Long term monitoring shows that the relative humidity inside the weighing chamber is between 31 – 35 % when the temperature is between 18 – 21 °C. The air pressure inside the weighing chamber is kept slightly positive by adjusting the air supply of the humidity control unit at 15 L/min during filter conditioning and at 25 L/min during filter weighing to maintain a stable humidity condition and prevent aerosol contamination from outside.

Errors occur because of water losses during the opening of <b>the</b> Cambridge <b>filter</b> pad <b>holder</b> to remove <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> pad as well as during the manual handling of <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> pad, and because <b>the</b> commercially available <b>filter</b> pad <b>holder,</b> which is constructed out of plastic, may adsorb water.

A modified 44 mm Cambridge <b>filter</b> pad <b>holder</b> and extraction equipment which supports in situ extraction methodology has been developed and tested. The principle of the in situ extraction methodology is to avoid any of the above mentioned water losses by extracting <b>the</b> loaded <b>filter</b> pad while kept in <b>the</b> Cambridge <b>filter</b> pad <b>holder</b> which is hermetically sealed by two caps. This is achieved by flushing the extraction solvent numerous times through the hermetically sealed Cambridge <b>filter</b> pad <b>holder</b> by means of an in situ extractor.

The work presented in this publication demonstrates that the in situ extraction methodology applies to a wider range of smoking products and smoking regimens, whereas the standard ISO methodology only applies to a limited range of smoking products and smoking regimens, e. g., conventional cigarettes smoked under ISO smoking regimen. In cases where a comparison of yields between the PMI HTP and conventional cigarettes is required the in situ extraction methodology must be used for the aerosol of the PMI HTP to obtain accurate NFDPM/”tar” values.

In addition, two of <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> media were compared with 1, 900 liters of drinking water. <b>The</b> <b>filter</b> media evaluated were MF nitrocellulose membranes (293 mm), AA Cox M- 780 epoxy-fiberglass-asbestos disks (267 mm), K- 27 yarn-wound fiberglass cartridges + AA Cox M- 780 disks (127 mm), and Balston epoxy-fiberglass tubes (24. 5 by 63. 5 mm). <b>The</b> <b>filters</b> were used to concentrate seeded poliovirus from 380 liters of finished drinking water. Sodium thiosulfate {{was added to the}} drinking water to neutralize chlorine, and hydrochloric acid was added to adjust the pH to 3. 5. Virus was eluted from <b>the</b> <b>filters</b> with glycine-NaOH buffer at pH 11. 5. In terms of virus recovery efficiency, <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> media ranked Balston > Cox 267 -mm > MF 293 -mm ≃ K- 27 + Cox 127 -mm, but differences were slight. <b>The</b> Balston <b>filters</b> and <b>holders</b> were also superior to the other systems in terms of size, weight, cost, and handling factors. Experiments with 2 - and 8 -μm porosity Balston filters showed no statistically significant difference in virus recovery. Virus was readily detected by the Balston and the MF 293 -mm systems at input levels of 12 to 22 PFU/ 1, 900 liters.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{a study that}} was carried out at a North American nickel alloy production facility to compare the levels of personal exposures to inhalable and total nickel-containing aerosols. It {{is part of a}} large body of work aimed at assessing the impact of introducing new personal sampling instrumentation with performance consistent with the latest criteria proposed by the International Standards Organization (ISO), the Comite Europeen Normalisation (CEN) and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Side-by-side sampling using <b>the</b> 37 -mm <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> (for total aerosol) and the so-called IOM inhalable aerosol tampler was conducted for the personal exposures of workers in a range of workplaces throughout the facility. The results showed that inhalable aerosol expo»ure levels—for both overall aerosol and for total nickel—were consistently and significantly higher than the corresponding total aerosol levels. Weighted least-squares linear regression yielded factors ranging from about 1. 3 to 2. 4 for overall dust and from about 1. 5 to 3. 5 for nickel. Inspection of the statistical distribution of the exposures for the whole plant suggested that it was log-normal. Copyright © 1996 British Occupational Hygiene Society...|$|R

50|$|Wide angle L-lenses {{typically}} have a gelatin <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> on <b>the</b> mounting {{point of the}} lens, which allows the photographer to cut a small, square piece of gelatin out of a larger filter sheet {{and place it on}} the lens. On film cameras, these are typically used to correct the color temperature, but on digital cameras this is largely unnecessary, as the color temperature can be corrected in software. The mount is still commonly used for neutral density gelatin sheets though, especially on certain wide-angle lenses where the protruding front element precludes the use of any screw-in filters. Some telephoto L-lenses, such as the EF 70-200mm zoom lenses, or the EF 300mm f/4L IS USM do not have rear gelatin <b>filter</b> <b>holders.</b> Super-telephoto lenses such as the EF 500mm f/4L IS USM, or the EF 200mm f/2L IS USM do have a rear 52mm drop-in <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> which can be used to hold gelatin type filters.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of dust cartridge filters {{commonly used in}} dust masks and in room ventilation depends both on the collection efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> material and <b>the</b> pressure drop across <b>the</b> <b>filter.</b> Currently, <b>the</b> optimization of <b>filter</b> design is based only on minimizing the pressure drop at a set velocity chosen by the manufacturer. The collection efficiency, an equally important fac-tor, is rarely considered in the optimization process. In this work, a filter quality factor, which combines the collection efficiency and the pressure drop, is used as the optimization criterion for filter evaluation. Most respirator manufacturers pleat <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> to various extents to in-crease the filtration area in the limit space within the dust cartridge. Six sizes of <b>filter</b> <b>holders</b> were fabricated to hold just one pleat of filter, simulating six different pleat counts, ranging from 0. 5 to 3. 33 pleats cm 21. The possible electrostatic charges on <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> were removed by dipping in isopropyl alcohol, and the air velocity is fixed at 100 cm s 21. Liquid dicotylphtha-late particles generated by a constant output atomizer were used as challenge aerosols to min-imize particle loading effects.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the {{improvements to the}} image replicating imaging spectrometer (IRIS) {{and the development of}} novel applications in the field of oximetry. IRIS is a snapshot multispectral device with a high transmission output and no need of inversion for data recovering, hence, with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). IRIS shows great versatility due to the possibility of choosing multiple contiguous or non-contiguous wavelengths inside its free spectral range. IRIS uses a set of waveplates and Wollaston prisms to demultiplex the spectral information of an object and replicate the image of such object in different wavelengths. The birefringent nature of IRIS means that different wavelengths are separated by the Wollaston prisms with different angles, introducing multiple images of the same object. In addition, the spectral transmission function shows multiple spectral sidelobes that contaminate each IRIS band with light belonging to other wavelengths. These issues can lower the performance of IRIS as a multispectral imaging device. In this thesis, these problems were assessed with the introduction of a filter plate array placed in the image plane of the optical system. This filter array is a set of narrow-band filters (Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) = 10 ± 2 nm) that removes undesired wavelengths from each IRIS band. Since the spectral transmission of IRIS is replicated along the free spectral range, <b>the</b> <b>filters</b> can be designed to match any of the present spectral lobes in IRIS. The design and fabrication of a <b>filter</b> array enhance <b>the</b> performance of IRIS as a multispectral imaging device: it allows wavelength selection and improves spectral and spatial image quality. The design and manufacture of <b>the</b> corresponding <b>filter</b> <b>holder</b> and camera adapter were critical in terms of offering an easy filter-camera implementation. <b>The</b> <b>filter</b> plate allowed <b>the</b> removal of other dispersed wavelengths by the Wollaston prisms, improving image registration between the set of spectral images created by IRIS, and so, improving the quality of the registered spectral 3 -D cube. The implemented improvements on IRIS allow high quality, calibration-free oximetry using eight different wavelengths optimised for oximetry. Two main experiments were performed: 1) Using an inverted microscopy interfaced with IRIS and a linear spectral unmixing technique, we measured the deoxygenation of single horse red blood cells (RBC) in vitro in real time. The oximetry was performed with a subcellular spatial resolution of 0. 5 μ m, a temporal resolution of 30 Hz, and an accuracy (standard error of the mean) of ± 1. 1...|$|R
