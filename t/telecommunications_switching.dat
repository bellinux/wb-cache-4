50|$|The {{early history}} of the <b>telecommunications</b> <b>switching</b> network in France is, unusually for this country, one of {{decentralized}} development.

Currently, {{the most commonly}} used network security evaluation method is risk assessment method, as well as to test and evaluation system of safety degree by software vulnerability scanning tools and so on. However, network security is related to computer, communication, physics, mathematics, biology, management, social, and many other fields, which is complicated system engineering. As a result, poor operational safety exist in the existing method, thus in this paper, the research of computer complex network reliability evaluation method based on GABP algorithm is put forward.

40|$|Research on firm {{performance}} {{after the}} introduction of a radical technological change has primarily concerned itself with differences between incumbents and entrants. This paper explores other factors that may influence firm performance over the longer term after a radical change [...] specifically, those related to product line development strategy. Following a radical change, a period of incremental technological change typically creates the opportunity for rapid development of new products. In such settings, strategies to manage multiple products, including families of products that may be derived from a common platform, may be expected to impact competitive performance. The data for the study are from the <b>telecommunications</b> <b>switching</b> sector, specifically the private branch exchange (PBX) industry. 56 firms and over 240 new products were analyzed over 22 years. For the literature on competition after radical technological change, this study shows that incumbent-entrant based explanations of firm performance are incomplete.
