50|$|Glass {{selection}} is important when tasting whisky seriously. The least appropriate {{is the traditional}} tumbler due to its large mouth, allowing the dissipation of the fumes and the grip which encourages unwanted warming of the liquid. The generally accepted industry standard for whisky <b>tasting</b> <b>glasses</b> is tulip-shaped with a stem, such as a sherry glass or copita. Another popular glass is the Glencairn whisky glass.

The glass influence on the evolution of sensory perception of wine is not fully understood and rarely evaluated. The analysis is composed of: (i) an experimental activity to understand the evolution of sensory profiles of a well-structured red wine maintained in different types of glasses through expert testers, (ii) the selection of one of the most important function carried on by the product, and therefore the study of the related behaviours, (iii) the identification of the correlation between the behaviours and the design parameters of the glass.

40|$|Background We {{report on}} what {{may well be}} the world’s largest multisensory tasting experiment. Over a period of 4 days in May 2014, almost 3, 000 people sampled a glass of red wine in a room in which the colour of the {{lighting}} and/or the music was changed repeatedly. The participants rated the wine, presented in a black <b>tasting</b> <b>glass,</b> on taste, intensity and liking scales while standing in each of four different environments over a period of 7 to 8 minutes. During the first 2 days (Experiment 1), the participants rated the wine while exposed to white lighting, red lighting, green lighting with music designed to enhance sourness and finally under red lighting paired with music associated with sweetness. During the latter 2 days of the event (Experiment 2), the same wine was rated under white lighting, green lighting, red lighting with sweet music and finally green lighting with sour music. Results In Experiment 1, the wine was perceived as fresher and less intense under green lighting and sour music, as compared to any of the other three environments. On average, the participants liked the wine most under red lighting while listening to sweet music. A similar pattern of results was reported in Experiment 2. Conclusions These results demonstrate that the environment can exert a significant influence on the perception of wine (at least in a random sample of social drinkers). We outline a number of possible explanations for how the sensory properties of the environment might influence the perception of wine. Finally, we consider some of the implications of these results for the wine drinking experience...|$|E

Traditionally, making good mint tea in Morocco is {{considered}} an art form and the drinking of it {{with friends and family}} is often a daily tradition. The pouring technique is as crucial as the quality of the tea itself. Moroccan tea pots have long, curved pouring spouts and this allows the tea to be poured evenly into tiny glasses from a height. For the best <b>taste,</b> <b>glasses</b> are filled in two stages. The Moroccans traditionally like tea with bubbles, so while pouring they hold the teapot high above the glasses. Finally, the tea is accompanied with hard sugar cones or lumps. Morocco has an abundance of oranges and tangerines, so fresh orange juice is easily found freshly squeezed and is cheap.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize the sensory profile of tropical wine of guard produced in the São Francisco Valley, Northeast Brazil. Two commercial wines, a varietal wine Touriga Nacional and an assemblage wine composed by Cabernet Sauvignon (60 %), Syrah (30 %) and Alicante Bouschet (10 %) were kept for 12 months in oak barrel. Latter, the samples were coded with three-digit numbers and blind tested in standard crystal <b>tasting</b> <b>glasses,</b> model ISO, in aliquots of 40 mL at 18 °C by an expert panel of ten experts with over five years of experience in sensory wine analysis. Three evaluation sheets (descriptive, score and nonparametric) were used. The assemblage wine was characterized in flavor intensity and floral taste, vegetal and woody taste, and taste intensity. Touriga Nacional wine was more evident due to higher clarity, tone and visual intensity, olfactory persistence, fruity, toasty and woody aromas, bitter taste, fruity spice flavors, body, typicality and quality taste. 201...|$|R

40|$|White {{wines are}} liable to develop haze during storage and {{transport}} due to residual protein in the finished wine. Since haze in white wines is considered unacceptable, winemakers attempt to reduce the protein content prior to bottling {{through the use of}} fining agents such as bentonite. The use of bentonite is not without economic cost with the estimated annual impact to the New Zealand wine industry in the region of NZD 35 million. The optimum quantity of bentonite to be used is normally determined using a heat test in conjunction with empirical fining trials. During these tests the winemaker is required to conduct various haze comparisons. Since these assessments are difficult to perform visually, researchers recommend the use of suitable nephelometric instrumentation to ensure consistency and precision. Despite these recommendations, most winemakers have not purchased the necessary equipment; it is thought that cost is the primary deterrent. The overall goal of this project was to explore the relationships between nephelometry, digital imaging and human perception of haze in terms of thresholds and intensity. In addition, the feasibility of using digital imaging devices to make nephelometric measurements was to be investigated. A range of achromatic and yellow turbid suspensions were prepared by suspending synthetic polymer microspheres of diameter 0. 25 μm in aqueous solutions. Base wine stocks exhibiting high turbidity were prepared by heating commercial grade Chardonnay wine at 90 ˚ for two hours. A range of wine samples of varying turbidities were then prepared by dilution with untreated wine. Polymer microsphere suspensions and wine samples of varying visual haze were used in a series of sensory and instrumentation experiments. The sensory experiments examined haze detection thresholds and intensity scaling in human subjects. All evaluations took place in purpose designed sensory booths utilising overhead light emitting diode (LED) illumination. The booth backgrounds and sides were modified to present dark or light surrounds by hanging black or white linen on the walls. Samples were presented to human subjects in standard ISO <b>tasting</b> <b>glasses</b> and the subjects were permitted to manipulate the glass freely whilst they evaluated the samples. Turbidity measurements were made with a Hach 2100 P nephelometric device. Image data was captured using a modified Canon A 2300 digital still camera using 90 ˚ viewing geometries. Haze threshold determinations were made for achromatic and yellow microsphere suspensions using the Ascending Method of Limits (AML) and 3 -Alternate Forced Choice (3 AFC) methods. The lowest thresholds were found when achromatic suspensions were presented in a dark surround where individual thresholds ranged from 0. 21 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) to 1. 07 NTU. The highest thresholds were found when yellow suspensions were presented in a light surround where individual thresholds ranged from 1. 89 NTU to 25. 16 NTU. Heat treated Chardonnay wine samples were also evaluated in a dark surround where individual thresholds ranged from 0. 52 NTU to 1. 39 NTU. Visual haze intensities in achromatic and yellow microsphere suspensions were assessed by human subjects in dark and light surrounds using modulus Magnitude Estimation (ME). Sample luminance was determined by digitally photographing the samples under the same conditions employed for the ME evaluations. The perceived haze intensity with respect to luminance was found to follow generalised power or logarithmic functions similar to psycho-physical models commonly proposed for the response of the human visual system to brightness and lightness. The data exhibited a bi-segment nature indicative of surround and/or planar contrast induction. Similar responses were found for heat treated Chardonnay wine samples using turbidity as the independent variable. Turbidity values were measured for a range achromatic and yellow microsphere suspension samples. Luminance values were derived from digital images taken of ISO <b>tasting</b> <b>glasses</b> containing the same microsphere suspensions. The turbidity and luminance values were found to be linearly related below 50 NTU (dark surround, R 2 = 0. 9978; light surround, R 2 = 0. 9813). A subsequent experiment examined turbidity values and luminance data in achromatic and yellow microsphere suspension samples over a low range (< 6 NTU) by imaging the sample surface directly rather than through the glass receptacle. Turbidity vales and luminance data were again found to be linearly related (R 2 = 0. 9628). Measurements from the Hach 2100 P device and a luminance based measurement model were found to be mean and median equivalent for the low range experimental data...|$|R

The temperature of samples was kept at 50  ±  2  °C during sensory analysis. This assessment consisted of 8 aroma descriptors (toasted, muttony, medicinal, fatty, milky, earthy, sour and waxy). The intensity from each panelist was given a score of 0 – 9 where 0  = none or not perceptible intensity, and 9  = extremely high intensity. The intensity of samples was normalized to reduce the response differences among the panelists. Results were expressed as the median intensity of the sensory perceptions of the 12 panelists. All of the samples were evaluated in triplicate.|$|R

Imitating lead-crystal à la façon d’Angleterre presented technical difficulties, as the best results were obtained with covered pots in a coal-fired furnace, a particularly English process requiring specialised cone-furnaces. Towards {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, lead-crystal glass was being produced in France, Hungary, Germany, and Norway. By 1800, Irish lead crystal had overtaken lime-potash glasses on the Continent, and traditional glassmaking centres in Bohemia began to focus on colored glasses rather than compete directly against it.|$|R

An incredible amount of skill and time was required to precisely twist and shape a chandelier.This new type of chandelier was called [...] "ciocca" [...] literally bouquet of flowers, for the characteristic decorations of glazed polychrome flowers.The most sumptuous of them consisted of a metal frame covered with small elements in blown glass, transparent or colored, with decorations of flowers, fruits and leaves, while simpler model had arms made with a unique piece of glass.Their shape was inspired by an original architectural concept: the space on the inside is left almost empty since decorations are spread all around the central support, distanced from it by the length of the arms.One of the common use of the huge Murano Chandeliers was the interior lighting of theatres and rooms in important palaces.|$|R
