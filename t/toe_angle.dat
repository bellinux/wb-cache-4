40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the effects of controllable articulating winglets on glide performance and yawing moments of high performance sailplanes. Testing was conducted in the Texas A&M University 7 x 10 foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel using a full-scale model of the outboard 5. 6 feet of a 15 meter class high performance sailplane wing. Different wing tip configurations could be easily mounted to the wing model. A winglet was designed in which the cant and <b>toe</b> <b>angles</b> as well as a rudder on the winglet could be adjusted to a range of positions. Cant angles used in the investigation consisted of 5, 25, and 40 degrees measured from the vertical axis. Toe-out angles ranged from 0 to 22. 5 degrees. A rudder on the winglet was used to study the effects of changing the camber of the winglet airfoil on wing performance and wing yawing moments. Rudder deflections consisted of- 10, 0, and 10 degrees. Test results for a fixed geometry winglet and a standard wing tip are presented to show the general behavior of winglets on sailplane wings, and the effects of boundary-layer turbulators on the winglets are also presented. By tripping the laminar boundary-layer to turbulent before laminar separation occurs, the wing performance was increased at low Reynolds numbers. The effects on the lift and drag, yawing moment, pitching moment, and wing root bending moment of the model are presented. Oil flows were used on the wing model with the fixed geometry winglet and the standard wing tip to visualize flow directions and areas of boundary layer transition. A cant angle of 25 degrees and a toe-out angle of 2. 5 degrees provided an optimal increase in wing performance for the cant and <b>toe</b> <b>angles</b> tested. Maximum performance was obtained when the winglet rudder remained in the neutral position of zero degrees. By varying the cant, <b>toe,</b> and rudder <b>angles</b> from their optimized positions, wing performance decreases. Although the winglet rudder proved to be more effective in increasing the yawing moment compared to varying the cant and <b>toe</b> <b>angles,</b> the amount of increased yawing moment was insignificant when compared to that produced by the vertical tail. A rudder on the winglet was determined to be ineffective for providing additional yaw control...|$|R

50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the radius arm forward attachments not being on the axis of the lower link arm inner pivots, it would appear at first glance that free movement of the suspension would be impossible without some components bending, or the trailing arm elastomeric bushes being compressed unduly. However, as described above, the crossbeam is rubber mounted to the body. The crossbeam and lower links maintain the correct <b>toe</b> <b>angle</b> of one wheel relative to the other, however due to the relative angles of the trailing radius arms, body roll results in the entire cross-beam and lower links pivoting slightly about the crossbeam's mounting points, thus inducing a small amount of passive rear wheel steering, which may result in significantly improved handling. When the Jaguar components are re-used in other vehicles, the differential is often rigidly mounted to the chassis, different radius arm configurations are used, and the passive rear wheel steering effect is lost.|$|E

40|$|Five {{measurements}} of claw conformation (<b>toe</b> <b>angle,</b> claw height, claw width, toe length and abaxial groove length) taken {{directly from the}} hoof were compared with the measurements taken from digital images of the same claws. Concordance correlation coefficients and limits-of-agreement analysis showed that, for {{four of the five}} measures (claw height, claw width, toe length and abaxial groove length), agreement was too poor for digital and manual measures to be used interchangeably. For all four of these measures, Liao’s modified concordance correlation coefficient (mCCC) was ≤ 0. 4, indicating poor concordance despite Pearson’s correlation being > 0. 6 in all cases. The worst concordance was seen for toe length (mCCC = 0. 13). Limits-of-agreement analysis showed that, for all four measures, there was a large variation in the difference between the manual and digital methods, even when the effect of mean on difference was accounted for, with the 95 % limits-of-agreement for the four measures being further away from the mean difference than 10 % of the mean in all four cases. The only one of the five measures with an acceptable concordance between digital and manual measurement was <b>toe</b> <b>angle</b> (mCCC = 0. 81). Nevertheless, the limits-of-agreement analysis showed that there was a systematic bias with, on average, the manual measure of <b>toe</b> <b>angle,</b> being 2. 1 ° smaller than the digital. The 95 % limits-of-agreement for <b>toe</b> <b>angle</b> were ± 3. 4 °, probably at the upper limit of what is acceptable. However, the lack of data on the variability of individual {{measurements of}} claw conformation means that it is unclear how this variability compares to measurement of <b>toe</b> <b>angle</b> in the same animal using the same or a different manual technique...|$|E

In this paper, the effects of weld <b>toe</b> inclination <b>angle</b> θ and weld edge transition arc radius r on the stress concentration coefficient of welded butt joints of magnesium alloy were analyzed by using ABAQUS finite element program, and the change rule of stress concentration coefficient with the variation of the two parameters was also researched.

50|$|Cars with rear live axles, {{also known}} as solid axles, tend to not have true bump steer. Since both wheels are {{connected}} to a single, rigid member they are incapable of having any <b>toe</b> <b>angles</b> under normal conditions. Rear live axle suspensions are therefore designed to exhibit roll understeer. During a curve, the entire axle will turn slightly to face {{the inside of the}} curve so that the car does not turn more sharply than anticipated by the driver, roll understeer. It is possible to design a rear live axle suspension that exhibits roll oversteer but it is highly undesirable for on road use. Roll oversteer is sometimes incorporated on extreme off-road vehicles because it can allow the rear wheels to help turn the vehicle extremely sharply in tight trail conditions.|$|R

Thirty young subjects (12 males, 18 females) aged between 22 and 40 years (mean 28. 5, S. D. 4. 8) and 31 older subjects (13 males, 18 females) aged between 76 and 87 years (mean 80. 8, S. D. 3. 1) walked at a self-selected comfortable walking speed across the pressure-sensor mat three times and repeated the process approximately 2 weeks later. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), coefficients of variation (CV) and 95 % limits of agreement were then determined. For both groups of subjects, the reliability of walking speed, cadence and step length was excellent (ICCs between 0. 82 and 0. 92 and CVs between 1. 4 and 3. 5 %). Base of support and <b>toe</b> in/out <b>angles,</b> although exhibiting high ICCs, were associated with higher CVs (8. 3 - 17. 7 % in young subjects and 14. 3 - 33. 0 % in older subjects).
