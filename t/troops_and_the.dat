5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Gielgud volunteered for active service, but was told that men of his age, thirty-five, would not be wanted for at least six months. The {{government}} quickly came to the view that most actors would do more good performing to entertain the <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> general public than serving, whether suitable or not, in the armed forces.|$|E

Almost 100,000 Chinese troops had surrounded 15,000 U.S. <b>troops,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pilots on Leyte were flying dozens of close air support missions every day to prevent the Chinese from overrunning the area.|$|E
5|$|Forster was {{not present}} in Mainz during the siege. As representatives of the Mainz National Convention, he and Adam Lux {{had been sent to}} Paris to apply for Mainz – which was unable to exist as an {{independent}} state – {{to become a part of}} the French Republic.

5|$|In general, Greece {{enjoyed a}} period of peace and {{prosperity}} during Alexander's campaign in Asia. Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire. However, Alexander's constant demands for <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's manpower, greatly weakening it {{in the years after}} Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC).|$|E
5|$|In {{reaching}} the upper Naktong valley {{at the end}} of July, the North Korean divisions engaged {{in this part of the}} drive southward had suffered heavy casualties. The NK 1st Division in battling across the Mun'gyong plateau against the ROK 6th Division not only suffered great losses in the ground battle but also took serious losses from UN aerial attack. Prisoners reported that by the time it reached Hamch'ang {{at the end of}} July it was down to 3,000 men from the 5,500 it had before the push. The NK 15th Division, according to prisoners, also lost heavily to artillery and mortar fire in its drive on Sangju against ROK <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> US 24th Infantry Regiment, and was down to about 5,000 men at the end of July, from 7,500 before the fight. In contrast, the NK 13th Division had bypassed Hamch'ang on the west and, save for minor skirmishes with ROK <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry, it had not been engaged and consequently had suffered relatively few casualties.|$|E
5|$|The {{diversion}} of {{three quarters of}} the Axis <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front prompted Britain to reconsider its grand strategy.

5|$|After {{his early}} {{release from prison}} for {{political}} crimes in 1924, over {{the second half of}} the 1920s, Gandhi continued to pursue swaraj. He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-co-operation with complete independence for the country as its goal. After his support for the World War I with Indian combat <b>troops,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> failure of Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh questioned his values and non-violent approach. While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, Gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two.|$|E
5|$|Allenby was {{replaced}} as Third Army commander by General Julian Byng, who began {{the war as}} commander of the 3rd Cavalry Division. After performing well during the First Battle of Ypres, he succeeded Allenby {{in command of the}} Cavalry Corps. He was sent to the Dardanelles in August 1915, to command the British IX Corps. He planned the highly successful evacuation of 105,000 Allied <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> majority of the equipment of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF). The withdrawal was successfully completed in January 1916, without the loss of a single man. Byng had already returned to the western front, where he was given command of the Canadian Corps. His most notable battle was the Battle of Vimy Ridge in April 1917, which was carried out by the Canadian Corps with British support.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the bicentennial}} celebration of the battle, in 2015 Belgium minted a 2 Euro coin {{depicting}} the Lion monument over {{a map of the}} field of battle. France officially protested this issue, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo. After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2½ Euros. Legally only valid within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 Euros. A 10 Euro coin, showing Wellington, Blücher, their <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 Euros.|$|E

5|$|Before {{and during}} the summit US {{president}} George W. Bush, British prime minister Tony Blair, Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper and Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende made a plea to European NATO members to make more troops available for deployment in Afghanistan, remove the national caveats (i.e. national restrictions on how, when and where forces can be used) and start sending its troops into the conflict-ridden south of the country. According to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) General James L. Jones {{it was not the}} lack of combat <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> caveats were the problem, but the lack of adequate helicopters and military intelligence to support airlift and on-the-ground operations.|$|E
5|$|Both Burgoyne and Arnold {{understood}} {{the importance of}} the American left, and the need to control the heights there. After the morning fog lifted around 10 am, Burgoyne ordered the army to advance in three columns. Baron Riedesel led the left column, consisting of the German <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 47th Foot, on the river road, bringing the main artillery and guarding supplies and the boats on the river. General James Inglis Hamilton commanded the center column, consisting of the 9th, 20th, 21st, and 62nd regiments, which would attack the heights, and General Simon Fraser led the right wing with the 24th Regiment and the light infantry and grenadier companies, to turn the American left flank by negotiating the heavily wooded high ground north and west of Bemis Heights.|$|E
5|$|Britain had {{recognised}} Zanzibar's {{sovereignty and}} its sultanate in 1886, {{after a long}} period of friendly interaction, and generally maintained good relations with the country and its sultans. However, Germany was also interested in East Africa, and the two powers vied for control of trade rights and territory in the area throughout the late 19th century. Sultan Khalifah had granted rights to the land of Kenya to Britain and that of Tanganyika to Germany, a process resulting in the prohibition of slavery in those lands. Many of the Arab ruling classes were upset by this interruption of a valuable trade, which resulted in some unrest. In addition, the German authorities in Tanganyika refused to fly the flag of the Zanzibar Sultanate, which led to armed clashes between German <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> local population. One such conflict in Tanga claimed the lives of 20 Arabs.|$|E

5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to be generous in spirit, though many were {{political}} in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city <b>troops</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were a thing of the past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile. He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E

However, instead of joining the ranks of the Palestinian fedayeen, Arafat fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood, although he did not join the organization. He took part in combat in the Gaza area (which was the main battleground of Egyptian forces during the conflict). In early 1949, the war was winding down in Israel's favor, and Arafat returned to Cairo from a lack of logistical support.|$|E
