5|$|Galeazzo Marescotti, {{a member}} of the zelanti, was the first serious {{candidate}} proposed two weeks in to the conclave. He was acceptable to the Spanish, but was opposed by the French because they wanted the new pope who was not strong. Bandino Panciatici was suggested by Pietro Ottoboni, but he was not supported by secular monarchs because he had supported giving benefices to nominees who were independent of <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> authorities. Giacomo Antonio Morigia was acceptable to <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> rulers, but was opposed by the zelanti for lacking governing experience in addition to not being firm or having the energy required. Following the proposal of these candidates, others came up as well, but were quickly rejected.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} this cantata for Whit Tuesday, {{the third}} day of Pentecost. It was likely based on an earlier secular cantata for New Year's Day composed in Köthen (BWV 184a).

5|$|Ecgbert's {{problems}} with the monasteries in his diocese came from <b>the</b> <b>secular</b> practice of families setting up monasteries that were totally under their control {{as a way of}} making the family lands book-land and free from secular service.
