5|$|Nepenthes rajah is {{most famous}} for the giant urn-shaped traps it produces, which can grow up to 41cm high and 20cm wide. These are capable of holding 3.5litres of water and in excess of 2.5 litres of {{digestive}} fluid, making them probably {{the largest in the}} genus by volume. Another morphological feature of N. rajah is the peltate leaf attachment of the lamina and <b>tendril,</b> which is present in only a few other species.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} N. rajah are very {{distinctive}} and reach a large size. They are leathery in texture with a wavy outer margin. The leaves are characteristically peltate, whereby the <b>tendril</b> joins the lamina on the underside, before the apex. This characteristic is {{more pronounced in}} N. rajah {{than in any other}} Nepenthes species, with the exception of N. clipeata. However, it is not unique to these two taxa, as mature plants of many Nepenthes species display slightly peltate leaves. The tendrils are inserted ≤5cm below the leaf apex and reach a length of approximately 50cm. Three to five longitudinal veins run along each side of the lamina and pennate (branching) veins run towards the margin. The lamina is oblong to lanceolate-shaped, ≤80cm long and ≤15cm wide.|$|E

5000|$|Some weak stemmed plants produce wiry, coiled, {{sensitive}} and delicate organs for climbing. They are called <b>tendrils</b> [...] These may develop {{from either the}} axillary bud or the terminal bud of the stem. In Passiflora, the <b>tendrils</b> develop from the axillary bud. In Cissus quadrangularis. And in Vitis vinifera the terminal bud develops into <b>tendrils.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>Tendrils</b> {{of which}} the {{extremities}} are permanently and slightly curved, are sensitive only on the concave surface; other <b>tendrils,</b> {{such as those of}} the Cobaea (though furnished with horny hooks directed to one side) and those of Cissus discolor, are sensitive on all sides. Hence the <b>tendrils</b> of this latter plant, when stimulated by a touch of equal force on opposite sides, did not bend. The inferior and lateral surfaces of the <b>tendrils</b> of Mutisia are sensitive, but not the upper surface. With branched <b>tendrils,</b> the several branches act alike; but in the Hanburya the lateral spur-like branch does not acquire (for excellent reasons which have been explained) its sensitiveness nearly so soon as the main branch. With most <b>tendrils</b> the lower or basal part is either not at all sensitive, or sensitive only to prolonged contact. We thus see that the sensitiveness of <b>tendrils</b> is a special and localized capacity. It is quite independent of the power of spontaneously revolving; for the curling of the terminal portion from touch does not in the least interrupt the former movement. In Bignonia unguis and its close allies, the petioles of the leaves, as well as the <b>tendrils,</b> are sensitive to a touch.|$|R
60|$|FUMARIACEAE.--Corydalis claviculata.--According to Mohl (p. 43), the {{extremities}} of the branched stem, {{as well as}} the leaves, are {{converted into}} <b>tendrils.</b> In the specimens examined by me all the <b>tendrils</b> were certainly foliar, and it is hardly credible that the same plant should produce <b>tendrils</b> of a widely different homological nature. Nevertheless, from this statement by Mohl, I have ranked this species amongst the tendril-bearers; if classed exclusively by its foliar <b>tendrils,</b> it would be doubtful whether it ought not to have been placed amongst the leaf-climbers, with its allies, Fumaria and Adlumia. A large majority of its so-called <b>tendrils</b> still bear leaflets, though excessively reduced in size; but some few of them may properly be designated as <b>tendrils,</b> for they are completely destitute of laminae or blades. Consequently, we here behold a plant in an actual state of transition from a leaf-climber to a tendril- bearer. Whilst the plant is rather young, only the outer leaves, but when full-grown all the leaves, have their extremities converted into more or less perfect <b>tendrils.</b> I have examined specimens from one locality alone, viz. Hampshire; and it is not improbable that plants growing under different conditions might have their leaves a little more or less changed into true <b>tendrils.</b>|$|R
25|$|Colorado's 3rd congressional {{district}} is a {{congressional district}} in the U.S. state of Colorado. The district takes {{in most of the}} rural Western Slope in the state's western third, with a <b>tendril</b> in the south taking in the southern portions of the Eastern Plains. It includes the cities of Grand Junction, Durango and Pueblo.|$|E
25|$|The 1962 film triffids (now {{given the}} {{binomial}} name Triffidus celestus) also differ physically: the film triffids were designed with flaying tentacles below their stems, which they use as slashing weapons and to drag their dead prey. Also, their stinger is shown as a gas-propelled projectile, {{rather than a}} coiled <b>tendril.</b> Finally, the film triffids are vulnerable to sea water.|$|E
25|$|In younger plants, the lamina {{is usually}} {{narrower}} towards the base, becoming more oblong as the plant matures. The apex may sometimes be slightly , with the <b>tendril</b> joining the lamina on the underside, up to 4mm before the apex. Occasionally {{the two halves}} of the lamina may meet the midrib unequally at different points along its length, up to 3mm apart in some specimens.|$|E
60|$|Bignonia littoralis.--The young {{internode}}s revolve {{in large}} ellipses. An internode bearing immature <b>tendrils</b> made two revolutions, each in 3 hrs. 50 m.; but when grown older with the <b>tendrils</b> mature, it made two ellipses, each {{at the rate}} of 2 hrs. 44 m. This species, unlike the preceding, is incapable of twining round a stick: this {{does not appear to be}} due to any want of flexibility in the internodes or to the action of the <b>tendrils,</b> and certainly not to any want of the revolving power; nor can I account for the fact. Nevertheless the plant readily ascends a thin upright stick by seizing a point above with its two opposite <b>tendrils,</b> which then contract spirally. If the <b>tendrils</b> seize nothing, they do not become spiral.|$|R
60|$|The {{position}} of the <b>tendrils</b> alone suffices to show their homological nature. In two instances one of two <b>tendrils</b> produced a flower at its tip; this, however, did not prevent its acting properly and curling round a twig. In a third case both lateral branches which {{ought to have been}} modified into <b>tendrils,</b> produced flowers like the central branch, and had quite lost their tendril-structure.|$|R
25|$|<b>Tendrils</b> {{are up to}} 10cm long, about 1.5 to 2mm wide {{near the}} lamina, and up to 2.5mm wide towards the pitcher. Developed <b>tendrils</b> seem to always possess a loop. The {{pitchers}} themselves are unknown.|$|R
25|$|The {{specialised}} pitcher traps of Nepenthes plants {{form on the}} end of tendrils. The {{tendrils of}} aerial pitchers are usually coiled in the middle. If the <b>tendril</b> comes into contact with an object for long enough it will usually curl around it, forming a strong anchor point for the pitcher. In this way, the tendrils help to support the growing stem of the plant.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{and most}} {{comprehensive study of}} tendrils was Charles Darwin's monograph On the Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants, which was originally published in 1865. This work also coined the term circumnutation to describe the motion of growing stems and tendrils seeking supports. Darwin also observed the phenomenon now known as <b>tendril</b> perversion, in which tendrils adopt the shape of two sections of counter-twisted helices with a transition in the middle.|$|E
25|$|In botany, a <b>tendril</b> is a {{specialized}} stem, leaves or petiole with a threadlike shape {{that is used}} by climbing plants for support, attachment and cellular invasion by parasitic plants, generally by twining around suitable hosts found by touch. They do not have a lamina or blade, but they can photosynthesize. They can be formed from modified shoots, modified leaves, or auxiliary branches and are sensitive to airborne chemicals, often determining the direction of growth, as in species of Cuscuta.|$|E
60|$|We {{have seen}} that the <b>tendrils</b> {{in the last three}} families, namely, the Vitaceae, Sapindaceae and Passifloraceae, are {{modified}} flower- peduncles. This is likewise the case, according to De Candolle (as quoted by Mohl), with the <b>tendrils</b> of Brunnichia, one of the Polygonaceae. In two or three species of Modecca, one of the Papayaceae, the <b>tendrils,</b> as I hear from Prof. Oliver, occasionally bear flowers and fruit; so that they are axial in their nature.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tendrils</b> {{are up to}} 10 cm long, about 1.5 to 2 mm wide {{near the}} lamina, and up to 2.5 mm wide towards the pitcher. Developed <b>tendrils</b> seem to always possess a loop. The {{pitchers}} themselves are unknown.|$|R

25|$|Nepenthes species usually produce {{two types}} of pitchers, known as leaf dimorphism. Appearing near {{the base of the}} plant are the large lower traps, which {{typically}} sit on the ground. The upper or aerial pitchers are usually smaller, coloured differently, and possess different features from the lower pitchers. These upper pitchers usually form as the plant reaches maturity and the plant grows taller. To keep the plant steady, the upper pitchers often form a loop in the <b>tendril,</b> allowing it to wrap around nearby support. In some species (e.g. N.rafflesiana), different prey may be attracted by the {{two types of}} pitchers. This varied morphology also often makes identification of species difficult.|$|E
25|$|The {{second major}} group of pitcher plants are the monkey cups or {{tropical}} pitcher plants {{of the genus}} Nepenthes. In the hundred or so species of this genus, the pitcher is borne {{at the end of}} a <b>tendril,</b> which grows as an extension to the midrib of the leaf. Most species catch insects, although the larger ones, such as Nepenthes rajah, also occasionally take small mammals and reptiles. Nepenthes bicalcarata possesses two sharp thorns that project from the base of the operculum over the entrance to the pitcher. These likely serve to lure insects into a precarious position over the pitcher mouth, where they may lose their footing and fall into the fluid within.|$|E
25|$|The {{inside of}} the ribbon was {{conceptualized}} as similar to a dense electrical storm, with tendrils of electricity fogging the screen. Because of the complex interplay of the ribbon elements with the ships that would be trapped within it, ILM decided the refugee ships and Enterprise-B should be CG models. To make the switch between computer-generated and motion-control passes of the physical model appear seamless, ILM created a wireframe of the physical model, with the computer-generated model's textures taken from photos of the physical model, shot in flat light with a long lens. The <b>tendril</b> strike that sends Kirk into the Nexus was simulated with the layering of multiple pieces of animation, including CG explosions Knoll rendered on his personal computer and a recycled explosion effect from The Empire Strikes Back.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{varieties}} in {{the vine}} species of Passiflora edulis. One is a shallow-rooted, woody, perennial that possesses many <b>tendrils.</b> The other variety is deeply-rooted. The young <b>tendrils</b> are finely-toothed and typically have a red or purple hue. (purdue) ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>tendrils</b> {{contract}} spirally a {{short time}} after catching any object; those which catch nothing merely bend slowly downwards. But the whole subject of the spiral contraction of <b>tendrils</b> will be discussed after all the tendril-bearing species have been described.|$|R

25|$|Motility {{is a key}} {{virulence}} determinant in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{has three}} distinct methods of moving across or through a medium. Rhamnolipids are particularly important in swarming motility where they are postulated to lower the surface tension of the surface through their surfactant properties, allowing the bacterial cell to swarm. New evidence suggests that rhamnolipids are necessary to allow Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells to overcome attachment mediated by type IV pili. There is some discrepancy between the role of HAAs and RHLs in swarming motility. Some studies use a rhlA mutation to assess the effect on motility, which prevents the formation of HAAs and rhamnolipids. Studies that use a rhlB mutant show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa can swarm {{in the absence of}} rhamnolipids, but HAAs are absolutely necessary for swarming. Rhamnolipids have been proposed to be important in regulating swarm <b>tendril</b> formation.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, the British Somaliland {{protectorate}} government commissioned {{an archaeological}} survey in twelve desert towns in present-day Somaliland, {{near the border}} with Ethiopia. According to the expedition team, the sites yielded the most salient evidence of late medieval period affluence. They contained ruins of what were evidently once large cities belonging to the Adal Sultanate. Three of the towns in particular, Abara, Gargesa and Amud, featured between 200 and 300 stone houses. The walls of certain sites still reportedly stood 18 meters high. Excavations in the area yielded 26 silver coins, unlike the copper pieces that were more common in polities below the Horn region. The earliest of these recovered coins had been minted by Sultan Barquq (1382–99), also of the Egyptian Burji dynasty, and the latest were again Sultan Qaitbay issues. All of the pieces had been struck in either Cairo or Damascus. A few gold coins were also discovered during the expedition, making the area {{the only place in}} the wider region to yield such pieces. Besides coinage, high quality porcelain was recovered from the Adal sites. The fine celadon ware was found either lying on the surface, or buried at a depth of seven and a half inches, or ensconced within dense middens four to five feet high. Among the artefacts were grey granular sherds with a crackled blue-green or sea-green glaze, and white crystalline fragments with an uncrackled green-white glaze. Some Ming dynasty ware was also discovered, including many early Ming blue-and-white bowl sherds. They were adorned with <b>tendril</b> scrolls on a bluish ground and ornamented with black spotting, while other bowls had floral patterns outlined by grey or black-blue designs. Additionally, a few Ming red-and-white sherds were found, as well as white porcelain fragments with bluish highlights. The Adal sites appeared to reach an Indian Ocean terminus at the Sa'ad ad-Din Islands, named for Sultan Sa'ad ad-Din II of the Ifat Sultanate.|$|E
500|$|Leaves are {{produced}} {{at regular intervals}} along the stem. [...] They {{are connected to the}} stem by sheathed structures known as petioles. A long, narrow <b>tendril</b> emanates from the end of each leaf. [...] At the tip of the <b>tendril</b> is a small bud which, when physiologically activated, develops into a functioning trap. [...] Hence, the pitchers are modified leaves and not specialised flowers as is often believed. [...] The green structure most similar to a normal leaf is specifically known as the lamina or leaf blade.|$|E
60|$|Lathyrus grandiflorus.--The plants {{observed}} {{were young}} and not growing vigorously, yet sufficiently so, I think, for my observations to be trusted. If so, we have the rare case of neither internodes nor <b>tendrils</b> revolving. The <b>tendrils</b> of vigorous plants are above 4 inches in length, and are often twice divided into three branches; the tips are curved and are sensitive on their concave sides; {{the lower part of}} the central stem is hardly at all sensitive. Hence this plant appears to climb simply by its <b>tendrils</b> being brought, through the growth of the stem, or more efficiently by the wind, into contact with surrounding objects, which they then clasp. I may add that the <b>tendrils,</b> or the internodes, or both, of Vicia sativa revolve.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tendrils</b> were an {{irregular}} collaboration between two Australian guitarists, Joel Silbersher (of Hoss) and Charlie Owen (of Beasts of Bourbon). A difficult sound to describe, <b>Tendrils</b> features two seemingly chaotic but strangely melodic and complementary, guitar parts and occasionally stripped back percussion. In 1995, starting out billed simply as Joel Silbersher and Charlie Owen, they issued an album, <b>Tendrils.</b> It {{was produced by}} Spencer P. Jones and recorded at Atlantis Studios, Melbourne. Drums were provided by Greg Bainbridge for three tracks and Todd McNeair on a track.|$|R
500|$|Mature plants {{may also}} produce [...] "upper" [...] or [...] "aerial" [...] pitchers, which are much smaller, funnel-shaped, and usually less {{colourful}} than the lowers. The <b>tendril</b> attachment in upper pitchers is normally {{present at the}} rear of the pitcher cup. True upper pitchers are seldom seen, as the stems of N. rajah rarely attain lengths greater than a few metres before dying off and being replaced by off-shoots from the main rootstock.|$|E
500|$|The peristome of N. rajah has {{a highly}} {{distinctive}} scalloped edge and is greatly expanded, forming an attractive red lip around the trap's mouth. [...] A series of raised protrusions, known as ribs, intersect the peristome, ending in short, sharp teeth that line its inner margin. The inner {{portion of the}} peristome accounts for around 80% of its total cross-sectional surface length in this species.
