5|$|When Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are {{watching}} Itchy & Scratchy, Marge says {{they watch the}} same episodes all the time, while Lisa says that the Itchy & Scratchy cartoons are just pasted together from pieces of old episodes. This comment is a joke about the construction of this episode; <b>the</b> <b>blackboard</b> and couch gags are taken from other episodes, there are clips from past episodes, and the interstitials are actually clips from past episodes that feature the family members talking in the kitchen. These three aspects {{support the idea of}} this episode being a clip show to the extreme.|$|E
5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on <b>the</b> <b>blackboard</b> and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E
5|$|In early 1957, Tubb persuaded Hamilton {{to switch}} the {{magazine}} from pocket-book to digest size format, {{in the hope}} that this would improve the magazine's visibility on bookstalls. The circulation did indeed rise, to about 14,000 copies per month—a surprisingly low figure given Landsborough's assertion that Authentic had been selling 30,000 copies in the early days. However, later that year, Hamilton made the decision to invest a substantial sum in the UK paperback rights of an American best-seller: it is not known for certain which book this was, but it is thought to have been Evan Hunter's <b>The</b> <b>Blackboard</b> Jungle. Hamilton could no longer afford to have cash tied up in Authentic, and in the summer of 1957 Tubb was given two months to close down the magazine, printing stories that had already been paid for. The last issue was dated October 1957.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the 1883 room has been restored to its original appearance. The red oak floor is trimmed by nine inches of mop board and quarter-round, decoratively accented. The two curved and semi-circular front walls mark the two coat rooms in the original, one-room building. The rounded walls hold a chair rail and are wainscoted below <b>the</b> <b>blackboards.</b> Blackboards cover available space on the north, east, and south walls.

5|$|While {{studying}} for his O-levels {{he began to}} have difficulties reading <b>the</b> <b>blackboard</b> and was initially devastated when told he would need glasses. At first, he played poorly at school, encumbered by the fragile spectacles. However, matters improved when a more robust pair, similar to those glasses worn by cricketer Roy Marshall, were fashioned {{for him at the}} behest of his maternal uncle, Albert Speight. Albert would go on to be a strong influence on Boycott's early cricketing game while playing for Brierley Juniors Football Club. In 1958, Boycott left school with seven O-level passes and the school's Individual Cricket Cup. That summer he played for the Leeds United under-18 football team alongside Billy Bremner and attracted the attention of Leeds United scouts. During the winter he continued to play nets with uncle Lawrence.|$|E

50|$|The first {{paintings}} to gain Bonifacho critical acclaim in Canada were <b>the</b> <b>Blackboards</b> series produced between 1978 and 1982. The series features racing greyhounds, targets, pop culture symbols (e.g. Marilyn Monroe) and/or American flags in sometimes unexpected juxtapositions.

40|$|In current Natural Language Processing Systems, {{different}} {{components for}} different processing tasks and input/ output modalities {{have to be}} integrated. Once integrated, the interactions between the components have to be specified. Interactions in dialogue systems can be complex {{due in part to}} the many states the system can be in. When porting the system to another domain, parts of the integration process have to be repeated. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a multi-blackboard architecture that is controlled by a set of expertsystem like rules. These rules may contain typed variables. Variables can be substituted by representations with an appropriate type stored in <b>the</b> <b>blackboards.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> representations in <b>the</b> <b>blackboards</b> allow to represent partial information and to leave disjunctions unresolved.

25|$|Schooling came to her, {{as it was}} apt {{to come to a}} girl of her period, {{intermittently}} and in variety. She spent a year in a small {{boarding school}} in Plattsburg; an interval at a school kept at the Shurtliff homestead in Middlebury; attendance at the Middlebury Female Semimary; a winter at a village Academy in Rutland, where she recited Latin with boys preparing to enter college as sophomores; and a term or two at “Old T. C. A.” It was at Middlebury, in a one-story school house on Pleasant Street ,that she began the study of Latin, the subject of all others most useful in her adult life, as she declared. There, too, under Father Merrill, she wrote on <b>the</b> <b>blackboard</b> the list of English kings from Julius Caesar to William the Fourth, without a blunder. The feat was recalled by President John M. Thomas when in 1910 he conferred on her the degree of Doctor of Letters from Middlebury College, an honor which with characteristic modesty she accepted as a tribute to the women of her generation.|$|E

25|$|As a {{young man}} John Schofield was educated in the public schools, helped his family farm and build their home, and then {{surveyed}} land in northern Wisconsin before spending a year teaching school in Oneco, Illinois not far from Freeport. Then U.S. Rep. Thomas J. Turner secured John Schofield an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. He sold land for travel expenses and reported on June 1, 1849. In his final year at the Academy, while a teaching assistant in the mathematics section, cadet Schofield was accused of allowing others in his classroom to make offensive jokes and drawings on <b>the</b> <b>blackboard.</b> He was dismissed from West Point, but after meeting with Illinois' U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas, appealed the decision to the Secretary of War, who referred the matter back to a Board of Inquiry at the Academy. A majority of the review board voted to rescind the expulsion, {{but one of the}} two officers who voted to sustain it, cavalry and artillery instructor Lt. George H. Thomas, later became a commander of Schofield during the Civil War. Although Schofield's eventual memoirs did not mention Thomas on the review board, his persistent criticism of Thomas's generalship after the war may reflect this incident. Schofield graduated in 1853, ranking seventh in his class, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the artillery.|$|E
500|$|After {{working through}} {{a large number of}} proposals, Ward hit upon a {{workable}} design incorporating staging, compression and radiation implosion. At a meeting on 2 December 1955, Ward sketched it on <b>the</b> <b>blackboard.</b> Penny's response was cool, regarding it as too complicated, but Cook recognised it as worthy. Although Ward's design was not the one ultimately adopted for the hydrogen bombs used in Operation Grapple, the concept was influential, {{and the development of a}} more advanced design than the Americans had would be the key to achieving the overall objective of the project—a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship with the Americans.

500|$|In {{the last}} {{scene of the}} episode, Bart is seen writing [...] "I will not expose the ignorance of the faculty" [...] on <b>the</b> <b>blackboard</b> as a {{punishment}} for exposing the ignorance of the teachers by removing the Teachers' Editions. In his book The Small Screen: How Television Equips Us to Live in the Information Age, Brian L. Ott describes this scene {{as one of the}} [...] "key ways The Simpsons appeals to audience, which tends to be younger, by critiquing authority figures, and in particular educators." [...] Toby Daspit and John Weaver write in their book Popular Culture and Critical Pedagogy: Reading, Constructing, Connecting that the writers of The Simpsons are [...] "particularly interested" [...] in questions about authority and the abuses of powers in school. Another scene from the episode sees Ms. Hoover telling the students to stare at <b>the</b> <b>blackboard</b> for fifteen minutes until class is over. Daspit and Weaver write that it is [...] "the absolute power that teachers have over students' every action that allows for the image to be presented on The Simpsons. It would be comforting to tell ourselves that this is simply parody run amok, that the writers are stretching reality to make a point, but the discussants in the study [...] had memories of a reality very much like the one presented in this program." [...] One of the discussants said she believes everyone has experienced similar situations in their school years, and she thinks the thought that [...] "an educator could ever do something so useless and pointless with the children's time" [...] is [...] "frightening".|$|E
