5|$|Knott's major {{shortcomings}} were in deterring crime. Despite the feuds {{that continued}} <b>to</b> <b>rage</b> in the state, {{including one that}} lasted several years in Rowan County, Knott refused to acknowledge lawlessness as a problem. Overcrowding of prisons prompted Knott to employ his pardon power liberally. The legislature approved {{the construction of the}} Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville, but it was Knott's predecessor, Luke P. Blackburn, who laid most of the groundwork for this project.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot (Old Father Goriot, 1835) was {{his next}} success, in which Balzac transposes {{the story of}} King Lear to 1820s Paris in order <b>to</b> <b>rage</b> at a society bereft of all love save the love of money. The {{centrality}} of a father in this novel matches Balzac's own position—not only as mentor to his troubled young secretary, Jules Sandeau, but {{also the fact that}} he had fathered a child, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay, with his otherwise-married lover, Maria Du Fresnay, who had been his source of inspiration for Eugénie Grandet.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, {{helicopter}} gunships conducted dawn {{air strikes}} against insurgents who were attacking troops at the university campus. By this point, the city had been coming under continuous air strikes for three days, which included barrel bombs. An all-out ground offensive was launched during the day {{in an attempt to}} capture the city. A column of troops started out from Samarra towards Tikrit to the north and by sundown had reached the edge of the city. According to Lt. Gen. Ahmed Abu Ragheef, another column was directed towards the Camp Speicher air base. There were initial claims by government sources of capturing Tikrit, but in fact Tikrit itself remained under insurgent control as heavy fighting continued <b>to</b> <b>rage</b> on the city outskirts during the night. In the evening, helicopters struck a gathering of people preparing for a wedding ceremony in the village of Al Bu Hayazi, east of Tikrit, killing four civilians.|$|E

5|$|Prospective colourists at A. Farsari & Co. {{were interviewed}} by Farsari himself, who ensured they were {{familiar}} with Japanese painting techniques. Once hired, they were given unpaid instruction for several months, and then a basic salary that steadily increased as Farsari became satisfied with their work. A capable and loyal colourist could earn twice the rate offered at other Yokohama studios and double his own daily rate for work on Sundays. Colourists also received regular bonuses and gifts. On the other hand, Farsari complained {{in a letter to}} his sister that to motivate his employees he had <b>to</b> <b>rage,</b> swear and beat them, which he did according to a fixed schedule. By 1891 A. Farsari & Co. had 32 employees, 19 of whom were hand-colouring artists.|$|E
5|$|The prequel Birth by Sleep {{introduces}} Terra as {{an apprentice}} Keyblade wielder who trains alongside Aqua and Ventus at the Land of Departure. Early in the game, Terra is denied the rank of Keyblade Master when his mentor, Master Eraqus, detects a strong presence of darkness in his heart. Disheartened, Terra is {{given a chance to}} redeem his failure when dispatched to eliminate an insurgence of dark creatures called the Unversed in neighboring worlds. Periodically, the vagabond Master Xehanort appeals to Terra to channel the power of darkness freely, creating a schism between him and his friends as they grow troubled by his actions. This eventually leads Terra to clash with Eraqus when he finds his master inexplicably attacking Ventus, which ends with Xehanort vanquishing the weakened Eraqus. Terra, realizing the entire conflict was engineered to stimulate his inner darkness, confronts Xehanort at the Keyblade Graveyard and succumbs <b>to</b> <b>rage,</b> allowing Xehanort to take over his body to prolong his own life. Terra's disembodied mind inhabits his discarded armor and becomes the Lingering Will, which remains in the Keyblade Graveyard after defeating Xehanort. The game's secret ending shows Terra's heart continuing to resist Xehanort, who still possesses his body after losing his memories in a final battle against Aqua.|$|E

25|$|Rage {{has a good}} {{reputation}} among viewers for its minimalist format which has remained largely unchanged {{for more than two}} decades. The program was originally created by executive producer Mark FitzGerald in early 1987 under the working title 'rage til you puke'. This was later shortened <b>to</b> <b>rage,</b> as this was deemed more likely to be acceptable to the ABC board. It debuted in April 1987 – the same month as MTV Australia debuted as a late night programme on the Nine Network and two months after Video Hits debuted on the Ten Network.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the success}} of these volumes, it was the release of Coal in 1976 that {{established}} Lorde as an influential voice in the Black Arts Movement, and the large publishing house behind it -- Norton -- helped introduce her to a wider audience. The volume includes poems from both The First Cities and Cables <b>to</b> <b>Rage,</b> and it unties many of the themes Lorde would become known for throughout her career: her rage at racial injustice, her celebration of her black identity, and her call for an intersectional consideration of women's experiences. Lorde followed Coal up with Between Our Selves (also in 1976) and Hanging Fire (1978).|$|E

A flashback expanded on Jaime's discovery of the scarab, revealing how the scarab bonded itself to Jaime and showing his first encounter with a metahuman. After the fight, Jaime found himself alone and naked in the desert and had to hitch-hike home. Upon his return, Jaime discovered he had been missing {{for a whole year}} because the scarab used a dimensional mode of transport to get back to Earth. Unlike most superheroes, Jaime shared his identity with family and friends.|$|E
25|$|Corey's {{political}} path {{took another}} detour {{in the latter}} part of 1936, when he moved again away from the CPUSA's orbit and began an association with the dissident Communist movement around expelled party leader Jay Lovestone. The so-called Lovestoneites embraced the fundamental tenets of Marxism, but oriented themselves towards the American trade union movement and away from foreign domination of the International Communist movement and its centrally-determined obsession with advancing the foreign policy interests of the USSR. With secret police terror beginning <b>to</b> <b>rage</b> in the Soviet Union from 1936 onwards, the Lovestone political organization's criticism of the USSR became increasingly harsh and its appreciation of American institutions more pronounced — a perspective which Corey himself shared.|$|E
25|$|In that era, {{there was}} social unrest in the country. Not {{only was the}} women's {{suffrage}} movement gaining momentum in Canada and calls {{were coming out of}} the prairies for socialist changes to the governmental system, but war continued <b>to</b> <b>rage</b> around the world. Canada was providing troops and supplies, and shortly after his installation, acting on the advice of Borden, Devonshire introduced conscription, a decision that was particularly divisive between French and English Canadians and sparked the Conscription Crisis of 1917. In the same year, the Governor General also travelled to Nova Scotia to survey the damage caused by the Halifax Explosion on 6 December; there he met with survivors and addressed the women of the Voluntary Aid Detachment.|$|E

25|$|About this time, the Light Cavalry Brigade of Colonel Makwitz, had {{completed}} his manoeuvre from the left, reached the right flank, and was formed {{up in two}} lines: also the four Battalions that had been detached from the 6th Brigade (General Krafft's), arrived upon the right of Saint-Amand-la-Haye, and came into action. The battle on both sides on {{this part of the}} Field continued <b>to</b> <b>rage</b> with unabated violence and with such indefatigable ardour did the Prussians continue the struggle, that when the fire of their skirmishers was observed to slacken, from the men having expended their ammunition, the soldiers of the 11th Hussars rushed into the midst of them, and supplied them with such cartridges as they had of their own; an act of devotion to which many of them fell a sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|There follow angry exchanges {{among the}} three, Norma declaring Pollione to be a traitor; {{he trying to}} persuade Adalgisa to leave with him; and she angrily telling him to go away. When he {{declares}} that it is his fate to leave Norma, she encourages the young priestess to go with him, but the latter declares that she would rather die. Norma then demands that her lover go, leaving behind his children—and his honour. (Finale: brief duet, Adalgisa and Pollione: he declares his love, and she her desire to Norma {{not to be the}} cause of grief to her. Trio: Norma continues <b>to</b> <b>rage</b> at Pollione, Adalgisa repeats her desire to make him return to Norma, and Pollione curses the day when he met Norma.) Then the sound of the Druids calling Norma to the temple is heard. They report that the angry god, Irminsul, has spoken. Pollione storms out.|$|E
25|$|The battles {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>rage</b> {{behind the}} leading trio, as Grosjean started to attack 4th placed Webber. The Red Bull driver {{decided to make}} a second pitstop for new tyres and rejoined in 8th place, behind Rosberg and Pérez, but ahead of Räikkönen. Felipe Massa, who was unable to regain the places he lost due to his spin, was now back up to 5th place as he too attempted a one-stopper. That did not work out however, and Rosberg had closed right up to him by lap 55, and brought Pérez, Webber and Räikkönen along. Rosberg attacked Massa on the DRS zone, but overshot the last chicane and had to give the position back. Pérez took advantage of this and was right behind Massa, which meant that he too was able to get the jump on Rosberg when he handed the place back to Massa. He then passed Massa on the same lap, with Rosberg also going through, this time doing the job cleanly. The Brazilian had enough, and pitted for a new set of tyres and rejoined in 10th place, where he stayed till the end.|$|E

25|$|After Khosrau I, Hormizd IV (579–590) {{took the}} throne. The {{war with the}} Byzantines {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>rage</b> intensely but inconclusively until the general Bahram Chobin, dismissed and humiliated by Hormizd, rose in revolt in 589. The following year, Hormizd was overthrown by a palace coup and his son Khosrau II (590–628) placed on the throne. However, this change of ruler failed to placate Bahram, who defeated Khosrau, forcing him to flee to Byzantine territory, and seized the throne for himself as Bahram VI. Khosrau asked the Byzantine Emperor Maurice (582–602) for assistance against Bahram, offering to cede the western Caucasus to the Byzantines. To cement the alliance, Khosrau also married Maurice's daughter Miriam. Under the command of Khosrau and the Byzantine generals Narses and John Mystacon, the new combined Byzantine-Persian army raised a rebellion against Bahram, defeating him at the Battle of Blarathon in 591. When Khosrau was subsequently restored to power he kept his promise, handing over control of western Armenia and Caucasian Iberia. The new peace arrangement allowed the two empires to focus on military matters elsewhere: Khosrau expanded the Sassanid Empire's eastern frontier while Maurice restored Byzantine control of the Balkans.|$|E
25|$|Orndorff and Hogan started {{teaming up}} to feud with Piper and Orton, facing them in tag team {{competition}} {{all over the}} country. Orndorff's feud with Piper and Orton continued <b>to</b> <b>rage</b> on while Hogan started to defend his title against other contenders; Orndorff faced both Orton and Piper in individual competition, usually without a conclusive outcome. After Orndorff fired Bobby Heenan as his manager, Heenan placed a $25,000 bounty on Orndorff, payable to anyone who could injure him. When no one succeeded, Heenan upped the bounty to $50,000. One of the first men to try and claim the new, higher bonus was Roddy Piper himself, but their matches got so out of hand that Bruno Sammartino was appointed as a special referee {{in the hopes of}} keeping peace. Instead of keeping peace, Sammartino became a target for Orton and Piper, which led to Orndorff and Sammartino teaming up. Orndorff teamed with a variety of opponents in his fights with Piper and Orton, including André the Giant. In February 1986, Bobby Heenan used a match between Hulk Hogan and Don Muraco as an opportunity to have King Kong Bundy attack Hogan, setting up their WrestleMania 2 match. While Hogan fought off Bundy, Orndorff battled Don Muraco in a match that ended in a double count out.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} the AWA, Jannetty and Michaels were {{contacted}} by WWF owner Vince McMahon informing them {{that he was willing}} to bring them back if they were able to be more professional this time round. By the end of May the team was working for the WWF under the shortened name The Rockers. They officially made their television debut on the June 18, 1988 edition of WWF Superstars of Wrestling in a squash match. The Rockers made their pay-per-view (PPV) debut at the 1988 Survivor Series as part of the 10 team tag match. They eliminated The Bolsheviks from the match before being eliminated by a double-disqualification in a brawl with the Brain Busters. The brawl between The Rockers and The Brain Busters led to a match taped for WWF Superstars of Wrestling where both teams were disqualified once again, this time before the match could really start. This led to a series of house show matches between the two teams, a series of matches that drew rave reviews from the fans. One match in particular on January 23, 1989 was rated as one of the 50 greatest matches in the PWI 10th year anniversary issue. The Brain Busters narrowly defeated The Rockers, as Anderson held down Marty Jannetty's leg as Blanchard pinned him. The feud continued <b>to</b> <b>rage</b> on as they clashed at Saturday's Night Main Event in a match that saw both teams counted out for brawling on the floor.|$|E
