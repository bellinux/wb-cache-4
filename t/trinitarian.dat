5|$|In 1938 Joaquín {{returned}} to Monterrey to preach {{to his former}} associates. There he learned {{that he had been}} baptized using the <b>Trinitarian</b> formula and not in the name of Jesus Christ as he preached. His re-baptism in the name of Jesus Christ by his collaborator Lino Figueroa marked Joaquín's separation {{from the rest of the}} Pentecostal community.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{proponents of}} social trinitarianism often {{claim to have}} been {{influenced}} by the Cappadocians' dynamic picture of the Trinity. However, it would be fundamentally incorrect to identify Gregory as a social <b>Trinitarian,</b> as his theology emphasises the unity of God's will, and he clearly believes that the identities of the Trinity are the three persons, not the relations between them.|$|E
5|$|Many {{existing}} Wesleyan-holiness denominations {{adopted the}} Pentecostal message, {{such as the}} Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee), the Church of God in Christ, and the Pentecostal Holiness Church. The formation of new denominations also occurred, motivated by doctrinal differences between Wesleyan Pentecostals and their Finished Work counterparts, such as the Assemblies of God formed in 1914 and the Pentecostal Church of God formed in 1919. An early doctrinal controversy led to a split between <b>Trinitarian</b> and Oneness Pentecostals, the latter founded the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World in 1916.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>Trinitarians</b> {{state that}} the {{doctrine}} of the Trinity was revealed in New Testament times; others, that it was revealed in the Patristic period. Nontrinitarians, on the other hand, will generally {{state that the}} traditional doctrine of the Trinity did not exist until centuries {{after the end of the}} New Testament period. Some <b>Trinitarians</b> agree with this, seeing a development over time towards a true understanding of the Trinity. <b>Trinitarians</b> sometimes refer to Christian belief about God before the traditional statements on the Trinity as unsophisticated, 'naive', or 'incipient Trinitarianism', and that early Christians were 'proto-Trinitarian, partially Trinitarian', etc. Unitarians and some <b>Trinitarians</b> would state that this means that those early Christians were not actually <b>Trinitarians.</b>|$|R

Through the Old <b>Trinitarians</b> Union, Old Boys regularly compete against current students in various sports such as cricket, volleyball and basketball, with {{the winner of the}} overall competition given the Jubilee Cup on Speech Day, with the President of the OTU collecting it on behalf of the old boys and the School Captain collecting it on behalf of the School.|$|R

5|$|The {{traditional}} view of Gregory {{is that he}} was {{an orthodox}} <b>Trinitarian</b> theologian, who was influenced by the neoplatonism of Plotinus and believed in universal salvation following Origen. However, as a highly original and sophisticated thinker, Gregory is difficult to classify, and many aspects of his theology are contentious among both conservative Eastern Orthodox theologians and Western academic scholarship. This is often {{due to the lack of}} systematic structure and the presence of terminological inconsistencies in Gregory's work.|$|E
5|$|Winchelsey was {{a preacher}} of some note, and when preaching at St. Paul's he {{attracted}} large crowds to his sermons and lectures. Winchelsey's theological writings date primarily from {{his time at}} St. Paul's, where he delivered a number of quodibeta. The quaestiones disputatae from those sessions survive, and illustrate his highly orthodox <b>trinitarian</b> views and his scholastic method. Miracles {{were said to have}} been worked at his tomb in Canterbury cathedral, but efforts to have him declared a saint have been unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the <b>Trinitarian</b> baptismal formula.|$|E

5|$|Most Christians {{believe that}} Jesus was {{both human and}} the Son of God. While there has been {{theological}} debate over his nature, Some early Christians viewed Jesus as subordinate to the Father, and others considered him {{an aspect of the}} Father rather than a separate person. The Church resolved the issues in ancient councils, which established the Holy Trinity, with Jesus both fully human and fully God. <b>Trinitarian</b> Christians generally believe that Jesus is the Logos, God's incarnation and God the Son, both fully divine and fully human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Protestant Reformation, Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus' two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} sign of dissent {{occurred}} in 1989 when a WCG minister, Gerald Flurry, published a manuscript outlining {{what he and}} others believed were disturbing trends in the work, including {{the beginnings of the}} doctrinal departure from what had been established by Armstrong. Flurry and another minister, John Amos, were disfellowshipped and went on to form the Philadelphia Church of God (PCG). The PCG began an alternative radio program and magazine, and {{over the next several years}} a few thousand WCG members left to join the PCG. Despite this, Tkach continued to implement additional changes in thinking including: the shift in emphasis away from observing world events primarily through the lens of prophetic interpretation; the removal of the prohibition of interracial marriage; the allowance of work on the Sabbath; the acceptance of the <b>trinitarian</b> doctrine; and the acceptance of the validity of other Christian denominations, among many other changes. Older Armstrong publications that supported the church's once unique doctrines were allowed to go out-of-print.|$|E
25|$|Today the <b>Trinitarian</b> Family is {{composed}} of priests, brothers, women (enclosed nuns and active sisters) as well as committed laity. Members of the <b>Trinitarian</b> Family include: The <b>Trinitarian</b> religious; the <b>Trinitarian</b> contemplative nuns; the <b>Trinitarian</b> Sisters of Valence; the <b>Trinitarian</b> Sisters of Rome, Valencia, Madrid, Mallorca, and Seville; the Oblates of the Most Holy Trinity; the Third Order Secular (tertiaries) and other <b>Trinitarian</b> Laity. All are distinguished by the cross of red and blue which dates from {{the origins of the}} Order. Trinitarians are found throughout Europe and in the Americas as well as in Africa, India, Korea and the Philippines.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} rosaries that are special to a {{particular}} religious Order, its history is rather cloudy. The first question is how long the <b>Trinitarians</b> have used the Trisagion and its associated prayers. The prayers themselves are quite old, and may well {{have come to the}} <b>Trinitarians</b> from Byzantium through their connections in the Middle East. The Trisagion itself can be traced at least {{as far back as the}} Council of Chalcedon (451 AD) and perhaps further. The use of these particular prayers by the <b>Trinitarians</b> may very well date back to the beginnings of the Order.|$|R
