5|$|O' Horten is a 2007 Norwegian {{language}} film {{directed by}} Bent Hamer. The film's title character Odd Horten is a habit-bound <b>train</b> <b>driver,</b> {{who is about}} to retire. On the day of his retirement he ends up in an unexpected situation, and is forced to reconsider his life. As in other films by Hamer, the themes are loneliness and old age, and the courage to take chances. O' Horten {{has been described as a}} film without a strong plot or a clear chronology.|$|E
5|$|Odd Horten is an overcautious 67-year-old {{man about}} to retire after forty {{years as a}} <b>train</b> <b>driver</b> on the route between Oslo and Bergen. As he awakes, he goes through a meticulous daily routine, as he prepares for his second-to-last time driving the train to Bergen. When he gets there, he makes small talk with Svea, who owns the {{boarding}} house where he stays when there and whom he now may never see again.|$|E

5|$|On 21 November, {{reinforcements}} {{had reached}} {{them and the}} decision was made to move the commandos to La Calle by rail. With only intermittent air cover, the train was attacked by German fighters and No. 6 Commando suffered heavy casualties with 11 killed and 32 wounded. After the <b>train</b> <b>driver</b> jumped from the engine, one of the commandos took over the duties of driving the train. The unit remained in La Calle until 26 November, during which time the commandos were used to unload stores from the ships in the port, while half the unit carried out a reconnaissance patrol near Tabarka, to determine whether the German tanks that were parked there were real or decoys.|$|E

5|$|Waterloo has {{appeared}} in fiction several times. In Jerome K. Jerome's 1889 comic novel, Three Men in a Boat, the protagonists spend {{some time in the}} station, trying to find their train to Kingston upon Thames. After being given contradictory information by every railway employee they speak to, they eventually bribe a <b>train</b> <b>driver</b> to take his train to their destination. In Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne's 1889 novel The Wrong Box, much of the farcical plot revolves around the misdelivery of two boxes at Waterloo station, and the attempts by the various protagonists to retrieve them. In H. G. Wells' 1897 science fiction novel, The War of the Worlds, the little used, and long since vanished, connecting track across the station concourse to Waterloo East station makes an appearance.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} study investigates the trauma experienced by Metrorail <b>train</b> <b>drivers.</b> An Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) is a worksite-based programme that assists {{in dealing with}} employee’s problems that impact on their job performance and overall production. Trauma awareness and management through therapy are necessary components {{and contribute to the}} effective operation of EAP. The study was conducted within the framework of a survey. Face-to-face scheduled interviews were designed and conducted on employees, i. e. Metrorail <b>train</b> <b>drivers,</b> after their respective supervisors had given permission. From the feedback on these interviews, it was apparent that <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> need the help of EAP services, maybe through psychological counselling and motivation. Witnessing suicides by people on rail tracks apparently is a common occurrence to Metrorail <b>train</b> <b>drivers.</b> These accidents leave them emotionally scarred and haunted for almost their entire lives. EAP services will embrace other elements influencing the performance and occupational well-being of these <b>train</b> <b>drivers.</b> These elements include performance incentives, fringe benefits, security, and conducive train settings.

5|$|While {{the rolling}} stock and Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} equipment were constructed in Japan, many parts were sourced from Europe. The trains were fitted with Stone Platt air-conditioning, Duwag bogies, Sig gangways, Scharfenberg couplers and Westinghouse brakes. Mitsubishi Electric's propulsion equipment was estimated to consume 50% less electricity than Hong Kong's existing MTR M-Train EMU. Its Automatic Train Control (ATC) signalling system was supplied by Westinghouse, capable of running at pre-programmed speeds and activated by the <b>train</b> <b>driver.</b> While theoretically possible to design for a fully driverless operation using this signalling technology, MRT Corporation (MRTC, now SMRT Corporation) decided against this option. The trainsets were assembled in Kobe, Japan, and then shipped to Singapore by Neptune Orient Lines. The first trainset was delivered to MRTC on 8 July 1986 at Bishan Depot, officiated by Yeo Ning Hong.|$|E
5|$|Meredith {{was born}} in 1874 in Chirk, a small mining town in Denbighshire, Wales, just south of Wrexham. He started work at Black Park Colliery as a pit pony driver {{at the age of}} 12. His family were Primitive Methodists, and Meredith himself {{remained}} a lifelong teetotaller. He spent eight years working in the mines, and worked during a tough time for the industry, enduring a 25% pay cut which led to strike action in 1893; this experience helped to shape his political views, which would become significant later in his life. An interest in football was kindled by his elder brothers. Elias, the eldest, was a <b>train</b> <b>driver</b> for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. His work allowed him to take Meredith to watch professional teams such as Everton. Football was a keen pastime for the miners, and the standard of amateur teams from towns and villages in north east Wales was high as a result; Chirk won the Welsh Cup five times between 1887 and 1894, with miners making up {{a large proportion of the}} team. All the Meredith brothers played football, but Sam, two years older than Billy, was the first to make an impression. He left Chirk to attempt a professional career, and went on to play for Stoke City as a full-back.|$|E

40|$|Given {{that the}} {{beneficial}} effects of <b>driver</b> <b>training</b> on accident risk {{may not be}} an appropriate criterion measure, this study investigates whether professionally <b>trained</b> and experienced <b>drivers</b> exhibit safer driving behaviour in a simulated driving task compared with drivers without professional <b>driver</b> <b>training.</b> A sample of 54 police <b>trained</b> <b>drivers</b> and a sample of 56 non-police <b>trained</b> <b>drivers</b> were required to complete two tasks. Firstly to overtake a slow-moving bus on a hazardous stretch of single-lane road with bends and hills and secondly to follow a lead vehicle travelling at 55 mph in a built-up section with a speed limit of 30 mph. Results showed that in comparison with non-police <b>trained</b> <b>drivers,</b> police drivers were significantly less likely to cross the central division of the road at unsafe locations during the overtaking task and reduced their speed on approach to pedestrians at the roadside in the following task to a greater extent. Police drivers also adopted a more central lane position compared with non-police <b>trained</b> <b>drivers</b> on urban roads and at traffic lights during the following task. Driver group differences in simulated driving performance are discussed with reference to the implications for <b>driver</b> <b>training</b> assessment and skill development...|$|R

40|$|It was {{suggested}} by most researchers that train drivers' workload and alertness levels attribute to train accidents. The main {{objective of this}} study is to determine the significant patterns of mental workload and alertness levels of <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> with respect to the conditions. The data are collected from simulation experiments on 15 professional <b>train</b> <b>drivers.</b> The simulation experiments are performed under three driving conditions (i. e. daytime, rainy daytime and rainy night) using a train driving simulator set. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are collected from six significant points on the body of the subjects. It is found that the mental workload of the <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> tends to be high during rainy night driving condition and sleepiness occurs which is indicative of low vigilance. The beta amplitude increases under rainy night driving condition which may be attributed to viewing difficulties while driving in the dark. The results reveal that there is a significant different between each session (p = 0. 042) especially with the pattern for rainy night driving. It is also observed that there is lower mental workload among the <b>train</b> <b>drivers,</b> which indicates that the <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> are detached from their work...|$|R

40|$|Background: National Transport Commission (NTC) classifies train driving as a {{high-level}} safety critical job. Objective: To assess fitness-for-work among <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> in Yazd, central Iran. Methods: We evaluated 152 <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> for their fitness for duty. The results were then compared with NTC guidelines. Results: 63. 8 % of subjects were fit for duty, 34. 2 % fit subject to review, and 2. 0 % were temporarily unfit. The most common reason for fit subject to review was a Kessler score > 19. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 48. 0 % and 15. 0 %, respectively. The prevalence of dyslipidemia was 69. 7 %, diabetes 10. 0 %, {{impaired fasting glucose}} 36. 0 %, and hypertension was 19. 0 %, respectively. Conclusion: Most studied <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> can continue their work safely. The prevalence of some risk factors such as overweight and dyslipidemia were high among <b>train</b> <b>drivers.</b> This warrants further evaluation and establishment of control programs. </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{questionnaire}} {{surveys are}} an established approach to source attitude data from <b>train</b> <b>drivers.</b> Questionnaire {{studies have been}} carried out to investigate train drivers’ motivations [3], organisational factors in incident reporting [4], influences of praise the drivers receive [5], physiological reactions to accidents [6], and effects of job stress on <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> [7]. Self-administered questionnaires were used by Yum, Roh [8] to explore symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder among Korean <b>train</b> <b>drivers.</b> Further questionnaire study by Jeon, Kim [9] showed that post-traumatic stress, in conjunction with sleep deprivation, is a major factor in human errors among <b>train</b> <b>drivers.</b> Effects of driver’s chronotype on performance and quality of life had been assessed through a series of questionnaires by De Araújo Fernandes Jr, Stetner Antonietti [10]. Design of immediate physical environment, specifically cab environment, and train drivers’ attitudes towards it had been assessed by Stevenson, Coleman [11]. They had used numerous mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative questions combined) questionnaires which asked <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> to assess ergonomics and design changes of the new Tangara train in Australia. More examples of questionnaire used for evaluation of physical design can be found in automotive industry. For instance, attitudes on car design requirements have been studied among ageing demographics of drivers [12].|$|R
