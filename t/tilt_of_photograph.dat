5000|$|On September 14, 2015, Production I.G. {{announced}} a 10-minute virtual reality short film titled Kōkaku Kidōtai - Shin Gekijōban: Virtual Reality Diver based on The New Movie. The short film {{is described as}} an [...] "original story" [...] presented in [...] "360° 3D video" [...] and will play {{through the use of}} the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, releasing worldwide on both the Apple App Store and Google Play {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2015. A three-minute demonstration trailer of Virtual Reality Diver was shown at the 2015 Tokyo Game Show. It was input through a single 2D channel, rather than the 3D input planned for the final product, in order to present it to a larger press through the six-meter hemispherical display. In subsequent press releases, many outlets released <b>tilted</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> the trailer.|$|R
40|$|A {{practical}} example of digital rectification <b>of</b> <b>tilted</b> <b>photographs</b> using a drum scanning micro densitometer and general purpose computers is depicted. The present research covers rectification of projective distorsions, occuring {{when the camera}} axis is not truly vertical, and affine distorsions due to curvature of a drum of a scanner. For this purpose, fundamental mathematical expressions were derived. And some pixel interpolation methods necessary for image reconstruction were compared experimentally. The examples revealed, however, that the film was deformed so complexly {{that they could not}} be corrected sufficiently only by affine transformation. Accuracy of rectification was checked by use <b>of</b> stereo aerial <b>photographs</b> in terms <b>of</b> residual y-parallaxes. The result showed residual y-parallaxes of ± 1 pixel (± 50 μm) and sometimes ± 2 pixels were observed. They seem to be caused mainly by film deformations which have not been eliminated, and their amount seems to exceed the photogrammetric tolerance...|$|R

50|$|The angle {{normally}} has volar <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> 11° to 12°. The {{most common}} fracture pattern usually demonstrates malalignment of this angle and collapse in a dorsal direction. A dorsal <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> 0° (11° - 12° deviation from normal anatomic position) causes a substantial {{risk of developing}} pain and impaired function. After closed reduction, a residual dorsal <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> a maximum of 5° (16° - 17° deviation) {{is regarded as the}} maximal residual angle for a satisfactory result.|$|R

The <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> the neutral sheet from 1971 to 1974 is compared with the cosmic ray intensity at Earth, recorded by the Mt. Washington neutron monitor.

50|$|Obliquity, {{otherwise}} known as tilt, refers to the angle that Earth's axis of rotation makes with a line that is perpendicular to Earth's orbital plane. The current <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> Earth's axis is roughly 23.5°. However, over long periods <b>of</b> time the <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> Earth's axis of rotation changes because of the uneven distribution of mass across the planet and gravitational interactions with the Sun, Moon, and planets. Due to these interactions the <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> Earth's axis of rotation varies between 22.2° and 24.5° on a 41,000 year cycle.|$|R

40|$|In THA, {{anterior}} or posterior <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> {{the pelvis}} changes {{the position of}} the acetabular component on the coronal plane of the body as compared with its anatomic position in the pelvic bone. To understand the occurrence and clinical importance for patients with pelvic tilt on an operating room table in the lateral decubitus position, we studied 436 patients (477 hips) undergoing primary THA using an imageless computer navigation system that measured tilt. We determined the distribution and magnitude <b>of</b> pelvic <b>tilt,</b> especially <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> 10 ° or greater. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>tilt</b> had a range of 25 ° posterior to 20 ° anterior. Twenty-nine of 477 (6. 1 %) hips had zero tilt; 251 (52. 6 %) had <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> 1 ° to 5 °; 120 (25. 2 %) had <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> 6 ° to 9 °; and 77 (16. 1 %) had <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> 10 ° or greater. The conversion factor for acetabular anteversion has been determined by a mathematical formula by Lembeck et al. and was confirmed by us in practice. Measurement <b>of</b> pelvic <b>tilt</b> during the performance of THA will improve the accuracy of cup position, especially allowing anteversion to be measured on the coronal plane...|$|R

40|$|Marine optical {{parameters}} {{required for}} ocean color satellite applications {{need to be}} measured with high accuracy and errors within the permissible limits. These stringent requirements demand careful measurements of optical parameters. Though the free fall radiometer {{is found to be}} a better option for measuring underwater light parameters as it avoids the effects of ship shadow and is easy to operate, the measurements however demand profiling the radiometer vertical in water with minimum tilt. Here we present the results of our observations on the <b>tilts</b> <b>of</b> the radiometer from the measurements in the Arabian Sea. Since there is hardly any study carried-out on the <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> the profiling radiometer, the result of this study will help in the better design of such marine instruments. The <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> the radiometer near the surface of water is attributed to the mode of deployment and environment parameters, while the <b>tilt</b> at depth <b>of</b> water is influenced by the density variations of the water. Here we also demonstrate a method of deploying the instrument that minimize the <b>tilt</b> <b>of</b> the instrument at the surface layer of water...|$|R
