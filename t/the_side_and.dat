5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s Barnes {{was one of}} the senior players in <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> succeeded Roy Paul as captain when Paul retired in 1957. During the 1957–58 season Barnes became the third player to score a hat-trick of {{penalties}} in an English top-flight match, as part of a 6–2 defeat of Everton. At this time Barnes was the club's primary penalty taker, helping him to score 11 goals {{over the course of the}} season. In his later years at Manchester City, Barnes role as captain meant he had become a strong influence on younger players. A particularly notable example was Denis Law, who joined the club in 1960, the pair becoming lifelong friends.|$|E

In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4–7.3mmHg or 0.78–0.98kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar puncture {{is similar to the}} intracranial pressure.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-season break, McManus left City to join Frickley Athletic. Instead, Powell signed Jimmy Gooch from Preston North End as his replacement. Gooch, aged 32, {{was more}} {{experienced}} than Smith and so {{took over as}} first-choice goalkeeper {{at the start of}} the 1953–54 season playing the first 20 games. Smith was called up to the first-team in November for a 1–1 draw with Hartlepools United. He remained in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> played all but two games for the rest of the season, coming back into the team for the final league game of the season against Gateshead as City finished fifth. He kept 11 clean sheets, which included equalling a club best five in consecutive matches as City won a record nine straight games, during which they conceded just one goal.|$|E

5|$|Gould {{was first}} capped for Wales against England {{in the opening}} game of the 1885 Home Nations Championship. He joined his brother Bob in <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> played at fullback, his {{preferred}} position at the time. Played under the captaincy of Newport team-mate Charlie Newman, this was Wales' eighth-ever international and fourth encounter with England. The Welsh lost by a goal and a try to a goal and four tries. Wing Martyn Jordan of London Welsh scored both Welsh tries, with one successfully converted into a goal. Some accounts award the conversion to Charles Taylor, though it is now generally credited to Gould. Gould was selected for the second game of the tournament, an away draw to Scotland, in which both teams played a pair of brothers; George and Richard Maitland for Scotland, and Arthur and Bob Gould for Wales.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{spent much}} of the 1934 season troubled by sore throats and back {{problems}} which restricted his appearances for Gloucestershire. His form for his county was good and in all first-class matches, he scored 2,366 runs (average 76.32), although he took fewer wickets at a higher average than the previous season. Awarded a benefit match, which raised just over £2,600, Hammond was idolised by the press and public for his achievements. In Tests, it was a different story; according to Wisden, he failed badly. England lost the Ashes, 2–1, in a series overshadowed at times by the Bodyline controversy. Hammond played in all five Tests against Australia but his top score was 43; he scored 162 runs at an average of 20.25, and took five wickets at an average of 72.80. Although the press and selectors supported him, there were some suggestions he should be left out of <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> Hammond felt under great pressure.|$|E

5|$|He {{remained}} with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an ageing squad had entered a decline that culminated with their relegation to the Third Division South in the 1930–31 season, being released {{at the end}} of the season. During his time at Ninian Park, he made over 500 appearances for the club, winning four Welsh Cup titles, the FA Cup and the FA Charity Shield in a 19-year association with <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> is regarded as one of the clubs all-time greats. A statue of Keenor, lifting the FA Cup, was erected outside Cardiff's new stadium, the Cardiff City Stadium, in November 2012 following a public fundraising campaign.|$|E
5|$|He {{took part}} in a fourth round League Cup {{hammering}} of Stoke City, scoring a hat-trick in an 8–0 victory, which was second only to the club's biggest ever win in 1986 – a 10–0 defeat of Fulham. In the League Cup final against Birmingham City, the club's first cup final since 1996, he captained <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> scored in the 30th minute.

5|$|In 1995, Burns {{was given}} a {{prolonged}} run in the Warwickshire team, playing both first-class and one-day cricket throughout April and May; he failed to impress during these matches, recording a highest score of 35 and averaging well under twenty in both forms of the game. He {{spent the rest of}} the season playing for the second team. Some strong performances for the seconds at the start of the 1996 season, including scores of 77 and 81 not out in a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club Young Cricketers, and a finger injury suffered by Piper, saw him regain a place in the Warwickshire first team in June. He remained in the first team for the rest of the season, playing as a specialist batsman when Piper returned to <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> scored three half-centuries in first-class cricket, including his highest first-class score to that point, 81 runs scored against Nottinghamshire, during a match in which he also remained 65 not out in the second innings.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{the club}} was {{purchased}} by Lebanese businessman Sam Hammam, who invested money into <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> saw them rise from the fourth tier to the second tier in just three seasons. Although Hammam left the club in 2006, they continued their progress, reaching the Football League Championship play-offs for three consecutive seasons between 2009 and 2012, suffering defeat on all three occasions. The following season, under the ownership of new owner Vincent Tan, they finished first in the Championship, winning promotion back into the top tier {{for the first time}} since 1962.

5|$|In March 1967, Dougan {{dropped into}} the Second Division after being signed by Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Ronnie Allen for a £50,000 fee.

He spent the summer of 1967 in the United States playing for the Los Angeles Wolves in the United Soccer Association, scoring three goals in eleven games to help Wolves to win the West Division title and then captained <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> scored a goal as they beat the Washington Whips 6–5 in the USA Final at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.|$|E

5|$|Males {{engage in}} mate {{guarding}} {{during the period}} females are most vulnerable to successful extra pair copulations. They usually stay close to their social mate, singing slowly on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> following the mate while she is foraging or searching for a nesting site. The guarding behavior, though, may conflict with males’ pursuit of extra-pair fertilizations. It {{is not yet clear}} to what extent a male will prefer mate guarding over extra-pair fertilizations. Male retention studies have shown that removal of a male increases the chance of extra-pair offspring in the brood, suggesting that mate guarding reduces extra-pair fertilization attempts. The extra-pair fertilization rate nonetheless cannot be eliminated even if males are allowed to stay near their social mates during fertility risk period. Several hypotheses try to explain this phenomenon: females may be able to manage extra-pair mating even while its social mate is guarding it, or females may reject extra-pair copulation attempts by other males in the absence of male guarding.|$|E
5|$|Nests {{built in}} the open are large and untidy domed structures, built of dry grass, twigs, and other plant {{material}}s. Any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be worked into the nest. In cavity nests, the hole is filled with a shapeless mass of grass {{with a cup of}} soft material containing the eggs on the inside. When the disused domed nests of weavers are used, they are simply given a soft lining. The nest entrance is on <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> is sometimes extended into a short funnel. The male and the female construct the nest together, keeping close when finding material and weaving it together. The inside linings of Cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as wolbossie (Helichrysum pumilio), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and camphor (Cinnamomum). This consistent use of aromatics suggests that they have some purpose such as protection against parasites.|$|E
