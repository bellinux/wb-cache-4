While being interviewed on NPR about the book, John Krakauer stated [...] "I don't mean to single out Missoula: Its rape rate is a little less than the national average; I <b>think</b> <b>its</b> problems with dealing with rape are pretty depressingly typical".|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1855, {{the letters}} of the word [...] "Dollars" [...] were enlarged, {{following}} complaints from the public. The same year, coinage began at the San Francisco Mint, where 6,600were struck as opposed to 50,555at Philadelphia. [...] Mintages at Philadelphia declined {{for the remainder of the}} decade, to 7,036by 1860; pieces were also struck at San Francisco in 1856, 1857, and 1860. [...] In 1859, early numismatic writer Montroville W. Dickeson wrote of the three-dollar piece, [...] "it is very unpopular, being frequently mistaken for a quarter eagle, and often counted as a five-dollar piece. [...] It is exceedingly annoying to that portion of the human family whose vision is dependent on artificial aid, and we <b>think</b> <b>its</b> retirement would meet with public approbation." [...] Perhaps a dozen contemporary numismatists collected three-dollar pieces; those who were serious ordered proof coins from the Mint. [...] Coins in this condition became easier to obtain from Philadelphia as officials responded to the rise in interest in coin collecting which followed the introduction of the Flying Eagle cent in 1857.|$|E
500|$|Israel entered one golfer {{into the}} Olympic tournament. Laetitia Beck (world no. 237) {{qualified}} directly {{among the top}} 60 eligible players for the women's event based on the International Golf Federation (IGF) World Rankings as of 11 July 2016. This {{marked the first time}} Israel sent a golfer to the Olympics. Due to Israel's inexperience representing golf athletes, Beck was required to procure all of her equipment to prepare for Rio, such as her uniform and hats. Israel's Olympic committee reimbursed her for the equipment. [...] On the topic of representing Israel at the Olympics, Beck said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>its</b> because of what my grandparents had to go through, not just my grandparents but everyone during World War II, all the Jewish people during World War II and the holocaust, that obviously brings me anger, but i think what i'm trying to do is bring the anger and try to do something meaningful." [...] Beck finished tied for 31st with a score of two over par. Her best round was the third round, where she was tied for 13th place.|$|E

500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I <b>think</b> <b>its</b> because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E

So this over-concentration of coloureds in the Western Cape is not working for them.

He mentions he is working with two ghost hunters, and says [...] "I think whatever they were hunting has found them. I <b>think</b> <b>its</b> found me too."

2500|$|He {{wrote that}} many of his critics mischaracterize the {{argument}} he puts forth in his essay {{in a manner similar to}} what Rosenfeld wrote was an erroneous portrayal in The New York Times. He explains: [...] "Since I never once referred to 'liberalism', called no one a 'Jewish anti-Semite' or 'self-hating Jew', said nothing about Democrats or the Iraq war, and made no attempt to 'silence' anyone, this Kafkaesque bill of indictment makes me wonder what is at play here – illiteracy, dishonesty, or worse? As Bret Stephens recently put it, 'How does joining a debate become an effort to suppress it?' Rosenfeld denied it, stating that, [...] "Nobody's being silenced....

2500|$|Katie Holmes portrays Kennedy in the 2011 miniseries The Kennedys, set {{during the}} Kennedy {{presidency}} and its 2017 sequel , focusing {{on her life}} after 1968. Mary McNamara and Hank Stuever regarded Holmes' performance with neutrality in their reviews of The Kennedys while Hadley Freeman called her [...] "bloodless" [...] in the role. Holmes stated reprising the role was a [...] "bigger challenge" [...] for having to act through later periods of Kennedy's life. When asked of the concurrent Jackie film, Holmes said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>its</b> really exciting. It's just {{is a testament to}} how amazing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was and how much she meant to our country." [...] Holmes also stated both should be watched due to covering different periods of Jacqueline's life. [...] In The Kennedys: After Camelot, Holmes' performance was viewed favorably by Daniel Feinberg and Allison Keane while Kristi Turnquist panned her.|$|E
2500|$|Orci {{described}} the film's theme as [...] "being away from home", with the Autobots contemplating living on Earth as they cannot restore Cybertron, while Sam goes to college. He wanted the focus between the robots and humans [...] "much more evenly balanced", [...] "the stakes [...] be higher", and {{more focused on}} the science fiction elements. Orci added he wanted to [...] "modulate" [...] the humor more, and felt he managed the more [...] "outrageous" [...] jokes by balancing them with a more serious plot approach to the Transformers mythology. Bay concurred {{that he wanted to}} please fans by making the tone darker, and that [...] "mums will <b>think</b> <b>its</b> safe enough to bring the kids back out to the movies." [...] Two elements were added late into the film: the Autobot Jolt—as General Motors wanted to advertise the Chevrolet Volt—and the railgun that kills Devastator, a new acquisition by the U.S. Military.|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy spoke on several episode topics. About {{the timing of}} the episode's airdate with Hurricane Sandy's landfall, he said, [...] "It's very strange and somewhat sad. We wrote this script I think in June. We based it on several big 50s and 60s Nor'easters that hit the East Coast, obviously not as severe as the one that just hit. It's very eerie." [...] About Jessica Lange's performance, he said, [...] "She's never really played a drunkard in her career so her doing this big drunk monologue that has both comedy and tragedy sometimes within a single minute and I think she just killed it. I <b>think</b> <b>its</b> really brilliant and tragic and it contains my favorite line she's ever said, which is 'Charles Laughton is an enormous whoopsie.' I thought that was really quite brilliant. Jessica Lange talking about Charles Laughton is just great. I know it was very challenging and she had a great time doing it. It was just a master class in acting." ...|$|E

And I'm glad Bill got quiet for those 40 minutes, until he finished off these 12 steps and I believe they have only been changed by about one word. Bill said at the end of this talk [...] "Who invented AA?, It was God almighty that invented AA, but this is the story of how we learned to be Free." [...] And he closed by saying [...] "God grant that AA and the program of recovery, and unity, and service be a story that continues into the future as long as God needs it."
