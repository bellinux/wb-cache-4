These forecast errors induce persistence in identified monetary policy shocks and cause the econometrician to overstate the variation in <b>Treasury</b> <b>risk</b> premia.

40|$|OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY Objective of {{the study}} is to develop and analyze an {{in-house}} credit assessment tool for a large Finnish industrial company. Identification of proactive non-financial and market information measures is considered central. This study proposes a new credit risk management framework that aims to link risk management to corporate strategy within a balanced scorecard (BSC) type of approach. The credit risk measurement technique will base on expert system. METHODOLOGY AND DATA The methodology is a constructive case study. The knowledge acquisition is based on various qualitative methods including theme interviews with experts from academic, banking and credit rating field, discussions and interviews with case company’s CFO, head of <b>treasury</b> <b>risk</b> management, credit risk managers and traders and, finally, exploiting the company’s internal written material. RESULTS The proposed scorecard for credit risk assessment was found efficient in terms of providing a comprehensive framework for credit risk measurement. This finding implied a linkage to the original BSC’s financial perspective and thus, the connection between risk management and strategy could be identified. The proposed credit risk assessment tool includes total of 25 measures where six financial, 15 non-financial and four market information measures were considered significant. The results obtained by analyzing 31 companies with the credit risk assessment tool suggested the constructed tool provided reasonably similar scores compared to external ratings...|$|E
40|$|Accounting {{information}} plays a {{key role}} in the foundation process of public sector decisions. Financing budget deficits, <b>treasury</b> <b>risk</b> identification (availability risk), formation of tax claims, foundation of financial sustainability for public investment projects are just some examples of using accounting information in decision-making process of credit accountant. How can we use and process accounting information in the foundation of public investment projects? We will try to answer this question in the content of this paper. The revenues and expenses, as accounting information, are necessary for determining the actual financial net value and/or the actual economic net value. These indicators have decisive information power in accepting and / or rejecting public investment projects. In the current economic context, the importance of investments is major for at least three reasons: the first one is a highly circulated reason in the last 20 years: the increase of technology, the alignment of the technology used in the alignment of competitors from the European market and even worldwide; the second reason is linked to the support of economic growth in crisis conditions through a policy of major investments especially in the infrastructure sector; the third reason, which derives from the second one, is that of post-accession grant funds available for investment both in private and public sectors. The importance given to public investments is also revealed by the authorities' approach to establishing key areas of interventions under grant programs (with programs designed to both public and private environment) designed exclusively to carry out public investment programs (for example the POS Transport). In this context, the present research is intended to be a documentary of the role that accounting information plays in decision-making process that precedes the development of an investment, especially as most major investments are made in the public domain...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This {{analysis}} {{seeks to}} deal with the emerging economies and to reveal that, if the fiscal authority is accountable with a policy that stabilizes the public debt/GDP ratio, the consequence is a low <b>Treasury</b> bond <b>risk</b> premium. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the purpose of this paper, a theoretical model is developed and empirical evidence through an autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) model, taking into account the Brazilian experience, is made. Findings – The findings denote that domestic variables are responsible for determining the risk premium. Moreover, a correct management of the public debt and the use of primary surplus targets make for a good strategy for promoting a fall in the <b>Treasury</b> bond <b>risk</b> premium. Practical implications – Primary surplus and public debt/GDP ratio can be used as important tools for mitigating the <b>Treasury</b> bond <b>risk</b> premium. Originality/value – The results of the paper give some new insights about the management of fiscal policy for developing countries.
