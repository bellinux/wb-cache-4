5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> to the electrical conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E

Moreover, the thermal transport in the BNNRs is anisotropic.

5|$|Diamond's high <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> {{is used by}} jewelers and gemologists who may employ an {{electronic}} thermal probe to distinguish diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds. However, older probes will be fooled by moissanite, a crystalline mineral form of silicon carbide introduced in 1998 as an alternative to diamonds, which has a similar <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity.</b>|$|E

5|$|Most {{materials}} with high <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity,</b> but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E
40|$|Equilibrium {{molecular}} dynamics (EMD) simulations {{along with the}} Green-Kubo formula {{have been widely used}} to calculate lattice <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities.</b> Previous studies, however, focused primarily on the calculated <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities,</b> with the uncertainty of the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> remaining poorly understood. In this paper, we study the quantification of the uncertainty by using solid argon, silicon, and germanium as model material systems, and examine the origin of the observed uncertainty. We find that the uncertainty increases with the upper limit of the correlation time, t_corre, UL, and decreases with the total simulation time, t_total, whereas the velocity initialization seed, simulation domain size, temperature, and type of material have minimal effects. The relative uncertainties of the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> for solid argon, silicon, and germanium under different simulation conditions all follow a similar trend, which can be fit with a "universal" square-root relation, as σ_k_x/k_x, ave = 2 (t_total/t_corre, UL) ^- 0. 5. We have also conducted statistical analysis of the EMD-predicted <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> and derived a formula that correlates the relative error bound (Q), confidence level (P), t_corre, UL, t_total, and number of independent simulations (N). We recommend choosing t_corre, UL to be 5 - 10 times the effective phonon relaxation time, τ_eff, and choosing t_total and N based on the desired relative error bound and confidence level. This study provides new insights into understanding the uncertainty of EMD-predicted <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities.</b> It also provides a guideline for running EMD simulations to achieve a desired relative error bound with a desired confidence level and for reporting EMD-predicted <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities.</b> Comment: Main article: 14 pages, 11 figures; Supplemental information: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|Rare-earth pyrochlores, {{commonly}} exhibiting anomalously low lattice <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities,</b> {{are considered}} as promising topcoat materials for thermal barrier coatings. However the structural origin underlying their low <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the phonon properties of {{two groups of}} RE pyrochlores, Ln 2 Zr 2 O 7 (Ln = La, Nd, Sm, Gd) and Gd 2 T 2 O 7 (T = Zr, Hf, Sn, Pb) employing density functional theory and quasi harmonic approximation. Through the relaxation time approximation (RTA) with Debye model, the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> of those RE pyrochlores were predicted, showing good agreement with experimental measurements. The low <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> of RE pyrochlores were shown to largely come from the interference between the low-lying optical branches and acoustic branches. The structural origin underlying the low-lying optical branches was then clarified and the competition between scattering processes in transverse and longitude acoustic branches was discussed.

5|$|Unlike most {{electrical}} insulators, diamond {{is a good}} {{conductor of}} heat because of the strong covalent bonding and low phonon scattering. <b>Thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of natural diamond {{was measured to be}} about 2200W/(m·K), which is five times more than copper. Monocrystalline synthetic diamond enriched to 99.9% the isotope 12C has the highest <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> of any known solid at room temperature: 3320W/(m·K). Because diamond has such high thermal conductance it is already used in semiconductor manufacture to prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating. At lower temperatures conductivity becomes even better, and reaches 41000W/(m·K) at 104K (12C-enriched diamond).|$|E

40|$|The temperature-dependent <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> of {{one-dimensional}} nonlinear Klein-Gordon lattices {{with soft}} on-site potential (soft-KG) {{have been investigated}} systematically. Similar to the previously studied hard-KG lattices, the existence of renormalized phonons has also been confirmed in soft-KG lattices. In particular, the temperature-dependence of renormalized phonon frequency predicted by a classical field theory has been verified by detailed numerical simulations. However, the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> of soft-KG lattices exhibit opposite trend in the temperature dependence {{in comparison with the}} hard-KG lattices. The interesting thing is that both the temperature-dependent <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> of soft- and hard-KG lattices can be interpreted in the same framework of effective phonon theory. According to the effective phonon theory, the exponents of the power-law dependence of the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> as the function of temperature are only determined by the exponents of the soft or hard on-site potentials. These theoretical predictions have been consistently verified very well by extensive numerical simulations. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

5|$|Ceramic {{industry}} consumes {{a significant}} amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefﬁcient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivity</b> is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.|$|E

The relationship between microstructure and <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> and elastic stiffness of CNTs is quantitatively characterized.

40|$|In {{contrary}} to other 1 D momentum-conserving lattices {{such as the}} Fermi-Pasta-Ulam β (FPU-β) lattice, the 1 D coupled rotator lattice is a notable exception which conserves total momentum while exhibits normal heat conduction behavior. The temperature behavior of the <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> of 1 D coupled rotator lattice had been studied in previous works trying to reveal the underlying physical mechanism for normal heat conduction. However, two different temperature behaviors of <b>thermal</b> <b>conductivities</b> have been claimed for the same coupled rotator lattice.

Our results also support the claim that there is no phase transition for 1 D coupled rotator lattice. We also give some discussion about the similarity of diffusion behaviors between the 1 D coupled rotator lattice and the single kicked rotator also called the Chirikov standard map.
