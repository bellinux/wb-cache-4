5|$|Again {{waiting until}} late afternoon, the Allies took the {{opportunity}} to attack a patrol of Cilician ships, destroying <b>them,</b> <b>before</b> retreating as night fell. These ships were possibly survivors of the wrecked detachment sent around Euboea, or were perhaps anchored in an isolated harbour.|$|E
5|$|Pickford {{left the}} Biograph Company {{at the end}} of 1910. The last films that she made for <b>them</b> <b>before</b> her {{departure}} were released in early 1911. All of these five films are one-reelers.|$|E
5|$|A. r. obscura, {{described}} by Donald R. Dickey and Adriaan van Rossem in 1923, {{is found in}} the Channel Islands of California on Santa Cruz, Anacapa, and formerly on Santa Catalina. While the Santa Catalina population has not been observed since 1863, the subspecies seems to have colonized Anacapa Island. No records exist of <b>them</b> <b>before</b> 1940. This subspecies is similar to A. r. canescens but is darker.|$|E

5|$|As of 2003 {{there were}} still 138 Allied men with no known grave in the area, and they are commemorated at the Groesbeek Memorial. However, {{evidence}} of the battle is often discovered even today, and the bodies of Allied servicemen are reinterred at the Airborne Cemetery. When found, bodies are exhumed and Dutch Graves Registration staff attempt to identify <b>them</b> <b>before</b> they are reburied. One soldier of the Border Regiment was discovered and reburied in the cemetery in 2005 and another who had previously been unidentified was reburied in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Both ships saw limited action during World War I, {{largely a}} result of the {{cautious}} strategies employed by the Regia Marina and its opponent, the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Nino Bixio was involved in the pursuit of a group of Austro-Hungarian raiders in December 1915, but did not engage <b>them</b> <b>before</b> they escaped. Marsala briefly battled Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the Battle of the Otranto Straits in May 1917. Both ships were sold for scrapping in the late 1920s, the victims of very tight naval budgets and their own poor performance.|$|E

When everyone else arrives, Ellen balks at telling them but Peter outs her. Ellen confirms that it's true and her friends are all supportive of her, although her friend Paige is hesitant.|$|E

5|$|Historically, the British and Irish Lions were {{intended}} as a representative team of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland however, when the Irish Free State {{broke away from the}} United Kingdom it was deemed inappropriate for the British and Irish Lions to use the British national anthem, God Save the Queen. As a result of this, the British and Irish Lions did not have an anthem to represent <b>them</b> <b>before</b> any of their matches until 2005.|$|E
5|$|In a post-credits scene {{after the}} main game's ending, Zobek is seen alive during modern times, and has {{uncovered}} Gabriel {{living as a}} vampire called Dracula. Zobek mentions the acolytes of Satan are preparing for his return and that they must stop him before he takes revenge on both of <b>them.</b> <b>Before</b> Gabriel disappears, Zobek tells him he will free him of his immortality if he helps him.|$|E
5|$|Mark Livolsi realized, as McKenna had on {{the other}} end, that the film worked best when it focused on the Andrea-Miranda storyline. Accordingly, he cut a number of {{primarily}} transitional scenes, such as Andrea's job interview and the Runway staff's trip to Holt's studio. He also took out a scene early on where Miranda complimented Andrea. Upon reviewing them for the DVD, Frankel admitted he hadn't even seen <b>them</b> <b>before,</b> since Livolsi didn't include them in any prints he sent to the director.|$|E

5|$|More than 1,000schools {{and churches}} were {{converted}} to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of <b>them</b> <b>before</b> the storm's arrival. The country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4emergency health kits and 1,000water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stock in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed, although damage to their airport ultimately prevented their distribution.|$|E
5|$|Pakistan {{announced}} a preliminary squad on 10 January 2007, {{and the final}} 15-man squad on 13 February 2007. Both Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif were included, despite their ongoing doping case, where the Pakistan Cricket Board had first banned <b>them</b> <b>before</b> a tribunal reprieved the two. In a twist of fate, both players were replaced by Mohammad Sami and Yasir Arafat on 1 March due to knee and elbow injuries respectively.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the first}} {{settlers}} lived in caves dug {{out of the river}} bank, but the city grew with construction of homes, churches, and wharves. The new landowners did not share Penn's vision of a non-congested city. Most people bought land along the Delaware River instead of spreading westward towards the Schuylkill. The lots they bought were subdivided and resold with smaller streets constructed between <b>them.</b> <b>Before</b> 1704, few people lived west of Fourth Street.|$|E

5|$|The {{light alloy}} split flaps at the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing were also pneumatically operated via a finger lever on the instrument panel. Only two positions were available; fully up or fully down (85°). The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing, and the pilot was to retract <b>them</b> <b>before</b> taxiing.|$|E
5|$|The {{other three}} raider {{companies}} arrived at Aola on 8 November. On 9 November, they moved by landing craft to Tasimboko and, on 10 November marched overland—guided by native scouts—toward Binu.

5|$|The {{video is}} {{split into two}} {{sections}} and switches between them throughout. The first has band members Homme, Nick Oliveri and Mark Lanegan driving a truck at night, whereupon they hit a deer. When they get out to inspect, the deer proceeds to attack <b>them</b> <b>before</b> going on a rampage in their International Harvester Scout. The second section of the video is of Homme, Oliveri, Troy Van Leeuwen and Dave Grohl performing the song against a black background.|$|E

5|$|They are {{captured}} by the gangster Bully Bull the anthropomorphised bulldog, and although they escape once, he recaptures <b>them,</b> <b>before</b> Bluebell kicks him so hard that he flies {{into the air and}} lands in Santa Barbara, where he is found and imprisoned by a sheriff. While Popol, Virginia, and Bluebell manage to make their way across a deep ravine, Bully Bull escapes from jail, and attacks Popol on a steep face. All of them fall down the cliff, but are rescued by firemen with a trampoline, and Bully Bull is once more apprehended.|$|E
5|$|This {{time they}} come {{too close to}} being caught having public sex, and while they manage to escape, they have to flee through Springfield in the nude. In the end, the two are seen in a {{football}} stadium, and a naked photograph of Homer and Marge appears in the local newspaper. The next day, Bart and Lisa see the picture and their parents begin to explain sex to <b>them.</b> <b>Before</b> they go into detail, however, they decide {{to go back to}} the miniature golf course.|$|E
5|$|To avoid a narrator, {{the serial}} delegates the novel's first ironic {{sentence}} to Elizabeth {{in an early}} scene. The adaptation opens {{with a view of}} Darcy's and Bingley's horses as they race across a field toward the Netherfield estate, expressing vitality; Elizabeth watches <b>them</b> <b>before</b> breaking into a run. While the novel indicates Elizabeth's independence and energy in her three-mile trek to Netherfield, the adaptation of this scene also shows her rebelliousness and love of nature.|$|E
