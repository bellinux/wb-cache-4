It's all on springs so it moves around like a train carriage – and I suffer from very bad motion sickness so on the first day I threw up. I had to literally run off the set half way through a scene and throw up in the loo. So it was quite an auspicious start." [...] Hesmondhalgh also commented on <b>the</b> <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> the filming, saying that it was the tightest location used for Inside No. 9 since [...] "Sardines", the first episode of the first series.

500|$|Byrnes {{found that}} Departures used {{the symbol of}} the cherry blossom, a flower which blooms after the winter only to wither soon afterwards, to {{represent}} the transience of life; through this understanding, he wrote, Japanese people attempt to define their own existence. Natural symbols are further presented through the changing seasons, which [...] "suggest delicate emotional changes" [...] in the characters, as well as the letter-stones, which represent [...] "love, communication, [...] the baton being passed from generation to generation". The film's settings are used to convey various sensations, including the solitude of the countryside and <b>the</b> <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> the public bath house. The colour white, manifested through snow, chrysanthemums, and other objects, is prominent in the film; Okuyama suggests that this, together with the classical music and ritualized hand gestures, represents the sacredness and purity of the death ceremonies.|$|E

500|$|The six {{episodes of}} the second series derived {{inspiration}} {{from a variety of}} sources.

[...] "The 12 Days of Christine" [...] follows a woman over the course of 12 years, with scenes displaying key moments in her life.

[...] "Cold Comfort" [...] began {{with the idea of a}} call centre, and was filmed in the style of a CCTV feed. With [...] "Nana's Party", the writers aimed for a feeling of suburban darkness, reminiscent of the work of Alan Ayckbourn. [...] "Séance Time" [...] began with the idea of a séance, an idea the writers had wanted to explore for some time.|$|E
500|$|La Rivière noted <b>the</b> <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> {{the series}} and the {{predominantly}} male voice cast and characters, suggesting that Joe 90 is [...] "very much a Boy's Own adventure." [...] Out of the 30 episodes, only ten feature appearances from female characters, a fact which La Rivière attributes {{to the increased}} demands on Century 21 for its feature film productions, Thunderbird 6 and Doppelgänger. Peel suggests that the female absence leaves Joe 90, with many other Anderson productions, inferior to previous Supermarionation effort Thunderbirds, in which the character of Lady Penelope has a primary role in several episodes. Grouping Joe 90 with the earlier Supercar and the subsequent The Secret Service, Peel concludes, [...] "It is hardly coincidental that these {{tend to be the}} least-loved of [...] series; he had, after all, ignored half of his potential audience." [...] For Peel, this return of the [...] "standard Anderson sexism" [...] is only one aspect of deterioration between Joe 90 and previous productions.

500|$|The sex scene {{remained}} controversial {{for some}} years after the film's release. The BBC cut it altogether when Don't Look Now premiered on UK television, causing a flood of complaints from viewers. <b>The</b> <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> the scene led to rumours that Christie and Sutherland had unsimulated sex which have persisted for years, and that outtakes from the scene were doing the rounds in screening rooms. Michael Deeley, who oversaw the film's UK distribution, claimed on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs that Warren Beatty had flown to London and demanded that the sex scene—featuring then girlfriend Julie Christie—be cut from the film. The rumours were seemingly confirmed in 2011 by former Variety editor Peter Bart, who was a Paramount executive at the time. In his book, [...] Infamous Players: A Tale of Movies, the Mob, (and Sex), Bart says he was on set {{on the day the}} scene was filmed and could clearly see Sutherland's penis [...] "moving in and out of" [...] Christie. Bart also reiterated Warren Beatty's discontent, noting that Beatty had contacted him to complain about what he perceived to be Roeg's exploitation of Christie, and insisting that he be allowed to help edit the film. Sutherland subsequently issued a statement through his publicist stating that the claims were not true, and that Bart did not witness the scene being filmed. Peter Katz, the film's producer, corroborated Sutherland's account that the sex was entirely simulated.|$|E
500|$|Although {{some of the}} {{original}} founders had already outlined plans for an institution like UCSC {{as early as the}} 1930s, the opportunity to realize their vision did not present itself until the City of Santa Cruz made a bid to the University of California Regents in the mid-1950s to build a campus just outside town, {{in the foothills of the}} Santa Cruz Mountains. The Santa Cruz site was selected over a competing proposal to build the campus closer to the population center of San Jose. Santa Cruz was selected for the beauty, rather than the practicality, of its location, however, and its remoteness led to the decision to develop a residential college system that would house most of the students on-campus. The formal design process of the Santa Cruz campus began in the late 1950s, culminating in the Long Range Development Plan of 1963. Construction had started by 1964, and the university was able to accommodate its first students (albeit living in trailers on what is now the East Field athletic area) in 1965. The campus was intended to be a showcase for contemporary architecture, progressive teaching methods, and undergraduate research. According to founding chancellor Dean McHenry, the purpose of the distributed college system was to combine the benefits of a major research university with <b>the</b> <b>intimacy</b> <b>of</b> a smaller college. UC President Clark Kerr shared a passion with former Stanford roommate McHenry to build a university modeled as [...] "several Swarthmores" [...] (i.e., small liberal arts colleges) in close proximity to each other. Roads on campus were named after UC Regents who voted in favor of building the campus.|$|E
