Peter Hingley, the researcher who solved the mystery of who designed the cards a hundred and seventy years after their publication, considered them amongst the most attractive star chart cards of the many produced in the early 19th century.|$|E
5000|$|When Pythagoras {{arrived at}} Croton, his first {{advice to the}} Crotoniates was to build a shrine to <b>the</b> <b>Muses</b> at <b>the</b> center of the city, to promote civic harmony and learning. Local cults of <b>the</b> <b>Muses</b> often became {{associated}} with springs or with fountains. <b>The</b> <b>Muses</b> themselves were sometimes called Aganippids because of their association with a fountain called Aganippe. Other fountains, Hippocrene and Pirene, were also important locations associated with <b>the</b> <b>Muses.</b> Some sources occasionally referred to <b>the</b> <b>Muses</b> as [...] "Corycides" [...] (or [...] "Corycian nymphs") after a cave on Mount Parnassos, called the Corycian Cave. <b>The</b> <b>Muses</b> were venerated especially in Boeotia, in the Valley of <b>the</b> <b>Muses</b> near Helicon, and in Delphi and the Parnassus, where Apollo became known as Mousagetes ("Muse-leader") after the sites were rededicated to his cult.|$|R

They anointed Liana and Alexa as princesses of music, promoted Melody as <b>the</b> third <b>muse</b> and give Jeremy and Ian electric guitars. <b>The</b> <b>muses</b> offer Liana and Alexa {{to stay at}} the castle but they want to go home instead, so <b>the</b> <b>muses</b> give them flower seeds and send them on their way.|$|R
5|$|Chopin's tombstone, {{featuring}} <b>the</b> <b>muse</b> of music, Euterpe, weeping over {{a broken}} lyre, {{was designed and}} sculpted by Clésinger. The expenses of the funeral and monument, amounting to 5,000 francs, were covered by Jane Stirling, who also paid {{for the return of}} the composer's sister Ludwika to Warsaw. Ludwika took Chopin's heart in an urn, preserved in alcohol, back to Poland in 1850. She also took a collection of two hundred letters from Sand to Chopin; after 1851 these were returned to Sand, who seems to have destroyed them.|$|E
5|$|Middlesex {{has several}} allusions to Greek {{classical}} myths; for example, the protagonist {{is named after}} Calliope, <b>the</b> <b>muse</b> of heroic poetry. Eugenides was partly inspired by the explorations of hermaphrodism in Greek myths to write the novel about an intersex man. In Middlesex, Cal acts out the story of Hermaphroditus, the Greek deity of bisexuality and effeminacy, while eking out a living in San Francisco. While narrating, Cal enters his ancestors' thoughts and empathizes with them, an ability possessed by Hermaphroditus. The protagonist compared himself to another mythical figureTiresias, the blind prophet of Thebes; the omniscient seer lived sevenyears as a woman because of a curse.|$|E
5|$|By 1846 Honoré de Balzac had {{achieved}} tremendous fame as a writer, but his finances and health were deteriorating rapidly. After writing {{a series of}} potboiler novels in the 1820s, he published his first book under his own name, Les Chouans ("The Chouans"), in 1829. He followed this with dozens of well-received novels and stories, including La Peau de chagrin ("The Magic Skin"), in 1831, Le Père Goriot ("Father Goriot") in 1835, and the two-volume Illusions perdues ("Lost Illusions"), in 1837 and 1839. Because of his lavish lifestyle and penchant for financial speculation, however, {{he spent most of}} his life trying to repay a variety of debts. He wrote tirelessly, driven as much by economic necessity as by <b>the</b> <b>muse</b> and black coffee. This regimen of constant work exhausted his body and brought reprimands from his doctor.|$|E
50|$|According to a myth from Ovid's Metamorphoses—alluding to the {{connection}} of <b>the</b> <b>Muses</b> with Pieria—King Pierus, king of Macedon, had nine daughters he named after <b>the</b> nine <b>Muses,</b> believing that their skills were a great match to <b>the</b> <b>Muses.</b> He thus challenged <b>the</b> <b>Muses</b> to a match, resulting in his daughters, the Pierides, being turned into chattering magpies for their presumption.|$|R

25|$|MuseScore was {{originally}} {{created as a}} fork of <b>the</b> <b>MusE</b> sequencer's codebase.

Since then, MuseScore has been under constant active development.|$|E

25|$|After his death, Trollope's Autobiography {{appeared}} {{and was a}} best-seller in London. Trollope's downfall {{in the eyes of}} the critics stemmed largely from this volume. Even during his writing career, reviewers tended increasingly to shake their heads over his prodigious output, but when Trollope revealed that he strictly adhered to a daily writing quota, he confirmed his critics' worst fears. <b>The</b> <b>Muse,</b> in their view, might prove immensely prolific, but she would never ever follow a schedule. Furthermore, Trollope admitted that he wrote for money; at the same time he called the disdain of money false and foolish. <b>The</b> <b>Muse,</b> claimed the critics, should not be aware of money.|$|E
