5|$|During Peter's {{recount of}} his job search to Brian, the talent show {{flashback}} mirrors the setting from <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> and makes {{a reference to the}} characters of the film, the von Trapp family.|$|E
5|$|The film's opening shot — a bird's eye view of Baltimore that {{eventually}} descends from the clouds to ground level — {{is a combination}} of the opening shots of West Side Story and <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music.</b>|$|E
5|$|How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? is a British reality {{television}} {{talent show}} that documented {{the search for}} an undiscovered musical theatre performer {{to play the role}} of Maria von Trapp in the 2006 Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Ian stage production of <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild {{published}} {{a list of}} the best-edited films of all time. Two films edited by Reynolds appeared on the list. The Godfather was ranked sixth, and <b>The</b> <b>Sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> was sixty-fourth.|$|R
5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the final, the three finalists and Lloyd Webber visited Salzburg to visit some of the {{locations}} made famous by <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music,</b> including Leopoldskron Palace and Nonnberg Abbey, to give the finalists a chance to understand the real Maria von Trapp.|$|E
5|$|When it was re-released in 1947, {{it earned}} an {{impressive}} $5 million rental in the United States and Canada, {{and was one}} of the top ten releases of the year. Successful re-releases in 1954 and 1961 enabled it to retain its position as the industry's top earner, despite strong challenges from more recent films such as Ben-Hur, but it was finally overtaken by <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> in 1966. The 1967 reissue was unusual in that MGM opted to roadshow it, a decision that turned it into the most successful re-release in the history of the industry. It generated a box-office gross of $68 million, making it MGM's most lucrative picture after Doctor Zhivago from the latter half of the decade. MGM earned a rental of $41 million from the release, with the U.S. and Canadian share amounting to over $30 million, placing it second only to The Graduate for that year. Including its $6.7 million rental from the 1961 reissue, it was the fourth highest-earner of the decade in the North American market, with only <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music,</b> The Graduate and Doctor Zhivago making more for their distributors. A further re-release in 1971 allowed it to briefly recapture the record from <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music,</b> bringing its total worldwide gross rental to about $116 million by the end of 1971—more than trebling its earnings from its initial release—before losing the record again the following year to The Godfather.|$|E
5|$|The {{lead role}} of Maria von Trapp {{in the new}} West End {{production}} of <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music,</b> to be staged by Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Ian, was to be played by American actress Scarlett Johansson. Negotiations fell through, and after a four-year search for an actress to fill the role, it was revealed in November 2005 that Lloyd Webber had approached the BBC to allow the public to cast the role through a Popstars-style talent search, {{the first time that}} such a format had been used.|$|E
5000|$|In 1966, American Express created <b>the</b> first <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> {{guided tour}} in Salzburg. Since 1972, Panorama Tours has been <b>the</b> leading <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> bus tour {{company in the}} city, taking {{approximately}} 50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding region.|$|R
60|$|The Count {{continued}} his stroll {{away from the}} band. He returned slowly, he said. I can imagine him enjoying to the full, but with his usual tranquillity, the balminess of this southern night and <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> softened delightfully by the distance.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{protection}} of veerakumaras and the elders, amidst <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> as played formally in the temple, the Karaga goes on a Pradarshana (procession) around the temple.

5|$|The Birth of a Nation, Gone {{with the}} Wind, The Godfather, Jaws, Star Wars, E.T. and Avatar all {{increased}} their record grosses with re-releases. The grosses from their original theatrical runs are included here along with totals from re-releases {{up to the}} point that they lost the record; therefore the total for The Birth of a Nation includes income from its reissues up to 1940; the total for Star Wars includes revenue from the late 1970s and early 1980s reissues but not from the 1997 Special Edition; the total for E.T. incorporates its gross from the 1985 reissue but not from 2002; the total for Avatar—as the current record-holder—includes all its earnings at the present time. Gone with the Wind is represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/general release/second-run) along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. The Godfather was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and Jaws was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music,</b> The Godfather, Jaws, Jurassic Park and Titanic increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013 and 2012 respectively, but they are not included in the totals here since they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.|$|E
5|$|Belle's yellow ballgown was {{inspired}} by a similar costume Hepburn had worn in the film Roman Holiday (1953). Hahn and a team of male filmmakers designed the ballgown while consuming pizza and alcohol. Originally, the marketing department ordered that Belles' dress be pink to cater to the female audience, but art director Brian McEntee convinced studio to make the dress gold in order to make her to distinguish her from other Disney Princess, specifically Aurora's from Sleeping Beauty (1950). Art director Brian McEntee suggested that Belle be the only character in her village to wear blue in order emphasize {{the fact that she is}} different and an outcast. The colors Belle wears also mimic her emotions, blue being associated with sadness and loneliness. Blue was also used to symbolize good, while Gaston's red represented evil. According to the Directory of World Cinema: American Hollywood by Lincoln Geraghty, Belle {{was inspired}} by actress Judy Garland's role as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Julie Andrews' performance as Maria von Trapp in <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> (1965).|$|E
5|$|The UK Albums Chart {{is based}} on Sunday to Saturday sales of both {{physical}} and digital albums. It is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC) {{on behalf of the}} UK music industry, and each week's new number one is first announced on Sunday evenings on The Radio 1 Chart Show. The album chart was first published by Record Mirror in 1956. The record at number one on 25 December that year was the original soundtrack to the 1956 film The King and I, making it the first ever UK Christmas number one album; The King and I soundtrack was also Christmas number one in 1957, the following year. In 1958, the original soundtrack to South Pacific became the second Christmas number one album. Staying {{at the top of the}} album chart for a total of 115 weeks, it was also number one in 1959 and 1960. Soundtracks to the movies <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> and Grease also became Christmas number ones.|$|E

5|$|When Me and Juliet began tryout {{performances}} in Cleveland, the duo {{realized that the}} show had problems with the plot and staging. Extensive revisions during the remaining Cleveland and Boston tryouts failed to cure the difficulties with the plot, which the critics considered weak and uninteresting. The show was met with less than favorable reviews, though Mielziner's staging won praise from audience and critics. The show closed once it had exhausted its advance sales. According to Bill Hayes the show's star in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he says' We played nearly five hundred performances, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits went into the R till. So, though {{not in the same}} category as the storied five that were made into films - Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> - our show must be considered a success. With the exception of a short run in Chicago, there was no national tour, and the show has seldom been seen. A small-scale production was presented by London's Finborough Theatre in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Audience tastes {{were fairly}} eclectic during the 20th century, but several trends did emerge. During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with The Birth of a Nation (American Civil War), The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, The Big Parade and Wings (all World War I) {{becoming}} {{the most successful}} films in their respective years of release, with the trend {{coming to an end}} with All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war themed films dominate again during this period, starting with Gone with the Wind (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with The Best Years of Our Lives (World War II) in 1946. Samson and Delilah (1949) saw the beginning of a trend of increasingly expensive historical dramas set during Ancient Rome/biblical times throughout the 1950s as cinema competed with television for audiences, with Quo Vadis, The Robe, The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur and Spartacus all becoming the highest-grossing film of the year during initial release, before the genre started to wane after several high-profile failures. The success of White Christmas and South Pacific in the 1950s foreshadowed the comeback of the musical in the 1960s with West Side Story, Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>Music</b> and Funny Girl all among the top films of the decade. The 1970s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films, with six such films made by either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg topping the chart during the 1980s. The 21st century has seen an increasing dependence on franchises and adaptations, with the box office dominance of films based on pre-existing intellectual property at record levels.|$|E
