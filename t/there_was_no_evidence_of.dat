5|$|In September 1993, {{after the}} field of the hoard find was ploughed, the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service {{surveyed}} the field, finding four gold coins and 81 silver coins, all {{considered part of the}} same hoard. Both earlier Iron Age and later mediaeval materials were also discovered, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a Roman settlement in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the court case, a female Scientologist was found {{collecting}} seven copies of the unpublished proofs from a copy shop in East Grinstead, near the Church of Scientology's UK headquarters at Saint Hill Manor. She was arrested but later released as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> theft.|$|E
50|$|The fact <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> {{for global}} warming, i.e. <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> interjection Let {{me tell you}} that the seas are not rising any more than is in any way out of the ordinary; the ice is not decreasing, it is {{increasing}}; the polar bears are increasing in number; and the temperature is going down not up. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> for this whatsoever.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence,</b> from {{a roll of}} schoolboys at Stratford Free Grammar School, about 1564-77, {{that any}} given boy {{attended}} it; for no roll exists. Consequently <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that Will <b>was</b> a pupil.|$|R
50|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> direct <b>evidence</b> that Astiz had {{any part}} in Hagelin's {{treatment}} after shooting and kidnapping Hagelin. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of who killed her.|$|R
5|$|In 2002, the {{controversy}} was revived. Alerted to the incident, American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), which had established the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Award in 1979, commissioned a new investigation. It {{was led by}} Jay Katz, emeritus professor at Yale Law School and a specialist in medical ethics. He concluded <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> unethical human experimentation, but the letter was so offensive that the prize should be renamed. AACR concurred and stripped the honor from Rhoads because of his racism.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty. One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, {{and the opening of}} the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a burglary.|$|E
5|$|The {{site and}} the finds from it are the {{property}} of the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society. Many of the finds from the site are on display in the Glastonbury Lake Village Museum at The Tribunal in Glastonbury High Street, and in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. The burial sites of ten new born babies were uncovered, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the interment of adults from the village.|$|E

5|$|The team's {{pre-season}} preparations were {{overshadowed by}} an accident involving Fernando Alonso {{on the final}} day of testing that saw Alonso hospitalised with a concussion and ruled out of the third and final test. Kevin Magnussen, McLaren's test and reserve driver, was drafted in as his replacement for the remainder of the test and the opening round of the season. Alonso later attributed the accident to a steering failure, although McLaren maintained that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a car failure in the telemetry data following the accident.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> their complicity, it was a political reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{concerns}} are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at around {{six months of}} age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs. Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. This {{was one of the}} lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> elbow dysplasia found. The breed has an average life span of 1013 years.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 118, over {{a period}} of six months, she was {{submitted}} to neurophysiological tests and a CT scan. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency was comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> progressive neurological disease, depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was in fact found to improve slightly over the six-month period. Calment reportedly remained mentally intact until the end of her life.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{investigations}} by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) were launched, {{and they}} interviewed witnesses, checked documentation, and conducted on-scene {{examination of the}} plant. OSHA arrived within two hours and the CSB within 48 hours. Other brief investigations were conducted by state firefighters and police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, but these were ended quickly after confirming <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the explosion and fire having been deliberately started. In a press conference held on February 17, 2008, {{one of the six}} members of the CSB team said that the explosion showed the ongoing risk from dust explosions despite their report highlighting the matter in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Pritchard {{received}} word from local residents {{that on the}} night before a party, probably including the Confederate President, had crossed the Ocmulgee River just north of Abbeville. Since there were two roads to Irwindale, one of which had been taken by Harnden and his men, Pritchard decided to take the other, {{to see if he could}} capture Davis. He took with him about a hundred and forty men and their horses, while the balance of the Michiganders stayed on the Ocmulgee River near Abbeville. Some seven hours later, at 1 A.M. on May 10, Pritchard arrived at Irwindale. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> Harnden's men being there yet.|$|E

5|$|The 17th-century room, S2, {{used the}} south {{wall of the}} {{existing}} structure as its own north wall, and was largely built using materials salvaged from S1, although the standard of the work was poorer. The new room had a double fireplace, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a dividing wall between the two hearths. Limestone blocks, identical to the quoins in S1, were used as structural and decorative features in the fireplace. In addition to the pantiles taken from S1, there were Cornish slate roof tiles. Whether they formed part of the roof of S2 or {{were associated with the}} possible wooden extension is unclear.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Lukeville POE at 3 or 3:30 PM, the two agents interviewed Howard and Maureen Cotterman separately. Howard Cotterman {{offered to help}} the agents with the computer, but the offer was declined. At 6 PM, the two agents left with both laptops and one digital camera. The devices were taken to Tucson and delivered to John Owens, an ICE Computer Forensic Examiner at 11 PM that night. The camera was returned to the Cottermans as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> contraband found. However, on April 8, Agent Owens' forensic examination turned up approximately 75 images of child pornography on Howard Cotterman's computer. Agent Owens called the Cottermans that night, asking Howard Cotterman for assistance opening the password protected files. Howard Cotterman agreed {{to come in the}} next day, but only his wife showed up to pick up the other laptop.|$|E
5|$|Several {{lawsuits}} {{have been}} filed against Yelp accusing it of extorting businesses into buying advertising products. Each have been dismissed by a judge before reaching trial. In early 2010, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Yelp alleging it asked a Long Beach veterinary hospital to pay $300 a month for advertising services that included the suppression or deletion of disparaging customer reviews. The following month, nine additional businesses joined the class-action lawsuit, and two similar lawsuits were filed. That May the lawsuits were combined into one class-action lawsuit, which was dismissed by San Francisco U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in 2011. Chen said the reviews were protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> manipulation by Yelp. The plaintiffs filed an appeal. In September 2014 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, finding that even if Yelp did manipulate reviews to favor advertisers, this would not fall under the court's legal definition of extortion.|$|E

5|$|The {{body of a}} {{young woman}} was {{discovered}} in the water of Belstead Brook at Thorpe's Hill, near Hintlesham, {{by a member of the}} public on 2 December 2006. The body, later identified as 25-year-old Gemma Adams, had not been sexually assaulted. Six days later, on 8 December, the body of 19-year-old Tania Nicol, a friend of Adams who had been missing since 30 October, was discovered in water at Copdock Mill just outside Ipswich. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault. On 10 December, a third victim, found by a member of the public in an area of woodland by the A14 road near Nacton, was later identified as 24-year-old Anneli Alderton. According to a police statement, she had been asphyxiated and was about three months pregnant when she died.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} the 23rd, {{the day of the}} speech, brought the reports from the lawyers, who opined that it was legal for a senator to accept expense reimbursements, and from the accountants, who stated that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> {{misappropriation}} of money. The Fund was to be dissolved, and gifts accepted since Nixon's nomination were to be accounted for as campaign contributions. Despite the reports, Eisenhower had second thoughts about relying on the success of the speech. He told an aide to call Governor Dewey, who was to call Nixon and instruct him to close his speech with his resignation from the ticket. Believing they had resolved the situation at last, Eisenhower and his staff had a relaxed dinner and began to prepare for his own speech that evening, before 15,000 Republican supporters in Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the 2001 India cyclone {{can be traced to}} a {{tropical}} disturbance over the Arabian Sea on May18. The following day, the system was determined to be relatively stationary near the island of Socotra. Although deep convection was associated with the disturbance, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a low-level circulation. By May20, the disturbance slowly moved towards the southeast in response to an upper-level trough over India. The overall structure gradually improved as good outflow developed. A mid-level circulation finally developed late on May21, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Several hours later, they began monitoring the system as a tropical depression with the identifier 01A; however, operational advisories were not issued until the cyclone was estimated to have attained tropical storm intensity. By the morning of May22, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) also took notice of the system.|$|E
