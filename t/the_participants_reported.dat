25|$|It is {{important}} to point out that the secondary social sharing is not limited to negative emotional episodes, but instead can occur after positive emotional episodes as well. In one study, 83% of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>reported</b> some degree of secondary social sharing in response to both positive and negative emotional situation, with no differences found between these two valences. However, there were some qualitative differences between secondary sharing for each: for positive emotional episodes, secondary social sharing was initiated faster and with a higher number of repetitions and targets than for negatives emotional episodes.|$|E
25|$|Employee {{turnover}} rate {{is a significant}} problem in many industries. According to a 2008 report, {{turnover rate}} among sales people has exceeded 40% annually with similar figures in the US. This is a disadvantage to businesses because replacing labor is extremely costly. The report studied the impact cognitive-behavioral therapy had on 166 financial service sales agents from a major British insurance company which had recently been acquired by a competitive, results-oriented organization. Measurements were based on employee well-being, job satisfaction, productivity and turnover. Major organizational changes lead to {{a substantial number of}} employees quitting. Three months prior to the study, 71% of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>reported</b> experiencing work-related stress and performing poorly. According to the results, there were major improvement in employees' attributional style, psychological distress, self-esteem, job satisfaction and intention to quit. Symptoms of psychological stress warranting intervention reduced from 37% of the sample to 10% after training. The psychological changes were also accompanied by a 66% reduction in employee turnover rate. Productivity had also improved post two years after training where 65% of the sample had achieved sales figures above the average. This is a significant increase prior to training where 29% of participants were barely performing at acceptable standards.|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} {{researchers}} from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine led by Griffiths {{conducted a study}} to assess the immediate and long-term psychological effects of the psilocybin experience, using {{a modified version of}} the mystical experience questionnaire and a rigorous double-blind procedure. When asked in an interview about the similarity of his work with Leary's, Griffiths explained the difference: [...] "We are conducting rigorous, systematic research with psilocybin under carefully monitored conditions, a route which Dr. Leary abandoned in the early 1960s." [...] The National Institute of Drug Abuse-funded study, published in 2006, has been praised by experts for the soundness of its experimental design. In the experiment, 36 volunteers without prior experience with hallucinogens were given psilocybin and methylphenidate (Ritalin) in separate sessions; the methylphenidate sessions served as a control and psychoactive placebo. The degree of mystical experience was measured using a questionnaire developed by Ralph W. Hood; 61% of subjects reported a [...] "complete mystical experience" [...] after their psilocybin session, while only 13% reported such an outcome after their experience with methylphenidate. Two months after taking psilocybin, 79% of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>reported</b> moderately to greatly increased life satisfaction and sense of well-being. About 36% of participants also had a strong to extreme [...] "experience of fear" [...] or dysphoria (i.e., a [...] "bad trip") at some point during the psilocybin session (which was not reported by any subject during the methylphenidate session); about one-third of these (13% of the total) reported that this dysphoria dominated the entire session. These negative effects were reported to be easily managed by the researchers and did not have a lasting negative effect on the subject's sense of well-being.|$|E

Additionally, research in which young adults were instructed to use plain cigarette packs and subsequently asked about their feelings towards them confirmed findings that plain packaging increased negative perceptions and feelings about the pack and about smoking. Plain packs also increased behaviours such as hiding or covering the pack, smoking less around others, going without cigarettes and increased thinking about quitting.
