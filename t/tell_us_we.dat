When questioned about his views on life after death, {{he wrote in his}} 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to <b>tell</b> <b>us.</b> <b>We</b> hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it.|$|E

"And {{unless we}} see and know some one like Mr. Bentley," [...] he went on, {{choosing}} his words, [...] "or discover for ourselves what Christ was, and what he tried to <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> <b>we</b> go on 'suffering, because we don't see any way out.

6000|$|... 'No one {{objects to}} plenty of {{domestic}} work or fashionable pleasure, I find; {{but the minute}} we begin to study, people <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> can't bear it, and warn us to be very careful. I've tried the other things, and got so tired I came to college; though my people predict nervous exhaustion and an early death. Do {{you think there is}} any danger?' asked a stately girl, with an anxious glance at the blooming face reflected in the mirror opposite.|$|E
60|$|It {{was easy}} to let him see that we {{intended}} to carry our provision {{with us from the}} first day; but he made signs to us to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> need not, for we should find provision enough everywhere for forty days. It was very difficult for us to understand how he expressed forty; for he knew no figures, but some words that they used to one another that they understood it by. At last one of the negroes, by his order, laid forty little stones one by another, to show us how many days we should travel, and find provisions sufficient.|$|E

It was wrote by a knowing man, but overworldly, I doubt. However, that saying's partly true; for the Bible <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> must be workers {{together}} with God." ...|$|R
60|$|Now how is that? The Catechism, I think, will <b>tell</b> <b>us.</b> The Doxology, {{at the end}} of the Lord's Prayer, will <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> if <b>we</b> {{consider}} it.|$|R

Yet it is theirs, and in return they <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> can go to work on the land, their land, and that what we produce by our toil shall be theirs. Yet in the old days we did not have to work. Also, when we are sick, they take away our freedom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not? This may be {{its last}} kick! I feel very tired. But it 's a masterpiece, though I do say it. They <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> owe {{so much to}} our parents. Well, I 've paid the filial debt handsomely!" [...] He {{walked up and down}} the room a few moments, with the purpose of his visit evidently still undischarged.

60|$|The Jacobites and Non-Jurants shall rise up in Judgment {{against this}} Generation, and shall condemn them, for they tell us, this Storm is a Judgment {{on the whole}} Nation, for Excluding their Lawful Soveraign, and Abjuring his Posterity: Upon this head they have been preaching up Repentance, and Humiliation to us; {{and some of them}} are willing to reduce all to a very {{practical}} Exhortation, and <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> <b>we</b> ought to look upon it as a Loud Call to Restore the Right Owner (as they call him) to the Possession of his own again; that is, in short, to rebel against a Mild, Gentle, Just and Protestant Queen, and call in the Popish Posterity of an abdicated Tyrant.|$|E
6000|$|Answ. The text saith the contrary; for we [...] "have not {{received}} {{the spirit of}} bondage again to fear." [...] Nor is God put to it for want of wisdom, to say and unsay, do and undo, or else he cannot do good. When we are sons, and have received the adoption of children, he doth not use to send the spirit after that to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> are slaves and heirs of damnation, also that we are without Christ, without the promise, without grace, and without God in the world; and yet this he must do {{if it comes to}} us after we have received him as a spirit of adoption, and put us, as a spirit of bondage, in fear as before.|$|E
60|$|There is a {{parallel}} case to {{this in the}} ordinary appointment of people to meet either at place or time, upon occasions of business. Two friends make an appointment to meet {{the next day at}} such a house, suppose a tavern at or near the Exchange: one says to the other, 'Do not fail me at that time, for I will certainly be there;' the other answers, 'I will not fail.' Some people, who think themselves more religious than others, or at least would be thought so, object against these positive appointments, and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> ought to say, 'I will, if it pleases God.' or I will, life and health permitting;[27] and they quote the text for it, where our Saviour expressly commands to use such a caution, and which I shall say nothing to lessen the force of.|$|E
5000|$|However, in ’t Hooft’s opinion: “History <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> that if <b>we</b> {{hit upon}} some obstacle, {{even if it}} looks like a pure {{formality}} or just a technical complication, it should be carefully scrutinized. Nature might be <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> something, and <b>we</b> should find out what it is.” ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{band has}} been criticized for [...] "not being metal enough". Vocalist M. Shadows responded to this with, [...] "we play music for the sake of music, not so that we can be labeled a metal band. That's like <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> aren't punk enough. Who cares?". Avenged Sevenfold is one of the notable acts of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal.|$|R
60|$|Where are we? Have we {{overshot}} Scilly?--and is {{the next}} land {{we are likely to}} see Ushant or Finisterre? Nobody knows. The faces of the Brothers Dobbs darken; and they recall to each other how they deprecated from the first this rash venturing into unknown waters. We hail two ships piteously, to ask our way. The two ships can't <b>tell</b> <b>us.</b> <b>We</b> unroll the charts, and differ in opinion over them more remarkably than ever. The Dobbses grimly opine that it is no use looking at charts, when we have not got a pair of parallels to measure by, and are all ignorant of the scientific parts of navigation. Mr. Migott and I manfully cheer the drooping spirits of the crew with Guinness's stout, and put a smiling face upon it. But in our innermost hearts, we think of Columbus, and feel for him.|$|E
60|$|It {{is useless}} their {{telling us that}} when we die we are {{instantly}} judged and packed straight off to some region where we are destined to spend an eternity. We know better. Nature, our own hearts, have taught us differently. Furthermore, we {{have heard of the}} resurrection--that the dead will rise again at the last day; and with all our willingness to believe what our masters <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> <b>we</b> know that even a dead man can't be in two places at the same time. Our dead are here where we laid them; sleeping, no doubt, but not so soundly sleeping, we imagine, as not to see and hear us when we visit and speak to them. And being villagers still though dead, they like to see us often, whenever we have a few spare minutes to call round and exchange a few words with them.|$|E

His name was Selkirk, {{and he had a}} family in Westerly, out on the Grade Suburban.... Some of the girls never came back at all, except to swagger in and buy {{expensive}} things, and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> were fools to work. And after a while I noticed Florry was getting discouraged. We never had so much as a nickel left over on Saturdays and they made us sign a paper, when they hired us, that we lived at home. It was their excuse for paying us six dollars a week. They do it at Ferguson's, too. They say they can get plenty of girls who do live at home. I made up my mind I'd go back to Madison, but I kept putting it off, and then father died, and I couldn't! ...|$|E

5000|$|Band members Andy Fletcher and Martin Gore both {{explained}} the album's title was {{conceived as a}} joke. Fletcher said, [...] "The title's ... a bit tongue-in-cheek, really.

[...] According to Gore, the title [...] "was a joke on the uncommerciality of album. It was anything but music for the masses!" ...|$|R
