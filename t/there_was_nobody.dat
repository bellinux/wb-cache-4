5|$|When Joe Nieuwendyk {{refused to}} report to the Flames prior to the 1995 season, they named Fleury interim captain. The title was made {{permanent}} when Nieuwendyk was traded in December. Fleury was reluctant to assume the captaincy, but did so out of loyalty to the team and because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> else capable of taking on the role. He relinquished it two seasons later after deciding that it was harming his play and affecting his relationship with his teammates and coach Pierre Pagé.|$|E
5|$|Carthage, {{the second}} largest city in the empire, was lost along with much of North Africa in 439 AD to the Vandals, {{and the fate of}} Rome seemed sealed. By 476 AD, what {{remained}} of the Empire was completely in the hands of federated Germanic troops and when they revolted, led by Odoacer and deposed the Emperor Romulus Augustus <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> to stop them. Odoacer happened to hold the part of the Empire around Italy and Rome but other parts of the Empire were ruled by Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alans and others. The Empire in the West had fallen, and its remnant in Italy was no longer Roman in nature. The Eastern Roman Empire and the Goths continued to fight over Rome and the surrounding area for many years, though by this point Rome's importance was primarily symbolic.|$|E
5|$|It {{was well}} known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who {{had been sent to}} Thermopylae had been killed there (with the {{exception}} of Aristodemus and Pantites), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.|$|E

25|$|The {{children}} in Ms Frizzle's class were sure that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> like her, {{but that was}} before they met her niece, Dottie Frizzle. Dottie accompanies the class on their field trip to the town power plant. There the bus turns into a dump truck, and pours the {{children in}}to the plant. They shrink and travel through the Walkerville electric system.|$|E

25|$|As MacKenzie's layout {{was seen}} by more and more people, a {{collective}} shudder ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed—"looking like rabbits in the headlights"—as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it—they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the enormity of it. It was a 'classic smear'.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} few months of Apple's existence, it did not even have an office. Most of the company's {{business}} was conducted from the NEMS building. It was not until the autumn of 1967 that Apple finally opened a London office. Since the Beatles already owned a four-story building at 94 Baker Street that had been purchased as an investment property by their accountants, they decided that Baker Street was as good a location as any for Apple. In September they set up an office for Apple Publishing in the Baker Street building. With Epstein's death, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> in the Beatles' inner circle with business acumen who could manage the company, and, as with their band affairs, the Beatles decided that they would manage it themselves.|$|E
25|$|U-570 quickly resurfaced {{and around}} 10 {{of the crew}} emerged. The Hudson fired on them with machine guns, but ceased when the U-boat crew {{displayed}} a white sheet. The captured crewmembers later recounted to British naval intelligence interrogators what had happened—the depth charge explosions had almost rolled the boat over, knocked out all electrical power, smashed instruments, caused water leaks, and contaminated the air on the boat. The inexperienced crew believed the contamination to be chlorine, caused by acid from leaking battery cells mixing with sea-water, and the engine-compartment crew panicked and fled forward to escape the gas. Restoring electrical power—for the underwater electric motors and for lighting—would have been straightforward, yet <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> remaining in the engine compartment to do this. The submarine was {{dead in the water}} and in darkness. Rahmlow believed the chlorine would make it fatal to stay submerged so he resurfaced. The sea was too rough for the crew to man their anti-aircraft gun so they displayed a white flag to forestall another, probably fatal, depth charge attack from the Hudson—they were unaware the aircraft had dropped all its depth charges.|$|E

25|$|In 1799, the Peak Forest Canal {{included}} clauses for {{a branch}} to the collieries at Poynton and Norbury in an Act of Parliament {{they were trying}} to obtain, but those clauses were deleted during the parliamentary process. In 1805 and 1806, they attempted to find the original papers from Outram's surveys, and hoped that the Trent and Mersey might support their proposal for a canal from Marple to Lawton, via Macclesfield. There was another proposal in 1810, and various half-hearted attempts to revive the idea between 1814 and 1818, but none came to fruition. In 1824, the Cromford and High Peak Railway, a bold scheme to link the Cromford Canal and the Peak Forest Canal, was being planned, but a suggestion to build a branch of the railway to serve Macclesfield was deferred, as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> from Macclesfield at the meeting. A proposal for a canal from Church Lawton to the Bridgewater Canal near Manchester, passing through Congleton, Macclesfield, and Stockport, was also made, but it was thought that there would be difficulties dealing with the Trent and Mersey Canal at one end and the Trustees of the Duke of Bridgwater at the other.|$|E
500|$|Some {{board members}} were {{uncomfortable with the}} way the matter was handled. Bob Merriman said that the other board members were [...] "absolutely pizzled [...] I don't know what the vote was because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> there". Malcolm Gray said that [...] "it was disgraceful that the Board hadn't been {{informed}} before". Damien Mullins said he thought [...] "it was poor and unsatisfactory".|$|E
500|$|The Guardian also {{quoted a}} U.S. {{official}} explaining the anticipated difficulty {{of finding a}} country that would accept the burial of bin Laden in its soil. A professor of Islamic Law at the University of Jordan stated burying at sea was permitted if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial, and that [...] "it's neither true nor correct to claim that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> in the Muslim world ready to receive bin Laden's body". On a similar note, Mohammed al-Qubaisi, Dubai's grand mufti, stated: [...] "They can say they buried him at sea, but they cannot say they did it according to Islam. If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: you dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it. Sea burials are permissible for Muslims in extraordinary circumstances. This {{is not one of}} them." [...] Khalid Latif, an imam who serves as a chaplain {{and the director of the}} Islamic Center of New York University, argued that the sea burial was respectful.|$|E

500|$|With Thomas dead, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> {{who could}} either {{implicate}} or clear Henry Percy of {{any involvement in}} the plot. [...] His failure to ensure that Thomas took the Oath of Supremacy upon his appointment as a Gentleman Pensioner, and their meeting on 4 November, constituted damning evidence, and the Privy Council also suspected that had the plot succeeded, {{he would have been}} Princess Elizabeth's protector. [...] With insufficient evidence to convict him he was charged with contempt, fined £30,000 and stripped of all public offices. [...] He remained in the Tower until 1621.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{acquiring}} the Auburn property, Tubman {{went back to}} Maryland and returned with her [...] "niece," [...] an eight-year-old light-skinned black girl named Margaret. The circumstances of this expedition remain clouded in mystery. There is great confusion about the identity of Margaret's parents, although Tubman indicated they were free blacks. The girl had left behind a twin brother and a loving home in Maryland. Years later, Margaret's daughter Alice called Tubman's actions selfish, saying, [...] "she had taken the child from a sheltered good home {{to a place where}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> to care for her." [...] Indeed, Alice described it as a [...] "kidnapping".|$|E

Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves {{along the length of}} the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, [...]|$|E
500|$|Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, {{was in a}} {{difficult}} position. [...] His midday dinner with Thomas Percy on 4November was damning evidence against him, and after Thomas Percy's death <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> who could either implicate him or clear him. [...] The Privy Council suspected that Northumberland would have been Princess Elizabeth's protector had the plot succeeded, but there was insufficient evidence to convict him. [...] Northumberland remained in the Tower and on 27June 1606 was finally charged with contempt. [...] He was stripped of all public offices, fined £30,000 (about £ in [...] ), and kept in the Tower until June 1621. [...] The Lords Mordaunt and Stourton were tried in the Star Chamber. They were condemned to imprisonment in the Tower, where they remained until 1608, when they were transferred to the Fleet Prison. [...] Both were also given significant fines.|$|E
500|$|Former Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland {{joined the}} band for their August {{headlining}} {{show at the}} 2008 ETP Fest in South Korea, although Borland would quit to reunite with Limp Bizkit after just one other performance. He later said {{he was reluctant to}} be a [...] "hired gun", citing the band's refusal to record any of the nine songs he submitted for their then-upcoming album. Manson clarified: [...] "There was talk early on about collaborating with different guitar players on the record. That was before Twiggy and I got back together, because once Twiggy was back, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nobody</b> else, and I don't care what you have to offer—this was our record." [...] Manson and Twiggy announced at the 2008 Scream Awards in October that the album was [...] "pretty much done", and indicated it would sound more like Antichrist Superstar than the band's recent material. Manson later described the record as featuring [...] " [...] guitar solos and brutal, reckless screaming", and as being [...] "very ruthless, heavy and violent". The album was co-produced by Manson, Twiggy and Vrenna, along with Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals co-producer Sean Beavan.|$|E
