5|$|Titan {{is never}} {{visible to the}} naked eye, but can be {{observed}} through small telescopes or strong binoculars. Amateur observation is difficult because of the proximity of Titan to Saturn's brilliant globe and ring system; an occulting bar, covering part of <b>the</b> <b>eyepiece</b> and used to block the bright planet, greatly improves viewing. Titan has a maximum apparent magnitude of +8.2, and mean opposition magnitude 8.4. This compares to +4.6 for the similarly sized Ganymede, in the Jovian system.|$|E
5|$|Herschel wedges, {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is destined for <b>the</b> <b>eyepiece</b> is reflected from an unsilvered {{surface of a}} piece of glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected. The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E
5000|$|In its astronomical use, a Barlow lens may {{be placed}} {{immediately}} before an eyepiece to effectively decrease <b>the</b> <b>eyepiece's</b> focal length {{by the amount}} of the Barlow's divergence.

5|$|Depicting <b>the</b> <b>eyepiece</b> of the {{microscope}} is Gamma Microscopii, which—at magnitude of4.68—is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation. Having spent much of its 620-million-year lifespan as a blue-white main sequence star, it has swollen and cooled to become a yellow giant of spectral type G6III, with a diameter ten times that of the Sun. Measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 229±4 light years from Earth. At around 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, it likely passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly massive enough and close enough to disturb the Oort cloud. Alpha Microscopii is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type G7III with an apparent magnitude of 4.90. Located 380±30 light-years away from Earth, it has swollen to 17.5times the diameter of the Sun. Alpha has a 10th magnitude companion, visible in 7.5cm telescopes, though this is a coincidental closeness rather than a true binary system. Epsilon Microscopii lies 182±2 light years away, and is a white star of apparent magnitude 4.7, and spectral type A1V. Theta1 and Theta2 Microscopii make up a wide double whose components are splittable to the naked eye. Both are white A-class magnetic spectrum variable stars with strong metallic lines, similar to Cor Caroli. They mark the constellation's specimen slide.|$|E

It was named by William Henry Smyth in 1844 for its resemblance in <b>the</b> <b>eyepiece</b> to {{a flock of}} ducks in flight. The cluster, 6200 light-years from Earth and 20 light-years in diameter, contains approximately 3000 stars, making it a particularly rich cluster. It is 220 million years old.|$|E
25|$|William Gascoigne was {{the first}} who {{commanded}} a chief advantage of the form of telescope suggested by Kepler: that a small material object could be placed at the common focal plane of the objective and <b>the</b> <b>eyepiece.</b> This led to his invention of the micrometer, and his application of telescopic sights to precision astronomical instruments. It was not till about {{the middle of the}} 17th century that Kepler's telescope came into general use: not so much because of the advantages pointed out by Gascoigne, but because its field of view was much larger than in the Galilean telescope.|$|E

50|$|Double Porro prism {{systems are}} used in small optical telescopes to re-orient an {{inverted}} image (an arrangement is known as an image erection system), and especially in many binoculars where they both erect the image and provide a longer, folded distance between the objective lenses and <b>the</b> <b>eyepieces.</b>|$|R

25|$|Since {{crafting}} large lenses is {{much more}} difficult than crafting large mirrors, most modern telescopes are reflecting telescopes, that is, telescopes that use a primary mirror rather than an objective lens. The same general optical considerations apply to reflecting telescopes that applied to refracting telescopes, namely, the larger the primary mirror, the more light collected, and the magnification is still equal to the focal length of the primary mirror divided by the focal length of <b>the</b> <b>eyepiece.</b> Professional telescopes generally do not have eyepieces and instead place an instrument (often a charge-coupled device) at the focal point instead.|$|E
25|$|Since {{speculum}} metal mirror secondaries or diagonal mirrors {{greatly reduced}} {{the light that}} reached <b>the</b> <b>eyepiece,</b> several reflecting telescope designers tried {{to do away with}} them. In 1762 Mikhail Lomonosov presented a reflecting telescope before the Russian Academy of Sciences forum. It had its primary mirror tilted at four degrees to telescope's axis so the image could be viewed via an eyepiece mounted {{at the front of the}} telescope tube without the observer's head blocking the incoming light. This innovation was not published until 1827, so this type came to be called the Herschelian telescope after a similar design by William Herschel.|$|E
25|$|The camera has a {{long and}} {{distinguished}} history {{as a means of}} recording scientific phenomena from the first use by Daguerre and Fox-Talbot, such as astronomical events (eclipses for example), small creatures and plants when the camera was attached to <b>the</b> <b>eyepiece</b> of microscopes (in photomicroscopy) and for macro photography of larger specimens. The camera also proved useful in recording crime scenes and the scenes of accidents, such as the Wootton bridge collapse in 1861. The methods used in analysing photographs for use in legal cases are collectively known as forensic photography. Crime scene photos are taken from three vantage point. The vantage points are overview, mid-range, and close-up.|$|E

50|$|Wide-field {{binoculars}} are possible, but require bulkier, heavier, {{and more}} complex <b>eyepieces.</b> <b>The</b> diameter of the objective lenses is unimportant for field of view. <b>The</b> widest-angle <b>eyepieces</b> used in telescopes are so large that two would not fit side-by-side for use in binoculars.|$|R
25|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun {{with the naked eye}} permanently damages human vision, amateur observation of sunspots is generally conducted using projected images, or directly through protective filters. Small sections of very dark filter glass, such as a #14 welder's glass, are effective. A telescope eyepiece can project the image, without filtration, onto a white screen where it can be viewed indirectly, and even traced, to follow sunspot evolution. Special purpose hydrogen-alpha narrow bandpass filters and aluminum-coated glass attenuation filters (which have the appearance of mirrors due to their extremely high optical density) on the front of a telescope provide safe observation through <b>the</b> <b>eyepiece.</b>|$|E
25|$|Consequently, when Bradley and Samuel Molyneux {{entered this}} sphere of {{research}} in 1725, there was still considerable uncertainty as to whether stellar parallaxes had been observed or not, and {{it was with the}} intention of definitely answering this question that they erected a large telescope at Molyneux's house at Kew. They decided to reinvestigate the motion of γ Draconis with a telescope constructed by George Graham (1675–1751), a celebrated instrument-maker. This was fixed to a vertical chimney stack in such manner as to permit a small oscillation of <b>the</b> <b>eyepiece,</b> the amount of which (i.e. the deviation from the vertical) was regulated and measured by the introduction of a screw and a plumb line.|$|E
25|$|M78 (NGC 2068) is a nebula in Orion.

M78 is associated with the variable star V351 Orionis, whose magnitude changes are visible in very short periods of time. Another fairly bright nebula in Orion is NGC 1999, also close to the Great Orion Nebula. It has an integrated magnitude of 10.5 and is 1500 light-years from Earth. The variable star V380 Orionis is embedded in NGC 1999.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{optical microscope}} has more recently {{evolved into the}} digital microscope.

25|$|Lanci's {{most notable}} {{achievement}} was his invention in 1567 {{of a piece}} of surveying equipment to obtain perspectives with a visual field of 180°. The instrument, which he named distanziometro ("distance meter"), was made of a circular bronze plate placed upon a horizontal tripod the height of which could be adjusted. Semi-cylindrical paper was wound around its edge. A cylindrical eyepiece was placed in the centre with a retracting metal needle or pen underneath. <b>The</b> <b>eyepiece</b> was high enough to overlook the semicircle of paper and sight points of interest while the retracting needle scored on the paper to accurately plot the subject. It could also be used as a quadrant for measuring height {{in much the same way}} as the orizzonte designed by Leon Battista Alberti.|$|E
25|$|Microscopes {{were first}} {{developed}} {{with just two}} lenses: an objective lens and an eyepiece. The objective lens is essentially a magnifying glass and was designed with a very small focal length while <b>the</b> <b>eyepiece</b> generally has a longer focal length. This {{has the effect of}} producing magnified images of close objects. Generally, an additional source of illumination is used since magnified images are dimmer due to the conservation of energy and the spreading of light rays over a larger surface area. Modern microscopes, known as compound microscopes have many lenses in them (typically four) to optimize the functionality and enhance image stability. A slightly different variety of microscope, the comparison microscope, looks at side-by-side images to produce a stereoscopic binocular view that appears three dimensional when used by humans.|$|E
25|$|The first telescopes, called refracting telescopes {{were also}} {{developed}} {{with a single}} objective and eyepiece lens. In contrast to the microscope, the objective lens of the telescope was designed with a large focal length to avoid optical aberrations. The objective focuses {{an image of a}} distant object at its focal point which is adjusted to be at the focal point of an eyepiece of a much smaller focal length. The main goal of a telescope is not necessarily magnification, but rather collection of light which is determined by the physical size of the objective lens. Thus, telescopes are normally indicated by the diameters of their objectives rather than by the magnification which can be changed by switching eyepieces. Because the magnification of a telescope is equal to the focal length of the objective divided by the focal length of <b>the</b> <b>eyepiece,</b> smaller focal-length eyepieces cause greater magnification.|$|E

The latter have a maximum shelf-life of 10 years, and the mask itself (the facepiece) of 20 years. The mask has many features including a fail-safe drinking device, a Secondary Speech Transmitter (SST) on the side which can accept special microphones, and corrective lenses can be fitted to <b>the</b> <b>eyepieces.</b> <b>The</b> mask also contains an inner mask to decrease fogging on the lenses.|$|R
50|$|Binoculars using roof prisms {{may have}} {{appeared}} {{as early as}} the 1870s in a design by Achille Victor Emile Daubresse. Most roof prism binoculars use either the Abbe-Koenig prism (named after Ernst Karl Abbe and Albert Koenig and patented by Carl Zeiss in 1905) or the Schmidt-Pechan prism (invented in 1899) designs to erect the image and fold the optical path. They have objective lenses that are approximately in line with <b>the</b> <b>eyepieces.</b>|$|R
50|$|An Amici roof prism, {{named for}} its inventor, the Italian {{astronomer}} Giovanni Amici, {{is a type of}} reflecting prism used to deviate a beam of light by 90° while simultaneously inverting the image.

The non-dispersive Amici roof prism {{should not be confused with}} the dispersive Amici prism.|$|R
25|$|One of Wheatstone's most ingenious devices was the 'Polar clock,' {{exhibited}} at {{the meeting of the}} British Association in 1848. It is based on the fact discovered by Sir David Brewster, that the light of the sky is polarised in a plane at an angle of ninety degrees from the position of the sun. It follows that by discovering that plane of polarisation, and measuring its azimuth with respect to the north, the position of the sun, although beneath the horizon, could be determined, and the apparent solar time obtained. The clock consisted of a spyglass, having a Nicol (double-image) prism for an eyepiece, and a thin plate of selenite for an object-glass. When the tube was directed to the North Pole—that is, parallel to the Earth's axis—and the prism of <b>the</b> <b>eyepiece</b> turned until no colour was seen, the angle of turning, as shown by an index moving with the prism over a graduated limb, gave the hour of day. The device is of little service in a country where watches are reliable; but it formed part of the equipment of the 1875–1876 North Polar expedition commanded by Captain Nares.|$|E

50|$|For {{operations}} during night time, {{the observation}} devices could be disconnected {{and replaced by}} an active infrared night vision device of the TKN-1 type or similar. The infra-red searchlight attached to the commander's dome had to be coupled to the night vision device with bolts and electric wires leading inside the tank. For {{this one of the}} four vision blocks had to be removed, creating a gap to pull the wires through. However, the infra-red floodlight could effectively illuminate only at distances up to 400 meters with a x2.75 magnification. Though the much larger gunner's infra-red floodlight helped to see effectively up to 800 meters, but only at the frontal arch of the turret. Such early night vision devices had many drawbacks, and the TKN-1 was no exception. The bright infra-red floodlights could be easily spotted by modern passive infra-red night vision devices and thermal sights at ranges exceeding the visibility of the active infra-red devices like the TKN-1. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>eyepieces</b> of <b>the</b> TKN-1 lay very close to the body of the TPKU-2B what made the commander's rubber frontal headrest an obstacle, without which keeping the eyes on <b>the</b> <b>eyepieces</b> during movement of the vehicle very difficult.|$|R
40|$|The twofold {{objective}} {{of this study is}} (1) to identify and give a brief review of the historical development of the various designs of early (pre- 1850) telescope eyepieces, and (2) to determine by measurements and calculations the axial and lateral chromatic aberrations of a number of extant eyepieces from that period in order to provide basic data on which to judge the relative quality of different eyepiece forms. Eight distinct types of eyepieces containing one to five lens elements are discussed and illustrated. The second objective was addressed by measuring the focal lengths of the individual lens elements and the lens spacings in each <b>eyepiece.</b> <b>The</b> data were processed by a ray-tracing program that yields the chromatic aberration (CA) and focal length of each of <b>the</b> <b>eyepieces.</b> Twenty-one telescopes from that period were studied in this way. Similar calculations were also made using data available in the literature on several additional historic telescopes. The conclusions drawn from the data are: (1) Telescopes with Galilean eyepieces have a smaller CA than those with Keplerian or Huygens <b>eyepieces.</b> (2) <b>The</b> two- lens Keplerian terrestrial eyepieces are demonstrated to have larger axial and lateral CA than any of <b>the</b> other <b>eyepiece</b> types. (3) Calculations from examples of telescopes by Divini and Campani for which data were available indicate that while the axial CAs of the two were the same, Campani’s instrument had a much smaller lateral CA. (4) Five element eyepieces were found to be better corrected for CA than the early four-lens systems that replaced them. (5) This study tends to confirm the speculation that the reason makers of early achromatic telescopes overcorrected the objective lenses was to compensate for the CA of <b>the</b> <b>eyepieces...</b>|$|R
