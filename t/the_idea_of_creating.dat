Serious trials based on automata, such as El Ajedrecista, were too complex and limited to be useful.|$|E

5|$|Development of Dark Forces {{was led by}} Daron Stinnett. The {{programming}} was led by Ray Gresko, and {{the graphics}} and storyline by Justin Chin. Production began in September 1993, {{at a time when}} the first-person shooter genre was very popular. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> a first-person shooter in the Star Wars universe was inspired by fan mods of Doom which had levels set on the Death Star. The developers of Dark Forces wanted to adapt the FPS format into an adventure game. To do this they introduced puzzles and strategy, along with a Star Wars plot. Originally Luke Skywalker was intended to be the main character in the game, however the developers realized that this would add constraints to gameplay and storyline. Instead a new character, Kyle Katarn, was created.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge {{stemmed from}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> {{a horde of}} creatures {{and the ability to}} care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. The choice was to be made by the player. From this point, Vogel {{considered}} who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was designed so that {{it would be possible to}} complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to bring {{together}} <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> generalizations or "models" to explain and teach principles of city structure and the work that is being done to discover how people view and remember cities. If some method can be found to provide images to go along with the existing models, then the teaching of city structure and organization will be a much more productive effort, for students remember visual characteristics of cities long after they have forgotten such things as maps of land use intensity. The "image-model" city classification system represents a preliminary step in that direction...|$|R

In the summer of 1862 the Ottomans sent a military contingent of 12,000 men to Zeitun to reassert government control. The force, however, was held at bay by the Armenians and, through French mediation, the first Zeitun resistance was brought to a close.

5|$|Hailing from Pomona, California, {{the members}} of Bonded by Blood met through mutual friends. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> a band was {{conceived}} by lead vocalist Jose Barrales, a singer with hardcore punk and crossover thrash backgrounds, influenced by groups like The Blackheads, Cryptic Slaughter, D.R.I. and Black Flag. He always had an appreciation for heavy metal music, {{but it was not}} until a friend recommended him to listen to Exodus that Barrales got into the thrash metal subgenre. Exodus' debut album Bonded by Blood had a profound impact on Barrales, and it was inspiring to the point he idealized the creation of a thrash metal band, as he had noticed that there were few or even no groups in this genre in the music scene.|$|E
5|$|Nora Belahcen Fitzgerald first {{conceived}} of <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> an organization to help Morocco's underprivileged women through career training in 2006 after meeting {{a single mother}} begging on the street who lived on 2030 dirhams per day (about €2.70, $3.40 in 2006). Belahcen Fitzgerald {{was inspired by the}} Association Solidarité Féminine, which helps single mothers overcome poverty and social stigma by providing them with shelter, counselling, and vocational training. She decided to begin helping women by teaching them to make baked goods in her family's language center. This proved to be successful, and the participants were able to make more money using their new skills than by begging. In 2008, Belahcen Fitzgerald began hiring underprivileged Moroccan women to cook for events she organized for her friends.|$|E
5|$|Persona began {{development}} {{after the release}} of Shin Megami Tensei If..., with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> a subseries around the positively received high school setting of If.... Multiple staff members from previous Megami Tensei titles were involved in development, including character designer Kazuma Kaneko, and director Kouji Okada. Multiple aspects of the story, including Personas and the character Philemon, were taken from Jungian psychology, while Kaneko's character designs were based on both staff members, and celebrities and fictional characters of the time. Reception to the game has generally been positive, with most praising its approach to the genre, while its navigation and localization were criticized. Its PSP port shared most points of praise with the original, along with the improved localization, but also drew negative comments for its by-then dated mechanics and graphics.|$|E

The series was intended to follow the film soon after but failed to do so when the Nine Network refused to pick it up. It eventually went into production in 2000. The film starred Jack Thompson as Jack McLeod, Kym Wilson as Tess Silverman McLeod and Tammy MacIntosh as Claire McLeod.|$|R

At first, the creative team considered putting Diagon Alley within Islands of Adventure. Eventually they decided that the London and Hogsmeade environments should not be visible between one another. As a result, Woodbury proposed building Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida and then connecting the two Harry Potter-themed lands with the Hogwarts Express train.|$|E
5|$|In early 1968, the Soviet Ministry of Defence {{decided to}} develop a {{specialised}} shturmovik armoured assault aircraft {{in order to provide}} close air support for the Soviet Ground Forces. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> a ground-support aircraft came about after analysing the experience of ground-attack (shturmovaya) aviation during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The Soviet fighter-bombers in service or under development at the time (Su-7, Su-17, MiG-21 and MiG-23) did not meet the requirements for close air support of the army. They lacked essential armour plating to protect the pilot and vital equipment from ground fire and missile hits, and their high flight speeds made it difficult for the pilot to maintain visual contact with a target. Having taken into account these problems, Pavel Sukhoi and a group of leading specialists in the Sukhoi Design Bureau started preliminary design work in a comparatively short period of time, with the assistance of leading institutes of the Ministry of the Aviation Industry and the Ministry of Defence.|$|E

5|$|Peter Molyneux and James Leach {{came up with}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> a Theme game {{based on}} a hospital, but Molyneux was not {{directly}} involved in development due to his work on Dungeon Keeper. Designers originally planned to include four distinct gameplay modes corresponding to historical time periods, but this was dropped due to time pressures on the team. Multiplayer support with up to four players was added in a patch. The game received a generally positive reception, with reviewers praising the graphics and humour in particular. Theme Hospital was a commercial success, selling over 4 million copies worldwide, and was ported to the PlayStation in 1998. A Sega Saturn version was in development, but cancelled. The game was re-released on GOG.com in 2012 and Origin in 2015, and the PlayStation version was released on the PlayStation Network in Europe in 2008, Japan in 2009, and North America in 2010.

5|$|Peter Molyneux {{stated that}} {{he came up with}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>creating</b> Theme Park because he felt the {{business}} genre was worth pursuing. He said that Theme Park is a game he had always wanted to create, and wanted to avoid the mistakes of his earlier business simulation game, The Entrepreneur: he wanted to create a business simulation game and make it fun so people would want to play it. In an interview, he explained that the primary reason he created Theme Park was because he wanted players to create their dream Theme Park. Another reason is he wanted players to understand the kind of work running one entails. The three difficulty settings enable players to choose the desired depth: simply having fun creating a theme park, or making all the business decisions too. Molyneux stated that the most difficult part to program was the visitors' behaviour.|$|E
