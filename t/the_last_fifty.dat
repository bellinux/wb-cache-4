5|$|There are {{specific}} instances where properties {{usually do not}} merit listing in the National Register. As a general rule, cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, moved structures, reconstructed historic buildings, commemorative properties, and properties that have achieved significance during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> years are not qualified for listing on the Register. There are, however, exceptions to all the preceding; mitigating circumstances allow properties classified {{in one of those}} groups to be included.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{resurgence}} in popularity since {{the success of}} Don't Believe The Truth was highlighted in February 2008 when, in a poll to find the fifty greatest British albums of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> years conducted by Q magazine and HMV, two Oasis albums were voted first and second (Definitely Maybe and (What's The Story) Morning Glory? respectively). Two other albums by the band appeared in the list – Don't Believe The Truth came in at number fourteen, and the album that has previously been heavily criticised {{by some of the}} media, Be Here Now, made the list at No.22.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} other {{different}} types of historic preservation associated with {{the properties of the}} National Register of Historic Places that cannot be classified as either simple buildings and historic districts. Through the National Park Service, the National Register of Historic Places publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating and applying the criteria for evaluation of {{different types of}} properties. Although the criteria are always the same, the manner they are applied may differ slightly, depending upon the type of property involved. The National Register bulletins describe application of the criteria for aids to navigation, historic battlefields, archaeological sites, aviation properties, cemeteries, and burial places, historic designed landscapes, mining sites, post offices, properties associated with significant persons, properties achieving significance within <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> years, rural historic landscapes, traditional cultural properties, and vessels and shipwrecks.|$|E

However the battle between British and French forces was only for control of south India. The capture and the defence of Arcot by handful of British troops and Sepoy under the command of Robert Clive against enormous forces {{was one of the most}} remarkable battles fought by the British. <b>The</b> siege <b>lasted</b> <b>fifty</b> days, ending 15 November 1751.|$|R

Rouletted and Amphorae wares, made in the Roman empire and brought by traders, have been excavated in several parts of Tamil Nadu, including the Pandyan country. These imported wares are dated to the early centuries of the Christian Era.|$|E
50|$|Depopulation {{has been}} a long-standing problem of the commune as scarceness of {{agricultural}} resources has driven the inhabitants, historically farmers and herdsmen, to move out to more populated areas, and within <b>the</b> <b>last</b> hundred and <b>fifty</b> years the village census has declined by over 94%.|$|R

40|$|In <b>the</b> <b>lasts</b> <b>fifty</b> years <b>the</b> {{tremendous}} {{evolution of}} modern technologies has gradually unbalanced the equilibrium between {{the production and}} the consumption of energy. Traditional energy resources, like coal, oil and natural gases, are no longer sufficient to satisfy the demand of energy without spoiling earth environment. Renewable energies have attracted {{a lot of attention}} because they are potential solution to this important problem. In particular photovoltaic solar cells are considered the most promising technology for a low-cost and environmentally friendly energy production. However, in order to exploit these technologies in real world applications, the complete physics of solar cells must be understood. Stability is one of the fundamental aspects and is related to the processes that regulate the energy conversion, both in long-term degradation as well in electrical stability. In this work the stability of two emerging categories of solar cells is thoroughly addressed: organic photovoltaics and organometal-halide perovskite. In organic photovoltaics understanding the stability and degradation mechanisms of photoactive blends is required to achieve long device lifetimes. Recent reports on organic solar cells presenting power conversion efficiencies exceeding 10...|$|R
25|$|It {{details the}} struggles of a Mexican-American girl born in Indian captivity, Lola, in an American society obsessed with class, religion, race and gender. The first ten {{chapters}} narrate the attack on Fort Sumter (18571861), and flashbacks are meant to take the readers back further than that time line, such as the kidnapping of Lola's mother (1846). <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> chapters chronicle the events that {{took place during the}} Civil War (18611864). Each chapter focuses on a particular character and is told from an omniscient point of view.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part, a draw occurs when {{it appears that}} neither side will win. Draws are codified by various rules of chess {{including}} stalemate (when the player to move has no legal move and is not in check), threefold repetition (when the same position occurs three times with the same player to move), and the fifty-move rule (when <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> successive moves made by both players contain no capture or pawn move). A draw also occurs when neither player has sufficient material to checkmate the opponent or when no sequence of legal moves can lead to checkmate.|$|E
25|$|Shriver was an admirable, principled, and {{conscientious}} man who {{respected the}} dignity and sanctity of human life, and he also {{happened to be a}} contemporary and in-law of Kennedy. Not only did Shriver represent a “link” with JFK, but he represented a particular culture of white ethnic Catholic Democratic politics that has been gradually disappearing for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> years. A pro-life Catholic, Shriver had been {{a founding member of the}} America First Committee, and more famously he was also on the 1972 antiwar ticket with George McGovern. In short, he represented much of what was good in the Democratic Party of his time.|$|E

50|$|Pianos have {{a limited}} lifetime, usually {{measured}} in decades. However, different parts have different lifetimes: for example, on a heavily used but well-cared-for instrument (e.g. in a concert hall), <b>the</b> hammers might <b>last</b> {{less than five years}} while <b>the</b> soundboard might <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> years and more. Regular replacement of worn parts can therefore extend a piano's lifetime by decades - even indefinitely, provided that the piano's structural support (i.e. the frame) remains sound (and sometimes the frame can also be repaired).|$|R

In {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, Falkirk was at the centre of the iron and steel industry, underpinned by the Carron Company in nearby Carron. The company was responsible for making carronades for the Royal Navy and later manufactured pillar boxes. Within <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> years, heavy industry has waned, and the economy relies increasingly on retail and tourism. Despite this, Falkirk remains the home of many international companies like Alexander Dennis; the largest bus production company in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Songs {{and music}} were a natural {{extension}} of this interest in words and {{her love of}} music began early in life as she listened to her father, Walter Pendleton Stringfellow, sing. She had access to a scrapbook of folk songs collected by her grandmother, Rosalie Cope Stringfellow. She began her music career collecting folksongs and performing them, first with her husband Jim in the late 1950s, then later on her own. It was during this time that the Smithsonian Institution's Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage recorded Rosalie and Jim performing her collection of traditional songs. Many of these have been released by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings in various compilation albums throughout <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>fifty</b> years.|$|E
