500|$|Frank, {{who worked}} on the Vioxx case early in his career, was called [...] "perhaps the loudest critic of the Vioxx litigation," [...] and debated trial lawyer Mark Lanier about the issue. Frank {{continued}} his criticism in a 2011 article. [...] "A final sordid chapter in the tort litigation over Vioxx closed, as Judge Eldon Fallon divvied up $315 million to be paid to the plaintiffs' attorneys {{who worked on}} the litigation. This sum was in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $1.2 billion already paid to such attorneys. When you add in what Merck paid to plaintiffs and for its own attorneys, the Vioxx litigation cost it more than $7 billion. Yet Merck almost certainly did not do anything wrong. Even as an unsympathetic corporate defendant, it won the vast majority of cases that went to trial, and another dozen or more that plaintiffs' attorneys dismissed on the eve of trial rather than risk the publicity of a certain loss. Even in the handful of cases that Merck lost at trial, such as the $253 million verdict in the Ernst case that generated much of the publicity that led {{to tens of thousands of}} cases being filed, Merck won reversals of most of those on appeal because the verdicts were based on conclusory junk-science expert testimony that should not have been admitted into evidence." [...] Lanier defended the settlement as fair.|$|E
