Influences of jazz fusion were also noted by a contemporary review by The New York Times. In a 1995 interview with Pulse, Björk {{was reluctant to}} listing other female vocalists as an inspiration, stating: [...] "I've never really compared myself to other people, not because I'm too big-headed or I've got a minority complex, but because I know I just can't sing like anyone else." [...] Nevertheless, in 2015 Björk acknowledged that as she grew older, she understood [...] "that music like Kate Bush has really influenced [...]" [...] The Pulse article also read: [...] "a lot of Björk's early influences were books (George Bataille's Story of the Eye, Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita) and films (Tampopo, Star Wars, The Tin Drum) available internationally.

2500|$|The above {{discovery}} {{goes right}} to <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> {{as to what}} exactly the -body problem is physically: as Newton realized, it {{is not sufficient to}} just specify the initial position and velocity, or three orbital positions either, to determine a planet's true orbit: the gravitational interactive forces have to be known too. Thus came the awareness and rise of the -body [...] "problem" [...] in the early 17th century. These gravitational attractive forces do conform to Newton's Laws of Motion and to his Law of Universal Gravitation, but the many multiple ( [...] -body) interactions have historically made any exact solution intractable. Ironically, this conformity led to the wrong approach.|$|E

But she has gone to <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> asserting that monetary union cannot be fudged, that it is incompatible with the French nation-state." [...] He went on to claim that Le Pen won 18% of the vote by campaigning to pull France out of the euro and, with reference to a poll finding only 3% of French voters consider immigration the main issue, that the National Front cannot owe its popularity to the issue. Rather, Cockburn stressed [...] "The number-one issue is employment." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{consequences}} of relativity, {{such as the}} change of ordinary concepts of space and time, {{as well as the}} introduction of non-Euclidean geometry in general relativity, were criticized by some philosophers of different philosophical schools. It was characteristic for many philosophical critics that they had insufficient knowledge of the mathematical and formal basis of relativity, which led to the criticisms often missing <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> For example, relativity was misinterpreted as some form of relativism. However, this is misleading as it was emphasized by Einstein or Planck. On one hand it's true that space and time became relative, and the inertial frames of reference are handled on equal footing. On the other hand, the theory makes natural laws invariant—examples are the constancy of the speed of light, or the covariance of Maxwell's equations. Consequently, Felix Klein (1910) called it the [...] "invariant theory of the Lorentz group" [...] instead of relativity theory, and Einstein (who reportedly used expressions like [...] "absolute theory") sympathized with this expression as well.|$|E
