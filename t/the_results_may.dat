5|$|The overall {{growth rate}} of the silky shark is {{moderate}} compared to other shark species and similar for both sexes, though it varies significantly between individuals. One central Pacific study has found females growing much slower than males, but <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>may</b> have been skewed by missing data from large females. The highest reported growth rates are from sharks in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the lowest from sharks off northeastern Taiwan. Males and females reach sexual maturity at ages of 6–10years and 7–12+years, respectively. Sharks from more temperate waters may grow slower and mature later than those in warmer regions. The maximum lifespan is at least 22years.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{posed by}} the ratio is that the {{multiple}} specimens studied, died in the same place, but probably not in a sudden mass-death and so do not represent a single herd or contemporary population. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>may</b> have been distorted by a greater chance for robust animals of getting fossilised or discovered. In an earlier study by Galton in 1982, {{it was suggested that}} individual difference in the sacral rib count of both Kentrosaurus and Dacentrurus might be an indication of dimorphism: females would have had an extra pair of sacral ribs, having also the first sacral vertebra connected to the ilium, in addition to the subsequent four sacrals.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) {{occurs when}} gas, {{which has been}} breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the body tissues, forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>may</b> range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system, paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers.

5|$|Despite the {{excitement}} surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall, and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>may</b> {{have been worse}} than hoped for by the tour's promoters. Philadelphia won only two of their fifteen matches, losing nine and earning a draw in the remaining four. After their win against Sussex, the only other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match, King took 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scored 46 runs. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, King proved himself {{to be the best}} bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs, more {{than anyone else in the}} team, taking 72 wickets with a bowling average of a little over 24 runs. In addition to his bowling, King scored 441 runs as a batsman at a batting average of just over 20.|$|E

25|$|CFD {{can give}} {{an insight into}} flow {{patterns}} that are difficult, expensive or impossible to study using experimental methods. Experiments can give a quantitative description of flow phenomena using measurements for one quantity at a time, at {{a limited number of}} points and time instances.

Simulations can give a prediction of flow phenomena using CFD software for all desired quantities, with high resolution in space and time and virtually any problem and realistic operating conditions.

However, in February2012, reports came out that <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>may</b> have been caused by a loose fiber optic cable attached to one of the atomic clocks which measured the departure and arrival times of the neutrinos.

25|$|In 1897 Patterson captained {{his next}} tour of England. The tour {{undertaken}} by the Philadelphian cricketers was very ambitious. Though <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>may</b> have been less satisfactory than hoped for by promoters, the tour was arranged mainly for educational purposes and few {{of those on the}} American side expected to win many matches.

Starting on June 7 at Oxford, the tour lasted for two months and ended in late July at The Oval. While it initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Patterson and the Philadelphians met the full Sussex team at Brighton on June 17. The team fared very well and soundly beat the English side. Patterson, though, had a relatively poor performance scoring only eight runs and not taking any wickets. The star of the match was undoubtedly John Barton King.|$|E
