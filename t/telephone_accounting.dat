50|$|At 21 {{he began}} working at the Bell <b>Telephone</b> <b>accounting</b> {{division}} and, before even graduating from law school, he {{was admitted to the}} Missouri bar. In 1913, he was married to Freda Josephine Prill of Kansas City. At age 24, Lynn took and passed the Missouri certified public accountant exam, earning the highest score on that exam ever made. Soon after, {{he began working}} for the largest underwriting insurance company in the country, U.S. Epperson, and quickly worked his way up in the company. By the age of 30, Lynn had taken out a significant and risky loan to buy the U.S. Epperson Underwriting Company. That step launched a successful business career that included insurance underwriting, oil well and orchard ownership, and large investments in the railroad business. He would become a prominent businessman in the Kansas City area as head of vast oil interests and as president of the world's largest reciprocal fire-insurance exchange.|$|E

In a further 7.7% of incidents, the patient was taken to a non-emergency hospital department such as a community hospital or minor injuries unit. The remaining incidents resulted in a patient being taken to a hospital emergency department, thus the majority of incidents (56.8%) resulted in a patient not being conveyed.|$|R

[...] These rights may be taken for granted today, but the legal right of a married woman in the U.S. to use her own name (rather than her husband's name) was denied by many officials and courts until a 9 Oct 1972 court decision, as documented in the 1977 book Mrs Man, by Una Stannard.|$|R
50|$|The first {{property}} management {{systems in the}} hospitality industry appeared {{on the market in}} the 1980s. In hotels a {{property management}} system, also known as a PMS, is a comprehensive software application used to cover objectives like coordinating the operational functions of front office, sales and planning, reporting etc. The system automates hotel operations like guest bookings, guest details, online reservations, posting of charges, point of sale, <b>telephone,</b> <b>accounts</b> receivable, sales and marketing, events, food and beverage costing, materials management, HR and payroll, maintenance management, quality management and other amenities. Hotel property management systems may have integrated or interface with third-party solutions like central reservation systems and revenue or yield management systems, online booking engine, back office, point of sale, door-locking, housekeeping optimization, pay-TV, energy management, payment card authorization and channel management systems.|$|R
40|$|Network {{intrusion}} {{occurs when}} a criminal gains access to a customer's telephone, computer, bank, or other type of account. Detecting network intrusion is an important problem that has received little attention in the statistics literature. This article proposes a Markov modulated nonhomogeneous Poisson process (MMNHPP) to monitor transactions on a customer's account for deviations from the customer's established behavior patterns. An important benefit of the MMNHPP {{is its ability to}} model the posterior probability of a criminal presence as a function of time. The MMNHPP combines aspects of the Markov modulated Poisson process and the nonhomogeneous Poisson process to model point processes exhibiting both regular patterns and irregular bursts of activity. The need to accommodate both types of behavior is demonstrated using data from two <b>telephone</b> <b>accounts.</b> MMNHPP parameters are sampled from their posterior distribution given a set of observed event times using an MCMC algorithm.

40|$|Patient-associated {{delay in}} seeking medical care in persons with acute {{coronary}} disease is receiving increasing importance given the time-dependent {{benefits associated with}} myocardial reperfusion therapies. We examined the extent of concordance between self-reported information about prehospital delay provided by patients to hospital staff {{at the time of}} hospitalization for coronary disease compared with information obtained from a telephone interview approximately 2 months following hospital discharge. The sample included 316 patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina at 43 hospitals who had delay time information available from both data sources. The extent of agreement between the medical record and <b>telephone</b> <b>accounts</b> of delay was 47 % in the total study sample, 53 % in patients with acute myocardial infarction, and 40 % in patients with unstable angina.

40|$|Some ofthe ideas {{expressed}} in this article were initially set forth a decade ago in Quarantelli (1997, 1999). Preface This paper focuses {{on a number of}} the major problematical or negative aspects of the computer based information/communication revolution ofthe last two decades or so. While much of what we write is equally applicable to many other areas of life where computers are central elements, we confine ourselves to the implications for disaster planning and crisis managing. Given the focus and the title of our paper, we want to preface our remarks by giving five concrete examples of rather positive consequences in disasters and crises {{as a result of the}} information/communication revolution we will be discussing in most ofthe article. For instance, just before Katrina impacted New Orleans, a member of the mayor's staff set up an Internet <b>telephone</b> <b>account.</b> Two days after impact he found a working socket in the conference room of the hotel where the city had set up its operational center, and was able to link together eight telephone lines though his laptop computer.

Similarly, the numbers of subscribers to data/internet services are 4,667,536 which represents 17.53% penetration rate. Most of the data service is accounted by GPRS users.

In 1984, after the breakup of AT&T, Drenttel won and managed the cellular <b>telephones</b> advertising <b>accounts</b> for two of the regional Bell Operating Companies, Ameritech and Pacific Telesis. His four years of international experience at Saatchi & Saatchi included one year managing P&G Canada accounts and three years as a managing director of Saatchi & Saatchi Italy, during which time agency billings and staff increased five-fold. Drenttel left Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising as senior vice president in 1985.|$|R
40|$|Many {{developed}} and developing countries have approached telecommunications reform by opening the market for mobile telephones to private participation and competition. One result of this strategy is the astounding worldwide growth in mobile communications, with developing countries accounting for the fastest growth. It is believed that mobile phones are complementary to fixed-line telephony in developed countries, but {{they appear to be}} substitutes for main lines in developing regions where access is low or non-existent. This paper examines the relationship between mobile and main-line <b>telephones</b> by <b>accounting</b> for reverse causality between them in an environment with low levels of development. The results suggest that mobile telephones act as a competitive force encouraging fixed-line providers to improve access. However, overtime, as mobile usage becomes more widespread, it becomes less of a complement in consumption and its role as a substitute starts to emerge. Between 1985 and 1997, the complementary effect outweighs the substitution effect even where fixed-line access is low...|$|R
