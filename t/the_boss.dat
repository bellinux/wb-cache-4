5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Boss</b> rescues Kinzie {{from her}} nightmare, she devises {{a plan to}} crash the simulation, which will force the Zin to draw power from their ship to keep it running, thus {{weakening}} the ship itself and creating an opening for the Saints to enter. Working together, the remaining Saints manage to overload the simulation, shutting it down just as <b>the</b> <b>Boss</b> escapes. Assaulting Zinyak's ship, <b>the</b> <b>Boss</b> finds power armor emulating the powers {{they had in the}} simulation, and confronts Zinyak in his throne room. While the entire Zin Empire watches, Zinyak and <b>the</b> <b>Boss</b> battle each other. With help from the Saints, <b>the</b> <b>Boss</b> kills Zinyak by tearing his head off and emerges victorious. Impressed, the Zin forces surrender to <b>the</b> <b>Boss,</b> who becomes the new head of the Zin Empire.|$|E

Eventually, <b>the</b> Mafia <b>boss</b> runs out of ammunition again and tries to reload. <b>The</b> Yakuza <b>boss</b> seizes <b>the</b> chance and puts the P38 to his head. He pulls the trigger but his gun is also empty. <b>The</b> Mafia <b>boss</b> swings his shotgun into the Yakuza’s stomach then discards it in favor of his switchblade. <b>The</b> Yakuza <b>boss</b> resorts to his sai once more. The two vigorously swing at each other, avoiding the other's weapon. <b>The</b> Yakuza <b>boss</b> kicks <b>the</b> Mafia <b>boss</b> into a boiler and charges at him, but <b>the</b> Mafia <b>boss</b> kicks back and pushes him away.

Eventually, <b>the</b> Mafia <b>boss</b> shoves <b>the</b> Yakuza <b>boss</b> into <b>the</b> boiler and tries to stab him. <b>The</b> Yakuza <b>boss</b> avoids <b>the</b> blow and <b>the</b> Mafia <b>boss</b> inadvertently punctures a pipe.

Just before <b>the</b> Yakuza <b>boss</b> can stab him with one of his sai, <b>the</b> Mafia <b>boss</b> pulls out his ice pick as a last resort and stabs the Yakuza’s arm, causing him to drop a sai. He seizes <b>the</b> Yakuza <b>boss</b> by his hair and slams his head into the punctured pipe, burning his face. He pulls <b>the</b> Yakuza <b>boss’s</b> head to <b>the</b> side so that his neck is exposed and slowly drives in the ice pick.

5|$|As the {{simulation}} begins to weaken under the Saints' influence, Zinyak floods virtual Steelport with copies of gang members <b>the</b> <b>Boss</b> has faced in the past. Kinzie determines that the copies {{are being made}} from someone's memory, leading <b>the</b> <b>Boss</b> to conclude Johnny Gat, who was seemingly killed during the events of Saints Row: The Third, is still alive and trapped within {{the simulation}}. Despite protests from Kinzie and Matt that rescuing Johnny will reveal their location to Zinyak, <b>the</b> <b>Boss</b> rescues Johnny from his nightmare of Aisha's death and gets {{him back to the}} ship. Johnny explains that during the fight in which he was presumed killed, he was actually abducted by Zinyak years in advance of their invasion, as Zinyak had concluded that Johnny could have single-handedly stopped him if left on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Next, Kinzie leads a {{successful}} effort {{to drive the}} Deckers out of Steelport, causing Miller to abandon the Syndicate and return to his home country after losing a virtual fight to <b>the</b> <b>Boss.</b> Finally, alongside Muerte, <b>the</b> <b>Boss</b> enters Murderbrawl XXXI and humiliates Killbane by defeating him in physical combat.

5|$|The {{team had}} {{originally}} {{wanted to create}} the game's boss battles in-house around the game's similar elements of player choice, with their initial design inspired by <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> fights in Metal Gear Solid. As the development on the story and gameplay framework took priority, boss battles became less and less of a focus. It eventually reached a point when the main development team could not complete them {{in time for the}} game's release. The team contemplated cutting them, but that would have negatively impacted the story and other areas of the game's design. In the end, development of <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> battles was outsourced to Grip Entertainment. Having been given access to the game's engine, Grip Entertainment were given the task of creating <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> battles and incorporating them into the framework of Human Revolution. For this, they needed to incorporate their own technology into the system, working from Eidos' specifications while bringing their own development style to bear on the project. They also attempted to balance <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> fights' action-focused approach with the other elements within Human Revolution so it would be accessible to all players.|$|E

When Drake reaches <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> arena, he starts to decipher the pages of the Thievius Racoonus, then Sly appears and explains he's the rightful owner of the pages that Nathan possesses. Drake refuses and Sly mocks his abilities in an attempt to intimidate him, as a result Drake responds insultingly and the two battle. After defeating <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> in the game, Nathan returns to the same island as before and using the All-Star Power he obtained from <b>the</b> <b>boss,</b> he greatly enhanced Sully's plane, as the screen turns to black, Drake randomly says 'I punched a chicken'.|$|E
