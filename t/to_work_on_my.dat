500|$|As a shopworker, Bondfield was {{expected}} to work between 80 and 100 hours a week for 51 weeks in the year, and might be sent out late at night to check that rival shops had closed before her employer would do so. She began to record her experiences, {{in a series of}} articles and stories that she wrote under the pseudonym [...] "Grace Dare", for the shopworkers' monthly magazine The Shop Assistant. She wrote surreptitiously, at night: [...] "I would light my half-penny dip , hiding its glare by means of a towel and set <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> monthly article". In 1896 she was recruited by the Women's Industrial Council (WIC) as an undercover agent, working in various shops while secretly recording every aspect of shop life. Her accounts of squalor and exploitation were published in articles under the [...] "Grace Dare" [...] name, in both The Shop Assistant and the Daily Chronicle newspaper, and provided the basis for a WIC report on shopworkers' conditions published in 1898.|$|E

500|$|West, who had {{previously}} recorded at Avex for 808s & Heartbreak, block-booked the studio's three session rooms simultaneously for 24 hours a day <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. According to Noah Callahan-Bever, who visited West during the recording sessions, [...] "when he hits a creative wall... he heads to another studio room to make progress on another song". West never slept a full night at the [...] "glass-enclosed mansion" [...] house he had rented, opting instead to take power naps in a studio chair or couch 90 minutes at a time. Engineers worked around the clock, as West bounced from room to room. This assiduous work ethic led to West employing two private chefs, one for hot food, and one for cold food.Before recording in the afternoon, West {{and most of his}} crew played games of 21 against locals at the Honolulu YMCA for leisure. Kid Cudi smoked marijuana in preparation and worked out on a treadmill, while RZA worked out in the weight room. West held breakfast each morning at his Diamond Head residence for his crew.|$|E
500|$|Though Pink Floyd {{turned down}} a {{contract}} worth £136million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting {{it ought to be}} for a charity event only. However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen, stating: [...] "The [...] rehearsals convinced me [...] it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just... I've been there, I've done it." [...] In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed by Gino Castaldo from the Italian newspaper La Repubblica; the resulting article declared: [...] "Patience for fans in mourning. The news is official. Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased." [...] Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: [...] "It's over... I've had enough. I'm 60 years old...it is much more comfortable <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own." [...] Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite with the surviving former members.|$|E
500|$|Faust was {{initially}} hired by Hasbro {{to create a}} pitch bible for the show, allowing her to get additional help with conceptualization. Faust said she was [...] "extremely skeptical" [...] about taking the job at first because she had always found shows based on girls' toys to be boring and unrelatable. My Little Pony {{was one of her}} favorite childhood toys, but she was disappointed that her imagination at the time was nothing like the animated shows, in which the characters, according to Faust, [...] "just had endless tea parties, giggled over nothing and defeated villains by either sharing with them or crying". With the chance <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Little Pony, she hoped to prove that [...] "cartoons for girls don't have to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness". To do this, she incorporated into the design of the characters and the show many elements that contradicted idealized stereotypes of girls, such as diverse personalities, the message that friends can be different and can get into arguments but still be friends, and the idea that girls should not be limited by what others say they can or cannot do. Elements of the characters' personalities and the show's settings were based on her own childhood imagination of the ponies' adventures, in part inspired by the animated shows that her brothers would watch while growing up, such as Transformers and she considered that she was making Friendship Is Magic [...] "for me as an eight-year-old". Faust still aimed for the characters to be [...] "relatable" [...] characters, using stereotypical [...] "icons of girliness" [...] (such as the waif or the bookworm) in order to broaden the appeal of the characters for the young female audience.|$|E

40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{overview}} and motivates {{the design of}} a C++ framework for object recognition using channel-coded feature maps. The code was produced in connection <b>to</b> the <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> PhD thesis Channel-Coded Feature Maps for Object Recognition and Machine Learning. The package contains algorithms ranging from basic image processing routines to specific complex algorithms for creating channel-coded feature maps through piecewise polynomials. Much emphasis has been put in creating a flexible framework using virtual interfaces. This makes it easy e. g. ~to switch between different image primitives detectors or learning methods in an object recognizer. Some common design choices include an image class with a convenient but fast pixel access, a configurable assert macro for error handling and a common base class for object ownership management. The main computer vision algorithms are channel-coded feature maps (CCFMs) including their derivatives, single-sided colored lines, object detection using an abstract hypothesize-verify framework and tracking and pose estimation using locally weighted regression and CCFMs. The code is considered as having alpha status at best. It is available under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and is mainly intended for future research on the subject...|$|R
