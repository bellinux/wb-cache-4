25|$|There is {{a report}} <b>that</b> <b>Ives</b> also won the admiration of Gustav Mahler, {{who said that he}} was a true musical revolutionary. Reportedly, Mahler talked of premiering Ives' Third Symphony with the New York Philharmonic, but he soon died (in 1911) thus {{preventing}} the premiere. However, the source of this story is Ives himself; since Mahler died, {{there was no way to}} verify whether he had seen the score of the symphony or decided to perform it in the 1911–12 season. Nonetheless, it is known <b>that</b> <b>Ives</b> regularly attended New York Philharmonic concerts and probably heard Mahler conduct the Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall.|$|R
5000|$|Ives' biographer Jan Swafford {{notes that}} whilst {{it might be}} tempting to hear Variations on [...] "America" [...] as a satire, the {{probability}} is <b>that</b> <b>Ives</b> meant the work as a sincere exercise in variations for organ. He adds <b>that</b> whilst <b>Ives</b> was capable of musical jokes, they are usually considerably broader than here. Ives was not deaf to its comic potential however: he later noted that his father [...] "didn't {{let me do it}} much, as it made the boys laugh" [...] in church.|$|R
50|$|In the 1938 experiment, {{the maximum}} TDE {{was limited to}} 0.047 Å.

60|$|B. B. [severely] Blenkinsop: {{there is}} nothing that cannot be {{explained}} by science. What did I do? Did I fold my hands helplessly and say that the case could not be explained? By no means. I sat down and used my brains. I thought the case out on scientific principles. I asked myself why didnt the missionary die of typhoid on top of tetanus, and the beadle of tetanus on top of typhoid? Theres a problem for you, Ridgeon. Think, Sir Patrick. Reflect, Blenkinsop. Look at it without prejudice, Walpole. What is the real work of the anti-toxin? Simply to stimulate the phagocytes. Very well. But so long as you stimulate the phagocytes, what does it matter which particular sort of serum you use for the purpose? Haha! Eh? Do you see? Do you grasp it? Ever since <b>that</b> <b>Ive</b> used all sorts of anti-toxins absolutely indiscriminately, with perfectly satisfactory results. I inoculated the little prince with your stuff, Ridgeon, because I wanted to give you a lift; but two years ago I tried the experiment of treating a scarlet fever case with a sample of hydrophobia serum from the Pasteur Institute, and it answered capitally. It stimulated the phagocytes; and the phagocytes did the rest. That is why Sir Patrick's father found that inoculation cured all fevers. It stimulated the phagocytes.

5000|$|... “The {{middle section}} has a folklike {{simplicity}} and grace <b>that</b> <b>Ives</b> rarely allowed himself in orchestral music.” Ives tried to incorporate Puritan qualities into the music.

5000|$|Although {{there is}} no {{conclusive}} evidence <b>that</b> <b>Ives</b> and Gustav Mahler ever met, Mahler had seen the manuscript and talked of premiering the symphony with the New York Philharmonic.

According to this seductive construct, poverty and overpopulation in the Himalayas was leading to degradation of highland forests, erosion, and downstream flooding.

40|$|Charles Ives is {{commonly}} referred to as the 2 ̆ 2 Father of American Music. 2 ̆ 2 The implication is one <b>that</b> <b>Ives</b> himself would agree with, that he wrote purely American ideas from his own environment without reference to other styles or methods, in particular the widespread European tradition. Some composers, like Aaron Copland and Roger Sessions, created an American sonority by incorporating the concepts of musical construction they studied at the Paris Conservatoire. Ives, conversely, received no instruction in Europe, but the techniques so prevalent in the music of the French art song are found in certain songs written by Ives. Though he claimed no European influence, however, he used the late nineteenth century French song style in some of his songs, and he also borrowed tunes from the French composers. This study identifies significant trademarks of eighteenth century French song and the stylistic traits associated with a variety of prominent composers of the time. Ives 2 ̆ 7 s childhood musical influences, his church position, and his studies at Yale University will establish a relationship between Ives and the French musical ideas. The primary source for his songs is his collection entitled 114 Songs. Ives gathered his songs and put them into one collection which included Four French Songs. Through the analysis of several songs, including the four French songs written by Ives and three comparisons of songs by Ives with songs by French composers, it becomes evident <b>that</b> <b>Ives</b> was influenced, to a certain extent, by French music and used many techniques of the style...|$|R
