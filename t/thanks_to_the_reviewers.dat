40|$|The Calogero-Moser {{families}} are partitions of the irreducible characters {{of a complex}} reflection group derived from the block structure of the corresponding restricted rational Cherednik algebra. It was conjectured by Martino in 2009 that the generic Calogero-Moser families coincide with the generic Rouquier families, which are derived from the corresponding Hecke algebra. This conjecture is already proven for the whole infinite series G(m,p,n) and for the exceptional group G 4. A combination of theoretical facts with explicit computations enables us <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> generic Calogero-Moser families for the nine exceptional groups G 4, G 5, G 6, G 8, G 10, G 23 =H 3, G 24, G 25, and G 26.

I have asked a handful of very prominent economists to review the 2006 ERP. Reviewers were chosen to reflect expertise on what I guessed would be key issues. The ERP in prin-ciple should provide an accurate assessment of the consensus professional views of econo-mists on any given issue, based on the research to date. Reviewers were asked to evaluate whether the discussion in the ERP in fact accurately summarizes what we as economists know? Reviewers were given free rein over what material they would review in the ERP but were urged to focus on their areas of particular expertise. In the reviews that follow, Martin Feldstein reviews the overview chapter as well as top-ics relating to macroeconomics.

40|$|We {{consider}} the question "Is every nonzero generic degree a density- 1 -bounding generic degree?" By previous results I 2 either {{resolution of this}} question would answer an open question concerning {{the structure of the}} generic degrees: A positive result would prove that there are no minimal generic degrees, and a negative result would prove that there exist minimal pairs in the generic degrees. We consider several techniques for showing that the answer might be positive, and use those techniques to prove that a wide class of assumptions is sufficient to prove density- 1 -bounding. We also consider a historic difficulty in constructing a potential counterexample: By previous results I 1 any generic degree that is not density- 1 -bounding must be quasiminimal, so in particular, any construction of a non-density- 1 -bounding generic degree must use a method that is able to construct a quasiminimal generic degree. However, all previously known examples of quasiminimal sets are also density- 1, and so trivially density- 1 -bounding. We provide several examples of non-density- 1 sets that are quasiminimal. Using cofinite and mod-finite reducibility, we extend our results <b>to</b> <b>the</b> uniform coarse degrees, and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nonuniform generic degrees. We define all of the above terms, and we provide independent motivation for the study of each of them. Combined with a concurrently written paper of Hirschfeldt, Jockusch, Kuyper, and Schupp HJKS, this paper provides a characterization of the level of randomness required to ensure quasiminimality in the uniform and nonuniform coarse and generic degrees.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{study of the}} sign of the Green’s {{function}} related to a general linear nth-order operator, depending on a real parameter, Tn[M]Tn[M], coupled with the (k,n−k) (k,n−k) boundary value conditions. If the operator Tn[M¯]Tn[M¯] is disconjugate for a given M̄, we describe the interval of values on the real parameter M for which the Green’s function has constant sign. One of the extremes of the interval is given by the first eigenvalue of the operator Tn[M¯]Tn[M¯] satisfying (k,n−k) (k,n−k) conditions. The other extreme is related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> minimum (maximum) of the first eigenvalues of (k− 1,n−k+ 1) (k− 1,n−k+ 1) and (k+ 1,n−k− 1) (k+ 1,n−k− 1) problems. Moreover, if n−kn−k is even (odd) the Green’s function cannot be nonpositive (nonnegative). <b>To</b> illustrate <b>the</b> applicability of the obtained results, we calculate the parameter intervals of constant sign Green’s functions for particular operators. Our method avoids the necessity of calculating the expression of the Green’s function. We finalize the paper by presenting a particular equation in which it is shown that the disconjugation hypothesis on operator Tn[M¯]Tn[M¯] for a given M̄ cannot be eliminatedAlberto Cabada was partially supported by Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte, Spain, and FEDER, project MTM 2013 - 43014 -P.

40|$|Business {{investment}} per {{worker in}} 2014 in Canada is falling {{relative to the}} rest of the developed world and the United States. Ontario and Quebec have become the national laggards, with the lowest per-worker investment levels in Canada. In the energy and resources sectors, which have been leading Canada’s capital investment, the latest figures suggest a loss of momentum. Policymakers can and should boost private-sector investment, through such measures as prioritizing growth-friendly taxation, creating opportunities in infrastructure and electric power, and increasing the rewards for R&D and innovation. Every Canadian worker – from a manufacturing worker in Ontario, to a welder in the oil sands, to a lawyer in Montreal – needs tools, buildings and equipment. But workers in some sectors and some provinces are getting more new kit than others. And Canadian workers as a whole get less new physical capital than workers in similar countries. Recent figures suggest that, after several years of improved performance against international competitors, Canadian non-residential business investment per worker is again falling behind. Per-worker spending on new capital in Canada is lower than the average figure among reporting countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

40|$|Corn poppy (Papaver rhoeas), {{the most}} {{problematic}} broadleaf weed in winter cereals in Southern Europe, has developed {{resistance to the}} widely-used herbicide, 2, 4 -D. The first reported resistance mechanism in this species to 2, 4 -D was reduced translocation from treated leaves {{to the rest of}} the plant. However, the presence of other non-target site resistance (NTSR) mechanisms has not been investigated up to date. Therefore, the main objective of this research was to reveal if enhanced 2, 4 -D metabolism is also present in two Spanish resistant (R) populations to synthetic auxins. With this aim, HPLC experiments at two 2, 4 -D rates (600 and 2, 400 g ai ha− 1) were conducted to identify and quantify the metabolites produced and evaluate possible differences in 2, 4 -D degradation between resistant (R) and susceptible (S) plants. Secondarily, to determine the role of cytochrome P 450 in the resistance response, dose-response experiments were performed using malathion as its inhibitor. Three populations were used: S, only 2, 4 -D R (R- 703) and multiple R to 2, 4 -D and ALS inhibitors (R- 213). HPLC studies indicated the presence of two hydroxy metabolites in these R populations in shoots and roots, which were not detected in S plants, at both rates. Therefore, enhanced metabolism becomes a new NTSR mechanism in these two P. rhoeas populations from Spain. Results from the dose-response experiments also showed that pre-treatment of R plants with the cytochrome P 450 (P 450) inhibitor malathion reversed the phenotype to 2, 4 -D from resistant to susceptible in both R populations. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that a malathion inhibited P 450 is responsible of the formation of the hydroxy metabolites detected in the metabolism studies. This and previous research indicate that two resistant mechanisms to 2, 4 -D could be present in populations R- 703 and R- 213 : reduced translocation and enhanced metabolism. Future experiments are required to confirm these hypotheses, understand the role of P 450, and the relationship between both NTSR mechanisms. On this basis, selection pressure with synthetic auxins bears the risk of promoting the evolution enhanced metabolism in Papaver rhoeas.

40|$|Nadal-Romero [...] . [et. al. ]Precipitation {{has been}} {{recognized}} as one of the main factors driving soil erosion and sediment yield (SY), and its spatial and temporal variability is {{recognized as one of}} the main reasons for spatial and temporal analyses of soil erosion variability. The weather types (WTs) approach classifies the continuum of atmospheric circulation into a small number of categories or types and has been proven a good indicator of the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation. Thus, the main objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between WTs, runoff, soil erosion (measured in plots), and sediment yield (measured in catchments) in different areas of the Iberian Peninsula (IP) with the aim of detecting spatial variations in these relationships. To this end, hydrological and sediment information covering the IP from several Spanish research teams has been combined, and related with daily WTs estimated by using the NMC/NCAR 40 -Year Reanalysis Project. The results show that, in general, a few WTs (particularly westerly, southwesterly and cyclonic) provide the largest amounts of precipitation; and southwesterly, northwesterly and westerly WTs play an important role in runoff generation, erosion and sediment yield as they coincide with the wettest WTs. However, this study highlights the spatial variability of erosion and sediment yield in the IP according to WT, differentiating (1) areas under the influence of north and/or north-westerly flows (the north coast of Cantabria and inland central areas), (2) areas under the influence of westerly, southwesterly and cyclonic WTs (western and southwestern IP), (3) areas in which erosion and sediment yield are controlled by easterly flows (Mediterranean coastland), and (4) lastly, a transitional zone in the inland northeast Ebro catchment, where we detected a high variability in the effects of WTs on erosion. Overall results suggest that the use of WTs derived from observed atmospheric pressure patterns could be a useful tool for inclusion in future projections of the spatial variability of erosion and sediment yield, as models capture pressure fields reliably. © 2014 Elsevier B.

The high standards of the conference have been ensured by a wide and competent scientific committee and by a selective review process. The reviewing of the manuscripts submitted for possible publication started in October 2010 with at least 2 reviewers per paper with further revision by the guest editors. The revision and selection process has been completed in December 2011. Among the 7 contributions selected for publication, advances in the state-of-the art related to several fields of transportation systems analysis are illustrated and discussed.

The distribution of major facies belts {{is strongly dependent on}} hydrographic and topographic constraints. The main bulk of carbonate deposits is derived from maerl-producing coralline algal biotopes that are restricted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> photic zone of waveprotected areas and influenced by tidal currents. Furthermore, extended mollusc and echinoderm-rich arenites are present in the area investigated. In deeper subtidal areas, terrigenous sediments of Late Weichselian to Early Holocene age are preserved. However, these are strongly influenced by later winnowing processes, generating a coquina lag deposit that serves as a secondary hardground for a diverse fouling community. The Holocene facies successions can be seen in several raised outcrops, containing the transition from glacigenic to Recent non-glacigenic depositional conditions. Autochthonous radiocarbon dated rhodolith banks, which mark the onset of carbonate sedimentation, yielded surprisingly young ages of 5, 500 YBP. Around 5, 500 YBP, present-day oceanographic and climatic conditions had already been firmly established. This time-lag can be explained with the behaviour of postglacial sea level fluctuations in the area. From 10, 000 their cooperation in this project.

40|$|Theorists often {{speculate}} why {{open source}} and free software project contributors give their work away. Although contributors make their work publicly available, {{they do not}} forfeit their rights to it. Community managed software projects protect their work by using several legal and normative tactics, which should not be conflated with a disregard for or neglect of intellectual property rights. These tactics allow a project's intellectual property to be publicly and freely available and yet, governable. Exploration of this seemingly contradictory state may provide new insight into governance models {{for the management of}} digital intellectual property.
