5|$|Du Bois was {{the first}} African American invited by the American Historical Association (AHA) to present a paper at their annual conference. He read his paper, Reconstruction and Its Benefits, to an astounded {{audience}} at the AHA's December 1909 conference. The paper went against the mainstream historical view, promoted by the Dunning School of scholars at Columbia University, that Reconstruction was a disaster, caused by the ineptitude and sloth of blacks. To the contrary, Du Bois asserted that the brief period of African-American leadership in the South accomplished three important goals: democracy, free public schools, and new social welfare legislation. He asserted {{that it was the}} federal government's failure to manage the Freedmen's Bureau, to distribute land, and to establish an educational system, that doomed African-American prospects in the South. When Du Bois submitted the paper for publication a few months later in the American Historical Review, he asked that the word Negro be capitalized. The editor, J. Franklin Jameson, refused, and published the paper without the capitalization. The paper was mostly ignored by white historians. Du Bois later developed his paper as his ground-breaking 1935 book, Black Reconstruction, which marshaled extensive facts to support his assertions. <b>The</b> <b>AHA</b> did not invite another African-American speaker until 1940.|$|E
25|$|After the 192627 season, <b>the</b> <b>AHA</b> {{wanted to}} {{negotiate}} a new agreement with the NHL, setting out the rules for how the leagues would work together.

On August 24, 1927, <b>the</b> <b>AHA</b> terminated Livingstone's membership in the league. When Livingstone tried to sell the franchise, {{he was told that}} he did not have one to sell and that four of his players (including Marvin Wentworth, who would play 13 seasons in the NHL) were now the property of the Blackhawks. He filed suit against Frederic McLaughlin, owner of the Blackhawks, charging him with tampering with his players and in December 1927 filed a $700,000 lawsuit against Calder and three AHA executives claiming that his team was taken away from him through a conspiracy.|$|E

25|$|Lindsay {{initiated}} an anti-trust {{lawsuit against}} the league, alleging a monopoly since 1926.

Norris on <b>the</b> <b>AHA</b> side. Also, the various Norris arenas were hiding revenues through ticket scalping and under-reporting arena capacities and actual ticket sales. Rather than face the lawsuit in court, the NHL, in an out-of-court settlement in February 1958, agreed {{to most of the}} players' demands, although the pension plan was not exposed until 1989, showing a surplus of $25 million.

500|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland, a {{conflict}} broke out between two American ice hockey bodies, the American Hockey Association (AHA) and the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU).

The Swiss Olympic Organizing Committee (SOOC) had accepted the AHA's application, but Avery Brundage of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) threatened to withdraw the entire American team if <b>the</b> <b>AHA</b> participated in the Olympics. The IIHF countered by threatening to withdraw hockey from the Games if <b>the</b> <b>AHA</b> were banned. The IOC suggested that both American teams be banned but the SOOC rejected this proposal.
