5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax is whether <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> {{has the ability}} to be revenue-neutral; that is, whether <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E

The alarm was raised, and more than 500 armed men attacked the fortified home of tax inspector General John Neville. Washington responded by sending peace commissioners to western Pennsylvania {{to negotiate with the}} rebels, {{while at the same time}} calling on governors to send a militia force to enforce <b>the</b> <b>tax.</b> Washington himself rode at the head of an army to suppress the insurgency, with 13,000 militiamen provided by the governors of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The rebels all went home before the arrival of the army, and there was no confrontation. About 20 men were arrested, but all were later acquitted or pardoned.

A new law was passed by the city legislature to deal specifically with this stadium and reduce the incentives, linking the concession of the credits to hosting the World Cup opening match and limiting the total amount of credits to R$420million.
