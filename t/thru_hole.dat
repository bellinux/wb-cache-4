40|$|The plated <b>thru</b> <b>hole</b> {{has changed}} {{considerably}} in 50 years of electronic packaging, {{but in its}} many forms remains the most common interconnection in 1 st and 2 nd level electronic packaging, and {{is still one of}} the most feared in terms of reliability. The transition from the original solder filled holes to BGA wiring vias, subcomposite buried vias, and today’s microvias has resulted in many new failure mechanisms, not only in the copper interconnections but also in the surrounding laminate, especially with Pb free reflows. This presentation surveys the most significant via and via-related laminate failure mechanisms from past to present using data from current induced thermal cycling (CITC) testing, failure analysis, and other sources. The relative life and failure modes of thru vias, buried vias, and microvias (stacked vs. non-stacked) are compared, along with the affect of structure, materials, and peak temperatures on the above. The origin of via-induced laminate failures such as “eyebrow cracks ” and Pb free related internal delamination is also explored. Video clips of laminate coupons during Pb free reflows are shown, including examples of failure mechanisms as they occur, to vividly illustrate the challenges involved and to help reveal the root causes. Finally, an extrapolation to future technology trends for laminate substrates is attempted to address the question—what might be the failure modes of tomorrow, and will via/laminate reliability be better or worse...|$|E
40|$|Upon {{completion}} of {{the second year of}} this contract, we have delivered the next generation of polymer/metal composite, optimum paste H, to Endicott. We have done preliminary flip-chip type bonding at Universal Instruments, working closely with their personnel to enhance their equipment set and process. We have also shown that a PMC bond can withstand over 40 % strain without effecting its electrical and mechanical properties. This resilience of the conductive polymer paste both under electrical and mechanical behavior, is a strong indication of the applicability of the material for Flip Chip Attach to organic laminates. We have also confirmed during this phase of the Contract that the Optimum Paste H can be processed and applied under normal ambient conditions, without special precautions of low temperature or inert atmospheres, a property which sets our system apart from many other commercial pastes. We would also like to remark the achievement of optimized paste properties and how these properties address the mayor issues and requirements for flip attach applications, in Table I and II of this report. Use of the PMC to build interposer for chip-testing. Due to the high electrical conductivity of the PMC, a process was developed to use a thin film layer of the paste applied to a metal cathode of an electrochemical cell, to build fully metallized <b>thru</b> <b>hole</b> arrays containing a given C- 4 chip foot print.

30|$|Reliability {{tests of}} PCBs are {{performed}} in the design process. In order to accelerate the tests, electronic devices are placed in an oven and temperature in the oven is changed periodically by a given frequency and amplitude. Since the board is thin and metal components have a high thermal conductivity, a nearly homogeneous temperature distribution occurs. There is {{a significant amount of}} know-how for thermal reliability tests and manufacturers are using their own calibrated tests, i.e., choice of frequency and amplitude. In order to obtain results as quick as possible, the oven achieves more than 100 K in less than a minute, which is not only technologically challenging; but also costly. Another method is much more easier and is sometimes called an active reliability test. An electric potential difference is applied such that an electric current produces JOULE’s heat leading to the temperature change. According to the free or forced convection, the necessary temperature differences in similar frequencies can be achieved. There are still some drawbacks and a lack of a comprehensive analysis of active tests. Computational methods can be fruitful for getting a better understanding and suggesting newer methods or design amendments. In this work we present the method of solving a coupled thermo-electro-mechanical system with open-source packages developed under the FEniCS project, see (FEniCS project 2017; Alnaes and Mardal 2012). Coupled and nonlinear partial differential equations can be solved monolithically by using research codes, for example FEniCS. Commercial programs are not capable to perform such tasks, at least at the time when this work was established. In order to demonstrate the strength of such computation, we perform an active reliability test for different laminate materials and compare them. We deliver the codes applied on a single <b>thru</b> <b>hole</b> via on PCB with different materials used for the board. Different materials as well as geometries can easily be applied by using the code in (Abali 2011) under the GNU Public license (GNU Public 2017).|$|E

This paper explores {{the development of an}} optical flip chip application and details the selection/qualification of the substrate. The selected assembly consists of a procured 1 x 12 Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) die, having 80 um diameter eutectic AuSn solder bumps at 250 um pitch and flip chip bonded to a. 006 ” thick 99. 6 % alumina substrate with. 006 ” diameter <b>thru</b> <b>holes</b> and metallized with 500 Å WTi, under minimum 2. 0 - 3. 0 μm (80 - 120 μ”) thin film deposited Au.

40|$|The {{constant}} {{drive to}} further miniaturization and heterogeneous system integration {{leads to a}} need for new packaging technologies which also allow large area processing and 3 D integration with potential for low cost applications. Large area mold embedding technologies and embedding of active components into printed circuit boards (Chip-in-Polymer) are two major packaging trends in this area. This paper describes {{the use of a}} novel S 2 iP (Stacked System in Package) interconnect technique using advanced molding process for multi chip embedding in combination with large area and low cost redistribution technology derived from printed circuit board manufacturing with a focus on integration of through mold vias and vertical interconnect elements for package stacking. The use of compression molding equipment with liquid or granular epoxy molding compounds for the targeted integration process flow is a new technology that has been especially developed to allow large area embedding of single chips but also of multiple chips or heterogeneous systems on wafer scale, typically 8 ? to 12 ?. The wiring of the embedded components in this novel type of SiP can be done using PCB manufacturing technologies, i. e. a resin coated copper (RCC) film is laminated over the embedded components. Also thin film redistribution technologies can be applied ? using similar processes as used for WLP on silicon. For the 3 D interconnection two technologies are evaluated: In a process flow similar to conventional PCB manufacturing vias are drilled using a UV laser after RCC lamination and are metalized in the same process as the vias for chip interconnection. A second via generation process uses vertical interconnect elements, e. g. silicon dies with well defined lead structures, assembled in the same process step as the embedded dies. Top and bottom surface of those vertical interconnect elements are exposed after mold embedding. Planar interconnection is then formed by thin film redistribution or after RCC lamination, the vertical interconnect elements are contacted using a µVia process. Within this study the different approaches to vertical interconnection in a mold embedded wafer have been intensively evaluated on their processability. A strong focus was put on the process chain chip placement on a temporary carrier - compression vacuum molding for embedding ? RCC lamination or thin film redistribution ? laser drilling processes for µVias & <b>Thru</b> <b>Holes</b> ? metallization structuring ? module singulation & 3 D assembly. The feasibility of the entire process chain is demonstrated by fabrication of a Ball Grid Array (BGA) type of system package with two embedded dies and through mold vias allowing the stacking of these BGA packages. Reliability of the manufactured 3 D stacks is evaluated by temperature cycling and is analyzed both non-destructively and destructively. The paper depicts a final technology demonstrator where two BGAs are stacked on each other and mounted on a base substrate enabling the electrical connection of the stacked module, allowing the evaluation of the technology and the applied processes...|$|R
40|$|TutorialSqueeze Film Dampers (SFDs) are {{effective}} means to ameliorate rotor vibration amplitudes and to suppress instabilities in rotor-bearing systems. A SFD {{is not an}} off-the-shelf mechanical element but tailored to a particular rotor-bearing system as its design must satisfy a desired damping ratio; if too low, the damper is ineffective, whereas if damping is too large, it locks the system aggravating the system response. In many cases, SFDs are also employed to control the placement of (rigid body) critical speeds displacing the machine operation into a speed range with effective structural isolation. Industry demands well-engineered SFDs with a low footprint to reduce cost, maintenance, weight, and space while pushing for higher operating shaft speeds to increase power output. Compact aero jet engines implement ultra-short length SFDs (L/D ? 0. 2) to satisfy stringent weight and space demands with low parts count. A manufacturer, {{as part of a}} business plan to develop and commercialize energy efficient aircraft gas turbine engines, supported a multiple?year project to test novel SFD design spaces. In spite of the myriad of analyses and experimental results reported in the literature, there has not been to date a concerted effort to investigate the dynamic forced performance of a SFD through its many configurations: open ends vis-?-vis sealed ends conditions, and supply conditions with a fluid plenum or deep groove vis-?-vis feed holes directly impinging into the film land. This lecture presents experimental results obtained with a dedicated rig to evaluate short length SFDs operating under large dynamic loads (2. 2 kN ? 500 lbf) that produced circular and elliptical whirl orbits of varying amplitude, centered and off-centered. The lecture first reviews how SFDs work, placing emphasis on certain effects largely overlooked by practitioners who often regard the SFD as a simple non-rotating journal bearing. These effects are namely fluid inertia amplification in the supply or discharge grooves, pervasive air ingestion at high whirl frequencies, and effective end sealing means to enhance damping. The bulk of the lecture presents for various SFD configurations comparisons of experimentally identified damping (C) and inertia or added mass (M) coefficients versus amplitude of motion (orbit size) and static eccentricity position, both ranging from small to large; as large as the film clearance! The experiments, conducted over six plus years of continued work give an answer to the following fundamental practitioners? questions: (a) Dampers don?t have a stiffness (static centering capability), how come? (b) Why is there fluid inertia or added mass in a damper? Isn?t a damper a purely viscous element? (c) How much do the damping and added mass change when the film length is halved? What about increasing the clearance to twice its original magnitude? (d) How much more damping is available if the damper has end seals? (e) Is a damper with feed holes as effective as one containing a groove that ensures lubricant pools to fill the film? What if a hole plugs, is a damper still effective? (f) Does a flooded damper offer same force coefficients as one lubricated <b>thru</b> feed <b>holes?</b> (g) Do the amplitude and shape of whirl motion affect the damper force coefficients? (h) What happens if the damper operates largely off-centered; does its performance become nonlinear? (i) Is air ingestion a persistent issue with an open ends SFD? (j) How do predictions from accepted engineering practice SFD models correlate with the experimental record? Is an idealized SFD geometry representative of actual practice...|$|R
