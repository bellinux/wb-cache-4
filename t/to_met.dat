5|$|The {{chemistry}} of plutonium {{was found to}} resemble uranium {{after a few months}} of initial study. Early research was continued at the secret Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago. On August 20, 1942, a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time. About 50micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1microgram was isolated. This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight. On December 2, 1942, on a racket court under the west grandstand at the University of Chicago's Stagg Field, researchers headed by Enrico Fermi achieved the first self-sustaining chain reaction in a graphite and uranium pile known as CP-1. Using theoretical information garnered from the operation of CP-1, DuPont constructed an air-cooled experimental production reactor, known as X-10, and a pilot chemical separation facility at Oak Ridge. The separation facility, using methods developed by Glenn T. Seaborg and a team of researchers at the Met Lab, removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the X-10 reactor. Information from CP-1 was also useful <b>to</b> <b>Met</b> Lab scientists designing the water-cooled plutonium production reactors for Hanford. Construction at the site began in mid-1943.|$|E

The EPB labeled it as an initiative that promotes the migration of more Puerto Ricans to the United States and as move made by the government to replace the population with foreign millionaires to address the financial decline. The organization expressed its belief that the IVA is a measure that is designed for independent nations and unrealistic for a territory, sacrificing the middle class and small and medium businesses in order <b>to</b> <b>met</b> the demands of bond buyers. Commander Guasábara concluded his exposition by warning against a divided response to the IVA, insisting that only an unified resistance could overcome the government and by warning that the Macheteros would [...] "be there [...] in the right time" [...] if it advanced from the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico and was adopted as law. Facing opposition even within the PPD, the IVA initiative was postponed and instead {{a modified version of the}} current income tax was adopted until it could be reformulated.|$|E

2500|$|Having met {{half the}} Australian {{national}} cricket team in Melbourne Denis Compton led the MCC <b>to</b> <b>met</b> {{the other half}} in Sydney. Alec Bedser {{was back in the}} team after his bout of flu, but probably wished he was not as the New South Wales captain Arthur Morris won the toss and batted on a flat wicket. Bedser had Jack Moroney caught behind with the score on 52, but disappeared for 1/127 off 24 overs as Morris hit 18 fours and a six in his 168. The Australian national cricket team vice-captain simply continued where he had left off in 1948, where his last two innings against England had been 182 at Headingley and 196 at the Oval. He was aided and abetted by the [...] "glamour boy" [...] Keith Miller who hit a chanceless 214 as the duo added 265 for the second wicket. In the end Morris was caught by Len Hutton in the slips off Trevor Bailey (1/54) and Miller was bowled by Eric Hollies (1/138), but the young Jim Burke made 80 not out before Morris declared on 509/3. In return the old firm of Len Hutton (112) and Cyril Washbrook (50) added 92 for the first MCC wicket and Hutton and Compton (92) 106 for the third wicket, seeing off the bouncers of Ray Lindwall (2/57), Alan Walker (0/30) and the young Alan Davidson (0/63). Miller did not bowl for some reason and it was the NSW spinners who took the wickets; veteran leg-spinner Freddie Johnston (6/100) wrapping up the tail with help from another youngster called Ritchie Benaud (1/75) as the last seven MCC wickets fell for 121 runs and they were all out for 339. Burke (53) and Moroney (60 not out) opened the NSW second innings adding 92 for the first wicket before Morris declared for 140/2. The MCC safely saw out the game with 142/2, Washbrook making another half-century (53 not out), Reg Simpson 32 and Compton 34 not out. Though the MCC had played reasonably well on a lifeless wicket after losing the toss the press corps still saw only their bad points, emphasising their poor fielding, first innings collapse and the inability of their bowlers to take more than 5 wickets in a tour match.|$|E
