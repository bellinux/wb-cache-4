5|$|As {{the wave}} {{breaches}} the Himalayas and approaches the site, an impact driver lodges in the ark-door gears, keeping a boarding gate open and preventing the ship's engines from starting. In the ensuing chaos where many people attempt <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>the</b> ships, Yuri, Tamara and Gordon are killed, Tenzin is injured, Ark 4 begins filling {{with water and}} is set adrift after Air Force One crashes into one of its supports, while also causing it to skim the hull of Ark 6 before drifting off. With Jackson and Noah's help, {{the crew of the}} Ark manages to regain control of the Ark narrowly before it fatally smashes into Mount Everest.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{discontinuation}} of ferry {{service to}} New Jersey, people moved to locations along the Hudson River waterfront there. In 1986, waterfront settlements like Bayonne, Highlands, Keyport, Port Liberte, and Weehawken saw a reinstatement of their ferry service to Manhattan, under {{the operation of}} NY Waterway. By 1989, around 3,000 of the settlements' combined 10,500 residents paid a $5.00 fare in each direction <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>the</b> NY Waterway ferries, despite competition from cheaper alternatives like the PATH train system. Around this time, there were plans to create ferry routes between Inwood and Atlantic City; South Amboy and Wall Street; and from the city proper to New Jersey, Connecticut, and Westchester.|$|E
5|$|Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents {{arrived at}} the airport after the plane landed. The {{aircraft}} was moved to a remote area so authorities could re-screen the plane, the passengers, and the baggage on board. A bomb-defusing robot was first used <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>the</b> plane, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) interviewed all passengers. Another passenger from the flight was placed in handcuffs after a dog alerted officers to his carry-on luggage; he was searched, and released without charges. For several days following, federal officials denied that this second handcuffing had occurred, they later reversed this position, confirming that a second passenger had been handcuffed.|$|E

5|$|Fireflash is {{recalled}} and Captain Hanson and his co-pilot {{instructed to}} circle the airspace above the airport. The shielding on the airliner's atomic reactor is weakening; if Fireflash does not land within two hours, the passengers and crew will die of radiation exposure. Air Traffic Control commandeers an Air Force jet called a TX-204 Target Carrying Aircraft that docks with Fireflash in flight, allowing a Lieutenant Bob Meddings <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>the</b> hold and attempt to remove the bomb. Meddings is almost killed when he falls through the unclosed maintenance hatch and plummets to the ground; moments before impact, however, he successfully deploys his parachute and ultimately survives.|$|E
5|$|Greyhound Express routes are {{assigned}} new or refurbished buses that {{are equipped with}} Wi-Fi, power outlets, leather seats, and extra legroom. In many stations Greyhound Express customers {{can take advantage of}} dedicated waiting areas, separate from passengers traveling on other Greyhound services or other carriers. Some stations also board passengers onto Greyhound Express buses using numbers printed on tickets. This number is assigned in the order in which the ticket was purchased, which means that passengers who bought their tickets earlier get <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>the</b> bus and choose their seats earlier.|$|E

By then, however, South Vietnamese units in I Corps had virtually disappeared, and their commanding officers had fled from their posts.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{in order}} to add four {{additional}} Amtrak trips along the corridor, four of the then six round trips to New London were cut back to Old Saybrook. An agreement with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection limits service over the Old Saybrook-Old Lyme bridge {{in order to}} avoid inconveniencing recreational boaters. ConnDOT's agreement with Amtrak allowed commuters with monthly passes to ride certain Amtrak trains instead. After criticism over the service cuts, in April 2008 ConnDOT began allowing commuters with multi-ride passes <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>the</b> selected Amtrak trains as well.|$|E
5|$|In May and June 2015 cyclists {{were allowed}} <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>the</b> trams with their bikes, during a trial period which was {{supported}} by cycle campaign groups Spokes and Pedal on Parliament. Following this, Edinburgh trams became the first light rail network in the UK to permit the carriage of bikes on a permanent basis, with up to two bicycles being allowed per tram outwith peak hours (7.30am to 9.30am, and 4pm to 6.30pm) and excluding the festival period (7−31 August) and other large events.|$|E
5|$|Kruger {{left the}} Transvaal by rail on 11 September 1900—he wept {{as the train}} crossed into Mozambique. He planned <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>the</b> first {{outgoing}} steamer, the Herzog of the German East Africa Line, but was prevented from doing so when, {{at the behest of}} the local British Consul, the Portuguese Governor insisted that Kruger stay in port under house arrest. About a month later Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands concluded a deal with Britain to extricate Kruger on a Dutch warship, HNLMS Gelderland, and convey him through non-British waters to Marseille. Kruger was delighted to hear of this, but dismayed that Gezina, still in Pretoria, was not well enough to accompany him. Gelderland departed on 20 October 1900.|$|E

5|$|Officers from Latona {{were first}} <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>the</b> French frigate but Emeric refused to tender his formal {{surrender}} except to {{an officer of}} Horatio because he insisted that Horatio had caused the entirety of Junons damage. British historians have debated this opinion: William James agreed with this assessment, but also opined that if Horatio had been alone {{it would have been}} Scott surrendering rather than the French officers, such was the damage his ship had suffered in the battle. Edward Pelham Brenton, who was a serving officer in the Caribbean at the time, gives most of the credit for the victory to Latona, in a detailed account that James later criticised for its inaccuracies.|$|E
5|$|She was wrecked on 26 February 1852, while {{transporting}} {{troops to}} Algoa Bay at Danger Point near Gansbaai, 87 miles (140 kilometres) from Cape Town, South Africa. There {{were not enough}} serviceable lifeboats for all the passengers, and the soldiers famously stood firm on board, thereby allowing {{the women and children}} <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>the</b> boats safely and escape the sinking.|$|E
5|$|Six Flags designers' {{decorative}} theme {{attempts to}} capture the spirit of Batman's world for those queuing <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>the</b> ride. As the queue moves through Gotham City Park, the theme becomes more ominous. Modeled after Anton Furst's award-winning set design for the original Batman film, the atmosphere indicates a crime-ridden and dirty environment, with wrecked cars, discarded pieces of equipment, crumbling concrete, and a Gotham City Police car riddled with bullet holes. The queue then enters the ride structure. The ride passenger loading area is modeled on Batman's Batcave, and features {{a replica of the}} Batsuit from the 1989 film.|$|E

5|$|The Confederate Navy {{originally}} had devised a plan where the James River Squadron would swarm Monitor {{with a party}} of men {{with the intention of}} capturing the vessel by boarding and disabling her by using heavy hammers to drive iron wedges under and disabling the turret and by covering the pilot house with a wet sail effectively blinding the pilot. Others would throw combustibles down the ventilation openings and smoke holes. At one point Jones made such an attempt <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>the</b> vessel but she managed to slip away around the stern of Virginia in time.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Jacksonville International Airport, Florida, several hours before the accident, although the departure from Jacksonville was delayed by poor weather over New York {{and the removal of}} the baggage of a passenger who decided not <b>to</b> <b>board</b> <b>the</b> jet. The instrument approach landing was uneventful and the jet was not significantly delayed while in the air waiting to land, however congestion on the taxiways at LaGuardia delayed the arrival of the aircraft at the gate.|$|E
5|$|The {{crash of}} National Airlines Flight 2511 came {{shortly after the}} crash of another National Airlines plane. National Airlines Flight 967 {{exploded}} over the Gulf of Mexico on November 16, 1959.

Spears was heavily insured, and the FBI indicated that his motive was insurance fraud. Similarly, Julian Frank was covered by almost $900,000 in life insurance policies, including some purchased the day of the crash.|$|E
