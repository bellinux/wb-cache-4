5|$|Members of {{this family}} are chiefly known for their {{characteristic}} behaviour; <b>they</b> <b>mostly</b> forage for insect prey on the trunks and branches of trees, and often communicate by drumming with their beak, producing a reverberatory sound that can be heard at some distance. Some species vary their diet with fruits, bird's eggs and small animals, and some suck sap. <b>They</b> <b>mostly</b> nest and roost in holes that they excavate in tree trunks, and their abandoned holes are of importance to other cavity-nesting birds. They sometimes come into conflict with man when they make holes in buildings or feed on fruit crops, but perform a useful service by their removal of insect pests on trees.|$|E
5|$|Old World flycatchers are a {{large group}} of small {{passerine}} birds native to the Old World. They are mainly small arboreal insectivores. The appearance of these birds is highly varied, but <b>they</b> <b>mostly</b> have weak songs and harsh calls.|$|E
5|$|This a {{large family}} of small {{passerine}} birds restricted to the Old World. Species below only occur in North America as vagrants. The appearance of these birds is highly varied, but <b>they</b> <b>mostly</b> have weak songs and harsh calls.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> are {{cultivated}} <b>mostly</b> in Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy, {{usually in}} home gardens, although formerly {{on a commercial}} scale. <b>They</b> are <b>mostly</b> used for pickling.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> are <b>mostly</b> vegetarians.|$|R
50|$|Arab {{immigration}} to Venezuela started {{as early as}} the 19th and 20th centuries. <b>They</b> came <b>mostly</b> from Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine. <b>They</b> are <b>mostly</b> located in the most important urban areas and Margarita Island, representing around 5% of the population in Venezuela.|$|R
5|$|It {{has long}} been rumoured a deal was struck between Blair and Brown at the former Granita {{restaurant}} in Islington, in which Blair promised to give Brown control of economic policy in return for Brown not standing against him in the leadership election. Whether this is true or not, the relationship between Blair and Brown was central to the fortunes of New Labour, and <b>they</b> <b>mostly</b> remained united in public, despite reported serious private rifts.|$|E
5|$|Metalloids usually {{look like}} metals but behave largely like nonmetals. Physically, they are shiny, brittle solids with {{intermediate}} to relatively good electrical conductivity and the electronic band {{structure of a}} semimetal or semiconductor. Chemically, <b>they</b> <b>mostly</b> behave as (weak) nonmetals, have intermediate ionization energies and electronegativity values, and amphoteric or weakly acidic oxides. They can form alloys with metals. Most of their other {{physical and chemical properties}} are intermediate in nature.|$|E
5|$|Most bee-eaters are gregarious. They form colonies, nesting in burrows {{tunnelled}} into vertical sandy banks, {{often at}} the side of a river or in flat ground. As <b>they</b> <b>mostly</b> live in colonies, large numbers of nest holes may be seen together. The eggs are white, with typically five to the clutch. Most species are monogamous, and both parents care for the young, sometimes with assistance from related birds in the colony.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> are <b>mostly</b> {{known from}} Australia.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> have <b>mostly</b> been {{inactive}} since 2005.|$|R
50|$|Indian Railways operate many railbuses. <b>They</b> are <b>mostly</b> electric.|$|R
5|$|Muskrats {{are found}} {{over most of}} Canada and the United States and {{a small part of}} {{northern}} Mexico. They were introduced to Europe {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century and have become an invasive species in northwestern Europe. <b>They</b> <b>mostly</b> inhabit wetlands, areas in or near saline and freshwater wetlands, rivers, lakes, or ponds. They are not found in Florida, where the round-tailed muskrat, or Florida water rat (Neofiber alleni), fills their ecological niche.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{primitive}} order and members do not extrude their stomach when feeding, lack an anus {{and have no}} suckers on their tube feet. Papulae are plentiful on their aboral surface and they possess marginal plates and paxillae. <b>They</b> <b>mostly</b> inhabit soft-bottomed areas of sand or mud. There is no brachiolaria stage in their larval development. The comb starfish (Astropecten polyacanthus) {{is a member of}} this order.|$|E
5|$|This {{order of}} starfish {{consists}} mostly of deep-sea and other cold-water starfish {{often with a}} global distribution. The shape is pentagonal or star-shaped with five to fifteen arms. <b>They</b> <b>mostly</b> have poorly developed skeletons with papulae widely distributed on the aboral surface and often spiny pedicellariae. This group includes the slime star.|$|E
50|$|Today <b>they</b> produce <b>mostly</b> TV-series {{and some}} feature films.|$|R
50|$|Vernonieae is a {{tribe of}} about 1300 {{species of plants}} in the aster family. <b>They</b> are <b>mostly</b> found in the tropics and warmer {{temperate}} areas, both in the Americas and the Old World. <b>They</b> are <b>mostly</b> herbaceous plants or shrubs, although {{there is at least}} one tree species, Vernonia arborea.|$|R
50|$|Sa'idabad: In {{its lower}} quarter, <b>they</b> speak <b>mostly</b> the dialect.|$|R
5|$|Birds roam {{from the}} forest floor to the canopy, but {{particularly}} favour the middle story. <b>They</b> <b>mostly</b> operate alone, in pairs or groups of three, and {{can also be found}} mixing with long-billed bernierias. Larger flocks do not occur. The nelicourvi weaver is an agile, active species that generally makes a lot of noise. It searches for insects on leaves, and branches, while hanging from vines and twigs. It looks for animals in rolled leaves such as wild ginger Aframomum and along leaf litter, probing crevices, and opening dead stems. It also dismembers flowers to reach the nectar. Mostly, arthropods (beetles, bugs, butterflies, caterpillars, dragonflies, flies, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, stick insects, millipedes and spiders) are consumed, sometimes small vertebrates (lizards and chameleons), next to some nectar, fruit and probably seeds.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{studies have}} found that rice rats {{assimilate}} 88% to 95% of the energy in their food. They lose weight when fed on Spartina, fiddler crabs, or sunflower seeds alone, but a diet consisting of several of those items or of mealworms is adequate to maintain weight. In an experiment, marsh rice rats did not show hoarding behavior, but wild rice rats have been observed carrying food to a nest. Even when they live in uplands, <b>they</b> <b>mostly</b> eat water plants and animals, although they consume some upland plants.|$|E
5|$|Mecopterans mostly inhabit moist environments {{although}} a few species are found in semi-desert habitats. Scorpionflies, family Panorpidae, generally live in broad-leaf woodlands with plentiful damp leaf litter. Snow scorpionflies, family Boreidae, appear in winter and are to be seen on snowfields and on moss; the larvae being able to jump like fleas. Hangingflies, family Bittacidae, occur in forests, grassland and caves with high moisture levels. <b>They</b> <b>mostly</b> breed among mosses, in leaf litter and other moist places, but their reproductive habits have been little studied, {{and at least one}} species, Nannochorista philpotti, has aquatic larvae.|$|E
25|$|Feral cats in Australia prey on {{a variety}} of wildlife. In arid and {{semi-arid}} environments, <b>they</b> eat <b>mostly</b> introduced European rabbits and house mice. In arid environments where rabbits do not occur, native rodents are taken. In forests and urbanized areas, <b>they</b> eat <b>mostly</b> native marsupials (particularly the common ringtail possum) and rodents.|$|R
500|$|<b>They</b> were <b>mostly</b> built {{between the}} 13th and the 20th centuries.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> are <b>mostly</b> used on freeboards and longboards {{without a}} kicktail.|$|R
5|$|New {{and shorter}} target substems were adopted in 2009. <b>They</b> <b>mostly</b> {{consist of a}} consonant, plus a vowel which is omitted if the source substem begins with a vowel. For example, human {{antibodies}} targeting the immune system receive names ending in -lumab instead of the old -limumab. Some endings like -ciximab remain unchanged. The old system employed seven different substems for tumor targets, {{depending on the type}} of tumor. Because many antibodies are investigated for several tumor types, the new convention only has -t(u)-.|$|E
5|$|Springbok {{inhabit the}} dry areas of south and southwestern Africa. Their range extends from northwestern South Africa through the Kalahari desert into Namibia and Botswana. The Transvaal marks the eastern {{limit of the}} range, from where it extends westward to the Atlantic and northward to {{southern}} Angola and Botswana. In Botswana, <b>they</b> <b>mostly</b> occur in the Kalahari desert in the southwestern and central parts of the country. They are widespread across Namibia and the vast grasslands of the Free State and the shrublands of Karoo in South Africa; however, they are confined to the Namib Desert in Angola.|$|E
5|$|The antlions are a {{group of}} about 2,000 species of insect in the family Myrmeleontidae, known for the {{fiercely}} predatory habits of their larvae, which in many species dig pits to trap passing ants or other prey. The adult insects are less well known, as <b>they</b> <b>mostly</b> fly at dusk or after dark, and may be mistakenly identified as dragonflies or damselflies; they are sometimes known as antlion lacewings, and in North America, the larvae are sometimes referred to as doodlebugs because of the strange marks they leave in the sand.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> have <b>mostly</b> a {{body length}} {{between one and}} three millimeters.|$|R
50|$|The {{inhabitants}} {{speak the}} Bura language. <b>They</b> are <b>mostly</b> subsistence farmers.|$|R
5000|$|They {{resemble}} angels, {{complete with}} flapping [...] "wings", hence their common name. <b>They</b> are gelatinous, <b>mostly</b> transparent pteropods, and {{they only have}} shells in their embryonic stage. <b>They</b> are <b>mostly</b> very small, with the largest species (Clione limacina) reaching 5 cm.|$|R
5|$|The bony fish lineage shows more derived {{anatomical}} traits, {{often with}} major evolutionary changes from {{the features of}} ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum, and a mouth {{at or near the}} tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping scales. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. <b>They</b> <b>mostly</b> spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Syria's {{population in the}} 12th century consisted of Sunni Muslims, typically from Arab or Kurdish backgrounds. There were also sizable Muslim communities of Twelver Shias, Druzes, and Alawites. The Ismaili presence was small and most were of Persian origin, having migrated from Alamut. <b>They</b> <b>mostly</b> resided in the mountainous area near the northern Syrian coastline. Large Christian communities existed in northern Syria, Palestine, Transjordan and Upper Mesopotamia. They were Aramaic-speaking and indigenous to the area, mostly belonging to the Syriac Orthodox Church. They lived in villages of Christian or mixed Christian and Muslim population, monasteries, and in small towns where {{they appear to have}} been on friendly terms with their Muslim neighbors. Ideologically, they were led by the Patriarch of Antioch.|$|E
5|$|Women also volunteered {{and served}} in a {{non-combatant}} role; {{by the end of}} the war, 80,000 had enlisted. <b>They</b> <b>mostly</b> served as nurses in the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS), the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY), the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD); and from 1917, in the Army when the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC), was founded. The WAAC was divided into four sections: cookery; mechanical; clerical and miscellaneous. Most stayed on the Home Front, but around 9,000 served in France.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> are <b>mostly</b> {{arboreal}} snakes that mainly feed on {{land snails}} and slugs.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> are <b>mostly</b> for {{collections}} and display, as many are expensive to tie.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> were <b>mostly</b> {{boys and}} women, {{and at his}} words they shrank back.|$|R
