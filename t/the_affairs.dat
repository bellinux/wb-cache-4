50|$|On August 12, 2008, Hunter's friend Pigeon O'Brien told CBS News that Edwards {{had lied}} about the {{timeline}} of <b>the</b> <b>affair.</b> She said <b>the</b> <b>affair</b> began in February 2006, {{six months before}} Edwards hired Hunter, and said <b>the</b> <b>affair</b> was not a brief liaison, but rather was allegedly characterized by Edwards to Hunter as a committed relationship. On August 13, 2008, Hunter's sister, Roxanne Druck Marshall, personally apologized to John Edwards's wife Elizabeth for her sister's behavior.

His successor as principal conductor was André Previn, who held the post for 11 years – at 2013 the longest tenure of the post to date.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to regain}} a public {{position}} in the Orange Free State failed, and in 1888 Spruyt once more returned to the South African Republic.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of these events, both the Spartans and their opponents {{prepared}} for more serious fighting to come.

The allies then sent emissaries {{to a number of}} smaller states and received the support of many of them.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs {{and other}} dignitaries were often in {{attendance}} at the cathedral, and the court occasionally held session there.

5|$|The Seaforth's royalist inclinations led to Lewis {{becoming}} garrisoned {{during the}} Wars of the Three Kingdoms by Cromwell's troops, who destroyed the old castle in Stornoway and in 1645 Lewismen fought on the royalist {{side at the}} Battle of Auldearn.

5|$|The ruling {{has been}} criticized for its {{intrusion}} into state affairs and its basis in previous rulings. Prior to Santosky, the realm of family life had been left to the states.
