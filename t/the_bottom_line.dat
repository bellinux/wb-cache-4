5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line,</b> {{with the}} signing of the treaty, was that any capital ships under {{construction}} by the five signatories (the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan) had to be canceled and scrapped. For battlecruisers, this encompassed the United States Lexington class, Japan's , and Great Britain's G3 battlecruisers. For the U.S. Navy, the choice seemed clear. If it scrapped all six Lexingtons in accordance with the treaty, it would throw away $13.4 million that could otherwise go toward aircraft carriers. The Navy opted for the latter course.|$|E
5|$|The major studios, {{at first}} {{resistant}} to the double feature, soon adapted. All established B units to provide films for the expanding second-feature market. Block booking became standard practice: {{to get access to}} a studio's attractive A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company's entire output for a season. With the B films rented at a flat fee (rather than the box office percentage basis of A films), rates could be set virtually guaranteeing the profitability of every B movie. The parallel practice of blind bidding largely freed the majors from worrying about their Bs' quality—even when booking in less than seasonal blocks, exhibitors had to buy most pictures sight unseen. The five largest studios—Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Fox Film Corporation (20th Century Fox as of 1935), Warner Bros., and RKO Radio Pictures (descendant of FBO)—also belonged to companies with sizable theater chains, further securing <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

In February 1999, Braathens merged the Swedish division with Malmö Aviation, to create Braathens Malmö Aviation. At the same time, the airline removed the 'Best' and 'Back' scheme on domestic Swedish flights. In November, Braathens terminated all services in Sweden that were inherited from Transwede. The Fokker 100 aircraft and Boeing 737-300 aircraft were sold, and the service from Oslo to Stockholm {{taken over by the}} company's Norwegian department. Malmö Aviation retained on flights from Stockholm-Bromma to Gothenburg and Malmö, as well as to London City. In addition, a Stockholm to Halmstad Airport service was started. In 1999, Braathens lost SEK300 million in Sweden, bringing the total loss of Braathens Swedish operations since 1996 to SEK600 million. At the same time, Braathens terminated its services from Sandefjord to Stavanger and Bergen, and the route from Oslo to Haugesund. From 25 June 2000, the company also terminated its Oslo to Stockholm route. Instead, the planes were put into service to Málaga and Alicante.|$|E

5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

When Foley and Hendryx performed at <b>The</b> <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> cabaret in New York City, Greenwich was there to see them. <b>The</b> <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> owner Allan Pepper convinced Greenwich to meet him and discuss putting together a revue showcasing her hits. In 1984, Leader of the Pack, a show based on Greenwich's life and music, opened at <b>The</b> <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line.</b> Greenwich appeared as herself in the second act, which focused on her early years in Long Island and her marriage and partnership with Barry. The show was revamped for Broadway and opened at the Ambassador Theater the following year. Cast members included Greenwich, Darlene Love, Annie Golden, Dinah Manoff as young Ellie, and Patrick Cassidy as Jeff Barry. Leader of the Pack {{was nominated for a}} Tony Award for Best Musical and a Grammy Award for the cast album, and the play garnered The New York Music Critics' Award for Best Broadway Musical. During the 1990s and into the new millennium, the musical has enjoyed several revivals and continues to be performed at schools and community theaters.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{critically}} {{the notion of}} “Triple <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> ” accounting.

We then use these claims as a basis upon which to argue (a) that what is sound about the idea of a Triple <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> is not novel, and (b) that what is novel about the idea is not sound. We argue on both conceptual and practical grounds that <b>the</b> Triple <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> is an unhelpful addition to current discussions of corporate social responsibility. Finally, we argue that <b>the</b> Triple <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> paradigm cannot be rescued simply by attenuating its claims: the rhetoric is badly misleading, and may in fact provide a smokescreen behind which firms can avoid truly effective social and environmental reporting and performance...|$|R

Elkington further advocated that companies should aim for sustainable development.

5000|$|The {{term was}} first coined and {{introduced}} into mainstream usage by Ayman Sawaf {{in a bid}} to factor in the return to one's spiritual self as an additional, fourth <b>bottom</b> <b>line.</b> Spirituality, according to Sawaf, is defined as your own unique relationship and partnership with God or The Divine. It is great to make money, to {{have a positive impact on}} society/people and the environment. It is also important to have a positive impact on one’s own spiritual growth. <b>The</b> fourth <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> lifts business activities to a sacred form. <b>The</b> fourth <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> is measured by how much more loving, understanding, happy, joyful, in touch with their destiny, deeper relationship or partnership with god or higher powers the person has become, while performing their business responsibilities. And as these qualities are acquired they are infused back into one's own business activities This definition, thus, identified spirituality as <b>the</b> fourth <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> by businesses that relate it with happiness of stakeholders. That is when the question of why one is doing business becomes relevant. <b>The</b> first <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> deals with <b>the</b> what. [...] "What do I get?" [...] is usually measured by money. The second and third <b>bottom</b> <b>lines</b> deal with <b>the</b> how. [...] "How will I do this?" [...] factors in that the means of doing business now matters. The question of whether one is doing business with honesty, trust, character, integrity, without hurting people and the environment. <b>The</b> Fourth <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> has to do with why. To ask oneself, [...] "Why am I doing this?" [...] involves a deeper sense of self being nurtured by such a choice. With <b>the</b> fourth <b>bottom</b> <b>line,</b> commerce/business becomes a spiritual path. The context of spirituality as a fourth factor is further elaborated upon by Dr. Sohail Inayatullah, a professor at Tamkang University and Queensland University of Technology.|$|R

25|$|The Village had a {{cutting-edge}} cabaret {{and music}} scene. The Village Gate, the Village Vanguard, and The Blue Note (since 1981), regularly hosted {{some of the}} biggest names in jazz. Greenwich Village also played a major role in the development of the folk music scene of the 1960s. Music clubs included Gerde's Folk City, The Bitter End, Cafe Au Go Go, Cafe Wha?, The Gaslight Cafe and <b>The</b> <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line.</b> Three of the four members of The Mamas & the Papas met there. Guitarist and folk singer Dave Van Ronk lived there for many years. Village resident and cultural icon Bob Dylan by the mid-60s had become one of the world's foremost popular songwriters, and often developments in Greenwich Village would influence the simultaneously occurring folk rock movement in San Francisco and elsewhere, and vice versa. Dozens of other cultural and popular icons got their start in the Village's nightclub, theater, and coffeehouse scene during the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, including Jimi Hendrix, Barbra Streisand, Peter, Paul, and Mary, Bette Midler, The Lovin' Spoonful, Simon & Garfunkel, Liza Minnelli, Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Eric Andersen, Joan Baez, The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, The Velvet Underground, The Kingston Trio, Carly Simon, Richie Havens, Maria Muldaur, Tom Paxton, Janis Ian, Phil Ochs, Joni Mitchell, Laura Nyro, and Nina Simone. The Greenwich Village of the 1950s and 1960s was at the center of Jane Jacobs's book The Death and Life of Great American Cities, which defended it and similar communities, while criticizing common urban renewal policies of the time.|$|E

At Judgment Day, Triple H lost his Intercontinental title to Kane. The following night on Raw Is War, Austin and Triple H wrestled against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit with the tag team titles on the line. Midway through the match, Triple H tore his quadriceps muscle. As planned, the team lost the tag team titles {{at the end of}} the match when Triple H accidentally hit Austin in the stomach with a sledgehammer but the injury to Triple H, which kept him out for the remainder of the year, forced the WWF to go in another direction. Austin officially broke up The Power Trip on that week's SmackDown!, criticizing Triple H for his injury and for hitting him with the sledgehammer. He continued to align himself with McMahon and began feuding with Jericho and Benoit by himself, with Kurt Angle joining the group as Triple H's replacement. For most of the next month leading to King of the Ring, he constantly fell victim to a double submission involving Jericho's Walls of Jericho and Benoit's Crippler Crossface, Austin did not wrestle as he was nursing an injury, but continued to feud with the reigning tag team champions, eventually costing them the titles on the SmackDown! preceding King of the Ring against the Dudley Boyz.
