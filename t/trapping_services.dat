We intensively sampled the butterfly fauna of mid-elevation tropical moist forest in southern Costa Rica with fruit bait traps to address a series of practical issues concerning {{the development of a}} robust, efficient sampling program. Variation in the number of captures and escapes of butterflies at the traps was better explained by the time of day than by the age of bait.

40|$|Litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) {{is subject}} to damage by a range of insect pests, the most {{important}} of which are the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae), the koa seedworm, Cryptophlebia illepida (Butler), and the litchi fruitmoth, C. ombrodelta (Lower) (also known as the macadamia nut borer) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). The activity of tephritid fruit flies and Cryptophlebia spp. (hereafter referred to as Cryptophlebia) both can lead to several types of fruit defects, including holes, stains, and release of fruit juices, making it difficult to distinguish which pest caused the damage. Field studies were conducted to minimize the occurrence of these types of fruit defects through use of a spinosad-based protein bait (GF- 120 Fruit Fly Bait) to suppress oriental fruit fly populations, and an attractant associated with a contact insecticide (attract-and-kill) technique (Last Call) to suppress Cryptophlebia populations in litchi orchards at the scale of individual farms. The Last Call product used was based on a pheromone blend developed for the macadamia nut borer because preliminary tests identified that this blend was more attractive to both C. ombrodelta and C. illepida than was a pheromone blend developed for the oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck). Overall, based on results from four split plot litchi orchards, {{there was no significant difference}} in oriental fruit fly trap catch between spray and control sections at any <b>trap</b> <b>service</b> date. However, population reduction in the sprayed section of one orchard with a higher B. dorsalis population may have been a result of the spray application.

State {{and federal agencies}} responded by initiating a large-scale trapping program to monitor its spread and population dynamics. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the trap catch between two delta traps differing in size and design. Both trap types were baited with female pheromone and trapped E. postvittana males on a sticky base. This insert was 121 cm 2 in the smaller Jackson traps compared to 360 cm 2 in the larger Scentry LP traps.

40|$|Introduction. Knowledge of tephritid {{diversity}} in Senegal was poor before 2004, so PIP-COLEACP and CIRAD, {{in collaboration with}} Cérès-DPV, carried out, in 2004, trapping for preliminary detection of fruit flies in six orchards in the Niayes zone. Materials and methods. We selected three mixed mango orchards and three homogeneous mango orchards in this zone. In each orchard, we used three attractants: Terpinyl acetate (Ter), Trimedlure (Tri) and Torula (Tor). <b>Traps</b> were <b>serviced</b> weekly. Results. We captured 77 642 fruit flies in more than 4 months including mango season; they were represented by 18 identified fly species, including ten Ceratitis, six Dacus and two Bactrocera species. Two very serious pests were identified with the confirmation of Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett) for cucurbit crops and the detection of B. invadens Drew Tsuruta & White for fruit crops. The two most abundant species of Ceratitis were C. cosyra and C. silvestrii. Discussion. We captured more fruit fly specie s in mixed mango orchards than in homogeneous mango orchards. Bactrocera invadens was also more abundant in mixed orchards, probably because of its polyphagous status. This new invasive species, B. invadens, can have many hosts in mixed mango orchards, enhancing its breeding potential. Conclusion.

40|$|Ecosystem-based coastal {{protection}} {{by means of}} conserving, restoring or creating intertidal ecosystems that attenuate waves and stabilize shorelines, offers a promising way to climate proof coastlines for the future. The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is an ecosystem engineering species, which {{is known for its}} wave attenuating and sediment <b>trapping</b> ecosystem <b>services,</b> but it remains unknown to which extent this is conditional. We aim to test the hypothesis that the ecosystem engineering effect concerning sediment trapping and stability by oyster reefs is conditional, and can be predicted based on i) local physical forcing, ii) morphological characteristics of the tidal flat, and iii) biological characteristics of the oyster reef. Analyses of long-term sediment accretion patterns on natural intertidal oyster reefs at the Oosterschelde basin (The Netherlands) showed that this ecosystem engineering effect is strongest on tidal flats under erosional conditions, lower aspect ratio (i. e., relative long and narrow reefs), relatively closed reefs (i. e., few open patches) and higher coverage of oysters within reef patches. The ability of C. gigas to shape the environment thus depends both on biotic and abiotic conditions, meaning that oyster reefs only work under specific conditions for erosion control. Overall, our results provide baseline understanding for ecosystem management aimed at affecting sediment dynamics, thereby contributing to a better understanding for designing ecosystem-based solutions under different abiotic and biotic conditions. In addition, present study provides a clear example of how we need {{to gain a better understanding}} of the conditionality of ecosystem services in general, to be able to create and restore ecosystems for obtaining their services...|$|R

With some form of debt restructuring a foregone conclusion, Russia, the United States, and world community have a vital stake in searching for creative ways to transform the inevitability of debt restructuring into something of value and constructive to Russia and the problems it faces. This was the rationale behind debt-for-nature swaps which emerged in the early 1980 s in Latin American and Eastern Europe as a means of relieving developing nations of their crippling foreign debt. Debt-for-nature swaps served both domestic and international needs by converting a portion of foreign debt, often at steep discounts, into local currency that was then used to fund programs to preserve the environment. The debt swap mechanism provides the prospect of getting something of real value where nothing is expected. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has proposed to use the same model to synergistically capitalize defense threat reduction activities and environmental remediation within Russia's closed nuclear cities. Preventing the emigration of nuclear technology, expertise, and hardware from these cities to subnational groups and countries of proliferation concern is one of the world's foremost pressing problems.

30|$|Due to {{different}} social situations, {{the theories of}} third-party governance and partnership represented by Salamon do not provide a suitable method for analyzing the purchase of public services by the Chinese government or the development of social organizations. The purchase of social services and government funding generates the interstitial space for the original obscure relationship, which facilitates boundary formation and change. Academia has not paid full attention to boundary issues nor has the function of intersystem translation been emphasized. The mainstream view on studies of social work in China is “embedded development” (Ge 2012; Wang 2011), including “political embeddness” or “system embeddness” (Xiong 2006). It is easy for this development to emphasize top-down control and to ignore the social service organization’s independence, which requires the building of capacity and {{an emphasis on the}} value of service. Some scholars find that while entering the community context, social service organizations are easily absorbed by the power structure of the sub-district. Social organizations are absorbed into the mechanism of state administration and “social workers are becoming more administrative in external serving, more bureaucratic in internal control and more of institutionalization after being introduced into the power network of the community” (Zhu and Chen 2013). This reflects deviation from the essential requirements of NPOs and disappointment about the impossibility of keeping professional faith. When emphasizing social work development, regardless of its nature, social service organizations may be <b>trapped</b> as a <b>service</b> instrument (DiMaggio and Anheier 1990). The over-emphasis on the absorption and control of the sub-district considers social service organizations as passive recipients and neglects their ability to initiate and spur further development. Moreover, both types of boundaries correspond to the issues of localization and professionalization. As a result, the academia may outweigh localization (the embedded development) or require additional professionalization (pessimism). Both stances have separate viewpoints, which are different or even opposite. They neglect the most important role of social service organizations in the balancing of boundaries: the interjacent role. Therefore, we need a more dynamic view of the development of the social service organizations. The paper focuses on the different stages and different parts of boundary production in the service supply process.|$|R
40|$|Terraced paddy {{field is}} not only {{important}} for rural food security, but also for trapping sediment in the slopping land. The aims of this research were to quantify the amount of incoming and outgoing sediments and to study sediment movement behavior during harrowing and fertilizing under traditional irrigation of terraced paddy field system. This study was carried out at Keji Village, Semarang District, Central Java during two cropping seasons, a wet season 2003 / 04 and a dry season 2004. A paddy field with eight terraces was selected. The terraces were flat, different in size and descending to the river. Sediment samples were taken at harrowing and fertilizing activities. The results indicated that at harrowing, outgoing sediment was higher than incoming both during the wet and the dry seasons. About 0. 53 and 0. 27 t ha- 1 day- 1 of soil were eroded during harrowing in the wet and the dry seasons, respectively. However, a week before and after fertilizing, both in the wet and the dry seasons, the amounts of incoming sediment were higher than the outgoing one. In the wet season, the amounts of incoming sediments were {{three to four times}} higher than the outgoing one, both a week before and after fertilizing. During the wet season, about 0. 31 and 0. 34 t ha- 1 day- 1 of sediment was yielded a week before and after fertilizing, respectively. During the dry season, the incoming sediments were ten times higher than the outgoing one. On an average the sediment yields were about 0. 07 and 0. 08 t ha- 1 day- 1 a week before and after fertilizing, respectively. Terraces having greater areas deposited more sediment than those with smaller sizes. During a week before and after first fertilizing, the total amounts of incoming sediments were 6. 44 and 1. 19 t ha- 1 for the wet and dry seasons, while that of outgoing sediments were 1. 89 and 0. 14 t ha- 1 for the wet and dry seasons, respectively.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 257 - 269. This study {{investigated}} the historical and sociological significance of domestic service in Cape and Cape Town class relations. The forces {{which led to the}} present class structure with its particular colour and sexual division of labour, where the majority of domestic workers were and are Black women were examined. It was felt that an emphasis on women's oppression only would obscure a broader understanding of domestic service in a class society where domestic service has been a major component of class, colour and sex oppression. A class analysis was used which allowed questions of gender to be posed. An historical investigation was necessary to analyse changing class relations and changes in the groups predominating in domestic service. Census reports for the Cape and Cape Town were studied in order to construct a sociological "index" to the class structure. Although many people were incorporated into wage labour via domestic service, class position and the earliness of their incorporation into wage labour allowed many groups to move on to other types of employment. Those who predominated in domestic service were the most disadvantaged by their class, colour and gender. It was because of a demand for cheap Black, mostly male, labour that Black women became <b>trapped</b> in domestic <b>service</b> in the absence of other options for employment. Ruling class demands for a supply of cheap labour as well as measures to control this labour were investigated. The Masters and Servants Acts were major sources of control and were both class and colour biased. Since so many people were incorporated into wage labour via domestic service, domestic service has been a major component in establishing class domination and control. Furthermore, domestic workers were also subject to informal control from their employers. It was only towards the 1900 s that explicit demands were made for female domestic workers in order to release male labour for other sectors of employment. By 1948, pressures were building up from the ruling class to introduce more stringent control over movement and this eventually led to extensions of pass laws after 1948. An attempt was made to elaborate on how domestic workers experienced their oppression (racist and sexist attitudes of employers were a part) and to draw a link between class and sex oppression. By the nature of the close contact between employer and employee, employers could exert a great deal of control over domestic workers' private lives and this control was often sexist. Limited material on resistance was found and this, together with the lack of options for other sources of survival, illustrated domestic workers' unique oppression...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} fifteen years the Sacramento River {{has become one of the}} most popular fishing streams in California for steelhead rainbow trout, Salmo gairdnerii gairdnerii Richardson. Each fall, {{fishermen}} in ever increasing numbers travel from all parts of California, as well as from neighboring states, to participate in the harvest of this prized western game fish. The increase in the numbers of anglers has been brought about by an accumulation of events, foremost of which has been an explosive growth in California's population and in the numbers of people seeking outdoor recreation. Construction of Shasta Dam, with its stabilizing and cooling effect upon the upper Sacramento, has produced an environment better suited for steelhead. The Sacramento is also a favorite steelhead stream of many anglers because the best fishing is enjoyed during balmy days in the fall, rather than during the cold periods so typical of most winter-run steelhead fishing areas. This expanding popularity made it essential that the Sacramento River steelhead management program be evaluated to determine whether or not it is adequate to insure continued good fishing in the face of these mounting demands upon the resource. Provision of good steelhead fishing despite the inroads by man is a problem which faces conservation agencies along the Pacific Coast. The State of Washington has attempted to offset this increase in fishing pressure principally by a long-range management program consisting of releases of migrant-sized steelhead (yearling fish averaging 6 to 8 inches in length) to supplement depleted and heavily fished runs, coupled with protective regulations and installation of fishways and fish screens to protect the runs. The stocking of migrant-sized steelhead during their normal period of seaward migration has definitely built up the runs of sea-run fish in Washington streams. In California it had been the policy for many years prior to 1940 to stock coastal streams with fingerling steelhead in the summer months. The results of this program shed considerable doubt on the effectiveness of this type of artificial stocking. An experimental program at California's Waddell and Scott creeks from 1932 through 1942 revealed that only extremely small returns of sea-run fish may be expected from releases of fingerling steelhead, but that on the average approximately 2 to 5 percent may be expected to return as adults when allowed to descend to sea as yearlings at their normal migration time. Until the start in 1952 of the study described herein, the management program for Sacramento River steelhead had consisted primarily of protective regulations and installation of fish protective devices such as fish screens and fish ways. There had been no artificial stocking of steelhead. The only previous significant investigation of Sacramento River steelhead was included in a study of the sport fishery, which was made between 1947 and 1949. Prior to 1952 considerable knowledge had been gained through the years about steelhead in the smaller coastal streams of California, but relatively little was known concerning the life history of Sacramento steelhead or the merits of planting migrant-sized steelhead in the Sacramento River. Therefore, it was decided to examine this important resource more thoroughly and to find out if artificial stocking of large numbers of migrant-sized steelhead in the Sacramento was a feasible method of maintaining or improving fishing for adult steelhead. In 1952 the California Department of Fish and Game's Bureau of Fish Conservation (now Inland Fisheries Branch) initiated a project to determine the effectiveness and economics of supplementing natural steelhead production in the Sacramento River with yearling, hatchery-reared fish. Secondary objectives were to study the fishery and the life history of Sacramento steelhead. It was originally planned to have the field work continue until 1960 but was found possible to complete it by 1958. The study was carried out as a cooperative program between the California Department of Fish and Game and several other organizations which recognized the need for an evaluation of steelhead stocking in the Sacramento River. Two sportsmen's organizations, California Kamloops, Inc. and Steelhead Unlimited, volunteered to pay for the food fed to the fish at the hatchery and awarded one thousand dollars over a five-year period to fishermen who returned tags to the Department of Fish and Game. Three thousand dollars in merchandise rewards for tag returns were donated by several sporting goods stores and fishing resorts along the Sacramento River between Redding and Meridian. The United States Fish and Wildlife <b>Service</b> <b>trapped</b> and spawned adult steelhead in Battle Creek and reared the resulting young to yearling size at Coleman National Fish Hatchery on the same stream. The Department of Fish and Game paid a small part of the food costs for rearing the fish, marked the yearlings, released them, and evaluated the returns...|$|R
