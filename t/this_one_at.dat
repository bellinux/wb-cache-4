5|$|British {{buildings}} and organisations now commemorate her by name. One {{of the first}} was the Mary Seacole Centre for Nursing Practice at Thames Valley University, which created the NHS Specialist Library for Ethnicity and Health, a web-based collection of research-based evidence and good practice information relating to the health needs of minority ethnic groups, and other resources relevant to multi-cultural health care. There is another Mary Seacole Research Centre, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> De Montfort University in Leicester, and a problem-based learning room at St George's, University of London is named after her. Brunel University in West London houses its School of Health Sciences and Social Care in the Mary Seacole Building. New buildings at the University of Salford and Birmingham City University bear her name, as does part of the new headquarters of the Home Office at 2 Marsham Street. There is a Mary Seacole ward in the Douglas Bader Centre in Roehampton. There are two wards named after Mary Seacole in Whittington Hospital in North London.|$|E
5|$|Following Virginia Tech's kickoff, Cincinnati {{began its}} first drive {{of the second}} half at its 36-yard line. Pike was stopped for no gain on a rushing attempt, then {{attempted}} a long pass downfield. The ball was intercepted by Virginia Tech defender Kam Chancellor, and the Hokies' offense returned to the field after just two Cincinnati plays. Tech's first play after the interception resulted in Taylor being sacked by Cincinnati defender Brandon Underwood for a loss of three yards, but Darren Evans made up the lost yardage by rushing 14 yards to the Tech 43-yard line for a first down. Taylor and Evans alternated short rushes, then Taylor completed a five-yard pass to Coale for another first down, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> the Cincinnati 47-yard line. Once in Cincinnati territory, however, the Hokies' offense faltered. Evans was tackled for a two-yard loss, then Taylor was sacked again, this time by John Hughes. A long pass attempt fell incomplete, and Tech punted {{for the first time in}} the second half. Returner Danny Milligan fumbled the ball, but he recovered the loose ball and returned it to the Cincinnati 20-yard line.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the song, Harrison {{delivers}} a spoken dedication to Frank Sinatra, adding: [...] "we love you, Frank, and we hope you include <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Caesars Palace on your next live album." [...] This message referred to Sinatra's adoption of the Harrison composition [...] "Something", which he lauded as [...] "the greatest love song of the past fifty years". On [...] "Far East Man", Inglis finds Scott's multiple horn parts [...] "reminiscent of the soul stylings" [...] of King Curtis, Junior Walker and the Funk Brothers. Unlike on the Wood recording, Harrison's slide guitar appears only midway through the Dark Horse version (overdubbed onto his rhythm guitar part), in a solo that author Elliot Huntley describes as [...] "wonderfully complement" [...] by Scott's [...] "bachelor-pad saxophones".|$|E

500|$|... "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken" [...] {{finished}} {{tied for}} 40th {{in the weekly}} ratings for the week of January 11–17, 1999 with a Nielsen rating of 8.9. The episode has met with mostly positive reviews. In his review of The Simpsons tenth season, James Plath of Dvdtown.com noted [...] "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken" [...] as [...] "pretty decent". Peter Brown of If regards [...] "Lard of the Dance", [...] "", [...] "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken", and [...] "" [...] as [...] "some of the best episodes of the season". The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that the episode was [...] "a curious unmemorable episode with a good chunk in the middle. Neither the opening with The Isotopes nor the finale with the rather dire song help <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> all, and frankly, if it wasn't for the superb parody of Village of the Damned, and the kids' revenge by revealing their family's secrets, it'd sink without trace." [...] In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed Lauper's performance {{as one of the}} thirty-three funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show.|$|E
500|$|Screen Rant's Kevin Yeoman, gave much praise in the episode. Like Paste {{magazine}} {{and other critics}} reviews, Yeoman claimed that [...] "there was certainly disappointment in finding out that Awake wouldn't see a second season, and would instead be looked at as a 13-episode miniseries". He claimed that the episode has the puzzling and high points {{that are similar to}} [...] "That's Not My Penguin" [...] and [...] "Say Hello to My Little Friend". Again, Screen Crush's Kevin Fitzpatrick was also disappointed that there would not be a second season. Verne Gay of Newsday gave the episode a complimenting review. He called it [...] "promising". He noted that he could see [...] "why Awake was canceled". He blessed [...] "the show for at least trying". He called it [...] "challenging" [...] and [...] "original". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode [...] "fascinating", [...] "puzzling" [...] and [...] "moving". Carl Cortez of Assignment X, again, enjoyed the episode. In his [...] "B+" [...] grade review, he noted that [...] "you can view it as another missed opportunity". He claimed that parts of the episode were [...] "confusing". He stated that he would [...] "prefer to have more questions than answers". He argued that the episode felt more like a [...] "Series Finale, than Season Finale", which he called [...] "a good thing", [...] "Too many good shows go off into the sunset without a single resolution and <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> least strives for something more". He also argued that NBC should have [...] "put a little more promotional push". He called it [...] "challenging" [...] and [...] "interesting".|$|E
2500|$|French {{team manager}} Raymond Domenech {{said of the}} game, [...] "I don't see what {{we could have done}} better...We needed to qualify and we did that, even if it was painful. Victories like <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> <b>at</b> the end of a {{difficult}} campaign, give this side heart and soul", although criticism in France of his team, which had existed before the game, continued. Domenech later criticised the condemnation of Henry and France, and questioned the right of former French players like Cantona and Lizarazu to criticise his record as the French coach.|$|E

2500|$|After his meeting, Szögyény {{reported}} to Vienna that Wilhelm [...] "would regret {{it if we}} [...] let this present chance, which was so favourable for us, go by without utilising it". This so-called [...] "blank cheque" [...] of German support {{up to and including}} war was to be the main determining factor in Austrian policy in July 1914. At another meeting held on 5 July, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Potsdam palace, German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, the Foreign Ministry's State Secretary Arthur Zimmermann, the Minister of War Erich von Falkenhayn, the head of the German Imperial Military Cabinet Moriz von Lyncker, the Adjutant general Hans von Plessen, Captain Hans Zenker of the Naval General Staff, and Admiral Eduard von Capelle of the Naval State Secretariat all endorsed Wilhelm's [...] "blank cheque" [...] as Germany's best policy.|$|E
2500|$|The current {{cable car}} network {{consists}} of three routes. Like all Municipal Railway (Muni) routes which have route letters or numbers, the cable lines have route numbers, but the cable routes are generally referred to by {{the names of the}} streets on which they travel. [...] The Powell-Hyde and Powell-Mason lines use [...] "single-ended" [...] cars, which must be looped or turned around like a bus {{at the end of the}} line; the single-ended cable cars use manual non-powered turntables to rotate the car. There are three street turntables to do <b>this,</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> the end of each of the three terminals: at Market & Powell Streets, Taylor & Bay Streets, and Hyde & Beach Streets, with a fourth turntable located inside the car barn on Washington and Jackson Streets.|$|E
2500|$|Nolan and Harvey {{combined}} commands made a dry camp on {{the evening}} of July 19. This was where Nolan discovered the lack of water rationing of his men. [...] The hunters were amused, maybe they {{thought it was a good}} lesson for the soldiers. [...] The next day led them up Sulpher Draw (Tobacco Creek, Nolan called it) and made the difficult climb up the cap rock up onto the [...] "Yarner" [...] of the [...] Llano Estacado. They headed for a large playa the hunters reported was nearby which they reached on July 21. A playa, or shallow depression is a basin that fills only when it rains. Cooper estimated <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> about [...] in size with a maximum depth of [...] There all relished in the water and played. Cooper described the rare event of men of different cultures and races, horses, mules, birds and other animals enjoying the water as one of the greatest [...] "aggregations of the animal kingdom ever witnessed" [...] "outside a circus tent" [...] in one small place.|$|E

60|$|In this {{conjecture}} Jack was right. The gold-miner {{was enjoying}} an unsocial {{cup of tea}} at the time, and fortunately heard the distant shots and shouting. Buckley was a prompt man. Loading his double barrel with ball as he ran, he suddenly made his appearance on the field, saw at a glance how matters stood, and, being a good shot, put two balls in the bear's carcass with deadly effect. Grizzly bears are, however, remarkably tenacious of life. <b>This</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> once turned on his new foe, who, getting behind a tree, re-loaded as quickly as possible. As the animal passed he put two more balls in its heart and killed it.|$|E

The blade was always bright and clear; each time she looked she had the happiness of knowing that all was well, till one evening, tired and anxious, as she frequently was at the end of the day, she took it from its drawer, and behold! the blade was red with blood. Her cry of horror brought her youngest brother to her, and, unable to speak, she held out the knife! ...|$|E
60|$|As {{might have}} been {{expected}} in the circumstances, he was a powerful baby. We cannot afford space for a full description, but {{it would be wrong to}} omit mention of the strength of his lungs. The imitative tendency of children is proverbial. Clearly the locomotive was baby Marrot's pattern in many things. No infant that ever drew breath equalled <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> a yell. There was absolutely a touch of sublimity in the sound of the duet--frequently heard--when baby chanced to be performing a solo and his father's engine went shrieking past with a running accompaniment! It is a disputed point to this day which of the two beat the other; and it is an admitted fact that nothing else could equal either.|$|E

So the mud-turtle went in alone again and come out just as flat as he done before. The lawyer for the prostitution looked very comfortable, but the judge looked disgusted. You see, Tom was {{just the same as}} a regular lawyer, nearly, because it was Arkansaw law for a prisoner to choose anybody he wanted to help his lawyer, and Tom had had Uncle Silas shove him into the case, and now he was botching it and you could see the judge didn't like it much. All that the mud-turtle got out of Lem and Jim was this: he asked them: ...|$|E
