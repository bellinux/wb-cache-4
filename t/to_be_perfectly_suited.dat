40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, strong {{evidence}} that galaxies have undergone a significant evolution over cosmic time were found. Do galaxy mergers, {{one of the main}} driving mechanisms behind the growth of galaxies, {{played a key role in}} their evolution at significant look-back time? Due to the difficulty to identify these violent interactions between galaxies at high redshifts, the major merger rate, involving two galaxies of similar masses, was constrained so far up to redshift z~ 3, from previous studies of spectrocopic pair counts. Thanks <b>to</b> MUSE, which <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> identify close pairs of galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts, we <b>are</b> now able <b>to</b> extend such studies up to z~ 6. I will present the results obtained from deep (10 - 30 h) MUSE observations in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. We provide the first constraints on the galaxy major merger evolution over 12 Gyrs (0. 2 < z < 6) and over a broad range of stellar masses, showing that there is a flattening of the major merger rate evolution at very high redshift...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{shows that}} nowadays it <b>is</b> impossible <b>to</b> manage people without manging use of technologies, therefore the title "technology used a tool <b>to</b> manage people", <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> what will <b>be</b> {{presented in this}} project, which is a connection between what is already known about contemporary theories of human resource management (HRM) and what is being developed {{in terms of the}} e-HR platform to manage people. In addition, a new theory of HRM is outlined which is based on the E-HR technology and suggests the alignment between the human resource sector and the business strategy of the organisation. Firstly, the research statrts with the presentation of the evolution of HR, which was initially called 'industrial welfare', and then follows on with main activities and goals of HR today. Secondly, the disseration gives a different perspective of HR and its future challenges in regards to the relationship between technology and traditional HR, resulting in an e-HRM platform. It gives a new approach for the alignment of human resources with technology to show that HR is now part of the business and organisational strategy. HR cannot <b>be</b> restricted <b>to</b> administrative tasks any longer. Finally, it will apply management theories to the real world or, in other words, it will show that it <b>is</b> unavoidable <b>to</b> manage people and HR without making use of IT...|$|R

In order to improve the computational efﬁciency of this class of methods a p-multigrid solution strategy has been developed, which is based on a semi-implicit Runge–Kutta smoother for high-order polynomial approximations and the implicit Backward Euler smoother for piecewise constant approximations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparison with p-multigrid schemes employing purely explicit smoothing operators for several 2 D inviscid test cases...|$|E
