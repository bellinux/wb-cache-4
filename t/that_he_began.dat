5|$|As Bishop of Aberdeen, Lichton {{was one of}} its {{greatest}} builders. The Aberdeen Registrum noted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> to rebuild the cathedral, and Hector Boece gave a description of his rebuilding, noting that although he finished the walls and two belltowers, the third belltower remained unfinished at his death. Licthon also constructed a new chapel dedicated to St John the Evangelist, and donated much {{of his own money}} to new service books and vestments, {{as well as to the}} reconstruction of the cathedral. He also authored several legal and religious texts, though none have survived.|$|E

He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by his father on his deathbed always to heed the welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else.

5|$|Gray {{was an avid}} reader even in his youth. He {{completed}} Clinton Grammar School {{from about}} 1823 to 1825, in those years reading many books from the nearby library at Hamilton College. In 1825 he enrolled at Fairfield Academy, switching to its Fairfield Medical College, {{also known as the}} Medical College of the Western District of Fairfield, in autumn 1826. It was during this time that Gray began to mount botanical specimens. On a trip to New York City, he attempted to meet with John Torrey to get assistance in identifying specimens, but Torrey was not home, so Gray left the specimens at Torrey's house. Torrey was so impressed with Gray's specimens <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> a correspondence with him. Gray graduated and became an M.D. in February 1831, even though he was not yet 21 years of age, which was a requirement at the time. Although Gray did open a medical office in Bridgewater, New York, where he had served an apprenticeship with Doctor John Foote Trowbridge while he was in medical school, he never truly practiced medicine as he enjoyed botany more. It was around this time <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> making explorations in New York and New Jersey. By autumn 1831 he had essentially given up his medical practice to devote more time to botany.|$|E
5|$|Well-known {{songs from}} the late 1960s and early 1970s {{included}} Suomi–Ruotsi ("Finland–Sweden") and the 1971 release Matkarakastaja ("Travelling Lover"), which met with criticism. While Vainio's early albums were collections of singles, he recorded his first proper studio album in 1972. The album Viisari värähtää ("The Pointer Twitches") included the song Kaunissaari (a reference to a place in Finland), which Vainio recorded several times during his career. It was also included on his next album, Tulin, näin ja soitin ("I Came, I Saw, I Played"), which was released in 1975. Although Matkarakastaja and Viisari värähtää were Vainio's earliest published compositions, {{it was not until}} the late 1970s <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> to compose music more actively.|$|E
5|$|When Donnchadh adopted or {{was given}} the title of earl (Latin: comes), or in his own {{language}} mormaer, is a debated question. Historian Alan Orr Anderson argued <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> using the title of comes between 1214 and 1216, based on Donnchadh's appearance as a witness to two charters issued by Thomas de Colville; the first, known as Melrose 193 (this being its number in Cosmo Innes's printed version of the cartulary), was dated by Anderson to 1214. In this charter, Donnchadh has no title. By contrast Donnchadh was styled comes in a charter dated by Anderson to 1216, Melrose 192.|$|E

5|$|William and {{his brother}} Roger de Chesney were leading {{supporters}} of King Stephen in 1141, and were both leaders in Stephen's army that gathered at Winchester. In 1143, William de Chesney was given control {{of the town and}} royal castle at Oxford. He also held the town and castle of Deddington, which he had acquired at least by 1157, and possibly earlier. Although he did not begin the fortifications at Deddington Castle, it is likely <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> the first stone defences at the site.

5|$|According to Mummer Kaylan, {{author of}} The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate of Secular Turkey, Bazna said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> spying for the Germans because {{he needed the}} money and, {{although}} {{he was not a}} Nazi, he liked Germans and disliked the British. He also alluded to involvement with the Milli Emniyet Hizmeti, which became the Turkish National Security Service in 1965. The British historian Richard Wires wrote Bazna was motivated entirely by greed as he had dreams of becoming rich by selling secrets to the Germans. Wires described Bazna as a typical petty criminal from the Balkans, a man of low intelligence with no values except greed who was apolitical and opportunistic, taking advantages of whatever chances he found to try to get rich, but who was easily duped by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|According to Noon, talk had {{circulated}} about adding extra {{characters that}} {{were not in the}} film. As the Sheng Long hoax and Akuma's debut in Super Street Fighter II Turbo were fairly recent at the time, the designers asked for Capcom's permission to add both characters into the game. Capcom approved the addition of Akuma, but denied the inclusion of Sheng Long. However, Capcom later unexpectedly approved the addition of Sheng Long. Noon designed Sheng Long's appearance for the title, giving him black gi pants and a long, green, padded/quilted, sleeveless Gi style top which was tied off with a black beltmandarin style, long white braided hair, Fu Manchu moustache, a thick black ribbon over his eyes due to being blinded by Akuma and one hand taking the form of a dragon's claw, described {{as a result of his}} power being so advanced, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> to physically manifest dragon like attributes. Capcom approved the design, and Luis Mangubat an artist from the development team posed as Sheng Long. However, the character was left unfinished because of time constraints.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the book}} by Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals that he stood for, but his contemporaries would turn more and more indifferent to these ideals.

It is clear <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> to identify himself with the work {{and it is possible}} that he also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E
5|$|After his {{baseball}} career ended, Paciorek {{returned to school}} and {{earned a degree in}} physical education from the University of Houston, a degree <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> to pursue while recovering from back surgery. While acquiring his degree, he became a Christian Scientist and married Linda Cupp. After graduating from college, he spent several years as an instructor at a Jewish community center, then became a physical education teacher after inquiring about a Christian Science Monitor advertisement for a teaching position at Clairbourn School in San Gabriel, California. Linda died of breast cancer in 1987, and Paciorek married Karen Purdy two years later. Paciorek has four sons and four daughters. His nephew, Joey Paciorek, played in the Milwaukee Brewers minor league organization, and his sons, Pete and Mack, had minor league careers as well. While watching his son in training camp, Paciorek became an author after watching what he felt was improper instruction given to the players. He has since written two books, Plato & Socrates, Baseball's Wisest Fans and The Principle of Baseball, and All There is to Know About Hitting.|$|E
5|$|At {{its closest}} approach, the angular size of Mars is 25arcseconds (a unit of degree); {{this is much}} {{too small for the}} naked eye to resolve. Hence, prior to the {{invention}} of the telescope, nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations. His records indicate <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon. Although uncertain of his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.|$|E

It was here at the former seat of the Song dynasty <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>began</b> a large project of reconstruction (since the siege against it in 1127). For much of his reign there was peace between Jin and Song, while both states upheld an uninterrupted flow of commercial trade between each other. While amassing tribute from the Southern Song, the Jin dynasty also imported large amounts of tea, rice, sugar, and books from the Southern Song. However, Wanyan Liang reopened the Jin dynasty's armed conflict with the Song by the 1160s.|$|E
