The {{purpose of this paper is}} to reveal the major role played by the Touring Club de France (TCF) in the launching of winter sports in France through its promotion of <b>tourist</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and support of the related activities. The TCF played an innovating and most efficient part through its action on three essential aspects: equipping sites for tourists; developing the manufacture of winter sports equipment; and promoting winter sports, thus bringing new life to mountain resorts. In taking into account the crucial role of the TCF in this study, the main sources used are related to the club itself: its archives and the monthly review from 1908 to 1914. On a larger scale, an explanation on how the TCF acted as a lever to generate dynamics beneficial to local development of the mountain areas will also be provided...|$|R

25|$|Despite the {{controversial}} {{status of the}} territory and its damaged infrastructure, tourism in Abkhazia grew following the Russian recognition of Abkhazian independence in 2008 due {{to the arrival of}} Russian tourists. In 2009 the number of Russian tourists in Abkhazia increased by 20% and the total number of Russian tourists reached 1 million.

40|$|AbstractThis paper aims {{to profile}} the {{tourists}} who have holidays in the Region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace (REMTh) in Greece regarding the factors affecting them in choosing their travel destination {{and sources of}} information and demographic characteristics. In particular the main factors influencing tourists to choose REMTh as tourist destination were identified. Furthermore tourists with similar buying behaviour were classified into groups; each group of tourists was profiled according to their preferences regarding their holidays and their demographic characteristics. Field interviews were conducted in a randomly selected sample consisting of 265 people in REMTh in summer 2013. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was performed to identify the main factors that affect tourists to make vacation in REMTh. These factors were: (a) Travel connections and <b>tourist</b> <b>infrastructures</b> (b) natural environment (c) vacation activities, (d) entertainment, (e) culture and (f) value for money. Hierarchical and non hierarchical cluster techniques were employed to classify tourists with similar behaviour. Three groups of tourists were identified: (a) those interested in the vacation activities, entertainment and culture (b) opportunists, (c) those interested in natural environment and (d) those interested in travel connections, <b>tourist</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and value for money. Discriminant Analysis was performed to assess how the identified main factors affecting tourists to have holidays in REMTh through PCA, could predict cluster membership.

25|$|Water {{resources}} {{management in}} the country, in particular water quality, quantity and Watershed management faces major challenges today. Despite {{of the lack of}} systematic data limiting an accurate and detailed assessment of the scope of the problems, there is a consensus that: (i) the overall poor quality of surface, groundwater and coastal water resources {{is the result of a}} lack of waste water management and agricultural run-off, causing health problems that disproportionally affect the poor; (ii) water scarcity is a regional problem resulting from poor demand management in irrigation, urban water supply and <b>tourist</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in drier regions; (iii) weak watershed management leads to soil erosion and amplifies the damage and frequency of flooding; and (iv) the overall lack of solid waste management pollutes water sources, causes disease and is a nuisance for inhabitants and visitors alike. The DR government is in the process of reducing its role as main investor for water resources infrastructure and services provider decentralizing some responsibilities to local and regional government, water users organizations, and private companies.|$|E

La Manga sandbar is cut off by natural channels that keep the two seas in contact with each other; the so-called golas allow water from the Mediterranean into the lake.
