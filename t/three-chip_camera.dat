40|$|We present {{our work}} {{regarding}} {{the evaluation of}} protection measures against laser dazzling for imaging devices. Different approaches {{for the evaluation of}} dazzled sensor images are investigated to estimate the loss of information due to the dazzle spot: (1) counting the number of overexposed pixels, (2) based on triangle orientation discrimination, and (3) using the structural similarity index. The evaluation approaches are applied on experimental data obtained with two different sensors hardened against laser dazzling. The hardening concept of the first sensor is based on the combination of a spatial light modulator and wavelength multiplexing. This protection concept allows spatially and spectrally resolved suppression of laser radiation within the sensor's field-of-view. The hardening concept of the second sensor utilizes the principle of "complementary bands. " The optical setup resembles a common <b>three-chip</b> <b>camera,</b> with the difference that dedicated filters with steep edges replace the regular spectral band filters. Although this concept does not really represent a "protection measure," it allows the sensor to provide information even in laser dazzling situations. The data for the performance evaluation were acquired both in a laboratory setup using test charts comprising triangles of different size and orientation as well as in field trials...|$|E
40|$|Endoscopic endonasal trans-sphenoid surgery (EETS) is {{increasingly}} used for pituitary lesions. Pre-operative CT and MRI scans and peroperative endoscopic visualization can provide useful anatomical information. EETS is indicated in sellar, suprasellar, intraventricular, retro-infundibular, and invasive tumors. Recurrent and residual lesions, pituitary apoplexy and {{empty sella syndrome}} can be managed by EETS. Modern neuronavigation techniques, ultrasonic aspirators, ultrasonic bone curette can add to the safety. The binostril approach provides a wider working area. High definition camera is much superior to <b>three-chip</b> <b>camera.</b> Most of the recent reports favor EETS in terms of safety, {{quality of life and}} tumor resection, hospital stay, better endocrinological, and visual outcome as compared to the microscopic technique. Nasal symptoms, blood loss, operating time are less in EETS. Various naso-septal flaps and other techniques of CSF leak repair could help reduce complications. Complications can be further reduced after achieving the learning curve, good understanding of limitations with proper patient selection. Use of neuronavigation, proper post-operative care of endocrine function, establishing pituitary center of excellence and more focused residency and endoscopic fellowship training could improve results. The faster and safe transition from microscopic to EETS can be done by the team concept of neurosurgeon/otolaryngologist, attending hands on cadaveric dissection, practice on models, and observation of live surgeries. Conversion to a microscopic or endoscopic-assisted approach may be required in selected patients. Multi-modality treatment could be required in giant and invasive tumors. EETS appears to be a better surgical option in most pituitary adenoma...|$|E

30|$|Improved imaging techniques. From {{the first}} video laparoscopies, {{there has been}} a steady and {{dramatic}} improvement in the quality of the images we have. Better light sources and cameras have replaced dull, poorly illuminated pictures by images of consistent high quality. <b>Three-chip</b> <b>cameras</b> are now standard and increasingly high-definition systems are becoming available. The results of these technological advances were demonstrated by the extraordinary quality of many of the videos shown throughout the meeting. This is an area which is perhaps difficult to justify on formal cost effect analysis but in which there can be no compromise. To undertake surgery with inadequate vision is both impractical and unethical. Conversely, the better the image available, the better the definition of the anatomy and pathology and so the more precise and better the quality of the surgery should be. The images are now so good it is difficult to anticipate further meaningful improvements but it is probable that further miniaturisation will make the instruments easier to use, particularly in areas currently difficult to access. Three-dimensional imaging would also simplify dissection and suturing. Such systems have been tried previously but {{have been found to be}} heavy and difficult to use and to also produce unstable and nausea-producing images. It is likely that improvements in these systems may soon result in the wide availability of useful 3 -D imaging systems.|$|R
30|$|The {{most common}} laparoscopes used in gynaecological surgery are 5 or 10  mm in diameter. A 150 -W halogen or xenon light source is {{necessary}} for the optical system to function optimally. A thicker light cable (10  mm) transmits more light and is preferable. The light cable should be replaced if {{more than one-third of the}} fibres are broken. Although the light transmitted is termed “cold light”, it can still generate significant heat if kept in contact with the patient or the drapes. The use of <b>three-chip</b> <b>cameras</b> with the video system gives a more realistic picture of tissues and organs. Atraumatic grasper should be used to manipulate the ovaries and the fallopian tubes. Tissue cutting can be achieved using scissors, EndoGIA or laser. While EndoGIA would add to the cost of surgery, laser is not commonly available. Tissue haemostasis is achieved by monopolar or bipolar electrocautery. The current delivered to the tissue should be enough to desiccate the tissues and not too much to cause charring. Many surgeons combine monopolar cautery with scissors to allow coagulation of tissues immediately prior to cutting the tissues. The operative field is kept clear by the use of suction irrigation system. Small tissue specimens can be removed directly from the laparoscopic portals. Larger specimens may be retrieved by use of endobags or culdotomy.|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} that integrates optics, colorimetry, and {{digital image processing}} is developed to measure the three-dimensional surface slope and elevation for time-evolving flows. The setup requires that a lens be {{placed at a distance}} of its focal length away from a diffuse, uniform, white light source which is covered with an appropriate transparent color palette. This setup then produces a system of color rays where beams of the same color are parallel to themselves, yet oriented in different directions with respect to beams of other colors. This arrangement is used in one of two modes. In the first mode, the reflective mode, the arrangement is set to illuminate the free surface from above the free surface. A <b>three-chip</b> color <b>camera</b> placed far above the free surface captures the reflected rays from the free surface (hence the name reflective mode). In the second mode, the refractive mode, the arrangement illuminates the free surface from below the free surface. A <b>three-chip</b> color <b>camera</b> placed far above the free surface captures the refracted rays from the free surface (hence the name refractive mode). For both modes, each of the three RGB color signals from the color camera is recorded onto separate laser disk recorders. These modes then allow for measurements of the free surface slope by creating a one-to-one correspondence between different colors and the free surface slopes. These data can then be integrated to derive the free surface elevation. Applications to various problems are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Laparoscopy was {{performed}} using a reusable single-site trocar with five integrated access ports (S-Portal X-Cone, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). This new device {{consists of two}} symmetrical metal half-shells that are connected and sealed by one large silicon cap containing the access port. Once in the peritoneal cavity, the two half-shells fit together to form an X shape and the final access portal. The silicon cap comprising three 5 -mm and one 12 -mm port is connected {{on top of the}} X-Cone, which forms an airtight seal. A clamp integrated into the rubber sealing prevents the X-Cone from opening unintentionally. The external and internal diameters {{at the level of the}} X-Cone's waistline are 25 and 20  mm, respectively. Under general anesthesia, each patient was positioned in the dorsal lithotomic position with both legs supported in Allen stirrups and the arms resting alongside the body. An intrauterine device was used to mobilise the uterus. A 2.0 -cm intraumbilical vertical skin incision and a 2 – 2.5 -cm rectus fasciotomy were performed to enter the peritoneal cavity. The single-port trocar was inserted into the abdominal cavity and the abdomen was insufflated to 12  mmHg. The patient was then put in a Trendelemburg position. Following placement of the X-Cone, the surgeon stood behind the patient’s left shoulder at the level of the patient’s right shoulder, and the monitor was positioned between the patient’s legs. We routinely used a rigid 30 °, 5 -mm-diameter, 50 -cm-length Hopkins high definition laparoscope in combination with a high definition <b>three-chip</b> video <b>camera</b> (Karl Storz) [8, 9].|$|R
