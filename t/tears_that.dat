5|$|Lesions can be transverse, {{occurring}} {{between the}} rings of the trachea, longitudinal or spiral. They may occur along the membranous {{part of the}} trachea, the main bronchi, or both. In 8% of ruptures, lesions are complex, occurring {{in more than one}} location, with more than one type of lesion, or on both of the main bronchi and the trachea. Transverse tears are more common than longitudinal or complex ones. The laceration may completely transect the airway or it may go only partway around. Partial <b>tears</b> <b>that</b> do not go {{all the way around the}} circumference of the airway do not allow a lacerated airway to become completely detached; <b>tears</b> <b>that</b> encircle the whole airway can allow separation to occur. Lacerations may also be classified as complete or incomplete. In an incomplete lesion, a layer of tissue surrounding the bronchus remains intact and can keep the air in the airway, preventing it from leaking into the areas surrounding the airways. Incomplete lacerations may require closer scrutiny to detect and may not be diagnosed right away.|$|E
5|$|Ancient lore {{states that}} Vana'diel was {{created as a}} {{playground}} for the Gods and their children, who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal. Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods, the children constructed a pathway to paradise. They were smote down for their insolence, however, and their cities cast {{to the bottom of}} the sea. After seeing the destruction of her children and filled with sadness, the Goddess Altana wept five <b>tears</b> <b>that</b> gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana'diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, condemned her weakness, however, and the life that arose from it. Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes: the apathy of the Humes, the arrogance of the Elvaan, the rage of the Galka, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, and the envy of the Mithra. He created the Beastmen, commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds, so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them. The creation lore's sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several Final Fantasy XI expansion packs, while the Beastmen are some of the game's main antagonists.|$|E
5|$|The film rewinds to 1910 Sargodha {{during the}} times of the British Raj. Javed, a Punjabi Muslim womaniser with a talent for reciting poetry, meets Aradhana, {{a young woman in}} the village, while being chased by the police. They become acquainted, but Javed's flirty nature upsets Aradhana. Javed insists she is special and focuses all his {{attention}} on her. He joins Aradhana's father in a protest for freedom from the British, but when officers begin to physically abuse the protestors, Javed hides while Aradhana's father is beaten. Aradhana is disgusted with him. To appease her, Javed allows himself to be beaten and arrested in front of her. She visits him in jail and tells him their love cannot happen, but he asks her to wait. Three months later, Javed is freed, but he learns that Aradhana was married a month before. Aradhana tells Javed in <b>tears</b> <b>that</b> she only got married to make her father happy. Soon after, Javed also must marry for his father's happiness. Aradhana comes to the wedding to see him one last time. During the vows, Javed realises Aradhana is wearing a widow's clothes and stops the wedding, insisting on marrying Aradhana.|$|E

Others say humans are molded from clay by the god Khnum. But overall, the focus of the creation myths is the establishment of cosmic order rather than the special place of humans within it.|$|E
25|$|The Natchez chiefdom was {{destroyed}} in the 1730s by the French; Natchez speakers took refuge among their neighbors and accompanied {{them when they were}} eventually driven to Oklahoma on the Trail of <b>Tears.</b> <b>That</b> meant that Natchez speakers were frequently multilingual in Creek, Cherokee, Natchez, and English, and the language gradually became endangered, and it is now generally considered extinct in spite of recent revitalization efforts.

25|$|Intrinsic factors {{refer to}} injury {{mechanisms}} that occur within the rotator cuff itself. The principal is a degenerative-microtrauma model, which supposes that age-related tendon damage compounded by chronic microtrauma results in partial tendon <b>tears</b> <b>that</b> then develop into full rotator cuff tears. As {{a result of}} repetitive microtrauma {{in the setting of}} a degenerative rotator cuff tendon, inflammatory mediators alter the local environment, and oxidative stress induces tenocyte apoptosis causing further rotator cuff tendon degeneration. A neural theory also exists that suggests neural overstimulation leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and may also contribute to tendon degeneration.|$|E
25|$|The first {{non-indigenous}} {{group to}} {{set foot in the}} area was the party of explorer Gaspar de Portolà, who camped near the present day intersection of Barrington and Ohio Avenues on August 3, 1769. There are two different versions of the naming of the city. One says that it was named in honor of the feast day of Saint Monica (mother of Saint Augustine), but her feast day is actually May 4. Another version says that it was named by Juan Crespí on account of a pair of springs, the Kuruvungna Springs (Serra Springs), that were reminiscent of the <b>tears</b> <b>that</b> Saint Monica shed over her son's early impiety.|$|E
25|$|Gloom (Blue Heart) - Peach will cry, {{causing a}} cartoonish amount of tears to {{steadily}} stream out {{in both directions}} around her as she dashes forward. The stream of <b>tears</b> <b>that</b> gets scattered while she is crying {{can also be used}} to water certain obstacles, such as helping a small sprout grow into a long tall plant which she can use to climb and reach higher places. When the tears hit the ground, ceiling or walls, sparkles appear beneath, above or next to them. This power can defeat the Nipper Plants and Cheep-Cheeps, extinguish flames, strike all blocks at once, wash away Blooper's ink on the ground, push heavy chained balls and inflicted enemies.|$|E

25|$|A {{rotator cuff}} tear {{can be caused}} by the {{weakening}} of the rotator cuff tendons. This weakening {{can be caused by}} age or how often the rotator cuff is used. Adults over the age of 60 are more susceptible to a rotator cuff tear. According to a study in the Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology the frequency of rotator cuff tears can increase with age. The study shows the participants that were the ages of 70–90 years old had a rate of rotator cuff <b>tears</b> <b>that</b> were 1 to 5. The participants who were 90+ years old the frequency of a rotator cuff tear jumped to 1 to 3. This study shows that with an increase in age there is also an increase in the probability of a rotator cuff tear.|$|E
25|$|Vaginal tears {{can occur}} during childbirth, most {{often at the}} vaginal opening as the baby's head passes through, {{especially}} if the baby descends quickly. Tears can involve the perineal skin or extend to the muscles and the anal sphincter and anus. The midwife or obstetrician may decide to make a surgical cut to the perineum (episiotomy) to make the baby's birth easier and prevent severe <b>tears</b> <b>that</b> {{can be difficult to}} repair. A 2017 Cochrane review compared episiotomy as needed (restrictive) with routine episiotomy to determine the possible benefits and harms for mother and baby. The review found that restrictive episiotomy policies appeared to give a number of benefits compared with using routine episiotomy. Women experienced less severe perineal trauma, less posterior perineal trauma, less suturing and fewer healing complications at seven days with no difference in occurrence of pain, urinary incontinence, painful sex or severe vaginal/perineal trauma after birth.|$|E
25|$|The Sorting Hat is a sapient {{artefact}} used at Hogwarts, {{which uses}} Legilimency (essentially, {{the ability to}} read minds) to determine which of the four school houses – Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin – each new student is to be assigned for their years at Hogwarts. The hat resembles a dilapidated conical leather wide-brimmed wizard's hat, with folds and <b>tears</b> <b>that</b> make it appear to have eyes and a mouth. During the opening banquet {{at the beginning of each}} school year, the Hat is placed on every first-year student's head. The Hat announces its choice aloud, and the student joins the selected house. The Hat speaks to the student while they're being sorted and is willing to take the student's preferences into account when it makes its decision. Sometimes it does not have the need to do so: for instance, the Hat barely touched Draco Malfoy's head before sending him to Slytherin. The Sorting Hat had a difficult time placing Harry, almost placing him into Slytherin house before he requested specifically and emphatically not to be. The Hat instead placed him into Gryffindor, the house of his parents. Rowling has stated the reason for the Hat's indecision as to which house to place him into was because it sensed the part of Voldemort's soul within Harry.|$|E

25|$|Identification of {{the exact}} causes usually begins with a {{thorough}} medical history, including detailed questioning about symptoms, bowel habits, diet, medication and other medical problems. Digital rectal examination is performed to assesses resting pressure and voluntary contraction (maximum squeeze) of the sphincter complex and puborectalis. Anal sphincter defects, rectal prolapse, and abnormal perineal descent may be detected. Anorectal physiology tests assess {{the functioning of the}} anorectal anatomy. Anorectal manometry records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and during contraction. The procedure is also able to assess sensitivity of the anal canal and rectum. Anal electromyography tests for nerve damage, which is often associated with obstetric injury. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves. Proctography, also known as defecography, shows how much stool the rectum can hold, how well the rectum holds it, and how well the rectum can evacuate the stool. It will also highlight defects {{in the structure of the}} rectum such as internal rectal intussusception. Dynamic pelvic MRI, also called MRI defecography is an alternative which is better for some problems but not as good for other problems. Proctosigmoidoscopy involves the insertion of an endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera) into the anal canal, rectum and sigmoid colon. The procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut, and may detect signs of disease or other problems that could be a cause, such as inflammation, tumors, or scar tissue. Endoanal ultrasound, which some consider to be the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions, evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters, and may detect occult sphincter <b>tears</b> <b>that</b> otherwise would go unseen.|$|E

[...] Later, he added that the video [...] "recalls the halcyon days of big-ticket rock videos" [...] and some [...] "claustrophobic, cathartic performance footage."
