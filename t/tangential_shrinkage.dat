40|$|Abstract. Wood has {{a strong}} {{hygroscopic}} behaviour, with a strong variation of moisture content and dimension stability caused by modifications of the relative humidity of the surrounding air. The properties that define the behaviour of wood facing temperature and moisture actions were studied in this work. Linear thermal expansion, hygroscopicity, <b>shrinkage</b> (<b>tangential</b> and radial <b>shrinkage</b> coefficient) and hygric expansion were given special attention. An experimental device was designed for testing wood samples, red oak.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate some wood properties of a clone of Eucalyptus urophylla in the radial direction and in two positions along the trunk. The studied material came from Votorantim Metais Zinco S. A., and the plantations, located in Vazante, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, were six years old. Six trees were harvested from which were cut two logs with three meter long each. Those logs were sawed into thick diametral slabs. A one-meter sample was obtained from these planks in the radial direction. Following this,samples were taken {{for the evaluation of}} specific gravity and apparent density, shrinkage from green or from 12 % moisture, fiber and vessel sizes and static bending properties. It was foundthat basic and apparent specific gravities, total longitudinal shrinkage, fiber length, vessel diameter and moduli of rupture and elasticity tended to increase in the bark-to-pith direction,while partial longitudinal shrinkage, the tangential/radial ratios and the vessel frequency were reduced. Radial and <b>tangential</b> <b>shrinkages,</b> width, lumen diameter and fiber wall thickness showed different patterns of variation. Only partial volumetric, radial shrinkages and vessel frequency showed different values between the two logs taken from the same tree. The main correlations observed were between modulus of elasticity and of rupture with either specific gravity or apparent density and between fiber lumen diameter with specific gravity, total longitudinal shrinkage and with modulus of rupture in static bending...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWood shrinks during drying {{with the}} {{departure}} of bond water. Along the fibre direction, {{the magnitude of this}} shrinkage is mainly governed by the orientation of cellulose microfibrils (MF) in the cell wall. However, tension wood has an unexpectedly high longitudinal shrinkage considering the fact that MFs are oriented nearly parallel to the cell direction. This effect is thought to be due to the gel collapse of G-layer, however, some species producing a tension wood without G-layer also exhibit a higher longitudinal shrinkage than normal wood. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the contribution of maturation stresses to drying <b>shrinkage.</b> Longitudinal and <b>tangential</b> drying <b>shrinkage</b> of tension wood and normal wood were measured on two sets of matched chestnut wood samples. The first set was directly ovendried, whereas on the second set a hygrothermal treatment released the maturation stress before oven-drying. The analysis of the strains during each step of the procedure reveals that part of the drying shrinkage is due to the release of internal stresses during the desorption process. Finally, a tentative schematic model is proposed taking into account the cumulative contributions to longitudinal drying shrinkage...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{inference}} of relatedness {{between individuals}} in breeding population {{contributes to the}} precision of genetic parameter estimates, effectiveness of inbreeding management {{and the amount of}} genetic progress delivered from breeding programs. Pedigree reconstruction has been proven to be an efficient tool to correct pedigree errors and recover hidden relatedness in open pollinated progeny tests but the method can be limited by the lack of parental genotypes and the high proportion of alien pollen from outside the breeding population. Our study investigates the efficiency of sib-ship reconstruction in an advanced breeding population of Eucalyptus nitens with only partially tracked pedigree. The sib-ship reconstruction allowed the identification of selfs (4 % of the sample) and the exploration of their potential effect on inbreeding depression in the traits studied. We detected signs of inbreeding depression in diameter at breast height and growth strain while no indications were observed in wood density, wood stiffness and <b>tangential</b> air-dry <b>shrinkage.</b> After the application of a corrected sib-ship relationship matrix, additive genetic variance and heritability were observed to increase where signs of inbreeding depression were initially detected. Conversely, the same genetic parameters for traits that appeared to be free of inbreeding depression decreased in size.

Variations in wood equilibrium moisture content, density and dimensions were studied at air temperatures of 22 °C and 27 °C (representing acclimatized homes and summer non-acclimatized homes, respectively) varying from 80 % to 30 % of relative humidity. For indoor uses (22 - 27 °C, 50 - 65 % of relative humidity), the wood equilibrium moisture content ranged 12 - 17 % and these values are recommended for the final commercial drying of cork oak wood. The fibre saturation point averaged 27 %. Total volumetric shrinkage at 22 °C- 27 °C averaged 12 %, the linear shrinkage 8. 1 - 8. 5 % and 3. 6 - 3. 6 %, respectively in tangential and radial directions. Anisotropy averaged 2. 3.

30|$|To {{investigate}} the factors affecting the surface-check variation in boxed-heart square timber of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica), surface checks {{formed by the}} conventional kiln drying were compared for two stem heights of five cultivars with different wood properties. The total length and average length of the surface checks were greater at {{the upper part of}} the stems for all the cultivars. This might be caused by more sapwood at {{the upper part of the}} stem, and large drying stresses between the outer sapwood and the inner heartwood. The cultivars, in which <b>tangential</b> <b>shrinkage</b> was large owing to small microfibril angle, formed longer surface checks and smaller bow.

30|$|The {{difference}} in surface check along the stem {{is likely to}} be influenced by <b>tangential</b> <b>shrinkage</b> too. Our previous study [7] showed that <b>tangential</b> <b>shrinkage</b> was smaller {{at the bottom of the}} stem than at the upper part because of larger MFA. For aya-sugi, although timber 4 exhibited high HWP as timber 1, its total length of surface checks was longer than that of timber 1 (Fig.  2; Table  3). It might be because timber 4 exhibited larger <b>tangential</b> <b>shrinkage</b> than timber 1 (Table  2). On the other hand, the tangential/radial shrinkage ratio was smaller in timber 4 than in timber 1 for most cultivars. This result suggests that the shrinkage difference between tangential and radial direction is the fundamental reason causing surface checks in the boxed-heart timber; however, its effect on the surface-check variation is unclear.|$|E

From a 30 -year-old stand in Sicily 6 trees were selec-ted in order to analyse the natural durability of wood against fungi, according to European Standards, and the main physical and mecha-nical properties from clear specimens, according to ISO Standards. The heartwood resulted classified from “durable ” to “very durable”, while sapwood is “not durable”. The wood is quite dense, taking into account the fast-grown characteristics of the stand, but the volume-tric shrinkage is limited and the ratio between <b>tangential</b> and radial <b>shrinkages</b> is less than 1. 5.

This study {{is part of a}} large investigation into the use of non-destructive methods of assessing wood properties by comparing the results with traditional destructive methods. This component of the study investigates the genetic variation in linear shrinkage of 152 open-pollinated families of Eucalyptus pilularis (Smith).

40|$|The {{reaction}} wood is formed {{in an attempt}} to remain upright tree in response to the action of forces such as winds, irregular crown or slope of the land that tend to incline it. In hardwoods, as in Eucalyptus, this type of wood is called tension wood and occurs in the region of the stem facing the face of force application. Indicative of the presence of this type of wood is the high shrinkage and basic density compared to normal wood. Once the basic density and shrinkage are parameters for determining the quality of the wood, this study aimed to evaluate the variation of basic density and shrinkage of opposite and tension wood along the radius in four species of Eucalyptus sp. Four tree species Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus maculata, Eucalyptus pilularis and Eucalyptus urophylla, with 32 years of age, were taken from an experimental planting of the Federal University of Lavras.

These tests indicated that a very small strain appeared at high volume-averaged moisture contents (greater than the fibre saturation point).

The stems sampled represented the largest diameters and therefore fastest growing stems (mean diameter 39. 4 cm, mean height 20. 5 m). Sapwood comprised 80 % of the stem at ground level, increasing to 99 % at 10 m above ground. Basic density decreased with increasing stem height from ground level to 10 m (469 kg/m 3 to 435 kg/m 3).

Saturated urea solution, one percent sodium hydroxide, four percent acetic acid, water, urea formaldehyde resin (UF), and polyvinyl acetate glue (PVA) were used. In Chapter 4, the experiment of chemical soaking pre-treatments showed that soaking in sodium hydroxide solution for up to 15 days caused almost double increase of boards' drying rate. However, this technique and soaking in acetic acid solution caused more collapse and checks. In Chapter 5 and 6, the surface coating experiment confirmed that coating with UF resin did not significantly improve the drying properties of the boards. In contrast, PVA coating prevented surface checking and considerably reduced edge checking and collapse. The check value of these P boards was only a quarter the check value of control boards.
