2500|$|To {{those who}} are not acquainted with the botanical {{construction}} of plants it may be well to explain that plants possess generative organs, which correspond to those of the male and female in the animal kingdom. In the animal kingdom, progeny is derived from the mating of different animals of the same breed; in the vegetable kingdom the rule is that the seed is produced through the agency of the generative organs growing together on the same plant. Prior to the commencement of the work initiated by us and carried on during the past 20 years, which has led to the production of our New and Improved Breeds of agricultural plants, it was a recognised belief that many farm plants in the production of their seed were more or less cross-fertilised. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> experiments however have proved that such was not the case but that constant in-and-in breeding was the rule.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his third}} year, he joined John Stevens Henslow's natural history course and was {{introduced}} to the Cambridge version of natural theology, part of the liberal Christianity of colleagues such as Adam Sedgwick, George Peacock and William Whewell who all had strong views about science as the search for the laws of nature. Study of nature was study of the work of the Lord, and scientists who were ordained clerics of the Church of England, such as themselves, could follow their enquiries without theological difficulties. Sedgwick gave a talk to the Geological Society of London in 1831 which declared that [...] "No opinion can be heretical, but that which is not true.... Conflicting falsehoods we can comprehend; but truths can never war against each other. I affirm, therefore, that we have nothing to fear from <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> enquiries, provided they be followed in the laborious but secure road of honest induction. In this way we may rest assured that we shall never arrive at conclusions opposed to any truth, either physical or moral, from whatever source that truth may be derived." [...] For these men, science could not be out of harmony with religion, and in a sense it was religion.|$|E

In this paper, we examine the effect, if any, that GM-Free messages have on product selection by the consumer.

On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> memory recall experiment shows that the consumer with relevant biotech knowledge uses the product information on back labels. Thus, firms can positively influence the product selection of biotech un-savvy consumers by placing GM-Free message on front labels. ...|$|R

6000|$|As regards archaeology, {{the second}} Expedition visited, described, and {{surveyed}} eighteen ruins {{of cities and}} towns, some of considerable extent, in North Midian, besides seeing or hearing of some twenty large Mashghal, apparently the ateliers of vagrant Gypsy-like gangs.

Many others are reported to exist in the central or inland region; and fifteen were added by the South Country, including the classical temple or shrine, found upon the bank of the Wady Hamz before mentioned. The most interesting sites were recommended to M. Lacaze, whose portfolio was soon filled with about two hundred illustrations, in oil and water-colours, pencil croquis and [...] "sun-pictures."
