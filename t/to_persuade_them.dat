5|$|Ai {{initially}} {{refuses to}} see a connection between his sexuality and his mode of consciousness, preventing him from truly understanding the Gethenians; thus he is unable <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> {{of the importance of}} his mission. Ai's failure to comprehend shifgrethor and to trust Estraven's motives leads him to misunderstand much of the advice that Estraven gives him. As Ai's relationship to Estraven changes, their communication also changes; they are both more willing to acknowledge mistakes, and make fewer assertions. Eventually, the two are able to converse directly with mindspeech, but only after Ai is able to understand Estraven's motivations, and no longer requires direct communication.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} campaign, Isbul and Malamir {{captured}} the Thracian fortresses of Probaton (near Adrianople, modern Edirne) and Bourdizon (modern Babaeski). After conquering these two fortresses, the Bulgarian troops reached Philippopolis (now Plovdiv). As the defence forces of the city had fled, Isbul and Malamir entered negotiations with the population in order <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> to cede the fortress. Pavlov is {{of the opinion that}} the war ended with a continuation of the peace of 815. He believes that Byzantine Emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842) was forced to make concessions to Bulgaria, which may have included the incorporation of Philippopolis and its close surroundings into the Bulgarian Empire.|$|E

5|$|Boyd had {{her first}} {{encounter}} with LSD in early 1965 when the couple's dentist, John Riley, secretly laced her coffee with the drug during a dinner party at his home. As she {{was getting ready to}} leave with Harrison and John and Cynthia Lennon, Riley told them that he had spiked their drinks and tried <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> to stay. Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to break a store window, but Harrison pulled her away. Later, when Boyd and her group were in a lift on their way up to the Ad Lib club, they mistakenly believed it was on fire.|$|E
5|$|Butlin {{proposed}} a new holiday camp at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex in 1936. Both {{the council and}} the local association of hotels were against the idea, as were the boarding house keepers. <b>To</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them,</b> Butlin took {{the members of the}} council to Skegness to see how the people there appreciated their holiday camp. The councillors were soon won over when they learnt that the local traders in Skegness had seen an initial dip in custom after its construction followed by a rise as campers had visited the town and seasonal workers had come to spend their pay. Once approved by the council, construction began and the camp opened in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the PTC {{launched}} a campaign against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), complaining that their SmackDown! program contained levels of sexuality and violence unbecoming prime time programming. In the campaign, Bozell said that four children {{had been killed by}} peers emulating professional wrestling moves learned from the program. With these allegations, Bozell and various PTC members began meeting with representatives of the advertising departments of various companies that advertised on SmackDown! <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> to withdraw sponsorship. The PTC also suggested that between 30 and 40 advertisers had pulled their commercials from WWF programming, an assertion that was not true.|$|E

5|$|JC's Girls (short for Jesus Christ's Girls, {{also called}} the JC's Girls Girls Girls Ministry) is an Evangelical Christian women's {{organization}} in the United States whose members evangelize to female workers in the sex industry. The organization supports women wishing to leave the industry, but does not try <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> to do so. The group does not focus upon conversion but rather on communicating its message that Christians exist who are not judging female sex workers {{and are willing to}} accept them. The organization also helps both women and men seeking to overcome pornography addiction.|$|E
5|$|Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{said that}} {{from then on}} the British did {{everything}} they could to break up the Umma party and to thwart him personally. They tried without success to get tribal chiefs and village leaders to leave the Umma. He claimed that it was the Umma that forced the British to establish a committee to start drafting a constitution for an independent Sudan in 1951, a constitution that was endorsed in April 1952. However, broader considerations were anyway leading the British towards support for an independent Sudan despite attempts by the United States <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> to give Egypt a role.|$|E
5|$|Although Gebhard had {{gathered}} some troops around him, {{he hoped to}} recruit support from the Lutheran princes. Unfortunately for him, he had converted to another branch of the Reformed faith; such cautious Lutheran princes as Augustus I, Elector of Saxony, balked at extending their military support to Calvinists and the Elector Palatine was unable <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> to join the cause. Gebhard had three primary supporters. His brother, Karl, had married Eleonore, Countess of Hohenzollern (1551–after 1598), and Gebhard could hope that this family alliance with the power-hungry Hohenzollerns would help his cause. Another long-time ally and supporter Adolf, Count von Neuenahr, was a successful and cunning military commander whose army secured {{the northern part of}} the territory. Finally, John Casimir (1543–1592), the brother of the Elector Palatine, had expressed his support, and made a great show of force in the southern part of the Electorate.|$|E

5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most effective}} and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the astrologer and {{psychologist}} Michel Gauquelin {{stated that}} {{though he had}} failed to find evidence that supported indicators like zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some planets and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the Mars effect. A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> to add or delete names from their study.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the sermons of {{the radical}} cleric John Ball, and led by Wat Tyler, a {{contingent}} of Kentish rebels advanced on London. They were met at Blackheath by representatives of the royal government, who unsuccessfully attempted <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> to return home. King Richard II, then aged 14, retreated {{to the safety of}} the Tower of London, but most of the royal forces were abroad or in northern England. On 13 June, the rebels entered London and, joined by many local townsfolk, attacked the gaols, destroyed the Savoy Palace, set fire to law books and buildings in the Temple, and killed anyone associated with the royal government. The following day, Richard met the rebels at Mile End and acceded to most of their demands, including the abolition of serfdom. Meanwhile, rebels entered the Tower of London, killing the Lord Chancellor and the Lord High Treasurer, whom they found inside.|$|E

5|$|The Bedouin iqtaʿat {{were small}} {{compared}} {{to those of the}} mamluk (manumitted slave soldier) emirs, though a number of sultans granted particularly generous iqtaʿat to the amir al-ʿarab. The distribution of iqtaʿat to the tribes was done, at least in part, <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> not plunder the unfortified towns and villages of the countryside as they were normally wont to do, and to induce them to cooperate with the state. The frequent rebellion of the tribes also motivated the Mamluks to incorporate them into the iqtaʿ system. The iqtaʿ of the amir al-ʿarab would often be confiscated in cases of rebellion against the sultan. In general, Salamiyah and Palmyra consistently served as iqtaʿat of the amir al-ʿarab, continuing into the early Ottoman era, when the iqtaʿ was supplanted by the timar. Besides Salamiyah and Palmyra, the Ottomans granted the amir al-ʿarab timar grants in the Hawran plain south of Damascus.|$|E
5|$|Asad was apprised {{of this on}} {{the evening}} of 7 December, when {{messages}} arrived at Balkh that the Turgesh and their allies, some 30,000 strong, were at Jazza. Asad ordered signal fires to be lit and mobilized his Syrian troops, although he had to pay each man twenty dirhams <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> to fight. The Umayyad governor initially refused to call upon the help of the local Khurasani Arabs, indicating the level of mistrust existing by now between the latter and the representatives of the Umayyad regime; in the end, however, he relented, and gathered a force of 7,000 men. In the meantime, Suluk attacked Khulm, but after being repelled marched on to Peroz Nakhsher/Peroz Bakhshin. Bypassing Balkh, the Turgesh seized the capital of Juzjan, and then dispersed and sent out mounted raiding parties in all directions, with some reaching as far as Marw al-Rudh. This was possibly done in search of forage, since such a large army could not otherwise be sustained during the winter. Against the expectations of Ibn Surayj, however, the ruler of Juzjan elected to side with Asad, who, informed of these events by the governor of Khulm, set out to engage the Turgesh.|$|E
5|$|Fearing a {{surrender}} to the Germans, Marcel-Henri Jaspar, a junior minister, left France for London where, together with Camille Huysmans, he appeared to form a rebel government or Belgian National Committee (Comité national belge) condemned by the official government. De Vleeschauwer arrived in London, where he was joined by Camille Gutt, the Minister of Finances, {{to deal with the}} threat. Pierlot remained in France. De Vleeschauwer travelled to neutral Spain where, at Le Perthus on the French-Spanish border, he met with Pierlot and Paul-Henri Spaak, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to attempt <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> to join him in London. Pierlot refused. Continued negotiations with the new Vichy government of Philippe Pétain proved fruitless. In August 1940, under pressure from the Germans, the French broke off diplomatic relations with the Belgian government and ordered it to disband. On 22 August, Pierlot and Spaak received the permission of the government to leave for London {{while the rest of the}} government remained in France.|$|E

5|$|In the East, Diocletian {{engaged in}} {{diplomacy}} with desert tribes {{in the regions}} between Rome and Persia. He might have been attempting <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> to ally themselves with Rome, thus reviving the old, Rome-friendly, Palmyrene sphere of influence, or simply attempting to reduce the frequency of their incursions. No details survive for these events. Some of the princes of these states were Persian client kings, a disturbing fact in light of increasing tensions with the Sassanids. In the West, Maximian lost the fleet built in 288 and 289, probably {{in the early spring}} of 290. The panegyrist who refers to the loss suggests that its cause was a storm, but this might simply have been an attempt to conceal an embarrassing military defeat. Diocletian broke off his tour of the Eastern provinces soon thereafter. He returned with haste to the West, reaching Emesa by 10 May 290, and Sirmium on the Danube by 1 July 290.|$|E
5|$|On Fernando Po itself, Richard Lippett, who had {{remained}} on the island, was taken in for questioning by the Spanish authorities on 17 January 1942.

He was released from custody on 27 January 1942, but was refused permission to leave the island. He finally left secretly by canoe, arriving in British territory on 1 March 1942. In the aftermath of the operation, Maid Honor was left in Lagos and eventually sold to the Sierra Leone government as a converted trawler. Duchess d'Aosta was sailed to Greenock and then managed by Canadian Pacific as the Empire Yukon for the Ministry of War Transport.

5|$|Out of {{a belief}} that many women in the sex {{industry}} have been spiritually abused by Christians trying to frighten {{them out of the}} sex industry with warnings of damnation, JC's Girls focuses on telling these women that God loves them. JC's Girls volunteers tell the women about the gospel but do not try <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>them</b> to leave the sex industry; the organization recognizes that is often not financially viable for women in the sex industry to immediately sacrifice their employment. JC's Girls connects female sex workers with churches the organization believes to be non-judgmental, hoping that the women will experience the love of Christ through these churches and that they will thereby eventually have the support and strength they need to leave the industry. Prior to referring a woman to a church, JC's Girls puts the church through a formal approval process to ensure that the church will not be judgmental. If women express a desire to leave the sex industry, JC's Girls attempts to support them in doing so.|$|E
