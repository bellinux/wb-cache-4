5|$|Al Lowe, {{a former}} high school <b>teacher,</b> <b>had</b> carved a niche for himself at Sierra with his work on such Disney-licensed {{edutainment}} titles as Donald Duck's Playground, Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood, and The Black Cauldron, which he wrote, designed and programmed. In 1982, Sierra had released a text-only game on the Apple II titled Softporn Adventure (it was the only text adventure that was released by a company which had established its name on providing a graphical alternative to such games). In 1986, after Sierra lost a Disney license, Al Lowe suggested that Sierra remake Softporn Adventure with the improved tools now at their disposal, and Ken Williams agreed.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the <b>teacher</b> <b>had</b> given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the group could cross the brook, had meant that the school could not {{be held responsible for}} the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers to meet up with the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the views of pre-service classroom teachers about nature of technology, the relationship between technology and science, the relationship between technology and society, and social construction of technology. Pre-service classroom <b>teachers</b> <b>have</b> been joined in this research. In order to determine the pre-service teachers’ views about the nature of technology ″Views on Science-Technology-Society (VOSTS) which was designed by Aikenhead, Fleming and Ryan (1989) instrument was used.

5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the <b>teacher</b> <b>had</b> them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E

30|$|Recent {{studies of}} Estonian VET <b>teachers</b> <b>have</b> yielded similar results and shown similar tendencies. They {{indicate}} {{the relevance of}} the changes in areas such as networking and cooperation between local and international partners, enterprises and other schools. Their methods in the classroom have changed because of new technology and the implementation of e-learning (Loogma 2010). Changes in teaching, emerging from new target groups and the growing diversity of student populations (e.g. increasing numbers of students with special needs), have also brought new roles as shown in other studies (Ümarik and Rekkor 2013; Loogma 2010). <b>Teachers</b> <b>have</b> to support these students in the learning process in ways that differ from the support they offer other students in order to make sure the students stay in school (Espenberg et al. 2012). VET <b>teachers</b> <b>have</b> had different experiences and attitudes regarding the national curriculum development and implementation process in their work. Therefore, some <b>teachers</b> <b>have</b> adopted the changes more easily than others (Rekkor et al. 2013).

As such, he acquired a reputation among his fellow students as a minor drug dealer. In addition, he began regularly abusing alcohol. He also engaged in acts of animal torture on at least three occasions while a student at the Kansas City Art Institute; during two of these instances, he tortured a duck and a chicken in the presence of his peers, and in the third instance, he experimented with sedatives and tranquilizers on a dog.|$|E

She subsequently obtained a master's of arts degree in history from Ohio State University in 1937. It was a time when women of African American ancestry were unlikely to continue higher education and pursue degrees.
