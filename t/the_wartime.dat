5|$|Although many {{publications}} have repeated Doyle's unsupported {{assertion that}} <b>the</b> <b>wartime</b> photograph inspired Miller's poster, Westinghouse historian Charles A. Ruch, a Pittsburgh resident {{who had been}} friends with J. Howard Miller, said that Miller {{was not in the}} habit of working from photographs, but rather live models. Penny Coleman, the author of Rosie the Riveter: Women working on the home front in World War II, said that she and Ruch could not determine whether <b>the</b> <b>wartime</b> photo had appeared in any of the periodicals that Miller would have seen.|$|E

Nevertheless, many gifts went unused {{and he did not}} live extravagantly.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{the state}} created <b>the</b> <b>wartime</b> shrine board, which {{expanded}} control over state shrines and expanded the state's role. Up to that point, individual priests had been {{limited in their}} political roles, delegated to certain rituals and shrine upkeep, and rarely encouraged Emperor worship, or other aspects of state ideology, independently. No shrine priest, or member of <b>the</b> <b>Wartime</b> Shrine board, had previously sought public office, which some scholars, such as Sakamoto, suggest is evidence of the state's use of Shinto to its own ends, rather than the Shinto priest's attempt to achieve political power.|$|E

5|$|The frontrunner for {{the post}} was <b>the</b> <b>wartime</b> {{commander}} of the Manhattan District, Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols. Indeed, Nichols was the War Department's only nominee. However, the AEC commissioners had different ideas. Nichols was seen as too closely identified with <b>the</b> <b>wartime</b> Manhattan Project; he had opinions at variance with the commissioners on whether the Director of Military Applications was a staff or a line position; {{and he had a}} strong disagreement with the commissioners over the vexing issue of which agency should hold custody of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Accordingly, the AEC commissioners decided to find another candidate.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wartime</b> economy {{relied heavily}} upon the {{large-scale}} employment of forced labourers. Germany imported and enslaved some 12 million people from 20 European countries {{to work in}} factories and on farms (approximately 75 percent were Eastern European). Many were casualties of Allied bombing, as they received poor air raid protection and poor living conditions led to high rates of sickness, injury and death, as well as sabotage and criminal activity. <b>The</b> <b>wartime</b> economy also relied upon large-scale robbery, initially through the state seizing the property of Jewish citizens and later by also plundering the resources of occupied territories.|$|E
5|$|Though the government's ideological {{interest}} in Shinto is well-known, there is {{debate over how}} much control the government had over local shrines, and for how long. Shrine finances were not purely state-supported. Shinto priests, even when state-supported, had tended to avoid preaching on ideological matters until the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>Wartime</b> Shrine board in 1940.|$|E

5|$|Women {{played an}} {{increasingly}} large role and by 1944 over {{a half million}} served as auxiliaries in the German armed forces, especially in anti-aircraft units of the Luftwaffe; a half million worked in civil aerial defence; and 400,000 were volunteer nurses. They also replaced men in <b>the</b> <b>wartime</b> economy, especially on farms and in small family-owned shops.|$|E
5|$|After the war most Commando {{units were}} disbanded, {{leaving only the}} Royal Marines 3 Commando Brigade. The modern Royal Marine Commandos, Parachute Regiment, Special Air Service and Special Boat Service trace their origins to the Commandos.

5|$|Although Gillis was not {{exclusively}} used on Post covers, the Willie Gillis series of covers was {{a hallmark of}} Rockwell's wartime work.

Rockwell's wartime art, including Willie Gillis, the Four Freedoms and Rosie the Riveter, contributed to the success of <b>the</b> <b>wartime</b> bond sales efforts.|$|E
5|$|Although Hall's author's note disclaims any {{real-world}} {{basis for}} the ambulance unit that Stephen joins, she drew heavily on <b>the</b> <b>wartime</b> experiences of her friend Toupie Lowther, co-commander of the only women's unit {{to serve on the}} front in France. Lowther, like Stephen, came from an aristocratic family, adopted a masculine style of dress, and was an accomplished fencer, tennis player, motorist and jujitsu enthusiast. In later years she said the character of Stephen was based on her, which may have been partly true.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} there were about forty Jesuit colleges (secondary schools) {{scattered}} throughout the Commonwealth. They were educating mostly szlachta, burgher sons to a lesser degree. Jan Zamoyski, Chancellor of the Crown, who built the town of Zamość, established an academy there in 1594; it had functioned as a gymnasium only after Zamoyski's death. The first two Vasa kings were well known for patronizing both the arts and sciences. After that the Commonwealth's science experienced general decline, which paralleled <b>the</b> <b>wartime</b> decline of the burgher class.|$|E

In an attempt to obtain them, he met with Fermi, von Halban and George Placzek in New York in April 1942. He was unable to secure the supplies he wanted, but Fermi showed an unexpected keen interest in the Wells Surveys work.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker was {{appointed}} to the House Committee on the Defence of Canada Regulations, an all-party committee which examined <b>the</b> <b>wartime</b> rules which allowed arrest and detention without trial. On June 13, 1940, Diefenbaker made his maiden speech as an MP, supporting the regulations, and emphatically stating that most Canadians of German descent were loyal. When the Mackenzie King government sought to force Canadians of Japanese descent from the Pacific Coast, Diefenbaker fought against the government's actions. However, his efforts were unsuccessful, and the forced relocation and internment of many Japanese-Canadians proceeded.|$|E
5|$|Dunne's {{bartender}} came to wider {{attention with}} <b>the</b> <b>wartime</b> columns, and the Dooley pieces were soon in newspapers nationwide.

Beginning around 1905, Dunne had increasing trouble finding time and inspiration for new columns, and they ended in 1915, except for a brief resurrection in the mid-1920s. Even in Dunne's own time (he died in 1936), his work was becoming obscure {{due in part to}} his use of dialect, and the unusual spellings that it used have proved a lasting barrier for potential readers.|$|E
