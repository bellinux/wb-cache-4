25|$|There {{were many}} herds and flocks. The flocks were {{committed}} to a shepherd, who gave receipt for them and took them out to pasture. The Code fixed his wage. He was responsible for all care, must restore ox for ox, sheep for sheep and must breed them satisfactorily. Any dishonest use of the flock had to be repaid tenfold, but loss due to disease or wild beasts fell upon the owner. The shepherd made good all loss due to his own neglect. If he let the flock feed on a field of crops, he had to pay damages fourfold; if he turned them into standing crops when <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been folded, he paid twelvefold.|$|E
25|$|Philo {{wrote that}} God {{instructed}} the Israelites to offer unleavened bread and bitter herbs {{together with the}} Passover sacrifice because unleavened bread signified great haste and speed, while bitter herbs signified the life of bitterness and struggle that the Israelites endured as slaves. Philo also taught that the deeper meaning was that leavened and fermented foods rose, while unleavened foods remained low, and each of these states symbolized types of the soul. Leavening symbolized the haughty soul swollen with arrogance, while the unleavened symbolized the unchangeable and prudent soul choosing the middle way rather than extremes. The bitter herbs manifested a psychic migration from passion to impassivity and from wickedness to virtue. For, Philo taught, those who naturally and genuinely repented became bitter toward their former way of life, lamenting {{the time that they}} had given over to the seductive and deceitful mistress of desire, being deceived by desire when <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> renewed themselves and advanced in the contemplation of wisdom toward the goal of a happy and immortal life. And so, those who desired repentance ate the unleavened bread with bitter herbs; they first ate bitterness over their old and unendurable life, and then ate the opposite of boastful arrogance in meditation on humility. For, Philo concluded, the memory of former sins caused fear, and by restraining sin through recollection, brought profit to the mind.|$|E
25|$|Over the 20th century, {{reform efforts}} focused on three main issues. The first {{concerned}} setting a fair system of priority among claims of different creditors. This primarily centred upon {{the ability of}} powerful contractual creditors, particularly banks, to agree to take a security interest over a company's property, leaving unsecured creditors without any remaining assets to satisfy their claims. Immediately after Salomon's case and the controversy created {{over the use of}} floating charges, the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897 mandated that preferential creditors (employees, liquidator expenses and taxes at the time) also had priority over the holder of a floating charge (now IA 1986 section 175). In the Enterprise Act 2002 a further major change was to create a ring-fenced fund for all unsecured creditors out of around 20 per cent of the assets subject to a floating charge. At the same time, the priority for taxpayers' claims was abolished. Since then, debate for further reform has shifted to whether the floating charge should be abolished altogether and whether a ring-fenced fund should be taken from fixed security interests. The second major area for reform was to facilitate the rescue of businesses that could still be viable. Following the Cork Report in 1982, the Insolvency Act 1986 created the administration procedure, requiring (on paper) that the managers of insolvent businesses would attempt rescue the company, and would act in all creditors' interests. After the Enterprise Act 2002 this almost wholly replaced the receivership rules by which secured creditors, with a floating charge over all assets, could run an insolvent company without regard to the claims of unsecured creditors. The third area of reform concerned accountability for people who worsened or benefited from insolvencies. As recommended by the Cork Report, the Company Directors' Disqualification Act 1986 meant directors who breached company law duties, or committed fraud could be prevented from working as directors for up to 15 years. The Insolvency Act 1986 section 214 created liability for wrongful trading. If directors failed to start the insolvency procedures when <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> known insolvency was inevitable, they would {{have to pay for the}} additional debts run up through prolonged trading. Furthermore, the provisions on fraudulent conveyances were extended, so that any transaction at an undervalue or other preference (without any bad intent) could be avoided, and unwound by an insolvent company.|$|E

In practice, cases were not brought against the King for breach of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter, but it was possible to bring a case against the King's officers, such as his sheriffs, using the argument that the King's officers were acting contrary to liberties granted by the King in the charters.|$|E
500|$|Richard Owen had {{expertise}} in comparative anatomy and his professional judgements revealed {{a succession of}} similar species in the same locality, giving Darwin insights which he would later recall as being central to his new views. Owen met Darwin on 29 October 1836 and quickly took {{on the task of}} describing these new fossils. At that time the only fully described fossil mammals from South America were three species of Mastodon and the gigantic Megatherium. On 9 November Darwin wrote to his sister that [...] "Some of them are turning out great treasures." [...] The near complete skeleton from Punta Alta was apparently very closely allied to anteaters, but of the extraordinary size of a small horse. The rhinoceros sized head bought for two shillings near Mercedes was not a megatherium, but [...] "as far as they can guess, must have been a gnawing animal. Conceive a Rat or a Hare of such a size— What famous Cats <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had in those days!" [...] Over the following years Owen published descriptions of the most important fossils, naming several as new species.|$|E

Darwin's reputation was being made by the giant mammal fossils. Owen's first surprising revelation was that a hippopotamus sized fossil skull 2feet4inches (710mm) long which Darwin had bought for about two shillings near Mercedes while on a [...] "galloping" [...] trip 120miles (190km) from Montevideo was of an extinct rodent-like creature resembling a giant capybara, which Owen named Toxodon. Darwin wrote to his sister Caroline that [...] " [...] are turning out great treasures" [...] and of the Toxodon, [...] "There is another head, {{as large as a}} Rhinoceros which as far as they can guess, must have been a gnawing animal.

Willis said of the strikebreakers: [...] "God damn them, <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> known better than to come down here; but now that they're here, let them take what's coming to them." [...] Gunfire continued throughout the night, and the mob began destroying equipment to prevent the mine from reopening.

2500|$|This {{principle}} {{is open to}} a series of qualifications. Most significantly, statute may require directly or indirectly that the company not be treated as a separate entity. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, section 214 stipulates that company directors must contribute to payment of company debts in winding up if they kept the business running up more debt when <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> known there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvency. A number of other cases demonstrate that in construing the meaning of a statute unrelated to company law, the purpose of the legislation should be fulfilled regardless of the existence of a corporate form. For example, in Daimler Co Ltd v Continental Tyre and Rubber Co (Great Britain) Ltd, the Trading with the Enemy Act 1914 said that trading with any person of [...] "enemy character" [...] would be an offence. So even though the Continental Tyre Co Ltd was a [...] "legal person" [...] incorporated in the UK (and therefore British) its directors and shareholders were German (and therefore enemies, while the First World War was being fought).|$|E

40|$|Whether {{scientists}} {{test their}} hypotheses as <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>has</b> interested both cognitive psychologists and philosophers of science. Classic analyses of hypothesis testing assume {{that people should}} pick the test with the largest probability of falsifying their current hypothesis, while experiments have shown that people tend to select tests consistent with that hypothesis. Using two different normative standards, we prove that seeking evidence predicted by your current hypothesis is optimal when the hypotheses in question are deterministic and other reasonable assumptions hold. We test this account with two experiments using a sequential prediction task, in which people guess the next number in a sequence. Experiment 1 shows that people’s predictions can be captured by a simple Bayesian model. Experiment 2 manipulates people’s beliefs about the probabilities of different hypotheses, and shows that they confirm whichever hypothesis they are led to believe is most likely...|$|R
