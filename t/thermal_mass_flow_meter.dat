40|$|In the {{capillary}} type <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> {{the sensor}} {{is a small}} diameter stainless steel or constantan capillary, heated by an electric current. The heat is supplied either at the central point or over the whole length of the tube. In the absence of gas flow, the temperature profile is symmetric about the mid point. Gas flow through the capillary tube cools the entry section while heating the exit. This introduces an asymmetry in the temperature profile, which {{is a measure of}} the fluid flow rate. The asymmetry is measured in terms of difference of temperature between two suitably chosen points on the capillary tube, which are equidistant from the mid point on opposite sides. This temperature difference is a function of the direction and rate of mass flow of the fluid. The focus of this dissertation is to experimentally characterize thermal mass flow meters so as to properly understand their functioning, and to create an adequate knowledge base on the subject. It will significantly facilitate further understanding and development of these devices. Performance a capillary type <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> has also been studied in terms of the different operating parameters...|$|E
30|$|Materials {{and methods}} Three OCC (Simply go ®, Devilbiss®, EverFlow®) were {{analyzed}} in continuous mode (O 2 flow rate: 2  l/min) in an hypobaric chamber (HC) (Aerospace Medicine Centre, Queen Astrid Military Hospital, Brussels). During the experimentation, the average {{temperature of the}} HC was maintained at 24  °C and relative humidity at 58  %. Seven altitude levels (from 0 to 18, 000 Feet) were successively achieved. FiO 2 was measured in continuous by an analog iWorx station/digital IWx/ 214 coupled to an analyzer of CO 2 /O 2 iWorx GA 200. O 2 flow rate was analyzed by a <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> Vogtlyn™ Red Y.

30|$|Materials {{and methods}} The study was {{conducted}} on bench with NC connected to a two compartment adult lung model (Dual Test Lung®) (DTL) controlled by a Maquet Servo I® ventilator. One oxygen flow rate (OFR) (5  L/min) and 3  min ventilation (MV: 6 / 9 / 12  L/min) with two Ti/Ttot (0.33 and 0.25) were investigated. All settings of MV were generated by modifying Rf (10 – 40 CPM) and Vt (0.3 and 0.6 L). Inspiratory flows rate (IFR) obtained with settings range from 18 to 48  L/min. OFR was analyzed by a <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> Vogtlyn™ Red Y. FDO 2 and MV measurements were made using a iWorx® acquisition system (GA 207 gas analyzer) and LabScribe II® software.

5000|$|The {{operation}} of <b>thermal</b> dispersion <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> {{is attributed to}} L.V. King who, in 1914, published his famous King's Law revealing how a heated wire immersed in a fluid <b>flow</b> measures the <b>mass</b> velocity {{at a point in}} the flow. King called his instrument a [...] "hot-wire anemometer". However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s and 1970s that industrial-grade <b>thermal</b> dispersion <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> finally emerged.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary reason}} <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are popular in {{industrial}} applications {{is the way}} they are designed and built. They feature no moving parts, nearly unobstructed straight through flow path, require no temperature or pressure corrections and retain accuracy over a wide range of flow rates. Straight pipe runs can be reduced by using dual-plate flow conditioning elements and installation is very simple with minimal pipe intrusions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> {{generally}} use {{combinations of}} heated elements and temperature sensors {{to measure the}} difference between static and flowing heat transfer to a fluid and infer its flow with {{a knowledge of the}} fluid's specific heat and density. The fluid temperature is also measured and compensated for. If the density and specific heat characteristics of the fluid are constant, the meter can provide a direct <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> readout, and does not need any additional pressure temperature compensation over their specified range.|$|R
30|$|Materials {{and methods}} On a bench study, a two-compartment model of adult lung (Dual Test Lung DTL, Michigan Instrument) was {{connected}} to a Servo i® Ventilator. The ventilator was set in volume-controlled mode. Three minute ventilation (MV: 6 / 9 / 12  l/min at Ti/Ttot =  0.33) and two oxygen flow rate (OFR: 2 and 4  l/min) were analyzed. OFR was analyzed with a <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> Vogtlyn™ Red Y. The compliance of the artificial lung was set to 70  ml/cmH 2 O and the resistance set to 5  cmH 2 O/l s− 1. The FDO 2 and MV measurements were made using an iWorx® acquisition system (GA 207 gas analyzer and analog/digital IX/ 228  s) and LabScribe II® software. To simulate the anatomic dead space of the nasopharynx (± 50  ml for an adult) {{we have used a}} 15  cm length corrugated tubing ISO 22  mm (CT 22) at the level of inflow of DTL. NC was introduced at the entry of the CT 22 while the NOC was introduced totally into the CT 22. Statistical: ANOVA on ranks followed by Student–Newman–Keuls.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{differences}} between traditional and new technology gas meters, and focuses specifically on the calibration procedure and uncertainty evaluation of CTTMFs (Capillary Type <b>Thermal</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Meter).</b> In particular, measurements perfor med on a sample set of commercial CTTMFs for natural gas in domestic/residential (G 4) applications allowed to evaluate the modifications to calibration procedures required by the new generation, digital, gas flow meters. Indeed, traditionally natural gas is metered by means of volumetric measurement techniques, while the modern, static gas flow meters (thermal and ultrasonic ones) are based on electronic flow sensors. This implies that the gas volume through the meter is measured by sampling the flow rate at selected time points and integrating the flow rate in time. The measurement time becomes therefore an important parameter, thus requiring a thorough rethinking of the calibration procedure. In order to analyse {{the effects of the}} various parameters, a ser ies of ad-hoc calibrations were performed. Specifically, one set of calibrations was performed with constant totalized volume, while the other required a constant measurement time. In order to highlight the novelties {{that will have to be}} implemented in ordinary calibration procedures to get the best of the new technologies, the two procedures as performed on a sample set CTTMFs will be compared; the theoretical (generic) evaluation of the associated uncertainty will also be presented. Measurements were carried out at the test facility of INRIM, the Italian National Metrology Institute...|$|E
40|$|A {{selective}} {{combination of}} the principles of a <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> and constant temperature anemometry was used to develop a solid mass flow meter that improves significantly on the flow meter developed by De Vos et al (2010). The flow meter has a measurement plate that is kept at a constant temperature. Due to conductive heat transfer between the entrained solids and the measurement plate, additional power is needed to maintain the plate at this setpoint temperature value. This additional power was correlated against the average solids flow rate. The calibration curve shows a linear relationship between the power measurement and the entrainment flux for entrainment fluxes between 3. 4 x 10 - 4 kg/(m 2. s) and 7. 5 x 10 - 3 kg/(m 2. s). Deviation from a linear response at lower entrainment fluxes may be caused by a longer residence time of fine particles on the measurement plate due to lower shear forces. At higher entrainment fluxes the power measurements were unreliable due to poor temperature control. The turndown ratio of the linear section of the calibration curve is approximately 3 times that of the linear part of the calibration curve of the flow meter developed by De Vos et al (2010). Even further improvement is possible with better temperature control. In a case study to test the applicability of the flow meter to measure changes in entrainment rate associated with hydrodynamic properties other than a change in gas superficial velocity, small amounts of ethanol were dosed to the inlet air. The continuously measured entrainment rate increased at lower ethanol dosing rates but decreased as the dosing rate of ethanol was increased. The increase in entrainment rate may be explained by a reduction in static electricity in the bed, while the decrease at higher dosing rates may be as a result of increased powder cohesivity.

50|$|Both types measure fluid <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate {{by means}} of the heat convected from a heated surface to the flowing fluid. In the case of the thermal dispersion, or immersible, type of <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> the heat is {{transferred}} to the boundary layer of the fluid flowing over the heated surface. In the case of the capillary-tube type, the heat is transferred to the bulk of the fluid flowing through a small heated capillary tube. The principles of operation of the two types are both thermal in nature, but are so substantially different that two separate standards are required. Additionally, their applications are much different. Thermal dispersion <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are commonly used for general industrial gas flow applications in pipes and ducts, whereas capillary types are primarily used for smaller flows of clean gases or liquids in tubes. This type is most widely used for <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> in industry. Nevertheless, the capillary type is not the subject of this discussion.|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} 20 years, the <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> {{have been widely}} used in several {{industries}} such as the petroleum refining industry, waste water processing and steeling making industry. I will call it “TMF” {{in the rest of the}} article. The TMF’ low-flow sensitivity and fast response have made them the first choice for many critical gas flow application. However, there are still some inadequacies in the TMF. Such as interruption among the wires, high cost of the installation and influenced by temperature. Some of the problem comes from its way of the connection [...] - four-wire connection. Two-wire connection can resolve some of these problems. In this thesis, the author presents a new type of two-wire installation and use of TMF which can be realized low production cost. The author found a new measurement method, which is detecting the functional relationship between working current of a traditional TMF and the flow. The author also designs a measurement converter needed for adequate signal processing so that flow value measurement values can be shown in computers...|$|R
40|$|This degree {{project has}} been {{conducted}} to study <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> and develop firmware for EC Instrument’s Reciflow. Flow rate is the volume of a fluid or mass of a substance which passes through a surface per time unit. Conversion can be made between volumetric and <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate if the gas density is known. A market survey showed that Coriolis and <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> and positive displacement (volumetric) <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> as the Reciflow, {{are the most common}} kinds. The Reciflow consist of a system-on-board and a displacement meter with an optical encoder. The displacement meter is a cylinder with a piston within and valves at the ends. The firmware controls the valves so that the piston can reciprocate. The components of the Reciflow affects the accuracy and it is estimated to ± 0; 025 % for non-normalized and ± 0; 2 %for normalized flow. It is measured under normal conditions to be ± 0; 2 %normalized, relative to a reference. Further experiments must be performed to verify the accuracy and also the precision. The actual measurement of flow rate and volume is made with the encoder: as a difference in time between signal edges and the total number of edges accounted for. Data with random noise is filtered with moving average filters and heuristic methods is used to handle static noise. Serial communication has been implemented for on- and off-board uses.

Data was taken throughout the parabolic trajectory where the g-level varied from 0. 01 to 1. 8 times normal gravity. Each meter was calibrated in normal gravity in the orthogonal position prior to flight followed by ground testing at seven different flow conditions {{to establish a}} baseline operation. During the tests, the actual flow rate was measured independently using choked-flow orifices. Gravitational acceleration and attitude had a unique effect on the {{performance of}} each meter. All meters operated within acceptable limits at all gravity levels in the calibrated orthogonal position. However, when operated in other orientations, the deviations from the reference flow became substantial for several of the <b>flow</b> <b>meters.</b> Data analysis indicated that the greatest source of error was the effect of orientation, followed by the gravity level. This work emphasized that when operating thermal <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> in a variable gravity environment, it is critical to orient the meter in the same direction relative to gravity in which it was calibrated. Unfortunately, there was no test in normal gravity that could predict the performance of a meter in reduced gravity. When operating in reduced gravity, all meters indicated within 5 percent of the full scale reading at all flow conditions and orientations...|$|R
40|$|The {{ignition}} and control systems of a laboratory scale high-pressure gas turbine combustor {{were developed in}} the present work. This work provides {{a detailed description of}} the design, development and testing of the remote control system developed for a High Pressure Gas Turbine Combustor (HPTC). ^ The combustor has the capability to operate at pressures up to 1. 5 MPa and temperatures up to 2400 K. It is also designed for a maximum air and fuel flow rates of 81. 93 g/s and 35. 77 g/s respectively. The fuel used will be CH 4 for the early experiments but it is designed to operate using a mixture of H 2 -CO with a hydrogen fuel composition variation of up to 30 percent. The HPTC also has optical accessibility capabilities in its combustion chamber with a converging nozzle that restricts the exhaust flow. It also has three circular ports that can be used as instrumentation ports to obtain real time data from the combustion chamber. ^ LabVIEW was used as the controlling interface for the user. A detailed outline of the LabVIEW programming is also described. LabVIEW controlled the proportional valves (ball valves), and solenoid valves; it also provided the user with data from <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> as well as pressure transducers. Both proportional and solenoid valves are 1. 91 cm and can withstand pressures of up to 1551 kPa. <b>Thermal</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> were used to obtain the flow in the lines with a range from 200 - 1000 L/min with an accuracy of 1. 5 percent. Pressure transducers with a range from 0 to 2068 kPa were also positioned on the lines in order to know the line pressures. ^ The ignition system design, development and testing is also described with its integration to the High Pressure Gas Turbine Combustor. A modified spark plug was used to provide the igniter with an ignition source. A diffusion flame was used to ignite the main line using methane as the fuel that utilizes the air in the combustion chamber as the oxidizer. Testing included a functional test of the equipment, and pressure testing prior to performing the ignition test. The system has the capability to withstand the maximum pressure allowed by the air compressor, which is 758 kPa. Ignition testing was performed at lean conditions using equivalence ratios from 0. 53 - 0. 79. Both systems demonstrated to be reliable and stable. Future work on this combustor includes flashback and flame stability of hydrocarbons at high pressures. ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} year several accomplishments were made for both the Particulate Matter Characterization and Measurement System, (PMCMS) and PAGEMS projects. The PAGEMS focus is to measure {{particulate}} emissions {{as a function of}} combustor parameters such as inlet temperature, inlet pressure and fuel air ratio. These measurements are used to evaluate combustor performance in hopes of correlating particulate emissions with engine conditions. These measurements have taken place at in-house NASA combustor facilities and off-site facilities. Ths work is unique because particulate measurements at high- pressure conditions are not commonly made. Some calibration of the PAGEMS instrumentation was done as well as minor modifications to the PAGEMS plumbing setup. These led to measurement improvements. The instrumentation and measurement process for PAGEMS was assessed and new instruments such as a thermodenuder, <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> and a cyclone separator were purchased to improve the PAGEMS instrumentation and measurement process. A worksheet was created to simulate varying inlet conditions to the DMA. This worksheet allows the user to assess the error in the measurements when certain conditions exist. Two technical papers were written with the PAGEMS team for the EXCAVATE field project. A paper was also reviewed for an in house publication. Also data was processed and analyzed for another field project (PAX) and will be part of a third PAGEMS paper. Accomplishments were also made with the PMCMS project. The calibration of the radial differential mobility analyzer, (RDMA) in the particle sizing system in the PMCMS was completed and provided satisfactory results. The voltages used for the RDMA depending on the particle of interest were corrected. The measurement capability of the PMCMS was increased by replacing the MetOne CPC with a TSI CPC. Lastly, assistance was provided to three college summer students with calibration of their particulate equipment and Monica Rivera shared her understanding of the aerosol technology with them. She also provided input for their end of the summer presentations. And attended the Aviation and Particle Emissions workshop. This workshop brought together experts in the aircraft particulate emissions field. As a result Ms. Rivera made two significant contacts with academia (UMR) and government (WPAFB) which could lead to future collaboration. She also attended the Aerosol and Particle Measurement Class held at the University of Minnesota. This class refreshed her particulate knowledge and introduced her to new aerosol applications and technology. Furthermore at the class contacts were made with private industry (TSI) and government (WPAFB).
