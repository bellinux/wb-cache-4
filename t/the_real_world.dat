5|$|During a LARP, player {{actions in}} <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> {{represent}} character actions in an imaginary setting. Game rules, physical symbols and theatrical improvisation {{are used to}} bridge differences between <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>world</b> and the setting. For example, a rope could signify an imaginary wall. Realistic-looking weapon props and risky physical activity are sometimes discouraged or forbidden for safety reasons. While the fictional timeline in a tabletop RPG often progresses in game-time, which may be much faster or slower than the time passing for players, LARPs are different in that they usually run in real-time, with game-time only being used in special circumstances.|$|E

Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series.
