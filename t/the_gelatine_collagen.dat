A rapid drop 100 Æ 0 % taking place within the first 100 ns supports the cavitation mechanism as described by the previous negative pressure wave model.

30|$|We {{postulate}} {{that the}} differences in water content between <b>the</b> <b>collagen</b> <b>gelatine</b> phases within parchment is a critical link when determining appropriate RH conditions for the storage, handling and display of parchment. The specific interaction between water and collagen {{at different levels of}} molecular and supramolecular structure means that changes in water content will induce well described and characteristic structural changes at each level; however in <b>gelatine,</b> <b>the</b> lack of conformational specificity means that changes in water content can only be described by the relative level in the proximity and entanglement of the collagen polypeptide chains. The gelatine-collagen stratigraphy within parchment may mean that the difference in water content at any given RH could cause differences in the cohesion between these structural phases [24, 25]. It is also possible that the difference in structural stability between <b>the</b> <b>collagen</b> and <b>gelatine</b> phases could affect mechanical properties within parchment inducing a stress at the interfaces between <b>collagen</b> and <b>gelatine.</b> If <b>the</b> changes in water exposure are cyclic, the stress imposed could eventually lead to mechanical fatigue and fracture, this would be a feed forward mechanism in which collagen is further damaged and converts to <b>gelatine.</b> Because <b>the</b> <b>collagen,</b> <b>gelatine</b> and interface layers will absorb different amounts of water at the same RH, there will be a differential distribution of water at any given RH typically used in storage conditions; an alteration in the RH will cause the water distribution and the physical properties of the different components to change [26]. The effect that the disparity between water content of <b>collagen</b> and <b>gelatine</b> has on parchment stability is not clear, and needs to be resolved. Electron micrograph images of parchment surfaces show a delamination of a glassy surface layer of parchment that has separated in parts from the underlying core of the parchment. These fractures are possible representative of differential behaviour of layers and interfaces within the parchment document [27].|$|R

40|$|This archive {{contains}} material {{relating to}} the photo-mechanical printing process invented by Walter Woodbury in 1865. Like the collotype process this also {{takes advantage of the}} changing nature of bichromated gelatine after exposure to light to produce a continuous tone print. Unlike the collotype process <b>the</b> bichromated <b>gelatine</b> layer does not form the printing plate. A negative is placed upon a sheet of bichromated gelatine and exposed to a light source, the sheet is then washed to flush out the excess bichromate. Where the light has passed through <b>the</b> negative <b>the</b> <b>gelatine</b> is no longer absorbent but where the negative blocked <b>the</b> light <b>the</b> <b>gelatine</b> will accept <b>the</b> water and swell. After the sheet has been washed it will be seen to have a relief surface, raised in the areas that represent the dark areas in the finished print and flat in the areas that represent the light areas of the print. Once dried, <b>the</b> <b>gelatine</b> sheet is placed on a steel plate in a hydraulic press and a sheet of lead that is half an inch thick and half an inch larger than <b>the</b> layer of <b>gelatine</b> is placed on top. The whole is then placed under pressure, and the relief surface of <b>the</b> <b>gelatine</b> sheet is embossed into the lead. The lead sheet produced forms the printing matrix used to make the print. It is placed face downwards in a press of Woodbury’s invention. A mixture of liquid gelatine and a colouring agent is then poured into the mould, a sheet of paper placed on the surface and the press closed. The press is then left for a few minutes allowing <b>the</b> liquid <b>gelatine</b> to set and adhere to the paper, which is then carefully lifted out of the press and placed in a drying rack. As <b>the</b> <b>gelatine</b> contracts slightly upon drying, causing the paper to curl inwards, these prints had to then be mounted. The archive contains journal articles taken from contemporary photographic journals describing this process and its potential amateur and commercial use as well as describing further refinements to the process.

The selected system consisted of an o/w emulsion embedded within <b>gelatine</b> gels. <b>The</b> <b>gelatine</b> gelled emulsions consisted of a discontinuous network of aggregated emulsion droplets, dispersed within a continuous network of <b>gelatine.</b> <b>The</b> viscoelastic properties of the gelled emulsions were dominated by the rheological behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>gelatine,</b> suggesting a gelatine continuous structure rather than a bi-continuous gel. A direct relationship between the speed of fat digestion and gel average mesh size was found, indicating that the digestion of fat within gelatine gelled emulsions is controlled by the ability of the gels microstructure to slow lipase diffusion to the interface of fat droplets. Digestion of fat was facilitated by gradual breakdown of <b>the</b> <b>gelatine</b> network, which mainly occurred via surface erosion catalysed by proteases.

Various hydrogels based on alginate, <b>gelatine,</b> <b>collagen,</b> chitosan and agarose have been used as a bioink for printing skin substitutes because of simplicity of their crosslinking mechanisms (Murphy et al. 2013). Alginate is a popular biologically derived and relatively inert bioink, which is generally crosslinked with calcium ions after bioprinting process and it degrades slowly within weeks to months depending on the degree of crosslinking (Jia et al. 2014). For instance, alginate preserves its strength and structure up to 3  weeks and is suitable for skin reconstruction (Sun and Tan 2013). On the other hand, 40  mM BaCl 2 treatment was able to keep the structure in place over 7  days without the appearance of visible cracks within the grid structure (Tabriz et al. 2015).

40|$|Gelatine, {{which is}} {{produced}} by collagen partial hydrolysis, has been largely used in the biomedical field {{for a wide variety}} of applications, which are ranging from drug delivery to wound healing. Its spread depends strongly on its biocompatibility: this natural polymer is indeed non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, non-immunogenic, enzymatically degradable and bioresorbable. In <b>the</b> biomedical field <b>gelatine</b> is mostly used as highly concentrated hydrogel (with a melting point above 43 °C - 45 °C) or cross-linked. This work investigated the use of uncross-linked gelatine hydrogels, with a melting temperature in the physiological range, for different biomedical applications. Firstly, it was studied the possibility to produce a solid hydrogel to use as easily removable wound dressing. Once applied to a wound, this patch keeps a moist environment in order to improve the regeneration, while releasing drugs or bioactive factors that it could be preloaded of. Moreover, it can be easily removed, without damages to the wound site and the newly formed tissue, by washing with warm sterile water (37 °C - 39 °C). Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>gelatine</b> material was investigated as substrate for the so-named cell sheet engineering.
