50|$|In this {{protection}} scheme, {{a primary}} and a backup LSP are computed and setup at the provisioning time prior to failures. The backup LSP {{does not necessarily}} {{need to have the}} same constrain in terms of bandwidth as the primary; it is possible to reserve less bandwidth on the backup LSP and not incur in packet loss when in use. This is because the bandwidth of the link is shared among the different LSPs and the reason why <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>explained</b> protection scheme is not preferred. It is also true that the Backup LSP does not necessarily carry traffic unless the primary LSP fails. When this occurs, a fault indication signal (FIS) is sent back to the head-end LSR that will immediately switch the traffic to the backup LSP. The drawback in this protection scheme is that the longer the LSPs, the longer the recovery time will be because of the travel time of the FIS notification.|$|R

The current study, rather than revisiting the analysis of the fundamental determinants of out-of-work benefit levels, aims instead at exploring the relationship between adequacy of benefits and activation policies at the cross-country level, as explained in the conceptual framework of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> section.|$|R

The geography of the crisis shows its widespread nature, and the intensity of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> bubble <b>explains</b> spatial differences. Resulting from this collapse are some problematic areas of 'empty urbanism'. An enormous land bubble, emerging from the peculiar Spanish urban development model, was a key factor in the impacts - caused by the crisis - on the territory and land-use plans. The crisis has demonstrated the unsustainability of this and the urgency of change in the existing land-use plans...|$|R

In this paper, we examine these issues exploiting a rich bank-level database for eight Latin American countries.

40|$|With the {{expansion}} {{of higher education in}} recent decades, exclusive academic qualifications have become the prominent way in which the status hierarchy of education is preserved. Much of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> research <b>explaining</b> social class differences in educational attainment have focused on cognitive ability but largely overlooked the importance of non-cognitive skills for enrolling in more prestigious educational fields. Using unique longitudinal data, the focus of this thesis is on childhood non-cognitive skills to explore their role for understanding the association between social class of origin and selection into prestigious university education in Sweden. The results confirm class differences in attending prestige education, but also show that non-cognitive skills cannot explain much of the variation in educational attainment between or within classes. More research is needed in order to fully understand the large class gap in prestigious academic outcomes in Sweden...|$|R

40|$|Quenching my {{thirst for}} God: On Johann Wilhelm Herrmann’s {{understanding}} {{of the experience of}} God (Part II) This article, which is divided into two parts, focusses on the concept of the “experience of God” as understood by the German systematic theologian Wilhelm Herrmann (1846 - 1922) of Marburg in his “Der Verkehr des Christen mit Gott” (1886). The first part of the article which was published in <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> edition, <b>explained</b> <b>the</b> historical and theological context of Herrmann’s “Der Verkehr [...] . ” as well as the theological frontiers over-against which he responded in his {{understanding of the}} experience of God, characterized as a “searchfind-experience”. This second part elaborates on this “search-find-experience” by humans of God as understood by Herrmann, and indicates the influence it had on Herrmann’s two greatest pupils, namely Karl Barth and Rudolf Bultmann. It is argued that Herrmann’s understanding of the experience of God makes up the kernel of their theological vantage points, and in this respect, is critically evaluated...|$|R
40|$|An entimation {{method for}} dynamic consitutive {{equations}} using the experimental data of strain time curves and the residual strain profile induced in a finite-length bar applied to longitudinal impact is described.

In this study, in order to confirm that the present method could be applied to the estimation of dynamic consitutive equations of carbons steels, stress-strain relationships of which are highly depndent on strain rates, the estimations were performed using actual experimental data. Furthermore, by the comparison of estimated results and experimental results regarding stress-strain relationships with strain rates, it was clarified that the method might be applied to estimation of the dynamic constitutive equations of carbon steels...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>previous</b> {{paragraph}} <b>explained</b> how {{a mathematician}} might weaken her conjecture {{in the face}} of counterexamples, but counterexamples {{can also be used to}} show that the assumptions and hypothesis are needed. Suppose that after a while the mathematician in question settled on the new conjecture [...] "All shapes that are rectangles and have four sides of equal length are squares". This conjecture has two parts to the hypothesis: the shape must be 'a rectangle' and 'have four sides of equal length' and the mathematician would like to know if she can remove either assumption and still maintain the truth of her conjecture. So she needs to check the truth of the statements: (1) [...] "All shapes that are rectangles are squares" [...] and (2) [...] "All shapes that have four sides of equal length are squares". A counterexample to (1) was already given, and a counterexample to (2) is a non-square rhombus. Thus the mathematician sees that both assumptions were necessary.|$|R
