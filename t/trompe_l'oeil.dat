5|$|The common {{element to}} both church and palazzi {{interior}} design was the stucco work. Stucco {{is an important}} component of the Baroque design and philosophy, as it seamlessly combines architecture, sculpture, and painting in three-dimensional form. Its combination with <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> ceilings and walls in Baroque illusionistic painting confuses reality and art. While in churches the stucco could represent angels and putti linked by swags of flowers, in a private house it might represent the owner's favourite foods or musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|The faux {{finished}} {{interior of}} the church incorporates groined vaults in the Gothic architecture style permitting very ample illumination from lateral windows. The steel columns, walls and ceiling were painted by Lorenzo Rocha, Isabelo Tampingco and Félix Martínez to {{give the appearance of}} marble and jasper. <b>Trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> paintings of saints and martyrs by Rocha were used to decorate the interiors of the church. True to the Gothic revival spirit of the church are its confessionals, pulpit, altars and five retablos designed by Lorenzo Guerrero and Rocha. The sculptor Eusebio Garcia carved the statues of holy men and women. Six holy water fonts were constructed for the church, each crafted from marble obtained from Romblon.|$|E
5|$|Although to many she is {{best known}} for Demi's Birthday Suit, art aficionados {{consider}} her most famous work Disappearing Model. The work appeared on Ripley's Believe it or Not!. In the <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> body painting, the face and body of the model are almost indistinguishable from the red and blue and yellow flowers of the wallpaper in the background. Her first body paintings was also memorable as she painted a moko on a female Ford Modeling Agency fashion model named Jana, which is a tabooed employment of a traditionally male ritual face mask. An example from Gair's website of her ability to trick the eye into seeing a three-dimensional subject blend with a two-dimensional background is seen in a photograph of a pregnant Elle Macpherson. Other examples of this technique include the cover of her first book (pictured below) and images from within this book.|$|E
50|$|Leon Vrancken's work is radical in its {{simplicity}} and pays tremendous attention to material and finish, expressing both tension and calm. He interweaves expectation with technical expertise. With {{a background in}} landscape architecture, after his artistic education in Situ at the Royal Academy in Antwerp, he has devoted his energies to the visual arts. His diverse works- sculptures, installations, photos or interventions - are mainly developed in interaction with space. Vranken completed his education at the Higher Institute for Fine Arts in Ghent in 2007, and has had international exhibitions in cities including New York, Londen and Toronto.Leon Vranken is always able to disrupt direct visual recognisability by depriving everyday objects of their function and deliberately using various materials. One could describe his work as sculptural <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeils,</b> alluring yet misleading configurations. Geometric ensembles, sophisticated sculptures and fake ready-mades are painstakingly orchestrated in space. Shape, presentation and meaning slide continuously over each other like tectonic plates. With his spatial compositions the artist defies gravity, the viewer and the medium. The image enters into dialogue with the frame, the sculpture with the pedestal.|$|R
25|$|Hollybush was {{originally}} {{the home of}} the Whitney family, {{and it was the first}} of its kind in South Jersey. It set a certain precedent with its Italianate architectural style, and its interior decorations attest to this precedent. Two of these significantly unique features of the house are the <b>trompe</b> de <b>l'oeil</b> ceilings in the parlor as well as the Summit Room, and the painted glass archway above and around the front door. The stone that was used in construction of Hollybush was New Jersey Ironstone, a sedimentary type stone that is found in the low hills and ridges of South Jersey.|$|R
40|$|The work of {{the artists}} in this {{exhibition}} is held together by the common themes Heritage, Irony, Politics, Irreverence, Humour, Being 'British'. Helen Baker’s work examines the politics of heritage. Inspired by a residency in Rome, these new works, Stop and Search, in gouache on gesso-ed board, carry these messages in mosaic like form. These texts emphasise the legalities that inform our political landscape and will be our bequest. Jane Millican’s labour intensive drawings fool the eye and fascinate. A slowly executed <b>trompe</b> - <b>l’oeil</b> pencil drawing might at first {{appear to be a}} quickly executed gestural painting. These images explore authenticity as material and this theme is emphasised by the creation of landscapes such as described by J. G. Ballard. They are both banal and terrifying in their exploration of a hideous future...|$|R
5|$|The {{desalination}} plant {{was impossible to}} hide, and since it had been built by the Italians, the enemy knew exactly where and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised the plant {{to look as if}} it had been destroyed by a bomb. A <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> black hole was painted over the top and one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought to decorate the compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if a stick of bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E
25|$|His {{paintings}} are mostly portraits or half-length groups of religious figures. He painted a live Sparrowhawk(National Gallery, London), {{which is probably}} a fragment of a larger work. The very early still-life of a Partridge, gauntlets, and crossbow bolt (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) is often called the first small scale <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> painting since antiquity; it {{may well have been}} the cover or reverse of a portrait (however, a fragmentary panel by another Venetian, Vittorio Carpaccio, has a <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> letter-rack of about 1490 on the reverse). In the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin there is a Portrait of a German Man and a religious subject. The Louvre has a religious group, and Philadelphia a pair of figures.|$|E
25|$|To {{lighten up}} the small dark rooms, tenants {{able to afford}} a degree of painted {{colourful}} murals on the walls. Examples have been found of jungle scenes with wild animals and exotic plants. Imitation windows (<b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil)</b> were sometimes painted to make the rooms seem less confined.|$|E
25|$|Palazzo Labia is a baroque {{palace in}} Venice, Italy. Built in the 17th–18th century, {{it is one}} of the last great palazzi of Venice. Little known outside of Italy, it is most notable for the {{remarkable}} frescoed ballroom painted 1746–47 by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, with decorative works in <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> by Gerolamo Mengozzi-Colonna.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 the Monuments Historiques {{division}} of the French Ministry of Culture began an 18.5 million dollar program of works at the cathedral, described as a restoration project. Part of the project involved painting the interior masonry creamy-white, with <b>trompe</b> <b>l’oeil</b> marbling and gilded detailing. The restoration architect {{in charge of this}} painting is Frédéric Didier. The goal of the project, which is due for completion in 2017, is to make the cathedral look as it would have done when finished in the 13th century.|$|E
25|$|Jacopo de' Barbari, {{sometimes}} {{known or}} {{referred to as}} de'Barbari, de Barberi, de Barbari, Barbaro, Barberino, Barbarigo or Barberigo (c. 1460/70 – before 1516), was an Italian painter and printmaker with a highly individual style. He moved from Venice to Germany in 1500, thus becoming the first Italian Renaissance artist of stature to work in Northern Europe. His few surviving paintings (about twelve) include the first known example of <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> since antiquity. His twenty-nine engravings and three very large woodcuts were also highly influential.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 15th century, the {{achieving}} of the effect of realistic space in a painting by the employment of linear perspective was a major preoccupation of many painters, as well as the architects Brunelleschi and Alberti who both theorised about the subject. Brunelleschi is known to have done a number of careful studies of the piazza and octagonal baptistery outside Florence Cathedral and it is thought he aided Masaccio in the creation of his famous <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> niche around the Holy Trinity he painted at Santa Maria Novella.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of Sixtus IV, a team of Renaissance {{painters}} that included Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Pinturicchio, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Roselli, created a series of frescos depicting the Life of Moses and the Life of Christ, offset by papal portraits above and <b>trompe</b> <b>l’oeil</b> drapery below. These paintings were completed in 1482, and on 15 August 1483 Sixtus IV celebrated the first mass in the Sistine Chapel for the Feast of the Assumption, at which ceremony the chapel was consecrated and dedicated to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
25|$|Mantegna's {{most famous}} {{work is the}} {{interior}} decoration of the Camera degli Sposi for the Gonzaga family in Mantua, dated about 1470. The walls are frescoed with scenes {{of the life of}} the Gonzaga family, talking, greeting a younger son and his tutor on their return from Rome, preparing for a hunt and other such scenes that make no obvious reference to matters historic, literary, philosophic or religious. They are remarkable for simply being about family life. The one concession is the scattering of jolly winged cherubs who hold up plaques and garlands and clamber on the illusionistic pierced balustrade that surrounds a <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> view of the sky that decks the ceiling of the chamber.|$|E
500|$|Like many mid-15th century polyptychs, the {{exterior}} panels borrow heavily from the Ghent Altarpiece, [...] which {{was completed in}} 1432. The combination of naturalistic donor portraits with grisaille imitation statues of saints is borrowed from that work, as is {{the treatment of the}} Annunciation. Van der Weyden used iconography in the Beaune exterior panels not found in his other works, which suggests Rolin may have commissioned the altarpiece to follow van Eyck's example. Van der Weyden was not inclined merely to imitate though, and arranged the panels and figures in a concentrated and compact format. Jacobs writes that [...] "{{the exterior}} presents the most consistent pictorial rendering of <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> sculpture to date". Gabriel's scroll and Mary's lily appear to be made of stone; the figures cast shadows against the back of their niches, creating a sense of depth which adds to the illusion.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there was}} {{necessarily}} a hotel restaurant from {{the inception of}} the Ritz, the current hotel restaurant, L'Espadon (The Swordfish) was established in 1956 by Charles Ritz. He was a keen fishing enthusiast so named the restaurant after a fish. The restaurant is inspired by the legendary first chef of the hotel, Auguste Escoffier, serving [...] "traditional French culinary style with contemporary overtones". The cuisine is by the award-winning chef Michel Roth, the ninth head chef of the hotel; the restaurant was awarded a second star by the 2009 edition of the influential Michelin Red Guide. The head chef was formerly Guy Legay, cited as one of Paris's greatest chefs, who had served from at least 1986 to beyond 1999. In 1999, Esquire magazine wrote, [...] "the dining room, L'Espadon, down the long corridor of mirrors and display cases, has a glittering Regency formality that seems to swirl around you, and it's easy enough to imagine Hemingway sitting down with Dietrich to a dish of chef Guy Legay's buttery scrambled eggs..." [...] The restaurant decor is described as [...] "opulent with <b>trompe</b> <b>l’oeil</b> ceilings, swagged drapes, and views into the garden." [...] The courtyard garden is rich in greenery and contains several statues and a fountain. The hotel hires five or so florists to provide fresh flowers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{association}} of Photorealism to <b>Trompe</b> <b>L'oeil</b> is a wrongly attributed comparison, {{an error in}} observation or interpretation made by many critics of the 1970s and 1980s. [...] <b>Trompe</b> <b>L'oeil</b> paintings attempt to [...] "fool the eye" [...] and make the viewer think he is seeing an actual object, not a painted one. When observing a Photorealist painting, the viewer is always aware that {{they are looking at}} a painting.|$|E
2500|$|... "Hand art" [...] is the {{application}} of make-up or paint to a hand {{to make it appear}} like an animal or other object. Some hand artists, like Guido Daniele, produce images that are <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> representations of wild animals painted on people's hands.|$|E

2500|$|His first Roman frescoes {{were in the}} {{corridor}} linking the Church of the Gesù to the rooms where St.Ignatius had lived. [...] His <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> architecture and paintings depicting the Saint's life for the Camere di San Ignazio (1681–1686), blended well with already existing paintings by Giacomo Borgognone.|$|E
2500|$|In 1762, {{the young}} Ledoux was {{commissioned}} to redecorate the Café Godeau, in the rue Saint-Honoré. [...] The result was an interior of <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> and mirrors. [...] Pilasters {{painted on the}} walls were interspersed with alternating Pier glasses and panels painted with trophies of helmets and weaponry, all executed in bold detail. [...] In 1969 this interior {{was moved to the}} Musée Carnavalet.|$|E
2500|$|The pilasters were of gray {{scagliola}} with gilt-bronze capitals {{supplied by}} Gouthière. The girandole lights suspended {{in front of}} the mirrors between the pilasters were semi-circular, so that with their reflection in the mirrors they appeared to be circular chandeliers hanging in space, a useful <b>trompe</b> <b>l'œil</b> to enlarge the somewhat cramped space, which was essentially an enlarged vestibule between the entrance and the Salon du Roi.|$|E
2500|$|The piano nobile also {{contains}} such rooms as the Chapel, and the beautifully frescoed Nuptial Allegory Room decorated {{to celebrate the}} 1758 marriage of Ludovico Rezzonico. The ceiling has a <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> depiction of the groom and his bride ferried by Apollo's chariot. The frescoes in [...] the adjoining room continues {{the celebration of the}} happy union. This room and the Palazzo Labia ballroom house major ceiling frescoes [...] "in situ" [...] by Tiepolo in Venice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{painting}} is signed, inscribed and dated {{on the wall}} above the mirror: [...] "Johannes de eyck fuit hic 1434" [...] ("Jan van Eyck was here 1434"). The inscription looks as if it were painted in large letters on the wall, as was done with proverbs and other phrases at this period. Other surviving van Eyck signatures are painted in <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> on the wooden frame of his paintings, so that they appear to have been carved in the wood.|$|E
2500|$|The Saenger Theatre's {{decoration}} {{was described}} as, [...] "the motif of a French palace of the Renaissance." [...] It {{was inspired by}} classical Greek mythology and Mobile's coastal location. Poseidon is cast above the front entrance and the interior plaster ornamentation includes: Dionysus above the proscenium, Maenads encircling the chandelier in the lounge, Pan beneath the organ grilles and various stylized seahorses, shells and fish throughout the theater. The color scheme of the interior was primarily sea-green with maroon and gold trim. The ceilings featured a variety of <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> decoration.|$|E
2500|$|According to Metzinger, in his Cubism was Born, {{published}} years later, Cubism {{had been}} born out of the [...] "need not for an intellectual art but for an art {{that would be something}} other than a systematic absurdity"; the idiocies of reproducing or copying nature in <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> on a surface that is rigorously flat. With this type of illusion other artist of his generation such as Gleizes and Picasso wanted nothing to do. [...] "Quite clearly" [...] Metzinger notes, [...] "nature and the painting make up two different worlds which have nothing in common..." [...] Already, in 1906, [...] "it could be said that a good portrait led one to think about the painter not the model".|$|E
2500|$|The {{ground floor}} {{contains}} the principal suite of large reception rooms, and while these rooms are furnished with {{works of art}} and furniture, they are low ceilinged, and, continuing the informal concept of the design, are in no way intended to be state rooms. The entrance hall is notable for its large paintings by Thomas Gainsborough, George Romney, and Joshua Reynolds and the large work by George Stubbs, [...] "Five Mares". The dining room, now decorated with {{what appear to be}} Dutch tiles but is in fact <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil,</b> contains a collection of small, mainly Dutch, paintings from the 16th and 17th centuries by such artists as Aelbert Cuyp, Adriaen van Ostade and Jan Steen.|$|E

2500|$|In 1766 Ledoux began {{designing}} the Hôtel d'Hallwyll (Le Marais, Paris), a building that, {{according to the}} Dijon architect Jacques Cellerier, received widespread praise and attracted new patrons to the architect. The owner Franz-Joseph d'Hallwyll (a Swiss colonel) and his wife, Marie-Thérèse Demidorge, were anxious to ensure work was executed economically. Therefore, Ledoux had to reuse portions of the existing buildings, the former Hôtel de Bouligneux. [...] He had envisaged two colonnades in the Doric order leading to a nymphaeum decorated with urns {{at the foot of}} the garden. [...] However, the limitations of the site made this impossible, so Ledoux resorted to <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> painting a colonnade on the blind wall of the neighboring convent, thus extending the perspective.|$|E
2500|$|The Cleves Master's {{originality}} {{is in the}} <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> effects, and in {{the still}} life borders. [...] For example, a border of pretzels and wafers encircles Saint Bartholomew, mussels enclose Saint Ambrose, and a rosary frames the Adoration of the Magi. Meiss observed that these pages are constructed so that the reader views the border through a magnifying glass and the miniature through a telescope. The Hours uses framing {{as a means to}} encourage viewers {{to think of themselves as}} participants with God in creating sacred time. The human figure appears flexible and articulate. The Master handles distance by graduated scale and diminishing clarity. The artist's increasing skill in depicting these realistic features can be traced from the start to the finish of this book.|$|E
2500|$|The painted {{ceiling of}} the nave [...] is a <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> [...] {{designed}} to give the illusion of barrel vaulting supported by four large arches covered in volutes and other decorative elements. Between the arches are painted squared balconies and “above” these balconies are three huge domes or cupolas rising on rings of open arches and columns. Most of this was painted between 1584 and 1586 by Francisco Venegas (fl. 1578-1590), royal painter to King Philip II. The Jesuits added the large central medallion (The Glorification of the Cross), as well as 8 large paintings and 12 monochrome panels depicting Biblical events. The ceiling {{near the front of}} the church was damaged in the 1755 earthquake and was rebuilt and repainted. The entire ceiling was restored in 2001 and the paint cleaned or repaired.|$|E
2500|$|Antithesis {{and unusual}} {{iconography}} conveys irony and humor. [...] Saint James the Less {{was known for}} his abstinence, so the border depicts men drinking wine. [...] Saint Gregory, the great Church administrator, is shown with a border of gold and silver coins. [...] Saint Peter is painted with the key of the Church, standing above a triskelion (a reference to the Trinity) of fresh fish as the fisher of men. [...] Saint Lawrence is shown with the grill of his martyrdom, and the alms purse attribute as the patron of the poor. [...] His border shows fresh fish ready for grilling, and the big fish eating the little fish, representing the rich devouring the poor, a common literary and pictorial theme of the 15th and 16th centuries. These fantastic <b>trompe</b> <b>l’oeil</b> borders were to influence the work of the Master of Mary of Burgundy 30 years later.|$|E
2500|$|The double height palazzo ballroom (or Salone delle Feste) {{is entirely}} frescoed with {{scenes from the}} Romantic {{encounters}} of Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra. [...] These frescoes were a collaboration between Tiepolo and Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna. The frescos are framed by architectural elements in <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil,</b> featuring doorways, windows and balconies.Through the illusionary elements we view the encounter of Anthony and the Egyptian Queen at a banquet, while from the painted balconies and upper windows members of Cleopatra's court seem to look down. [...] It is thought the models for these figures {{were members of the}} Labia's household. In the scene Cleopatra dissolves her priceless pearl in a goblet of wine, demonstrating to Anthony her wealth; Maria Labia would have seen this as a metaphor to her nouveau riche position in Venetian society. It is said Maria Labia herself was the model for Cleopatra, but no documentary evidence supports the claim.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst in Paris, Schiaparelli - [...] "Schiap" [...] to {{her friends}} - began making her own clothes. With {{encouragement}} from Poiret, she started her own business but it closed in 1926 despite favourable reviews. She launched a new collection of knitwear in early 1927 using a special double layered stitch created by Armenian refugees and featuring sweaters with surrealist <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> images. Although her first designs appeared in Vogue, the business really took off with a pattern that {{gave the impression of}} a scarf wrapped around the wearer's neck. The [...] "pour le Sport" [...] collection expanded the following year to include bathing suits, ski-wear, and linen dresses. Schiaparelli added evening wear to her collections in 1931, using the luxury silks of Robert Perrier, and the business went from strength to strength, culminating in a move from Rue de la Paix to acquiring the renowned salon of Louise Chéruit at 21 Place Vendôme, which was rechristened the Schiap Shop.|$|E
2500|$|He {{painted the}} {{designs for the}} decorations of the Ambassadors Staircase, the grand {{staircase}} of the King’s apartment at Versailles (four <b>trompe</b> <b>l'oeil</b> tapestries representing the taking of various towns, 1677). From 1679 {{he worked on the}} large-scale paintings of The King’s Conquests (Les conquêtes du Roi) intended for the decoration of the Royal Pavilion of Marly on which he worked until his death in 1690. [...] Marly was a new pleasure residence built for the King as an architectural fantasy, with twelve little pavilions and elegant Royal Pavilion laid out on a square plan. The four apartments of the pavilion were separated by vestibules with as only decoration two marble tables with above them two large paintings of The King’s Conquests by van der Meulen. [...] Van der Meulen was commissioned by Anne Marie Louise d'Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier to create smaller replicas of his paintings of conquests to decorate the Château de Choisy (1680-1688), and then by Louvois to decorate the Château de Meudon.|$|E
