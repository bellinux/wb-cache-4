500|$|He <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat,</b> {{crossed his}} hand across his chest and knelt in obeisance nine times {{offering}} worship to {{the sun and the}} mountain. He spent three days on the mountain offering prayers and thus established a strong bond of spirituality with the mountain and derived special strength from it.

500|$|Walker took {{command of}} the 64-gun [...] on 8 February 1798, before {{transferring}} in quick succession to the 56-gun , the 98-gun , the 90-gun [...] and lastly the 50-gun [...] on 7 October 1800. He commanded Isis in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and in the Baltic Sea, {{as well as with}} the Channel Fleet. Isis was assigned to the Baltic expedition under Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, and joined Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson's squadron for the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. The plan of attack had to be improvised at the last minute, after several ships ran aground while trying to enter the harbour, including Nelson's flagship, [...] Walker took Isis in to engage both his own target as well as Elephants, and ended up fighting two Danish blockships and a 14-gun battery. When eventually Nelson was able to work his way down the line he left Walker at his task and took another position. As he passed, Nelson <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat,</b> waved it, and cried, 'Well done, brave Walker! Go on as you have begun; nothing can be better'. After four and a half hours of intense fighting Isis silenced her opponents, at the heavy cost of nine officers and 103 men killed or wounded. Nelson came aboard Isis the following morning and thanked Walker and his men for their brave efforts.|$|E
2500|$|The Sorting Hat {{originally}} {{belonged to}} Godric Gryffindor, {{one of the}} four founders of Hogwarts. The four founders used to hand-pick the students for their houses, but then realised someone else would have to do it after they died, so Gryffindor <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat,</b> enchanted it, and let it choose. Since then, the Sorting Hat has always been used to choose which house the students are put in. Due to its age, it appears [...] "patched and frayed and extremely dirty." [...] Before Sorting the students each year, the hat recites a new introductory song. These songs occasionally warn of danger to come, as in Order of the Phoenix. The Sorting Hat's songs vary in length and content, but always include a brief description of each house.|$|E

6000|$|Of course, {{all this}} secrecy about Christmas is merely sentimental and ceremonial; {{if you do}} not like what is sentimental and ceremonial, do not {{celebrate}} Christmas at all. You will not be punished if you don't; also, since we are no longer ruled by those sturdy Puritans who won for us civil and religious liberty, you will not even be punished if you do. But I cannot understand why any one should bother about a ceremonial except ceremonially. If a thing only exists in order to be graceful, do it gracefully or do not do it. If a thing only exists as something professing to be solemn, do it solemnly or do not do it. There is no sense in doing it slouchingly; nor is there even any liberty. I can understand the man who <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> to a lady because it is the customary symbol. I can understand him, I say; in fact, I know him quite intimately. I can also understand the man who refuses to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> to a lady, like the old Quakers, because he thinks that a symbol is superstition. But what point would there be in so performing an arbitrary form of respect {{that it was not a}} form of respect? We respect the gentleman who <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> to the lady; we respect the fanatic who will not <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> to the lady. But what should we think of the man who kept his hands in his pockets and asked the lady to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>hat</b> <b>off</b> for him because he felt tired? ...|$|R
