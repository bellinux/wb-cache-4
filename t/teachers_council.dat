Whereas there is a well-developed leadership strategy for the school sector there is no equivalent support for teachers in ECE.

An interesting finding, which contrasted with previous research, was that PRTs in the secondary sector had levels of satisfaction with their role that were as high as those in other sectors. The key limitation to effectiveness was linked to lack of time for discussions and observations of the PRT’s practice...|$|E

Among the digital technologies introduced into classrooms are software packages, such as Moodle, which are designed to offer online learning environments. More recently, New Zealand schools are also using social network sites (SNS) such as Facebook for learning (NZ <b>Teachers</b> <b>Council,</b> 2013). Yet, social network sites {{have been identified as}} spaces for identity experimentation and impression management for young people (boyd, 2008). Furthermore, the co-opting of students ’ “social space ” for educational purposes, and the presence of the teacher, blurs the boundary between public and private. This thesis documents the ways in which a group of New Zealand students negotiate their identities on a class Facebook page. I examine the way one teacher and her class use Facebook as an online learning environment, the way a group of students from the class negotiate their identities on Facebook, and what the educational presence on Facebook means for students and teachers. Operating from a poststructuralist framework, I conceptualise identity as a fluid process and recognise the discursive constructions that shape identity. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The New Zealand <b>Teachers</b> <b>Council</b> {{recognises}} that “the induction of provisionally trained {{teachers is}} {{of critical importance}} for the retention and development of quality teachers” (Cameron, 2007, p. i). This study explores the effectiveness of an externally provided induction programme for provisionally registered teachers in teacher-led early childhood education services within Aotearoa New Zealand. An interpretive approach was taken, which used questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to capture the participants’ provisional registration experiences. The findings are presented in a narrative style in order to capture {{the voices of the}} participants. The major findings from the study indicate that the induction process for beginning teachers in teacher-led early childhood services is a complex one, and not always a smooth transition from pre-service training. The context of teacher-led early childhood services is unique to the education sector as it comprises fully qualified, in-training and un-trained educators within its teaching teams. The study is contextualised within a historical overview of both teacher registration and early childhood education in Aotearoa New Zealand. The study indicates that there are both structural and situational factors which influence a beginning teacher’s entry into the profession of teaching within a teacher-led early childhood service. These include the quality of the provisionally registered teacher’s mentor and induction programme, the mandates and policies which govern the sector and the receptiveness of the professional community which the beginning teacher is being inducted into...|$|E
40|$|An {{effective}} mentoring programme has {{a positive}} effect on the quality of teaching, student achievement, the retention of trained teachers and the teaching profession as a whole and the importance of mentoring beginning teachers cannot be overstated. Recently, there has been a shift in thinking on {{the most effective way to}} mentor beginning teachers. This shift has been away from a mentoring approach that only provides support and guidance towards educative mentoring which both challenges and transforms teaching practice and is based on a co-constructed learning relationship. In 2012, the New Zealand <b>Teachers</b> <b>Council</b> introduced guidelines into schools to assist mentor teachers in the educative mentoring of beginning teachers. The purpose of this case study was to examine how effectively one intermediate school was implementing these guidelines, identify challenges involved in the implementation process and describe the conditions necessary to support effective, educative mentoring. To answer the research questions, data was collected through an on-line survey, focus groups and an interview. The findings indicated that while both the mentors and beginning teachers felt that the guidelines were being implemented, neither group believed the mentoring process at the school was particularly effective. The biggest challenge to the implementation of the guidelines was differing perceptions of the purpose and potential of a mentoring programme. The beginning teachers, mentor teachers and principal all held differing views on the purpose of mentoring, leading to other challenges including the lack of clarity around procedures and expectations and tension between assistance and assessment...|$|E
40|$|The Guidelines for Induction and Mentoring and Mentor Teachers were {{published}} in 2011 by the New Zealand <b>Teachers</b> <b>Council.</b> The Guidelines signalled a shift from what had been an induction programme based on advice and guidance to one that involved educative mentoring. These guidelines were developed to support the provision of nationally consistent, high quality, and comprehensive support for provisionally certificated teachers (PCTs). This qualitative investigation used an interpretative case study approach to describe what educative mentoring looked like in three New Zealand primary schools. Data were gathered using an online survey, interviews, recorded meeting and analysis of documents. The findings were that mentors and provisionally registered teachers had differing levels of understanding of educative mentoring. While mentors espoused using educative mentoring components (Education Council of Aotearoa New Zealand, 2015 a, pp. 25 - 26) this {{did not appear to}} be happening in practice. This suggests the need for mentor training if educative mentoring is to become embedded. Mentors need training to understand what educative mentoring really means. In particular the elements of deconstruction (describing, analysing, and discussing evidence) and co-construction (setting new personal goals) were missing to some degree in each relationship investigated. The process of induction and mentoring is to develop practice and ultimately for the provisionally registered teacher to attain the Practising Teacher Criteria. However this study revealed that the developmental process of practice appears to be more focused on meeting the Practising Teacher Criteria than developing understanding through the setting of personal goals...|$|E
