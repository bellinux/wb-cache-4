5|$|Development {{began in}} 2010, soon after id Software gave MachineGames the {{rights for the}} franchise. The {{development}} team envisioned Wolfenstein: The New Order as a first-person action-adventure game, taking inspiration from previous games in the series and particularly focusing on the combat and adventure elements. The game attempts <b>to</b> <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> character development of Blazkowicz, unlike its predecessors—a choice from the developers to interest players in the story.

5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E

According to Claude Samuel, Boulez wanted <b>to</b> <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> the field of rhythmic shifts, tempo changes and superimpositions of different speeds, inspired in part by his contact with the music of György Ligeti. Boulez described it as “a sort of narrative mosaic”.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in other}} cultures, toys {{are used to}} expand the {{development}} of a child's cognition in an idealistic fashion. In these communities, adults place the value of play with toys to be on the aspirations they set forth for their child. In the Western culture, the Barbie and Action-Man represent lifelike figures but in an imaginative state out of reach from the society of these children and adults. These toys give way to a unique world in which children's play is isolated and independent of the social constraints placed on society leaving the children free <b>to</b> <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> the imaginary and idealized version of what their development in life could be.|$|E
25|$|From the Festival of Latin American Solidarity emerged solo {{artists that}} would go on <b>to</b> <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> a more adult {{oriented}} form of rock and pop music, with the Argentine youngsters of the 1960s now mature adults. Some of these names were Juan Carlos Baglietto (who was optimistic about a young musician from Rosario named Fito Páez), Alejandro Lerner, and Celeste Carballo. In heavy metal, Pappo founded his new band Riff, and newcomers V8 and La Torre would emerge. New witty rock bands like Los Twist, Suéter, and the riot grrrl group Viuda e hijas de Roque Enroll crashed to the scene infusing Argentine rock with needed dosages of humor and self-deprecation. On the gothic side of rock, La Sobrecarga and Euroshima would carry the torch.|$|E

25|$|His radio {{career began}} in New York City, working as the {{producer}} for the Tex and Jinx interview program from Peacock Alley in the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, a live remote broadcast over WNBC-AM {{in the mid-1950s}} at 10:30 PM to Midnight, Monday through Friday. William Safire hired Farber as a producer. Farber eventually hosted his own show on WINS. Begun in 1960, his first talk show was called Barry Farber’s WINS Open Mike. It was the only talk show on {{what was then a}} rock n’ roll station. He left that job for an evening talk show on WOR-AM in 1962, and then became an all-night host in 1967. In 1970, he ran for Congress in New York City's 19th district on the Republican ticket, but was defeated by Bella Abzug. Farber left his talk-radio career for a time in 1977 <b>to</b> <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> politics, running for mayor of New York City, but was defeated.|$|E
25|$|Welles's next turn as {{director}} was the film Mr. Arkadin (1955), which {{was produced by}} his political mentor from the 1940s, Louis Dolivet. It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man <b>to</b> <b>delve</b> <b>into</b> the secrets of his past. The film stars Robert Arden, who had worked on the Harry Lime series; Welles's third wife, Paola Mori, whose voice was dubbed by actress Billie Whitelaw; and guest stars Akim Tamiroff, Michael Redgrave, Katina Paxinou and Mischa Auer. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually five {{different versions of the}} film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version that Dolivet completed was retitled Confidential Report. In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the Munich Film Museum oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements.|$|E
