25|$|One day for {{the march}} I {{received}} this heavy old gun. A gun? And during a war? Never, I thought to myself. And leaned it against a hut. And walked away. But that stood out even in our group at <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> don't know now how I got away with it, but somehow it worked. And so I got by unarmed.|$|E
25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of mind {{that we were not}} only making music, we were making history. But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{is lucky}} you have come, Gerald," [...] {{he said when}} the first {{greetings}} were over, [...] "for I am going to return to Ireland in a fortnight's <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> am already appointed to a charge near Cork, and am to sail in a Bristol ship which is expected in Cadiz about <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Is</b> there any chance of my meeting you there?" ...|$|R

25|$|Inevitably, I {{made up my}} mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E
500|$|Taylor said in 1980, [...] "I {{was getting}} a bit fed up. I wanted to broaden my scope as a guitarist and do {{something}} else... I wasn't really composing songs or writing at <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> {{was just beginning to}} write, and that influenced my decision... There are some people who can just ride along from crest to crest; they can ride along somebody else's success. And there are some people for whom that's not enough. It really wasn't enough for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Hugo Black {{was also}} a {{one-time}} member of the Ku Klux Klan as revealed by journalist Ray Sprigle of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, who uncovered Black's handwritten resignation from the Klan on July 9, 1925. When confronted with the evidence that Hugo Black {{had been a member}} of the Klan, he responded in part: [...] "Before becoming a Senator I dropped the Klan. I have had nothing to do with it since <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> abandoned it. I completely discontinued any association with the organization." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a wait of {{half an hour}} {{at the end of}} {{the first}} act, and I could have gone out and rested during <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> but <b>I</b> could not trust myself to do it, for I felt that I should desert to stay out. There was another wait of half an hour toward nine o'clock, but I had gone through so much by <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had no spirit left, and so had no desire but to be let alone.|$|R

500|$|For his part, Rodgers {{recalled}} {{that he had}} first seen Madonna perform at a small club in New York in 1983. In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: [...] "I went to the club to see another woman sing, but when I got there Madonna was onstage. I loved her stage presence and then we met right after that. I kept thinking to myself, 'Damn, is she a star', but she wasn't at <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> always {{wanted to work with}} her and Like a Virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|Speer {{supported}} the German invasion of Poland and subsequent war, though {{he recognized that}} {{it would lead to}} the postponement, at the least, of his architectural dreams. In his later years, Speer, talking with his biographer-to-be Gitta Sereny, explained how he felt in 1939: [...] "Of course I was perfectly aware that [...] sought world domination...t <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> asked for nothing better. That was the whole point of my buildings. They would have looked grotesque if Hitler had sat still in Germany. All I wanted was for this great man to dominate the globe." ...|$|E
500|$|Had the Germans invaded Britain, Coward was {{scheduled}} to be arrested and killed, as he was in The Black Book along with other figures such as Virginia Woolf, Paul Robeson, Bertrand Russell, C. P. Snow and H. G. Wells. When this came to light after the war, Coward wrote: [...] "If anyone had told me at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was high up on the Nazi blacklist, I should have laughed... I remember Rebecca West, {{who was one of the}} many who shared the honour with me, sent me a telegram which read: 'My dear – the people we should have been seen dead with'." ...|$|E
500|$|Hergé's {{extensive}} research began with The Blue Lotus; Hergé stated, [...] "It was from <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> undertook research and really interested {{myself in the}} people and countries to which I sent Tintin, {{out of a sense}} of responsibility to my readers".|$|R

500|$|After {{defeating}} Nikolay Davydenko at Wimbledon 2012, Murray pointed upwards {{with both}} hands and wagged them back and forth while looking to the sky. Murray declined to reveal the reason, and ever since, he has continued to celebrate his victories with this gesture. Murray marked his first Wimbledon title in 2013 with the same victory salute. Then in his book 'Seventy-Seven; My Path to Wimbledon Glory', released in November 2013, Murray said: “The real reason is that around <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had a few friends and family who had various issues affecting them [...] [...] [...] I knew that they would be watching and I wanted to let them know I was thinking of them.” ...|$|E
500|$|Lee divided {{his forces}} into {{multiple}} columns, spread apart widely {{as he moved}} into Maryland and also maneuvered to capture the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry. This was a risky move for a smaller army, but Lee was counting on his knowledge of McClellan's temperament. He told one of his generals, [...] "He is an able general but a very cautious one. His army {{is in a very}} demoralized and chaotic condition, and will not be prepared for offensive operations—or he will not think it so—for three or four weeks. Before <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> hope to be on the Susquehanna." [...] This was not a completely accurate assessment, but McClellan's army was moving lethargically, averaging only [...] a day.|$|E
500|$|On October 1, 1937, Hugo Black made a {{statement}} over the radio. Black said in part, [...] "I number among my friends {{many members of the}} colored race. Certainly, they are entitled to the full measure of protection accorded by our Constitution and our laws..." [...] Black also said, [...] "I did join the Klan. I later resigned. I never rejoined.... Before becoming a Senator I dropped the Klan. I have {{had nothing to do with}} it since <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> abandoned it. I completely discontinued any association with the organization. I have never resumed it and never expect to do so."

500|$|Soon after Newman {{arrived in}} the UK, ABC's Head of Drama Dennis Vance was moved into a more senior {{position}} with the company, and Thomas offered Newman his position, which the Canadian quickly accepted. He was, however, somewhat disparaging {{of the state in}} which he found British television drama. [...] "At <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> found this country to be somewhat class-ridden," [...] he reminisced to interviewers in 1988. [...] "The only legitimate theatre was of the 'anyone for tennis' variety, which on the whole gave a condescending view of working-class people. Television dramas were usually adaptations of stage plays and invariably about the upper classes. I said, 'Damn the upper classes: they don't even own televisions!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Various {{accounts}} of Hubbard's {{service in the}} North Atlantic have been put forward by the Church of Scientology and Hubbard himself. The Church of Scientology states in one publication that Hubbard [...] "took command of an antisubmarine escort vessel with Atlantic convoys". In a 1954 lecture, Hubbard asserted {{that he had been}} sent [...] "to Boston in the very early part of the war to take command of a corvette" [...] and had been given a crew made up of convicts from the Portsmouth Naval Prison. Hubbard stated in another lecture that he had been posted aboard [...] "corvettes, North Atlantic. And I went on fighting submarines in the North Atlantic and doing other things and so on. And I finally got a set of orders for the ship. By <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had the squadron." ...|$|E
500|$|Jones became {{interested}} in programming in high school, and learned Applesoft BASIC and 6502 Assembly on an Apple II series computer. When Apple released its Macintosh line, Jones's family purchased a Macintosh 128K, but Jones never programmed much for it. After high school Jones got a job programming for a computer-aided design company on PCs, before going to college the next year. In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, [...] "and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac," [...] he said. [...] "The first thing I did on the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac. I was still finishing that when I came to college. By <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> knew I wanted to write games." ...|$|E

500|$|One day, whilst {{working on}} On the 6, Jennifer Lopez [...] "happened to be" [...] {{recording}} {{at the same}} recording studio where American recording artist Marc Anthony was recording. Anthony, who had become intrigued by Lopez after seeing her in Selena (1997), came into her studio {{and asked her to}} appear in the music video for his song [...] "No Me Conoces". She agreed, but only if he recorded a song with her, to which he in turn agreed. Lopez recalled the events on her [...] video album by stating: [...] "So at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> called Tommy [...] and I'm like 'Look, so Marc Anthony said he would do a song and I really don't want to do a duet with just anybody, I want to do a duet with him. So can you force him to sign something, so he has to do a record with me? If I do this video!'". The two first shot the video and then began working on the song.|$|E
500|$|She {{was educated}} at Monk's Walk School, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Dixon's parents split up when Dixon was four and Dixon's father moved away, {{resulting}} in Dixon later describing her family life as [...] "very dysfunctional". Between {{the ages of}} eight and ten, Dixon witnessed her mother suffer domestic violence from her partner; she only spoke publicly about the issue 21 years later, in 2010. Dixon created a documentary for the BBC, Don't Hit My Mum, regarding the issue of domestic abuse from a child's perspective, and remarked upon her own childhood: [...] "When I think about <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> don't remember living in harmony, I don't remember any fun times, I suppose because the negativity has clouded it. The negative times and the scary times have blocked anything that was good... I believe that every child {{has the right to}} grow up in an environment where they feel secure and fearless going into the world, and I didn't really feel that".|$|E
500|$|In 2013, The Islamic Society in Denmark {{stated that}} they regretted their visit to Lebanon and Egypt in 2006 to show the caricatures because the {{consequences}} had been much more serious than they expected. In August 2013, Ahmed Akkari expressed his regret {{for his role in}} the Imams' tour of the Middle East, stating [...] "I want to be clear today about the trip: It was totally wrong. At <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> was so fascinated with this logical force in the Islamic mindset that I could not see the greater picture. I was convinced it was a fight for my faith, Islam." [...] Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying [...] "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society. To me, he is really sincere, convincing and strong in his views." [...] A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Denmark said [...] "It is still not OK to publish drawings of Muhammad. We have not changed our position." ...|$|E

I did not know at <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was quite immune from the poison of the oak and that the California rattlesnake was quite so friendly and harmless an animal as John Muir has since assured us that he is.
