60|$|But we {{will let}} these things pass, and call you again to remembrance {{of what is}} in hand: we are now shewing that there be them that name the name of Christ, 'that yet depart not from iniquity,' and in shewing the cause of their not so doing, one was for that the gospel came to them in word only; and the other was, for that though it came to others in power, yet not in power, or in that power, that effectually keepeth some to salvation. Upon this second reason I now am, and am shewing how it comes to pass that they that are under the power of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> afore discoursed, should {{notwithstanding}} that, return to their vomit again. One cause of this declension, or going back to iniquity, I have just now touched upon, {{and we have some}} more behind.|$|E

60|$|The {{fundamental}} fact, however, is {{the absence}} of the reciprocal idea. The Prussian is not sufficiently civilised for the duel. Even when he crosses swords with us his thoughts are not as our thoughts; when we both glorify war, we are glorifying different things. Our medals are wrought like his, but they do not mean the same thing; our regiments are cheered as his are, but the thought in the heart is not the same; the Iron Cross is on the bosom of his king, {{but it is not the}} sign of our God. For we, alas, follow our God with many relapses and self-contradictions, but he follows his very consistently. Through all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> examined, the view of national boundaries, the view of military methods, the view of personal honour and self-defence, there runs in their case something of an atrocious simplicity; something too simple for us to understand: the idea that glory consists in holding the steel, and not in facing it.|$|E

I would awaken or keep alive in their memory <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been, the grand, brave things that some of our race have done, and I would stir up a longing, a determination for the future that we must win back. I would be a counter- agent to the agents of the fait accompli. In course of time the Government would find out what I was doing, and I should be sent out of the country, but I should have accomplished something, and others would carry on the work.

60|$|To summarise; before {{touching}} the philosophy which Shaw has ultimately adopted, we must quit {{the notion that}} we know it already and that it is hit off in such journalistic terms as these three. Shaw does not wish to multiply problem plays or even problems. He has such scepticism as is the misfortune of his age; but he has this dignified and courageous quality, that he does not come to ask questions but to answer them. He is not a paradox-monger; he is a wild logician, far too simple even to be called a sophist. He understands everything in life except its paradoxes, especially that ultimate paradox that the very things that we cannot comprehend are <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to take for granted. Lastly, he is not especially social or collectivist. On the contrary, he rather dislikes men in the mass, though he can appreciate them individually. He has no respect for collective humanity in its two great forms; either in that momentary form which we call a mob, or in that enduring form which we call a convention.|$|E

Drummer Redd Claudio says, [...] "You’ll find that each track is based on a separate experience, it’s just narrating those experiences. That for me, shows how personal it is in that sense." [...] "album is about our lives, heartbreak, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> celebrate, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> go through, happiness.

6000|$|There {{is a great}} {{difference}} between their dispensation and ours for comfort, even as much as there is between {{the making of a}} bond with a promise to seal it, and the sealing of the same. It was made indeed in their time, but it was not sealed until the time the blood was shed on the Mount Calvary; and that we might indeed have our faith mount up with wings like an eagle, he showeth us what encouragement and ground of faith we have to conclude we shall be everlastingly delivered, saying, [...] "For where a testament" [...] or covenant [...] "is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood" [...] (Heb 9:16-18). As Christ's blood was the confirmation of the new covenant, yet it was not sealed in Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob's days to confirm the covenant that God did tell them of, and yet they believed; therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to believe <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> heard, and not in any wise to let them be questioned; and the rather, because you see the testament is not only now made, but confirmed; not only spoken of and promised, but verily sealed by the death and blood of Jesus, who is the Testator thereof.|$|E
6000|$|He put such divine despair {{into the}} words, [...] "Except my life, except my life, except my life!" [...] {{following}} the mockery {{with which he}} had assured Polonius {{there was nothing he}} would more willingly part withal than his leave, that the heart-break of them had lingered with me for thirty years, and I had been alert for them with every Hamlet since. But before I knew, Mme. Bernhardt had uttered them with no effect whatever. Her Hamlet, indeed, cut many of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> learned to think the points of Hamlet, and it so transformed others by its interpretation of the translator's interpretation of Shakespeare that they passed unrecognized. Soliloquies are the weak invention of the enemy, for the most part, but as such things go that soliloquy of Hamlet's, [...] "To be or not to be," [...] is at least very noble poetry; and yet Mme. Bernhardt was so unimpressive in it that you scarcely noticed the act of its delivery. Perhaps this happened because the sumptuous and sombre melancholy of Shakespeare's thought was transmitted in phrases that refused it its proper mystery. But there was always a hardness, not always from the translation, upon this feminine Hamlet. It was like a thick shell with no crevice in it through which the tenderness of Shakespeare's Hamlet could show, except for the one moment at Ophelia's grave, where he reproaches Laertes with those pathetic words ...|$|E

But in death we may find all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> lost. So your father taught, Macumazahn, and there was wisdom in his gentleness. Ou! I do not believe in death; it is change, that is all, Macumazahn. Look now, the rain falls, the drops of rain that were one water in the clouds fall side by side. They sink into the ground; {{presently}} the sun will come out, the earth will be dry, the drops will be gone. A fool looks and says the drops are dead, they will never be one again, they will never again fall side by side. But I am a rain-maker, and I know the ways of rain. It is not true. The drops will drain by many paths into the river, and will be one water there. They will go up to the clouds again in the mists of morning, and there will again be as they have been. We are the drops of rain, Macumazahn. When we fall that is our life. When we sink into the ground that is death, and when we are drawn up again to the sky, what is that, Macumazahn? No! no! when we find we lose, and when we seem to lose, then we shall really find. I am not a Christian, Macumazahn, but I am old, and have watched and seen things that perhaps Christians do not see. There, I have spoken. Be happy with your star, and if it sets, wait, Macumazahn, wait till it rises again. It will not be long; one day you will go to sleep, then your eyes will open on another sky, and there your star will be shining, Macumazahn." ...|$|E

50|$|Thus the {{unconscious}} mind {{can be seen}} as the source of dreams and automatic thoughts (those that appear without any apparent cause), the repository of forgotten memories (that may still be accessible to consciousness at some later time), and the locus of implicit knowledge (<b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> learned so well that we do them without thinking).|$|E

For him, truth plays a pre-eminent role in cognitive evaluation, and placing value on truth is thus pragmatically preferable...|$|R
