5|$|The {{designation}} WS-199B {{was assigned}} to the project that, under a contract awarded in 1958 to Martin Aircraft, would become the Bold Orion missile. The design of Bold Orion was simple, using parts developed for other missile systems to reduce the cost and development time of the project. The initial Bold Orion configuration was a single-stage vehicle, using a <b>Thiokol</b> TX-20 Sergeant solid-fuel rocket. Following initial testing, the Bold Orion configuration was altered to become a two-stage vehicle, an Allegany Ballistics Laboratory Altair upper stage being added to the missile.|$|E
5|$|The High Virgo missile was a {{single-stage}} weapon, {{powered by}} a solid-fueled <b>Thiokol</b> TX-20 rocket, and was equipped an advanced inertial guidance system derived {{from that of the}} AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. Four tailfins in a cruciform arrangement provided directional control. The missile was developed by Lockheed, utilising components developed for several existing missiles to reduce the cost of the project, and also to reduce the development time required. Convair was responsible for development of a pylon for carriage and launching of the missile from the prototype B-58, the pylon replacing the aircraft's normal weapons pod.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experimental}} research was to compare Marshall Space Flight Center's electrets with <b>Thiokol's</b> fixed flow air samplers during the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Demonstration Model- 3 static test firing on October 19, 1978. The measurement of rocket exhaust effluents by <b>Thiokol's</b> samplers and MSFC's electrets indicated that the firing of the Solid Rocket Booster had no {{significant effect on the}} quality of the air sampled. The highest measurement by <b>Thiokol's</b> samplers was obtained at Plant 3 (site 11) approximately 8 km at a 113 degree heading from the static test stand. At sites 11, 12, and 5, <b>Thiokol's</b> fixed flow air samplers measured 0. 0048, 0. 00016, and 0. 00012 mg/m 3 of CI. Alongside the fixed flow measurements, the electret counts from X-ray spectroscopy were 685, 894, and 719 counts. After background corrections, the counts were 334, 543, and 368, or an average of 415 counts. An additional electred, E 20, which was the only measurement device at a site approximately 20 km northeast from the test site where no power was available, obtained 901 counts. After background correction, the count was 550. Again this data indicate there was no measurement of significant rocket exhaust effluents at the test site...|$|R
50|$|Dihalides {{used in this}} {{condensation}} polymerization are dichloroalkanes (such as 1,2-dichloroethane, bis-(2-chloroethyl)formal (ClCH2CH2OCH2OCH2CH2Cl), and 1,3-dichloropropane). The polymers are called <b>thiokols.</b> In some cases, polysulfide polymers can be formed by ring-opening polymerization reactions.|$|R
25|$|In 2001, ATK {{acquired}} <b>Thiokol,</b> renaming it ATK Launch Systems in 2006, {{though it}} is still known within the industry by its original name. <b>Thiokol</b> was the sole manufacturer of the reusable Solid Rocket Motor used to launch the NASA Space Shuttle, which is being adapted for NASA’s Space Launch System.|$|E

25|$|The Alpha Draco missile was a {{two-stage}} vehicle, {{the first}} stage comprising a <b>Thiokol</b> TX-20 solid-fuel rocket of the type used in the MGM-29 Sergeant theatre ballistic missile, and the second stage using a <b>Thiokol</b> TX-30 solid-fuel rocket. The payload vehicle was aerodynamically shaped, using the lifting body principle to provide aerodynamic lift; following burnout of {{the first stage}}, the vehicle would coast {{for a short time}} before ignition of the second stage, burnout of the second stage was followed by the vehicle entering the glide phase of flight, which would be terminated by a dive upon the target.|$|E
40|$|The {{propulsion}} {{performance and}} reconstructed mass properties data from Morton <b>Thiokol's</b> RSRM- 4 motors, which {{were assigned to}} the STS- 30 R launch, are presented. The composite type solid propellant burn rates were close to predicted. The performance of the pair of motors were compared to some CEI Specification CPW 1 - 3600 for compliance. Some aspects of the CEI Specification could not be compared because of low sampling of data. The performance of the motors were well within the CEI specification requirements.

5000|$|The {{disaster}} {{resulted in}} a 32-month hiatus in the shuttle program {{and the formation of}} the Rogers Commission, a special commission appointed by United States President Ronald Reagan to investigate the accident. The Rogers Commission found NASAs organizational culture and decision-making processes had been key contributing factors to the accident, with the agency violating its own safety rules. NASA managers had known since 1977 that contractor Morton <b>Thiokols</b> design of the SRBs contained a potentially catastrophic flaw in the O-rings, but they had failed to address this problem properly. NASA managers also disregarded warnings (an example of [...] "go fever") from engineers about the dangers of launching posed by the low temperatures of that morning, and failed to adequately report these technical concerns to their superiors.|$|R
40|$|The {{propulsion}} {{performance and}} reconstructed mass properties data from <b>Thiokol's</b> RSRM- 13 motors which {{were assigned to}} the STS- 41 launch are presented. The SRM propellant, TP-H 1148, is a composite type solid propellant, formulated of polybutadiene acrylic acid acryonitrile terpolymer binder, epoxy curing agent, ammonium perchlorate oxidizer, and aluminum powder fuel. A small amount of burning rate catalyst (iron oxide) was added to achieve the desired propellant burn rate. The propellant evaluation and raw material information are also presented. The presented ballistic performance was based on the Operational Flight Instrumentation. The adjustments made to the raw data on this flight include biasing the data to correct ambient pressure before liftoff. The performance from each motor as well as matched pair performance values were well within the CEI Specification requirements...|$|R
25|$|<b>Thiokol</b> had {{a landing}} strip on their property, used by company {{executives}} {{who lived on}} St. Simons Island. All available pilots were requested to fly to the company airstrip to transport the injured to hospitals, the closest being in Brunswick.|$|E
25|$|Like the MX-2223 design, the SM-73 {{utilized}} a non-metallic fiberglass fuselage. The {{swept wing}} of the MX-2223 design evolved to a fiberglass 52°delta wing. A <b>Thiokol</b> solid-propellant rocket booster was used to launch the SM-73 to a speed of 300 knots (345mph).|$|E
25|$|During the Delta IV's development, a Small variant was considered. This {{would have}} {{featured}} the Delta II second stage, an optional <b>Thiokol</b> Star 48B third stage, and the Delta II payload fairing, all atop a single CBC. The Small variant was dropped by 1999.|$|E
50|$|Solid rockets {{can provide}} high thrust for {{relatively}} low cost. For this reason, solids {{have been used}} as initial stages in rockets (for example the Space Shuttle), while reserving high specific impulse engines, especially less massive hydrogen-fueled engines, for higher stages. In addition, solid rockets have a long history as the final boost stage for satellites due to their simplicity, reliability, compactness and reasonably high mass fraction. A spin-stabilized solid rocket motor is sometimes added when extra velocity is required, such as for a mission to a comet or the outer solar system, because a spinner does not require a guidance system (on the newly added stage). <b>Thiokol's</b> extensive family of mostly titanium-cased Star space motors has been widely used, especially on Delta launch vehicles and as spin-stabilized upper stages to launch satellites from the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle. Star motors have propellant fractions as high as 94.6% but add-on structures and equipment reduce the operating mass fraction by 2% or more.|$|R
40|$|Essential {{studies and}} {{analyses}} required to integrate the SRM into the booster and overall space shuttle system. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} case, nozzle, insulation, and propellant components with resulting performance, weight, and structural load characteristics being generated. Effort conducted during the time period of this contract included studies, analyses, planning, and preliminary design activities. Technical requirements identified in the SRM Project Request for Proposal No. 8 - 1 - 4 - 94 - 98401 and <b>Thiokol's</b> proposed SRM design (designated Configuration 0) established the basis for this effort. The requirements were evaluated jointly with MSFC and altered where necessary to incorporate new information that evolved after issuance of the RFP and {{during the course of this}} interim contract. Revised water impact loads and load distributions were provided based on additional model test data and analytical effort conducted by NASA subsequent to the RFP release. Launch pad peaking loads into the SRM aft skirt were provided which also represented a change from RFP requirements. A modified SRM/External Tank (ET) attachment configuration with new structural load data was supplied by NASA, and direction was received to include a 2 percent inert weight contingency...|$|R
40|$|Laser Shearography is {{a viable}} {{inspection}} method for detection of de-bonds and voids within the external TPS (thermal protection system) on to the Space Shuttle RSRM (reusable solid rocket motors). Cork samples with thicknesses up to 1 inch were tested at the LTI (Laser Technology Incorporated) laboratory using vacuum-applied stress in a vacuum chamber. The testing proved that the technology could detect cork to steel un-bonds using vacuum stress techniques in the laboratory environment. The next logical step was to inspect the TPS on a RSRM. Although detailed post flight inspection has confirmed that ATK <b>Thiokol's</b> cork bonding technique provides a reliable cork to case bond, due to the Space Shuttle Columbia incident {{there is a great}} interest in verifying bond-lines on the external TPS. This interest provided and opportunity to inspect a RSRM motor with Laser Shearography. This paper will describe the laboratory testing and RSRM testing that has been performed to date. Descriptions of the test equipment setup and techniques for data collection and detailed results will be given. The data from the test show that Laser Shearography is an effective technology and readily adaptable to inspect a RSRM...|$|R

40|$|The {{propulsion}} {{performance and}} reconstructed mass properties data from <b>Thiokol's</b> RSRM- 9 motors which {{were assigned to}} the STS- 36 launch are presented. The SRM propellant, TP-H 1148, is a composite type solid propellant, formulated of polybutadiene acrylic acid acryonitrile terpolymer binder (PBAN), epoxy curing agent, ammonium perchlorate oxidizer and aluminum powder fuel. A small amount of burning rate catalyst (iron oxide) was added to achieve the desired propellant burn rate. The propellant evaluation and raw material information for the RSRM- 9 are included. The propellant grain design consists of four segments. There is a forward segment with an eleven point star with a transition into a tapered circular perforated (CP) configuration. There are two center segments that result in a double tapered CP configuration and an aft segment with a triple taper CP configuration and a cutout for the partially submerged nozzle. The ballistic performance presented is based on the Operational Flight Instrumentation (OFI) 12. 5 sample per second pressure data for the steady state and tail off portion of the pressure trace. No high sample rate pressure gauges, Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI), were used on this flight and therefore no ignition data is presented...|$|R
40|$|Employees who "blow {{the whistle}} " on their company {{because they believe}} it is engaged in {{practices}} that are illegal, immoral, or harmful to the public, often face grave consequences for their actions, in:auding demotion, harassment, forced resignation, or termination. The case of Allan McDonald and Roger Boisjoly, engineers who blew the whistle on Morton <b>Thiokol's</b> poor management practices when the company agreed to launch the shuttle Challenger even after concerns for safety had been expressed, illustrates the problems involved in whistleblowing. McDonald was reassigned and Boisjoly took disability leave to recover from depression over the Challenger disaster. The whistleblower, if his or her charges are correct, characterizes one of the dilemmas of complex organizations: how to restrict {{the flow of information}} up the organizational hierarchy and still insure that accurate, useful information reaches organizational decision makers. NASA has since instituted au anonymous whistleblowing system, retaining an outside firm to investigate the claim before it reaches NASA personnel. However, it is naive to think that "a message sent is a message received, " and it does not appear as though the new system will avert such disasters as the Challenger explosion.
