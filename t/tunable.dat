5|$|Liquid crystal <b>tunable</b> {{filters are}} used as electrooptical devices, e.g., in hyperspectral imaging.|$|E
5|$|Michelson interferometers {{are used}} in <b>tunable</b> narrow band optical filters and as the core {{hardware}} component of Fourier transform spectrometers.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} same phases, their self-assembled {{structures}} are <b>tunable</b> by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, {{it is more difficult}} to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.|$|E
5|$|The stable {{isotopes}} {{of potassium}} can be laser cooled {{and used to}} probe fundamental and technological problems in quantum physics. The two bosonic isotopes possess convenient Feshbach resonances to enable studies requiring <b>tunable</b> interactions, while 40K {{is one of only}} two stable fermions amongst the alkali metals.|$|E
5|$|Thus, most {{einsteinium}} {{samples are}} contaminated, and their intrinsic properties are often deduced by extrapolating back experimental data accumulated over time. Other experimental techniques {{to circumvent the}} contamination problem include selective optical excitation of einsteinium ions by a <b>tunable</b> laser, such as in studying its luminescence properties.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, taiko have a {{drum shell}} with heads {{on both sides}} of the body, and a sealed {{resonating}} cavity. The head may be fastened to the shell using a number of different systems, such as using ropes. Taiko may be either <b>tunable</b> or non-tunable depending on the system used.|$|E
5|$|Although blue phases are of {{interest}} for fast light modulators or <b>tunable</b> photonic crystals, they exist in a very narrow temperature range, usually less than a few kelvin. Recently the stabilization of blue phases over a temperature range of more than 60K including room temperature (260–326K) has been demonstrated. Blue phases stabilized at room temperature allow electro-optical switching with response times {{of the order of}} 10−4s.|$|E
5|$|Fig.9 shows a doppler {{image of}} the solar corona made using a <b>tunable</b> Fabry-Pérot {{interferometer}} to recover scans of the solar corona {{at a number of}} wavelengths near the FeXIV green line. The picture is a color-coded {{image of the}} doppler shift of the line, which may be associated with the coronal plasma velocity towards or away from the satellite camera.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Hertz (1887) {{experimentally}} {{demonstrated the}} resonance phenomena by building two resonant circuits, {{one of which}} was driven by a generator and the other was <b>tunable</b> and only coupled to the first electromagnetically (i.e., no circuit connection). Hertz showed that the response of the second circuit was at a maximum when it was in tune with the first. The diagrams produced by Hertz in this paper were the first published plots of an electrical resonant response.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{photoluminescence}} mapping, {{the energy}} of the excitation light can be scanned in Raman measurements, thus producing Raman maps. Those maps also contain oval-shaped features uniquely identifying (n,m) indices. Contrary to PL, Raman mapping detects not only semiconducting but also metallic tubes, and it is less sensitive to nanotube bundling than PL. However, requirement of a <b>tunable</b> laser and a dedicated spectrometer is a strong technical impediment.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium {{compounds}} {{are sometimes}} used in fireworks {{to give them}} a purple color. Rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle, where rubidium ions are formed by heat at high temperature and passed through a magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current. Rubidium, particularly vaporized 87Rb, {{is one of the most}} commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose–Einstein condensation. Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength, and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures. For cold atom applications requiring <b>tunable</b> interactions, 85Rb is preferable due to its rich Feshbach spectrum.|$|E
5|$|When {{used as a}} <b>tunable</b> {{narrow band}} filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.|$|E
25|$|The vacuum {{ultraviolet}} (VUV) band (100–200nm) can {{be generated}} by non-linear 4 wave mixing in gases by sum or difference frequency mixing of 2 or more longer wavelength lasers. The generation is generally done in gasses (e.g. krypton, hydrogen which are two-photon resonant near 193nm) or metal vapors (e.g. magnesium). By making one of the lasers <b>tunable,</b> the VUV can be tuned. If one of the lasers is resonant with a transition in the gas or vapor then the VUV production is intensified. However, resonances also generate wavelength dispersion, and thus the phase matching can limit the <b>tunable</b> range of the 4 wave mixing. Difference frequency mixing (lambda1 + lambda2 − lambda3) has an advantage over sum frequency mixing because the phase matching can provide greater tuning. In particular, difference frequency mixing two photons of an ArF (193nm) excimer laser with a <b>tunable</b> visible or near IR laser in hydrogen or krypton provides resonantly enhanced <b>tunable</b> VUV covering from 100nm to 200nm. Practically, the lack of suitable gas/vapor cell window materials above the lithium fluoride cut-off wavelength limit the tuning range to longer than about 110nm. <b>Tunable</b> VUV wavelengths down to 75 nm was achieved using window-free configurations.|$|E
25|$|Highly <b>tunable</b> – many {{internal}} parameters can be configured {{for optimal}} functionality.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tunable</b> laser, {{which can}} {{selectively}} excite certain sublevels {{of the ground}} and excited state.|$|E
25|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{nature of}} ferroelectric materials {{can be used}} to make capacitors with <b>tunable</b> capacitance. Typically, a ferroelectric capacitor simply consists of a pair of electrodes sandwiching a layer of ferroelectric material. The permittivity of ferroelectrics is not only <b>tunable</b> but commonly also very high in absolute value, especially when close to the phase transition temperature. Because of this, ferroelectric capacitors are small in physical size compared to dielectric (non-tunable) capacitors of similar capacitance.|$|E
25|$|PMMA, in a {{purified}} form, {{is used as}} {{the matrix}} in laser dye-doped organic solid-state gain media for <b>tunable</b> solid state dye lasers.|$|E
25|$|Capacitors {{are divided}} into two {{mechanical}} groups: Fixed capacitors with fixed capacitance values and variable capacitors with variable (trimmer) or adjustable (<b>tunable)</b> capacitance values.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{spectroscopy}} uses <b>tunable</b> lasers {{and other}} types of coherent emission sources, such as optical parametric oscillators, for selective excitation of atomic or molecular species.|$|E
25|$|Traveling {{wave tube}} {{amplifiers}} (TWTAs) {{are used for}} high power amplification at low microwave frequencies. They typically can amplify across {{a broad spectrum of}} frequencies; however, they are usually not as <b>tunable</b> as klystrons.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the drum}} sounds on the LM-1 were {{composed}} of two chips that were triggered at the same time, and each voice was individually <b>tunable</b> with individual outputs. Due to memory limitations, a crash cymbal sound was not available except as an expensive third-party modification. A cheaper version of the LM-1 was released in 1982 called the LinnDrum. Priced at $2,995, not all of its voices were <b>tunable,</b> but crash cymbal was included as a standard sound. Like its predecessor the LM-1, it featured swappable sound chips. The LinnDrum can be heard on records such as The Cars' Heartbeat City and Giorgio Moroder's soundtrack for the film Scarface.|$|E
25|$|Plasma polymer {{surfaces}} with <b>tunable</b> wettability and reversibly switchable pH-responsiveness {{have shown}} the promising prospects due to their unique property in applications, such as drug delivery, biomaterial engineering, oil/water separation processes, sensors, and biofuel cells.|$|E
25|$|The first {{instruments}} {{developed in}} the evolution of steelpan were Tamboo-Bamboos, <b>tunable</b> sticks made of bamboo wood. Tamboo-Bamboo bands also included percussion of a (gin) bottle and spoon. By the mid-1930s, bits of metal percussion were being used in the tamboo bamboo bands.|$|E
25|$|Carbide-derived carbon (CDC), {{also known}} as <b>tunable</b> {{nanoporous}} carbon, is a family of carbon materials derived from carbide precursors, such as binary silicon carbide and titanium carbide, that are transformed into pure carbon via physical (e.g., thermal decomposition) or chemical (e.g., halogenation) processes.|$|E
25|$|Even {{minor changes}} in the weather, {{physical}} layout or even bumping the chassis containing the <b>tunable</b> capacitors can cause the tuning to vary. For this reason a variety of systems were used to decrease {{the sensitivity of the}} radiogoniometer to mis-tuning. Primary among these was the aperiodic aerial concept, which described the mechanical layout of the radiogoniometer's internal wiring. By winding the sense coil wiring around a vertical cylinder, and wiring the field coils in a similar arrangement {{as close as possible to}} the sense coil, the entire circuit became capacitively coupled. A single <b>tunable</b> capacitor on the output from the sense coil could then be used to tune the entire system.|$|E
25|$|Statistics {{can be used}} to predicatively create art, as in the {{statistical}} or stochastic music invented by Iannis Xenakis, where the music is performance-specific. Though this type of artistry does not always come out as expected, it does behave in ways that are predictable and <b>tunable</b> using statistics.|$|E
25|$|Klystrons are {{specialized}} linear-beam vacuum-devices, {{designed to}} provide high power, widely <b>tunable</b> amplification of millimetre and sub-millimetre waves. Klystrons are designed for large scale operations and despite having a narrower bandwidth than TWTAs, they {{have the advantage of}} coherently amplifying a reference signal so its output may be precisely controlled in amplitude, frequency and phase.|$|E
25|$|These {{are used}} as voltage-controlled capacitors. These are {{important}} in PLL (phase-locked loop) and FLL (frequency-locked loop) circuits, allowing tuning circuits, {{such as those in}} television receivers, to lock quickly on to the frequency. They also enabled <b>tunable</b> oscillators in early discrete tuning of radios, where a cheap and stable, but fixed-frequency, crystal oscillator provided the reference frequency for a voltage-controlled oscillator.|$|E
25|$|Hieronymus {{subsequently}} designed solid-state {{versions of}} his Analyzers, substituting germanium transistors for crystal prisms and <b>tunable</b> capacitors for the rotating armature. He also {{designed and built}} various specialized devices designed for specific functions, including analysis of living organisms and production of homeopathic remedies. The most well-known Hieronymus Machine is the Eloptic Medical Analyzer, which supposedly analyzes and transmits eloptic energy to diagnose and treat medical conditions in plants and animals.|$|E
25|$|PZT {{thin films}} have {{attracted}} attention for {{applications such as}} force sensors, accelerometers, gyroscopes actuators, <b>tunable</b> optics, micro pumps, ferroelectric RAM, display systems and smart roads, when energy sources are limited, energy harvesting {{plays an important role}} in the environment. Smart roads have the potential to play an important role in power generation. Embedding piezoelectric material in the road can convert pressure exerted by moving vehicles into voltage and current.|$|E
25|$|In 2014 {{researchers}} {{proved that}} they can create electrically conductive thin films of MOFs (Cu3(BTC)2 (also known as HKUST-1; BTC, benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid) infiltrated with the molecule 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinododimethane) {{that could be used}} in applications including photovoltaics, sensors and electronic materials and a path towards creating semiconductors. The simulated matrices of 600 atoms. The team demonstrated <b>tunable,</b> air-stable electrical conductivity over six orders of magnitude, with values as high as 7 siemens per meter.|$|E
25|$|They {{dispensed}} with split-ring-resonators and instead used {{a network of}} L–C loaded transmission lines. In the metamaterial literature this became known as artificial transmission-line media. At that time it had the added advantage of being more compact than a unit made of wires and split ring resonators. The network was both scalable (from the megahertz to the tens of gigahertz range) and <b>tunable.</b> It also includes a method for focusing the wavelengths of interest.|$|E
25|$|Laser Spectroscopy (or Cavity ring-down spectroscopy, CRDS) {{is able to}} {{directly}} measure D/H, 17O/16O and 18O/16O isotope compositions in water or methane. The application of laser spectroscopy to hydrogen isotopes was first reported by Bergamaschi et al. in 1994.CH4/12CH4 and 12CH3D/12CH4 ratios in atmospheric methane sources {{by means of a}} long-path <b>tunable</b> diode laser absorption spectrometer|url=http://ao.osa.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ao-33-33-7704|journal=Applied Optics|volume=33|issue=33|doi=10.1364/AO.33.007704|pages=7704}} They directly measured 12CH3D/12CH4 in atmospheric methane using a lead salt <b>tunable</b> diode laser spectroscopy. The development of CRDS was first reported by O’Keefe et al. in 1988. In 1999, Kerstel et al. successfully applied this technique to determine D/H in water sample. The system consists of a laser and a cavity equipped with high finesse reflectivity mirrors. Laser light is injected into the cavity, at which the resonance takes place due to the constructive interference. The laser then is turn off. The decay of light intensity is measured. In the presence of a water sample, the photo-absorption by water isotopologues follows the kinetic law. The optical spectrum is obtained by recording ring-down time of the H2O spectral features of interest at certain laser wavelength. The concentration of each isotopologue is proportional to the area under each measured isotopologue spectral feature.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{based on}} a neuromimetic approach, a novel {{ingredient}} {{has been added to}} the field of quantum machine learning, {{in the form of a}} so-called quantum memristor, a quantized model of the standard classical memristor. This device can be constructed by means of a <b>tunable</b> resistor, weak measurements on the system, and a classical feed-forward mechanism. An implementation of a quantum memristor in superconducting circuits has been proposed, and an experiment with quantum dots performed. A quantum memristor would implement nonlinear interactions in the quantum dynamics which would aid the search for a fully functional quantum neural network.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} various {{attempts}} to find modifications to general relativity. The most famous of these are the Brans–Dicke theory (also known as scalar-tensor theory), and Rosen's bimetric theory. Both of these theories proposed changes to the field equations of general relativity, and both suffer from these changes permitting the presence of bipolar gravitational radiation. As a result, Rosen's original theory has been refuted by observations of binary pulsars. As for Brans–Dicke (which has a <b>tunable</b> parameter ω such that ω = ∞ {{is the same as}} general relativity), the amount by which it can differ from general relativity has been severely constrained by these observations.|$|E
25|$|Silk {{has been}} {{considered}} as a luxurious textile since 3630 BC. However, it started to serve also as a biomedical material for suture in surgeries decades ago. In the past 30 years, it has been widely studied and used as a biomaterial, which refers to materials used for medical applications in organisms, due to its excellent properties, including remarkable mechanical properties, comparative biocompatibility, <b>tunable</b> degradation rates in vitro and in vivo, the ease to load cellular growth factors (for example, BMP-2), {{and the ability to}} be processed into several other formats such as films, gels, particles, and scaffolds. Silks from Bombyx mori, a kind of cultivated silkworm, are the most widely investigated silks.|$|E
