Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur conceived {{the idea for the}} story, and asked Offerman whether he and Mullally would be opposed to her playing such a terrible character. Offerman was extremely responsive to the idea. Mullally said she enjoyed the script, particularly the dialogue of Ron describing Tammy, more than Tammy's part herself. Offerman and Mullally improvised many of their on-screen fights, as well as the varied methods of unusual kissing between the two characters. During the diner scene, in which Ron and Tammy switch between violent fighting and passionate kissing, Offerman accidentally pulled a diner table out of the wall after placing Mullally on top of it and kissing her.

500|$|Jake Coyle of the Associated Press {{was more}} {{critical}} of the film, calling it [...] "terribly overstuffed {{and many of the}} jokes get drowned out by the special effects... The pervasive movie references detract from the stab at freshness, and Guardians depends all too much on the whimsy of '70s anthems for an original beat." [...] He also felt that Close, Reilly and del Toro were underused in the film. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "In place of wit, Guardians offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits <b>that</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it. Everyone is clearly working, but nothing is really happening–and yet the effort is so evident that there's an impulse to reward it." [...] Kyle Smith of the New York Post also had a negative response to the film, comparing it to Howard the Duck and Green Lantern, and criticizing the dialogue, villains, soundtrack, lack of suspense, and the characters of Quill, Rocket, and Drax. The film received mixed reviews in China, where viewers complained that the film's [...] "poor subtitle translation not only spoiled the fun of watching it, but also made it difficult to understand its humor." ...|$|E

Handlen {{felt that the}} episode was not entirely cohesive and that its ending was somewhat disappointing, but felt that overall the episode's imagery made up for this—summing up this idea by saying [...] "Millennium often {{seems to be at}} its best when sense is a secondary consideration". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3.5 out of 5, noting that its [...] "atmospheric elements do not quite add up to a cohesive whole". Gibron felt that this resulted in [...] "an episode <b>that</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> the first half of a bad b-movie". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, awarded [...] "Beware of the Dog" [...] one-and-a-half stars out of five. Shearman felt the episode was so similar to The X-Files that it gave the impression that Millennium had [...] "lost its own identity". He found that the script contained [...] "enough wit in the dialogue" [...] but that its plot seemed too [...] "vague and elliptical". Writing for the Star Tribune, Bill Ward felt that the episode featured a [...] "lighter" [...] tone than usual, comparing it to The X-Files.

Although he was initially hesitant about returning to the series, he agreed to come back after developing a story with his brother and David S.

The Dark Knight Rises was released on 20 July 2012 to positive reviews; Andrew O'Hehir of Salon called it [...] "arguably the biggest, darkest, most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen", further describing the work as [...] "auteurist spectacle on a scale never before possible and never before attempted". Christy Lemire of The Associated Press wrote in her review that Nolan concluded his trilogy in a [...] "typically spectacular, ambitious fashion", but disliked the [...] "overloaded" [...] story and excessive grimness; [...] "This is the problem when you're an exceptional, visionary filmmaker. When you give people something extraordinary, they expect it every time. Anything short of <b>that</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> a letdown." [...] Like its predecessor it performed well at the box office, becoming the thirteenth film {{in the world to}} gross over $1-billion. During a midnight showing of the film at the Century 16 cinema in Aurora, Colorado, a gunman opened fire inside the theater, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others. Nolan released a statement to the press expressing his condolences for the victims of what he described as a senseless tragedy.|$|E
500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock and rap rock by professional reviewers.

He described the [...] "weak" [...] status of modern rock in the music industry as an inspiration in recording a heavier rock album; to try to bring the sound of the 1990s back to the forefront. Shinoda criticized the modern state of alternative radio, stating [...] "There’s so much stuff that sounds like HAIM or CHVRCHES or Vampire Weekend that I’m full. The thing I’m hungry for is not that. I turn on the rock station in L.A. and it sounds like Disney commercial music.” This led to a response from CHVRCHES, with their lead singer Lauren Mayberry calling Shinoda's comment [...] "a pointless dig." [...] Bennington agreed with Shinoda's comments, as he said, [...] "The bands I was listening to when I was growing up were all doing really innovative shit—Jane’s Addiction, Alice in Chains, Nirvana... Bands like the Refreshments and the Rembrandts, that music fucking angers me to this day.
