25|$|You {{are asking}} me to „voluntarily {{surrender}} the fortress; otherwise you will be corrected in front of God and humanity“. What a beautiful and humane sentence? Do you believe in God? I doubt <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in Him and that love humanity, if you would, then you wouldn't lead his unfortunate soldiers right here to a senseless slaughter, and to certain death, {{and you would have}} spared them, their wives and children, and made them to live quietly at home instead of having led them such a distance because of the pernicious whims of your king.|$|E
25|$|In short, I never yet {{encountered}} the mere mathematician {{who could be}} trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it {{as a point of}} his faith that x squared + px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> occasions may occur where x squared + px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.|$|E
500|$|... "This idea of The Fame {{runs through}} and through. Basically, {{if you have}} nothing—no money, no fame—you can still feel {{beautiful}} and dirty rich. It's about making choices, and having references—things you pull from your life <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in. It's about self-discovery and being creative. The record is slightly focused, but it's also eclectic. The music is intended to inspire people to feel a certain way about themselves, so they'll be able to encompass, in their own lives, a sense of inner fame that they can project to the world, and the carefree nature of the album {{is a reflection of}} that aura. I like to funnel interesting ideas {{to the rest of the}} world through a pop lens." ...|$|E

500|$|US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt {{also worked}} on Waller's behalf. Historian Richard B. Sherman states that she became {{involved}} {{after receiving a}} letter from Murray, which prompted her to write Governor Price requesting that he investigate whether Waller had received a fair trial and delay the execution. Roosevelt biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin, in contrast, holds that the First Lady intervened after receiving a handwritten note from Waller himself saying [...] "I have heard lots of people speak of what a nice lady {{you are and what}} I can hear is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in helping the poor ... Please write to the Governor and get him to have mercy on me and allow me a chance." [...] Whatever its beginnings, Roosevelt's involvement in the case caused her to be widely criticized in the white Southern press.|$|E
500|$|The sixth track, [...] "Criminal Intent" [...] {{features}} Robyn rapping, {{which was}} compared to the rapping style of musician Peaches. The song is about Robyn getting arrested for [...] "freaky dancing" [...] to her own song. Ben Norman of About.com called it [...] "a darker version of [...] previous rap songs". Comparisons were also drawn towards [...] "Fembot" [...] from Body Talk Pt. 1, and [...] "Piece of Me" [...] by Britney Spears. [...] "U Should Know Better" [...] featuring Snoop Dogg was called the album's highlight by several critics. It features Snoop Dogg rapping over an electro beat and Robyn delivering [...] "quotable, ridiculous lines", such as [...] "You know when in Rome I {{sat down with the}} Romans. Said we need a black Pope and she'd better be a woman." [...] Jaime Gill of BBC Music said that the song features [...] "the teen-pop singer and hip hop outlaw swapping louche quips over a relentless, grimy electro stomp." [...] The acoustic [...] "Indestructible" [...] reflects [...] "the downside of needing someone". Norman said that it [...] "is sweeping and symphonic and has so much vulnerability and strength in it <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> she really will love as if she is indestructible." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{production}} designer was Scott Chambliss, {{a longtime}} collaborator with Abrams. Chambliss {{worked with a}} large group of concept illustrators, including James Clyne, Ryan Church, creature designer Neville Page, and Star Trek veteran John Eaves. Abrams stated the difficulty of depicting the future was that much of modern technology was inspired by the original show, and made it seem outdated. Thus the production design had to be consistent with the television series but also feel more advanced than the real world technology developed after it. [...] "We all have the iPhone that does more than the communicator," [...] said Abrams. [...] "I feel like there's a certain thing that you can't really hold onto, which is kind of the kitschy quality. That must go if it's going to be something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> is real." [...] Prop master Russell Bobbitt collaborated with Nokia on recreating the original communicator, creating a $50,000 prototype. Another prop recreated for the film was the tricorder. Bobbitt brought the original prop to the set, but the actors found it too large to carry when filming action scenes, so technical advisor Doug Brody redesigned it to be smaller. The phaser props were designed as spring-triggered barrels that revolve and glow as the setting switches from [...] "stun" [...] to [...] "kill". An Aptera Typ-1 prototype car was used on location.|$|E

500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Howard Bryant in the Acknowledgments {{section of}} Juicing the Game, his 2005 book about steroids in baseball, said of Halberstam's assistance: [...] "He {{provided}} me with a succinct road map and the proper mind-set." [...] Bryant went on to quote Halberstam on how to tackle a controversial non-fiction subject: [...] "Think {{about three or four}} moments <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> {{to be the most important}} during your time frame. Then think about what the leadership did about it. It doesn't have to be complicated. What happened, and what did the leaders do about it? That's your book." ...|$|E

He was escorted on the death-walk by the prison chaplain, who was reading aloud from The Consolations of Religion about the fires of hell. Peace burst out [...] "Sir, if I believed what you and the church of God say <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe,</b> even if England were covered with broken glass from coast to coast, I would walk over it, if need be, on hands and knees and think it worth while living, just to save one soul from an eternal hell like that!" ...|$|E

I waited all day for the answer, and all the evening, and when night came and no letter I felt <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>believed</b> me guilty; I became desperate, and when Fred advised me to bolt, and offered me the money to take me away, I thought I {{might as well go}} at once as go after the disgrace of being publicly expelled before the whole school." ...|$|R
