They fortified the hill and surrounding areas, which served as an advance outpost <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> <b>the</b> 7th Infantry Division if the Chinese attacked. During this period, the fighting entered a lull, and troops resumed their rest and recuperation rotations. Allen, Pryor, and Freeman left on one such rotation with a number of men, leaving Queen and only 80 enlisted men on the hill.|$|E
40|$|The {{sophisticated}} user defense {{provides a}} defense to manufacturers in products liability failure <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> cases. <b>The</b> defense is {{premised on the}} theory that a manufacturer has no duty <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> users of <b>the</b> product who have the sophisticated knowledge necessary to understand the risks associated with use of the product. Courts are in disagreement, however, as to the validity of this defense in failure <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> actions. In this comment, the author traces the development of products liability law and analyzes the application of Restatement (Second) of Torts sections 388 and 402 A in failure <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> cases. <b>The</b> author discusses the use of the defense by asbestos manufacturers and examines the validity of the defense in Maryland. Finally, the author proposes the elimination of strict liability failure <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> actions...|$|R

Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, carries them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape, Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.|$|E
5|$|Fearing for {{the safety}} of his wife's {{relatives}} in San Antonio, Bowie invited her cousins Getrudis Navarro and Juana Navarro Alsbury, as well as Alsbury's 18-month-old son, Alijo Perez Jr., to stay inside the walls of the Alamo. Bowie also brought several black servants, some of whom worked at the Veramendi Palace, into the security of the Alamo fortress. Bowie had been ill, and twodoctors, including the fort surgeon, were unable to diagnose his illness. Travis became the sole commander of the forces when Bowie was confined to bed. Santa Anna and his army began a siege of the Alamo on February 24. The Mexican army raised a red flag <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> <b>the</b> defenders that no quarter would be given.|$|E
5|$|Seven more towers {{were built}} between 1637 and 1638.

In 1647, Saint Agatha's Tower was built in Mellieħa. This was a large tower intended as a strongpoint, and was built {{in the style of the}} Wignacourt towers. Two more towers were built at Dwejra and Xlendi on Gozo in 1650 and 1652.
