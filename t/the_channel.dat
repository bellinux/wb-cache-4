5|$|Alfred Godsal {{intended}} to swing Vindictive broadside on into <b>the</b> <b>channel</b> mouth, {{but as he}} ordered the turn, the right screw broke down completely, preventing the cruiser from fully turning. Before this was realised on the cruiser's bridge, a shell fired from a gun battery on shore struck Commander Godsal directly, killing him instantly and shattering the bridge structure. Most of the bridge crew were killed or wounded by the blast, including First Lieutenant Victor Crutchley, who staggered to the wheel and attempted to force the ship to make the full turn into <b>the</b> <b>channel.</b> The damaged propeller made this maneuver impossible and the drifting cruiser floated out of <b>the</b> <b>channel</b> and became stuck on a sandbank outside, only partially obscuring the entranceway.|$|E

5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal {{seemed to have been}} at least partially successful. <b>The</b> <b>channel</b> was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get through. In fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven optimistic and <b>the</b> <b>channel</b> there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through <b>the</b> <b>channel</b> as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks.|$|E
5|$|Directional {{anisotropy}} {{refers to}} a difference in diffusion mechanism or rate in a particular direction on a given crystallographic plane. These differences may {{be a result of}} either anisotropy in the surface lattice (e.g. a rectangular lattice) or the presence of steps on a surface. One of the more dramatic examples of directional anisotropy is the diffusion of adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc (110), where diffusion along <b>the</b> <b>channel</b> is much faster than diffusion across <b>the</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E

Two years later, she was rejoined <b>the</b> <b>Channel</b> Fleet {{before going to the}} Mediterranean in 1878.

Defence had brief tours on the North American and Mediterranean Stations, from 1869 to 1872 before she was refitted again from 1872 to 1874.
