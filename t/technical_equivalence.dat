50|$|As {{indicated}} above, {{the risk}} assessment of biocides in EU hinges {{for a large}} part {{by the development of}} specific emission scenario documents (ESDs) for each product type, which is essential for assessing its exposure of man and the environment. Such ESDs provide detailed scenarios to be used for an initial worse case exposure assessment and for subsequent refinements. ESDs are developed in close collaboration with the OECD Task Force on Biocides and the OECD Exposure Assessment Task Force and are publicly available from websites managed by the Joint Research Centre and OECD (see below). Once ESDs become available they are introduced in the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances (EUSES), an IT tool supporting the implementation of the risk assessment principles set in the Technical Guidance Document for the Risk Assessment of Biocides (TGD). EUSES enables government authorities, research institutes and chemical companies to carry out rapid and efficient assessments of the general risks posed by substances to man and the environment. Once a biocidal active substance is allowed onto the list of approved active substances, its specifications become a reference source of that active substance (so called 'reference active substance'). Thus, when an alternative source of that active substance appears (e.g. from a company that have not participated in the Review Programme of active substances) or when a change appears in the manufacturing location and/or manufacturing process of a reference active substance, then a <b>technical</b> <b>equivalence</b> between these different sources needs to be established with regard to the chemical composition and hazard profile. This is to check if the level of hazard posed to health and environment by the active substance from the secondary source is comparable to the initial assessed active substance.|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which two different modes of administration (interview by a trained interviewer versus self-administration) yielded a comparable estimate of health-related quality of life (HRQL) in pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients. Methods The study was conducted between September 1 st 2012 and July 31 st 2013, among consecutive PTB patients treated at Thoracic and Respiratory Disease Specialist Centre in Baghdad, Iraq. The mode of administration of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Tuberculosis (FACIT-TB); a new tuberculosis (TB) -specific instrument, at baseline was registered in 305 subjects. Results Although the FACIT-TB was designed for self-administration, most patients in our sample (N = 193, 63. 278 %) requested some help from the interviewer to fill out the questionnaire. Mann Whitney U test showed that those patients capable of self-administration were younger (38. 16 ± 12. 93 versus 43. 58 ± 16. 41 years, P = 0. 005) and required less time to complete the questionnaire compared to those who interviewed by a trained interviewer (14. 64 ± 3. 24 versus 17. 22 ± 2. 61 minutes, P 0. 05). Conclusions <b>Technical</b> <b>equivalence</b> has been demonstrated in the sample of PTB patients in Iraq.

The results were compared with previous studies based on light and transmission electron microscopic techniques. The integrated FESEM approach yielded the same quantitative results as the microscopic techniques used previously. Given this <b>technical</b> <b>equivalence,</b> the integrated approach offers several advantages. First, the single preparation method and detection system avoids interpretation discrepancies between corresponding areas that were examined for different properties with different detection techniques in different samples. Second, the specimen size suitable for whole particle study is virtually unlimited, which simplifies sectioning and puts less stringent demands on the embedding technique. Furthermore, the sensitivity toward enzyme presence and distribution increases because the epitopes inside thick sections become available for labeling.

40|$|The {{notion of}} Translation Equivalence is {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} most problematic and controversial areas in the field of translation theory. The term has caused, and it seems quite probable that it will continue to cause, heated debates within the field of translation studies. Equivalence, indeed, is a constitutive feature and the guiding principle of translation. As Catford points out, "the central problem of translation-practice is that of finding Target Language equivalents. A central task of translation theory is that of defining the nature and conditions of translation equivalence" (Catford 21 : 1965). In order to explore the realm of Translation Equivalence, I will try in this paper to point to the different methods used to achieve equivalence when translating an economic report entitled: Extralegality in Tunisia and the connection to the Arab Spring (2013) from English (L 3) into Arabic (L 1) and French (L 2). However, addressing non-equivalence in some cases, will pave the way for introducing several methods and procedures to overcome this problem.

40|$|AbstractIn an {{algebraic}} {{setting for}} parallelism and synchronisation due to R. Milner, we define {{a wide variety}} of synchronising operators on processes. We introduce them by the semantical conditional rules they obey. We prove they are higher-level nonprimitive operators from the original SCCS calculus, showing how to meet their behaviours with primitive expressions. Our purposes are: study of expressiveness—either ‘semantic’, in the realm of transition systems, or ‘syntaxic’, through translation of other formalisms in the calculus. Such operators allow one to specify formally sophisticated synchronisation modes dealing with (operational) products and transformations of transition systems, and still not lose their informal appealing intuition; for we then forget the realisation working with Meije-SCCS elementary synchronisation mechanisms (the mechanics below the hood). The defining rules are syntactically given, except for the allowed relations on the components' actions monoids. This ‘semantical’ aspect allows us to treat many ‘calculability’ issues. This is especially true of closed terms, where we may claim constructive ‘universality’ amongst transition systems. The case of operators seems slightly more intricate. The proof of our main result has led us to a <b>technical</b> shaping of <b>equivalence</b> proofs for open expressions which shows to be interesting in its own right...|$|R
40|$|Synchronous {{reactive}} formalisms form {{an appealing}} programming model for embedded system and Systems-on-Chip (SoC) design. Deploying synchronous programs onto asynchronous distributed execution platforms {{is an important}} issue, and has been the topic of substantial research in the past. The point is that signal/event absence in a reaction cannot be taken as granted because of communication latencies. A simple solution consists in systematically sending signal absence notifications, but it is unduly expensive at run-time. Sufficient properties have been proposed defining subsets of synchronous programs where asynchronous evaluation is faithful to their original specification. In essence they aim at preserving stream computation monotonicity, in the original formulation of Kahn Network principles, or confluence, as coined by R. Milner. Some of these criteria may become quite involved. In the current paper we show a precise <b>technical</b> result: If <b>equivalence</b> between the synchronous and the asynchronous semantics is congruence with respect to parallel constructors, then the "good" criterion amounts to a single step "diamond closure" property, with independent behaviors converging to the union of their effects. It should be remembered here that the local individual behaviors of components may themselves contain simultaneous events, thereby allowing complex synchronous modeling on this lower layer...|$|R

Design An approach involving a systematic translation process, expert review by experienced researchers and a review by ‘patient' experts involving the use of content validity indexing techniques with chance correction. Setting Five European countries where Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian and Polish are spoken. Participants ‘Patient' experts who had recently experienced a hospitalization in the participating country. Main OutcomeMeasure(s) Content validity indexing with chance correction adjustment providing a quantifiable measure that evaluates the conceptual, contextual, content, semantic and <b>technical</b> <b>equivalence</b> of the instrument in relationship to the patient care experience. Results All translations except two received ‘excellent' ratings and no significant differences existed between scores for languages spoken in more than one country. Patient raters across all countries expressed different concerns about some of the demographic questions and their relevance for evaluating patient satisfaction. Removing demographic questions from the evaluation produced a significant improvement in the scale-level scores (P=. 018). The cross-cultural evaluation process suggested that translations and content of the patient satisfaction survey were relevant across countries and languages.

40|$|Objective  To {{identify}} {{the most appropriate}} generic instrument to measure experience and/or satisfaction of people receiving integrated chronic care. Background  Health care is becoming more user-centred and, as a result, the experience of users of care and evaluation of their experience and/or satisfaction is taken more seriously. It is unclear to what extent existing instruments are appropriate in measuring the experience and/or satisfaction of people using integrated chronic care. Methods  Instruments were identified {{by means of a}} systematic literature review. Appropriateness of instruments was analysed on seven criteria. The two most promising instruments were translated into Dutch, if necessary, and administered to a convenience sample of 109 people with a chronic illness. Data derived from respondents were analysed statistically. Focus-group interviews were conducted to assess the semantic and <b>technical</b> <b>equivalence</b> as well as opinions of people about the applicability and relevance of the translated instruments. Results  From 37 instruments identified, the Patients’ Assessment of Care for chronIc Conditions (PACIC) and the short form of the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire III (PSQ- 18) were selected as most promising instruments. Both instruments produced similar median scores across people with different chronic conditions. The overall PACIC and its subscales and the overall PSQ- 18 were highly internally consistent, but not the PSQ- 18 subscales. Overall, the PACIC demonstrated better psychometric characteristics. PACIC and PSQ- 18 scores were found to be moderately correlated. Whereas more respondents preferred the PSQ- 18, focus-group participants regarded the PACIC to be more applicable and relevant. The technical and semantic equivalence of both instruments were sufficient. Conclusions  Because of its psychometric characteristics, perceived applicability and relevance, the PACIC is the most appropriate instrument to measure the experience of people receiving integrated chronic car...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four essays covering topics about existence and uniqueness of solutions of strategic games. The first essay characterizes uniqueness conditions for rationalizable strategies. In general, rationalizability is a weaker solution concept than equilibrium concepts; however, games with a unique rationalizable strategy admit a very robust strategic solution since players can arrive at this solution by following some internal process of reasoning that excludes unreasonable strategy choices. The main result shows that rationalizable strategies are unique if players best response functions satisfy particular contraction properties. The second essay applies these theoretical findings to Cournot oligopolies where firms compete via output decisions. In standard models of Cournot oligopoly virtually any output decision of a firm is rationalizable but, as my results show, uniqueness may already obtain under slight and realistic changes in the model parameters. In the third essay I investigate existence of strategic solutions {{under the assumption that}} players rather behave as so-called security- and potential level decision makers than as expected utility maximizers. Since security- and potential level preferences require discontinuous utility representations standard existence results for Nash equilibrium points and for equilibria in beliefs do not any longer apply. It turns out that existence of equilibria may fail in finite games whereas there always exist rationalizable strategies. Finally, the fourth essay deals with <b>technical</b> questions concerning <b>equivalence</b> of several rationalizability concepts, which differ by their definition of unreasonable strategies...|$|R
40|$|We {{perform a}} {{canonical}} quantization of pure gravity on AdS 3 using as a <b>technical</b> tool its <b>equivalence</b> at the classical level with a Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SL(2,R) xSL(2,R). We first quantize the theory canonically on an asymptotically AdS space [...] which is topologically the real line times a Riemann surface with one connected boundary. Using the "constrain first" approach we reduce canonical quantization to quantization of orbits of the Virasoro group and Kaehler quantization of Teichmuller space. After explicitly computing the Kaehler {{form for the}} torus with one boundary component and after extending that result to higher genus, we recover known results, such as that wave functions of SL(2,R) Chern-Simons theory are conformal blocks. We find new restrictions on the Hilbert space of pure gravity by imposing invariance under large diffeomorphisms and normalizability of the wave function. The Hilbert space of pure gravity is shown to be the target space of Conformal Field Theories with continuous spectrum and a lower bound on operator dimensions. A projection defined by topology changing amplitudes in Euclidean gravity is proposed. It defines an invariant subspace that allows for a dual interpretation {{in terms of a}} Liouville CFT. Problems and features of the CFT dual are assessed and a new definition of the Hilbert space, exempt from those problems, is proposed in the case of highly-curved AdS 3. Comment: 61 pages, 7 figures.

40|$|How to {{generate}} provably true randomness with minimal assumptions? This question {{is important not}} only for the efficiency and the security of information processing, but also for understanding how extremely unpredictable events are possible in Nature. All current solutions require special structures in the initial source of randomness, or a certain independence relation among two or more sources. Both types of assumptions are impossible to test and difficult to guarantee in practice. Here we show how this fundamental limit can be circumvented by extractors that base security on the validity of physical laws and extract randomness from untrusted quantum devices. In conjunction with the recent work of Miller and Shi (arXiv: 1402 : 0489), our physical randomness extractor uses just a single and general weak source, produces an arbitrarily long and near-uniform output, with a close-to-optimal error, secure against all-powerful quantum adversaries, and tolerating a constant level of implementation imprecision. The source necessarily needs to be unpredictable to the devices, but otherwise can even be known to the adversary. Our central <b>technical</b> contribution, the <b>Equivalence</b> Lemma, provides a general principle for proving composition security of untrusted-device protocols. It implies that unbounded randomness expansion can be achieved simply by cross-feeding any two expansion protocols. In particular, such an unbounded expansion can be made robust, which is known for the first time. Another significant implication is, it enables the secure randomness generation and key distribution using public randomness, such as that broadcast by NIST's Randomness Beacon. Our protocol also provides a method for refuting local hidden variable theories under a weak assumption on the available randomness for choosing the measurement settings.

40|$|Introduction: In Pakistan {{there is}} dearth of {{research}} on deliberate self-harm (DSH) and its predictors among adolescents. While the lack of research in Pakistan can be partly attributed to the sacrilegious status, criminalization and stigmatization attached to DSH, {{it is also an}} attribute of paucity of Urdu versions of the standardized psychological instruments. Previous research in developed countries has indicated that attachment theory {{can be used as a}} useful framework to understand the development of austere psychopathologies like DSH, as well as for studying pathways of interaction of interpersonal and intrapersonal factors of psychopathologies. In this study, standardized psychological instruments are translated into Urdu language as a first step. These instruments are then used to study pathways of interaction of interpersonal and intrapersonal factors of DSH, conceptualized within attachment framework. Method: The study was conducted in two steps. In step 1, Youth Health Risk Behavior Survey (YHRB), Inventory of Interpersonal Problems- 32 (IIP- 32) and Significant Others Scale (SOS), were translated into Urdu language. Along with these scales, Urdu translated versions of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Adolescent Relationship Scales Questionnaire (ARSQ), Life Events scale (LES) from CASE questionnaire and Family Affluence Scale-II (FAS-II) were reviewed for accuracy of translation through expert judgement and psychometric evaluation. Secondly, a cross sectional survey was conducted with 1290 adolescents (10 - 19 years age) using the translated Urdu versions of the instruments and demographic pro forma. Structural equation modelling was used to study the pathways of associations between predictors of DSH. Results: The extensive process of translation resulted in establishment of semantic, content, <b>technical</b> and construct <b>equivalence</b> of the translated instruments with the original English versions. Multiple imputation was performed to account for missing values in SPSS 20. Important structural adaptations were made in the scales based on factor analyses conducted in M plus.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{recognition}} {{of the burden of}} disease due to mood disorders in low- and middle-income countries, {{there is a lack of}} consensus on best practices for detecting depression. Self-report screening tools, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9), require modification for low literacy populations and to assure cultural and clinical validity. An alternative approach is to employ idioms of distress that are locally salient, but these are not synonymous with psychiatric categories. Therefore, our objectives were to evaluate the validity of the PHQ- 9, assess the added value of using idioms of distress, and develop an algorithm for depression detection in primary care. METHODS: We conducted a transcultural translation of the PHQ- 9 in Nepal using qualitative methods to achieve semantic, content, <b>technical,</b> and criterion <b>equivalence.</b> Researchers administered the Nepali PHQ- 9 to randomly selected patients in a rural primary health care center. Trained psychosocial counselors administered a validated Nepali depression module of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to validate the Nepali PHQ- 9. Patients were also assessed for local idioms of distress including heart-mind problems (Nepali, manko samasya). RESULTS: Among 125 primary care patients, 17 (14 %) were positive for a major depressive episode in the prior 2 weeks based on CIDI administration. With a Nepali PHQ- 9 cutoff ≥ 10 : sensitivity = 0. 94, specificity = 0. 80, positive predictive value (PPV) = 0. 42, negative predictive value (NPV) = 0. 99, positive likelihood ratio = 4. 62, and negative likelihood ratio = 0. 07. For heart-mind problems: sensitivity = 0. 94, specificity = 0. 27, PPV = 0. 17, NPV = 0. 97. With an algorithm comprising two screening questions (1. presence of heart-mind problems and 2. function impairment due to heart-mind problems) to determine who should receive the full PHQ- 9, the number of patients requiring administration of the PHQ- 9 could be reduced by 50 %, PHQ- 9 false positives would be reduced by 18 %, and 88 % of patients with depression would be correctly identified. CONCLUSION: Combining idioms of distress with a transculturally-translated depression screener increases efficiency and maintains accuracy for high levels of detection. The algorithm reduces the time needed for primary healthcare staff to verbally administer the tool for patients with limited literacy. The burden of false positives is comparable to rates in high-income countries and is a limitation for universal primary care screening...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the EU agri-food system {{has been driven by}} modernization and industrialization of food production, processing and distribution, the standardization of the food supply and the globalization of food markets, but also by consumer demand for quality food linked to different strategies in order to valorize local and/or regional food products. The primary aim of this thesis was to evaluate the interaction between producers, consumers and main organic standards, as drivers of the organic food geography at local and global scales, using organic certification as the underpinning theme. The approach taken adopts some of the core elements of quality conventions theory in order to understand at the global scale the quality conventions that establish “orders of worth. ” These orders of worth are subjected to a reality test through a rigorous evaluation of EU-US equivalence agreements with respect to organic standards and their possible implications for the local scale. At a local level, the research focused on “socially constructed criteria” from the communication between farmers and consumers that support “trust in organic farmers” as well as the market strategies used by organic producers for addressing consumer expectation on the quality of food produced. At the global level, it seems that in this reconfiguration of the global space there are forces, probably from corporate interests, that are being imposed over the <b>technical</b> process of <b>equivalence,</b> as revealed {{by the fact that the}} USDA and the EU organic regulations are not equivalent at all. The research concludes that equivalence agreements could facilitate market access for exporters, but not necessarily guarantee genuine organic quality to consumers. At a local level, I found a lack of effective ‘connection’ between producers and consumers for organic beef in Spain. The failure to develop and maintain this direct connection means that the producer does not receive consumer feedback on the meat attributes which consumers most appreciate. For producers such feedback could provide them with very important information such as locality, price, taste, and freshness that play an important role in the distinctiveness of organic over conventional products. My research revealed an urgent need to reconfigure this relationship, as building a trustworthy relationship with consumers is essential not only for conducting business but for the development and maintenance of an efficient and sustainable organic food network...|$|R
