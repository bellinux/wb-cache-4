25|$|Critics {{argued that}} some {{politicians}} supporting the War on Terror {{are motivated by}} reasons other than those they publicly state. Others accuse those politicians of cynically misleading the public to achieve their own ends. For instance, {{in the months leading}} up to the invasion of Iraq, President Bush and members of his administration indicated that they possessed information which demonstrated a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. Published reports of the links began in late December 1998. In January 1999, Newsweek magazine published a story about Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda joining forces to attack U.S. interests in the Gulf Region. ABC News broadcast a story of this link soon after. Polls suggested that a majority of Americans believed <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> linked to the attacks of September 11, 2001. However, despite shifting public opinion, the Bush Administration believed that there was the possibility of a potential collaboration between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime following the U.S. led invasion of Afghanistan.|$|E
500|$|Biden {{had voted}} against {{authorization}} for the Gulf War in 1991, siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators; {{he said the}} U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition. [...] Biden was {{a strong supporter of}} the 2001 war in Afghanistan, saying [...] "Whatever it takes, we should do it." [...] Regarding Iraq, Biden stated in 2002 <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> a threat to national security, {{and that there was no}} option but to eliminate that threat. In October 2002, Biden voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, justifying the Iraq War. [...] While he soon became a critic of the war and viewed his vote as a [...] "mistake", he did not push to require a U.S. withdrawal. [...] He supported the appropriations to pay for the occupation, but argued repeatedly that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should [...] "level with the American people" [...] about the cost and length of the conflict.|$|E

The Swiss {{government did not}} take up this proposal. After the 2003 invasion, Ziegler accused British and American forces of using water and food as weapons of war in Iraqi cities under attack by insurgents, to encourage civilians to flee.|$|R

2500|$|On {{the early}} morning of 19 March 2003, U.S. forces {{abandoned}} the plan for initial, non-nuclear decapitation strikes against 55 top Iraqi officials, in light of reports <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> visiting his sons, Uday and Qusay, at Dora Farms, within the al-Dora farming community {{on the outskirts of}} Baghdad. At approximately 05:30 UTC, two F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighters from the 8th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron dropped four enhanced, satellite-guided 2,000-pound GBU-27 'Bunker Busters' on the compound. Complementing the aerial bombardment were nearly 40 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from at least four ships, including the [...] , credited with the first to strike, [...] , and two submarines in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2002, a {{representative}} of the head of Iraqi Intelligence, the General Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, contacted former Central Intelligence Agency Counterterrorism Department head Vincent Cannistraro stating that Saddam [...] "knew there was a campaign to link him to 11 September and prove he {{had weapons of mass destruction}} (WMDs)." [...] Cannistraro further added that [...] "the Iraqis were prepared to satisfy these concerns. I reported the conversation to senior levels of the state department and I was told to stand aside and they would handle it." [...] Cannistraro stated that the offers made were all [...] "killed" [...] by the George W. Bush administration because they allowed Saddam to remain in power, an outcome viewed as unacceptable. It has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> prepared to go into exile if allowed to keep $1 billion USD.|$|E

5000|$|According to Mother Jones, [...] "The {{impact of}} the article ... was immediate: Op-eds ran in major papers, and the story {{was taken to a}} wider {{audience}} through cable-TV talk shows. When Condoleezza Rice, then George W. Bush's national security adviser, was asked about the story at a press briefing, she said, 'I think it surprises no one <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>is</b> engaged in all kinds of activities that are destabilizing.'" [...] As late as 2006, conservative magazines including The Weekly Standard and National Review continued to use the story to justify the invasion of Iraq.|$|R

2500|$|A chart {{battle between}} Blur and Oasis dubbed [...] "The Battle of Britpop" [...] brought Britpop to the {{forefront}} of the British press in 1995. The bands had initially praised each other but {{over the course of the}} year antagonisms between the two increased. Spurred on by the media, the groups became engaged in what the NME dubbed on the cover of its 12 August issue the [...] "British Heavyweight Championship" [...] with the pending release of Oasis' single [...] "Roll with It", and Blur's [...] "Country House" [...] on the same day. The battle pitted the two bands against each other, with the conflict as much about British class and regional divisions as it was about music. Oasis were taken as representing the North of England, while Blur represented the South. The event caught the public's imagination and gained mass media attention in national newspapers, tabloids, and even the BBC News. The NME wrote about the phenomenon, [...] "Yes, in a week where news leaked <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> preparing nuclear weapons, everyday folks were still getting slaughtered in Bosnia and Mike Tyson was making his comeback, tabloids and broadsheets alike went Britpop crazy." [...] Blur won the battle of the bands, selling 274,000 copies to Oasis' 216,000 - the songs charting at number one and number two respectively. However, in the long run Oasis became more commercially successful than Blur. Unlike Blur, Oasis were able to achieve sustained sales in the United States thanks to the singles [...] "Wonderwall" [...] and [...] "Champagne Supernova". Oasis's second album (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995) eventually sold over four million copies in the UK, becoming the third best-selling album in British history. These subsequent successes led some members of the press to state in later years that Oasis [...] "lost the battle but won the war." ...|$|E

5000|$|In October 2002, he {{presented}} {{what he believed}} were the primary arguments for and against the war, writing, [...] "Hawks favor war on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>is</b> reckless, tyrannical and instinctively aggressive, and that if he comes into possession of nuclear weapons {{in addition to the}} weapons of mass destruction he already has, he is likely to use them or share them with terrorists. The threat of mass death on a scale never before seen residing in the hands of an unstable madman is intolerable - and must be preempted. Doves oppose war on the grounds that the risks exceed the gains. War with Iraq could be very costly, possibly degenerating into urban warfare." ...|$|R

50|$|In 2002, the United States {{began to}} {{campaign}} for the overthrow of Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein. The United States, under the administration of George W. Bush, argued <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> a threat to global peace, a vicious tyrant, and a sponsor of international terrorism.|$|E
25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern is if we continue to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> doesn't understand <b>that</b> President Bush is dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this <b>is</b> the direction <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>is</b> heading.|$|R

5000|$|The Bush administration's overall {{rationale}} for the invasion of Iraq was presented in detail by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell to the United Nations Security Council on 5 February 2003. In summary, he stated, We know <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>is</b> determined to keep {{his weapons of mass}} destruction; he's determined to make more. Given Saddam Hussein's history of aggression ... given what we know of his terrorist associations and given his determination to exact revenge on those who oppose him, should we take the risk that he will not some day use these weapons at a time and the place and in the manner of his choosing {{at a time when the}} world is in a much weaker position to respond? The United States will not and cannot run that risk to the American people. Leaving <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> in possession of weapons of mass destruction for a few more months or years is not an option, not in a post-September 11 world.|$|R
5000|$|... 67% of Fox viewers erroneously {{believed}} that the [...] "U.S. has found clear evidence in Iraq <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> {{working closely with the}} al Qaeda terrorist organization" [...] (compared with 56% for CBS, 49% for NBC, 48% for CNN, 45% for ABC, 16% for NPR/PBS).|$|E
5000|$|Immediately {{after the}} attacks, rumors began that Iraq {{could have played}} a role. The state-run Iraqi media praised the attacks but denied that Iraq was responsible.

50|$|However, the United Arab Emirates, by {{the late}} 1990s, told U.S. {{officials}} that they thought <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> meeting his international obligations and that containment of Iraq was no longer necessary.

5000|$|Prior to the 2003 Iraq War, {{she took}} a {{position}} on the alleged threat posed by <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> For example, in an interview with Tony Snow on a February 23, 2003 episode of Fox News Sunday, Garofalo said of the Iraqi dictator: [...] Yes, I think lots of people are eager to obtain weapons of mass destruction. But there's no evidence that he (Hussein) has weapons of mass destruction. There's been no evidence of him testing nuclear weapons. We have people that are in our face with nuclear weapons. We've got Iran and North Korea. We've got a problem with Pakistan. You know, I don't know what to say about that. There's {{a whole lot of people}} that are going nuclear. And I think <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>is</b> actually, with the evidence, the least able to use nuclear weapons and the least obvious offender in that area at this moment.

Clinton replaced Deutch after he had won re-election.|$|E
5000|$|Conclusion 1: The CIA's {{assessment}} that Iraq and al-Qaeda were [...] "two independent actors trying to exploit each other" [...] was accurate only about al-Qaeda. [...] "Postwar findings indicate <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> distrustful of al-Qa'ida and viewed Islamic extremists {{as a threat}} to his regime, refusing all requests from al-Qa'ida to provide material or operational support." ...|$|E
5000|$|As late as January 20, 2011, Lieberman [...] "continued {{to insist}} <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>was</b> {{developing}} {{weapons of mass}} destruction even though none were ever found after the invasion of Iraq," [...] and [...] "also said that despite the enormous cost to the U.S. in blood, prestige and treasure he does not regret his vote for war and would do it all over again." ...|$|E
5000|$|Leon Jaroff, in Time, {{pointed out}} that the Jamison twins were also {{frequently}} incorrect.
