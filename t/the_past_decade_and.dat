5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of {{research has been done}} at Mount Baker over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decade,</b> <b>and</b> it is now among the most-studied of the Cascade volcanoes. Recent and ongoing projects include gravimetric and GPS-based geodetic monitoring, fumarole gas sampling, tephra distribution mapping, new interpretations of the Schriebers Meadow lava flow, and hazards analyses. Mapping of Carmelo and Sherman craters, and interpretations of the eruptive history, continues, as well. The Mount Baker Volcano Research Center maintains an online archive of abstracts of this work, and an extensive references list, as well as photos.|$|E

At the end of 2012, a poll undertaken by 60 Minutes and Vanity Fair named 30 Rock the seventh greatest sitcom of all time. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America named 30 Rock as one of the best-written television series of all time, ranking it at 21st place.|$|E
5|$|Markets for second-generation {{technologies}} have been strong and growing over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decade,</b> <b>and</b> these {{technologies have}} gone from being {{a passion for the}} dedicated few to a major economic sector in countries such as Germany, Spain, the United States, and Japan. Many large industrial companies and financial institutions are involved and the challenge is to broaden the market base for continued growth worldwide.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Ralph Friedgen {{took over}} a Maryland team that had one winning season in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decade,</b> <b>and</b> led them to an ACC {{championship}} and a Bowl Championship Series (BCS) game in his first season. In the following two years, Friedgen became the only ACC head coach to have led his team to win ten games {{in each of his}} first three seasons. In his ten-year tenure, Friedgen led the Terrapins to seven bowl appearances. Most recently, Maryland concluded the 2010 season with a 9-4 record, a win in the Military Bowl, and a top 25 national ranking.|$|E
5|$|During the 1929 {{stock market}} crash and {{subsequent}} economic depression, not a single San Francisco-based bank failed, while the region attempted to spur job growth by simultaneously undertaking two large infrastructure projects: construction of the Golden Gate Bridge, which would connect San Francisco with Marin County, and the Bay Bridge, which would connect San Francisco with Oakland and the East Bay. After the United States joined World War II in 1941, the Bay Area became a major domestic military and naval hub, with large shipyards constructed in Sausalito and across the East Bay to build ships for the war effort, and Fort Mason acting the primary port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater of Operations. After the war, the United Nations was chartered in San Francisco to help prevent the kind of devastation that occurred over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decade,</b> <b>and</b> on September 1951, Japan officially surrendered to the Allied forces in San Francisco, with the Treaty of San Francisco entering into force a year later. In the years immediately following the war, the Bay Area saw a huge wave of immigration as populations increased across the region. Between 1950 and 1960, San Francisco welcomed over 100,000 new residents, inland suburbs in the East Bay saw their populations double, Daly City's population quadrupled, and Santa Clara's population quintupled.|$|E
5|$|Heathrow is {{the largest}} airport in the country, {{handling}} over 67million terminal passengers in 2006, making it the third busiest airport in the world, and the busiest if measured {{by the number of}} international passengers. Nearly a third of all overseas residents visiting the UK enter the country via this airport, which also handles more than a fifth of all overseas visits by UK residents. Even though there are no dedicated freight services operating out of Heathrow, the practise of transporting cargo in the holds of passenger aircraft means that this airport still accounts {{for more than half of}} all freight handled by UK airports. Gatwick airport, with 34million terminal passengers, is the second largest in the country, eighth busiest in the world for international passenger traffic, and lays claim to the busiest single runway airport in the world. Between them the five London airports handle nearly 137million terminal passengers, 59 per cent of the national total. Stansted and East Midlands airports have both experienced large growth in freight handling over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decade,</b> <b>and</b> these two airports are the major hubs for express freight operations.|$|E

25|$|Shale gas {{is natural}} gas {{produced}} from shale, {{a type of}} sedimentary rock. Shale gas has become an increasingly important source of natural gas in the United States over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decade,</b> <b>and</b> interest has spread to potential gas shales in Canada, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

25|$|The anti-religious {{campaign}} of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> the terror {{tactics of the}} militantly atheist regime, had effectively eliminated all public expressions of religion and communal gatherings of believers outside of {{the walls of the}} few churches (or mosques, synagogues, etc.) that still held services.

25|$|Whisky is {{probably}} the best known of Scotland's manufactured products.

50|$|The {{settlement}} is mentioned in three Venetian census reports.

25|$|From 1911 the {{government}} required {{the company to}} establish a fund which would aid the workers should the company go bankrupt. This was introduced after several large industrial companies had collapsed in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> large costs had befallen the state. Just as the first expansion was competed, Sydvaranger decided that it needed to further expand its export capacity to 650,000 tonnes. Financing was secured through issuing new shares worth NOK3million. Investments included a new steam shovel, three steam cranes, three locomotives, a new briquetting plant; the work was completed in 1913. In 1913 the company had 1,150 employees.|$|E
