The rapid rates of heating and nanoscale dimensions require accurate modeling of thermal transport phenomena in the constituent materials. This motivates improved understanding of the thermal properties of Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (GST) thin films and PCM electrode materials.

The steady-state controlling power supplied to the hot plate, the area and thickness of samples, and the temperature drop across the samples are then used in a simple calculation of the thermal conductance.

The diffusive-ballistic nature of heat conduction in finite-length single-walled carbon nanotubes is discussed. The length dependence of thermal conductivity [1] is quantified {{for a range of}} nanotube lengths up to 1. 6 μm at room temperature. A gradual transition from nearly pure ballistic to diffusive-ballistic heat conduction was identified from the thermal conductivity profile. In the diffusive-ballistic regime, the profile exhibits power-law length dependence and does not converge even for a tube length of 1. 6 μm [2]. The diffusive-ballistic phonon transport regime covers a wide range of nanotube-lengths in actual applications due to the extraordinary long phonon mean free path at room temperature. Here, the total thermal resistance between high-temperature thermal bath and low-temperature bath are separated into the diffusive thermal resistance of nanotube and two <b>thermal</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>resistances</b> between <b>thermal</b> baths and nanotube.

In this work we show that, {{in the presence of}} a local heat source in the active region, the temperature of the laser structure, calculated using finite element methods, is very inhomogeneously distributed among the different layers forming the device. This is due to the impact that the low dimensionality and the <b>thermal</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>resistances</b> have on the thermal transport across the laser structure.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semiclassical {{model for the}} anisotropic thermal transport in III-V semiconductor superlattices (SLs). An effective interface rms roughness is the only adjustable parameter. Thermal transport inside a layer is described by the Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time approximation and {{is affected by the}} relevant scattering mechanisms (three-phonon, mass-difference, and dopant and electron scattering of phonons), as well as by diffuse scattering from the interfaces captured via an effective interface scattering rate. The in-plane thermal conductivity is obtained from the layer conductivities connected in parallel. The cross-plane thermal conductivity is calculated from the layer thermal conductivities in series with one another and with <b>thermal</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>resistances</b> (TBRs) associated with each interface; the TBRs dominate cross-plane transport. The TBR of each interface is calculated from the transmission coefficient obtained by interpolating between the acoustic mismatch model (AMM) and the diffuse mismatch model (DMM), where the weight of the AMM transmission coefficient is the same wavelength-dependent specularity parameter related to the effective interface rms roughness that is commonly used to describe diffuse interface scattering. The model is applied to multiple III-arsenide superlattices, and the results are in very good agreement with experimental findings. The method is both simple and accurate, easy to implement, and applicable to complicated SL systems, such as the active regions of quantum cascade lasers. It is also valid for other SL material systems with high-quality interfaces and predominantly incoherent phonon transport. Comment: Manuscript (9 pages) plus supplementary materials (6 pages...|$|R

Despite recent important advances in the development of CNT purity assessment tools and atomic resolution imaging of individual nanotubes by scanning tunnelling microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, the macroscale assessment of the overall surface qualities of commercial CNT materials remains a great challenge. The lack of quantitative measurement technology to characterize and compare the surface qualities of bulk manufactured and engineered CNT materials has negative impacts on the reliable and consistent nanomanufacturing of CNT products In this paper we show how photothermal and photoacoustic techniques represent useful non-destructive tools to study the thermal properties of carbon nanotubes films. The photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) is used for a direct measurement of the absorbance spectra of CNT showing many advantages with respect to the standard optical spectra measurements which are usually affected by relevant scattering phenomena. We applied PAS in the UV/VIS range from 250 to 650 nm by using 400 W Arc Xe lamp.
