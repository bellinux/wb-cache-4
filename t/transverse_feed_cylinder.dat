40|$|This thesis report investigates how the {{parameters}} of friction stir welding tools {{affect the quality of}} welds. Specifically, the joining of 5 mm 6061 -T 6 aluminium alloy with four different tools was carried out and a relationship between tool parameters and weld quality was then determined. The four types of tools include; a flat shoulder with cylindrical threaded pin, flat shoulder with triangular pin, spiral shoulder with threaded triflute pin and concave shoulder with threaded pin. The design of the friction stir welding tools are based on literature reviewed. To analyse the quality of the welds microstructure, bend and hardness tests were conducted. The experimental setup consists of a milling machine with an adjustable spindle speed and <b>transverse</b> <b>feed</b> rate which was used to undertake friction stir welding. The welding parameters of spindle speed and <b>transverse</b> <b>feed</b> rate were kept constant throughout testing which allows only the tool geometry to affect the outcome of the welds. Welds made with the triflute, cylindrical and concave tools were of a satisfactory condition whereas the triangular tool failed. Results from post weld analysis indicate that the triflute and concave tools have a coarse grain microstructure which leads to a lower hardness and a more ductile failure during the bend test. The cylindrical tool resulted in a fine grained microstructure and thus has a higher hardness and brittle failure. The triangular tool failed to produce a satisfactory weld due to failure in the pin which sheared off. Micro crack defects were found in all weld samples as well as a wormhole in welds made using the cylindrical tool and lack of root penetration with the triflute tool...|$|R

The lead angle of helical motion is only related to the speed ratio of rotational and linear motion.

50|$|The use of straight-five petrol {{engines in}} mass {{production}} cars only became truly viable {{with the advent}} of reliable fuel injection. A five-cylinder engine using a carburetor fuel system has an unavoidable problem in that the length of the inlet manifold between the carburetor varies too greatly between cylinders at the ends of the engine and those nearer the carburetor for reliable and consistent fuel delivery. Using multiple carburetors (two or three) always results in one carburetor <b>feeding</b> more <b>cylinders</b> than the other, which also produces running and tuning problems. In theory individual carburetors could be used for each cylinder, but this approach is expensive and still brings with it the attendant difficulties in balancing the multiple carbs. Multi-point fuel injection circumvents all the above problems by <b>feeding</b> each <b>cylinder</b> individually from a central, single pump. This fueling issue was never present in diesel engines (except the Volvo D5) which used fuel injection from the very start, which is why large five-cylinder diesels were commonly seen decades before the type's adoption for automotive use.|$|R

40|$|Paired {{polishing}} process (PPP) is {{a variant}} of the chemical mechanical polishing process which facilitates defect mitigation via minimization of maximum force as well as effective planarization via profile driven determination of force gradient. The present embodiment of PPP machine employs two polishing wheels, radially spanning the wafer surface on a counter-gimbaled base. The PPP machine is deployed to experimentally investigate the role of the process parameters on the surface roughness evolution, and the effective material removal rate. Two sets of copper and aluminum blanket layers were polished under a range of applied down force, polishing wheel speed and <b>transverse</b> <b>feed</b> rate to examine the scalability of the process parameters for different material constants. The experimental measurements along with the topological details of the polishing pad have been utilized to develop a mechanistic model of the process. The model employs the soft wheel-workpiece macroscopic contact, the polishing wheel roughness and its amplification to the local contact pressure, the kinematics of abrasive grits at the local scale, and the collective contribution of these individual micro-events to induce an effective material removal rate at the macroscale. The model shows the dependence of the material removal on the ratio of wheel rotational to feed speed for the PPP process, in a form of an asymptote that is scaled by the surface hardness of each material. The PPP machine exploits this insight and utilizes an oblique grinding technique that obviates the traditional trade-off between MRR and planarization efficiency...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: "Die-less forming " {{is a new}} concept, {{intended}} to manufacture long compo-nents of continuous-fiber thermoplastic-matrix composites. The concepts behind die-less forming have been tested in experiments on a two-roller demonstration machine. The experiments focused on finding the effects of important forming parameters on the shape. Laminates with special lay-up were also made and formed to study the effect of lay-up on shape. Quasi-isotropic laminates showed an unexpected "excess bending. " An elastic/visco-plastic model has been developed to explain and predict this excess bending during die-less forming. The model is rate dependent and captures the shape dependency on strain rate, <b>transverse</b> <b>feed</b> magnitude and the lay-up. The model {{is based on the}} application of the principle of virtual displacements. The model predicts the net bend angle well for quasi-isotropic laminates. 1. EXCESS BENDING DUE TO INCREMENTAL FORMING I N THE DIE-LESS forming process, we control the position of the rollers andhence the way the component exits the forming zone. The material does not allow in-plane changes in area. Hence, we consider only developable shapes to be formed out of continuous fiber laminates. Although the shapes before and after the bend is propagated are developable (inextensible) surfaces, the interme-diate shapes are not. Referring to Figure 1, the constraints on the component are as follows: o The left of the component is fixed to an XZ table. This article was invited by the edito...|$|R
