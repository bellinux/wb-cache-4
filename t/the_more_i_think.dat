500|$|Kyla was {{involved}} in three romantic relationships during her time in the show, {{the first of which}} was with physiotherapist Justin Fuller (Ben Richards). Ayola said of the relationship: [...] "She hasn't got great taste in men! She likes good-looking blokes - that whole 'take me to a cave' thing - but she doesn't check that there is a soft, gentle, sensitive side to him. He's gorgeous to look at, but she hasn't learned that you have to look a bit deeper." [...] Roger Griffiths was cast as Kyla's ex-husband Harvey. Ayola commented on their previous relationship: [...] "I think they split up because Kyla is so volatile. The more we learn about Harvey <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he might not be the reason for their split". She expanded: [...] "They had a tempestuous relationship and Kyla is very irrational which got too much for Harvey. Harvey brings out the worst in Kyla and she just ends up yelling at him. It's a very difficult and if he knew how to handle her maybe it could work out but he doesn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{was also}} {{pleased with the}} episode, noting that Hermes' and Bender's team-up worked well and that the ending was cathartic. [...] He found the episode to be his {{favorite}} of the new season, giving it a 9/10 and stating, [...] "after an okay start, [...] {{turned out to be}} my favorite episode of this comeback season so far. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about it, the more pleasure I find in it. It was an episode full of laughs, action and the kind of emotional tug the series has been missing of late." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste gave the episode a rating of 8.7/10 and wrote: [...] "Judging from this episode and the last it seems like Futurama is intentionally straying away from its old groupings and trying new things. The sixth season is moving off from the repetition of its first two episodes and is all the better for it." [...] Though he felt the episode was weaker with its jokes, he noted that this [...] "is frequently the case in with episodes that deal more with the characters and less about making jokes in a wacky world. But this isn't something I think will bother real fans, as that's part of what's given Futurama its cult audience in the first place: that the show gives a damn about its characters." ...|$|E

60|$|Alas! it is a mistake.

I met the Hawtreys last night at dinner. They both asked me after you. The young lady quite seemed to take your disappearance to heart. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> so, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> because she had sent down a servant with a note to your lodgings, and the girl had learnt from your landlady that you had been away for a week. Of course, I could not enlighten her. Her father took me apart and asked me quite seriously about you. He {{seemed to think that}} you had been trying to ferret out something about this confounded letter business. He told me he had talked it over with you, regarding you as almost one of the family.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Tony Sclafani of PopMatters {{rated the}} album an {{eight out of}} ten, commenting [...] "Heroes & Thieves isn’t a perfect album and {{sometimes}} gets too idiosyncratic and precious for its own good. It’s already spawned its share of detractors, specifically reviewers who question whether Carlton has the vocal goods to pull off some of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> complicated numbers. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> her imperfect singing keeps her sounding human and give her props for not messing with a pitch correction program.

[...] "When I'm working, I {{like to work with}} a lot of music. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> can <b>think</b> of what a character would listen to, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> feel like I have a place to create from". agrees that he's using songs to give him insights into his character and not just to get him into an emotional space. [...] "I have a record player at home that I usually listen to, but since I've been in Wilmington Carolina, where the series is filming, I couldn't bring it with me. When I'm on set, I'm listening through headphones on my computer, just trying to zone in and focus. Britt Robertson always makes fun of me about how I'm always in my chair listening to music". He also works with images. [...] "When I'm working, I find images and kind of attach to them. It just makes the dialogue so much stronger if you have a distinct image in your mind".|$|R

But he fell into the belly of the mainsail, breaking his fall, turned a somersault, and landed on his feet on deck and unhurt. And he landed right alongside of Mr. Harding, facing him. I don't know which was <b>the</b> <b>more</b> astonished, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Mr. Harding was, for he stood there petrified. He had expected the man to be killed. Not so the man. He took one look at Mr. Harding, then made a wild jump for the rigging and climbed right back up to that topsail-yard." ...|$|R

This mess must be cooked in the Star- Chamber, and that is an oven seven times heated, my lord;--and yet, if you are {{determined}} to see the king, I will not say but you may find some favour, for he likes well any thing that is appealed directly to his own wisdom, and sometimes, in the like cases, I have known him stick by his own opinion, which is always a fair one. Only mind, if you will forgive me, my lord--mind to spice high with Latin; a curn or two of Greek would not be amiss; and, if you can bring in any thing about the judgment of Solomon, in the original Hebrew, and season with a merry jest or so, the dish will be <b>the</b> <b>more</b> palatable.--Truly, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> that, besides my skill in art, I owe much to the stripes of the Rector of the High School, who imprinted on my mind that cooking scene in the Heautontimorumenos."

60|$|But if animals, or some single terrible animal, {{then what}} had become of my comrades? A ferocious beast would surely have {{destroyed}} them and left their remains. It is true that there was that one hideous pool of blood, which told of violence. Such a monster as had pursued me during the night could have carried away a victim as easily as a cat would a mouse. In that case the others would have followed in pursuit. But then they would assuredly have taken their rifles with them. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> tried to <b>think</b> it out with my confused and weary brain the less could I find any plausible explanation.

6000|$|... "You'll excuse my asking {{again if}} it has {{anything}} to do with a picture, ma'am," [...] observes Mr. Guppy, [...] "because I do assure you that <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of that picture the better I know it, without knowing how I know it!" ...|$|E

60|$|It may be {{said that}} the Carboniferous {{formations}} demonstrate the existence of a vast extent of dry land in the present dry-land area, and that the supposed terrestrial Palaeozoic Vertebrate Fauna ought to have left its remains in the Coal-measures, especially as there is now reason to believe that much of the coal was formed by the accumulation of spores and sporangia on dry land. But if we consider <b>the</b> matter <b>more</b> closely, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that this apparent objection loses its force. It is clear that, during the Carboniferous epoch, the vast area of land which is now covered by Coal-measures must have been undergoing a gradual depression. The dry land thus depressed must, therefore, have existed, as such, before the Carboniferous epoch--in other words, in Devonian times--and its terrestrial population may never have been other than such as existed during the Devonian, or some previous epoch, although much higher forms may have been developed elsewhere.|$|R
60|$|But their {{sanguine}} {{hopes of}} enjoyment were not entirely fulfilled. Both Jessie and Christie {{were obliged to}} confess to a certain disappointment in the aspect of the civilization they were now reentering. They at first attributed it to the change in their own habits {{during the last three}} months, and their having become barbarous and countrified in their seclusion. Certainly in the matter of dress they were behind the fashions as revealed in Montgomery Street. But when the brief solace afforded them by the modiste and dressmaker was past, there seemed little else to be gained. They missed at first, I fear, the chivalrous and loyal devotion that had only amused them at Devil's Ford, and were <b>the</b> <b>more</b> inclined, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> to distrust <b>the</b> conscious and <b>more</b> civilized gallantry of the better dressed and more carefully presented men they met. For it must be admitted that, for obvious reasons, their criticisms were at first confined to the sex they had been most in contact with. They could not help noticing that <b>the</b> men were <b>more</b> eager, annoyingly feverish, and self-asserting in their superior elegance and external show than their old associates were in their frank, unrestrained habits. It seemed to them that the five millionaires of Devil's Ford, in their radical simplicity and thoroughness, were perhaps nearer the type of true gentlemanhood than these citizens who imitated a civilization they were unable yet to reach.|$|R
60|$|The {{budget of}} last year I cannot admit {{to have been an}} error. People say it should have been smaller. My belief is that {{if it had been a}} smaller boat it would not have lived in such a sea. I speak of the period of the session before the China war became certain. When it did so, we were in a great strait about the paper duty. We felt the {{obligation}} incurred by the vote on the second reading, and we construed it according to the established usage. We took <b>the</b> <b>more</b> arduous, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> honourable course for a government to pursue. Had we abandoned the bill, I know not how we could have looked in the face those who had acted and invested on the faith of an unbroken practice. I admit that political motives greatly concurred to recommend the budget {{of last year}}. It was a budget of peace, and peace wanted it. The budget of this year followed from the budget of last, given the other circumstances. At the same time I can understand how the claim of tea could be set up, but not well after the occurrences of last year how it could be supported.|$|R
