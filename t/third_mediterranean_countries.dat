40|$|The {{competitive}} {{scenario for}} {{the agricultural sector}} of the Campania region {{has to deal with}} the progressively increasing demand in environmental, economical, territorial and social sustainability. The competitive challenge is therefore influenced by the multilateral (WTO) and the regional integration agreements. Among the last form of integration, an increasing importance has been devoted to the free trade area (FTA) between EU and the <b>Third</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Countries.</b> The aim of this work is to offer an analysis of the trade in food products between the Campania region and the <b>Third</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Countries</b> through the use of RCA indicators (Revelead Comparative Advantage) that showed the food products for which the Campania region has a competitive advantage. The empirical results, interpreted also in view of the previous qualitative research conducted, showed the importance of trade in the food sector between Campania and <b>Third</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>countries</b> and the strategic importance that the “no price” elements will have, as the most important means of competition, after the closer integration among the EU and the <b>Third</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Countries...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to examine the impact of the latest and {{forthcoming}} EU enlargement on the Euro-Mediterranean relations. The answer cannot be simple and it depends on many factors, primary role amongst others has the institutional evolution of EU. For example, will the existing regime of the Euro-Mediterranean relations be sustained after the enlargement? What will the EU discussions for a European Constitution conclude to? The underlying conclusion is that a prediction on the future of Euro-Mediterranean relations is not an easy task. In this direction two main questions are raised. First, if and in what context are the <b>Third</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Countries</b> and the CEE Countries competitive to each other, in respect to the European Market and second what are the primary dangers for the <b>Third</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Countries</b> after the EU enlargement. The paper deals with these questions and presents some basic findings for the above. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the attempt}} to reduce {{migration}} pressure, since 1995, the European Union has been planning to establish a free trade area with developing <b>countries</b> bordering the <b>Mediterranean</b> Sea. The process is still ongoing. Our paper tests whether {{it is likely to}} be an effective policy. We estimate a gravitational model of bilateral migrations on bilateral exports from the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Countries</b> (South) to the European Union (North) over the period 1970 – 2000, using different specifications. We find, in line with most of the literature, a significantly positive correlation (called “complementarity”) between exports and migrations from the South to the North. Then we go one step further, trying to solve the potential endogeneity problem using average trade tariffs and bilateral exchange rate volatility as instruments for trade. Based on the OLS as well as the 2 SLS results, liberalizing trade in the area of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership does not seem to be an effective policy to mitigate the migration flows, at least in the short run...|$|R

40|$|The {{starting}} point of the present paper {{is the idea that}} to define a regional development policy which should effectively respond to the new challenges of the future, in particular to the globalisation of the economy and the acceleration of technological changes, it is necessary to think about new methods that grant a privilege to the local solution, using to the maximum the local skills, the national technological strength, the creative and innovative capabilities existents. But, referring to the Mediterranean basin, there are major disparities between regions and countries in the field of innovation and R&D, as also in the level of diffusion of modern information and communication technologies. In particular some <b>Third</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>countries</b> as also some regions of South Europe, if on the one hand have clear difficulties in developing modern forms of industrialisation capable to insure an access to the international markets, on the other need to increase the competitiveness of their firms, to improve their strengths and to compensate the disadvantages due to their periphericity by developing their international contacts with neighbouring countries in the Mediterranean Basin. This study identifies and analyses the policies adopted by Algeria in the development of technological and managerial capabilities to highlight the facilities and the constraints for implementing and managing advanced technology and innovation in the economic lagging regions and to explore ways of innovative co-operation in this field. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is the {{analysis}} of fishery products exchange between the EU and its Mediterranean partners. In order to delineate more clearly the framework of trade in fish products among the Mediterranean countries, EU and non-EU members, countries under analysis (only those with a Mediterranean shore) will be divided into 4 groups:  PMM, EU Mediterranean members (France, Greece, Italy, Spain, Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia);  PCM, candidate Mediterranean countries (Croatia and Turkey);  PPCM, potential candidate Mediterranean countries (Albania and Montenegro);  PTM, <b>third</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>countries</b> (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Syria, Palestinian Authority and Tunisia). In addition to the more recent political agreements (enlargement processes and membership) the analysis will take into account the partnership processes involving the EU, on one hand, and some Mediterranean partners: the Euro - Mediterranean partnership (PEM) and the Stabilization and Association process (PSA) that the EU has launched with the countries of the Mediterranean south-east (from North Africa to the Middle-East) in the first case, and with the countries of south-eastern Europe (Balkans), in the second case. The study focuses on the fishery products exchange using, as sources, UN-Comtrade data (for the international trade) and Eurostat data (for the EU trade). The analysis will pay attention both on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of trade. From the analysis it is expected to identify the main trends of exchange, the effects of the liberalisation processes on the fish products exchange and any product specialisation.

40|$|The {{starting}} point of the present paper {{is the idea that}} to ensure a sustainable development among the Mediterranean countries both of the North and south-east shores, it is necessary to exploit the potentialities of each country and use them in terms of co-development rather then competition. The study area encompasses on the one hand the countries of Central Maghreb {{and on the other hand}} the regions of Southern Italy. This choice is originated by the fact that both these regional groups show similarities and complementarities. The paper analyses the agricultural sector which still has a very dominant position in the socio-economic structure, of both Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria and in the Southern Italian regions, although at a different degree. Therefore that seems to be the sector on which to focus in order to obtain both economic and social improvements. However it is not possible to look at the Mediterranean agricultural sector development only from a free market point of view, for the presence of the same patterns of production activities in the two groups. In order to avoid clashes, it is necessary, instead, to create a production network able to develop a typical Mediterranean product with which to compete in the international markets. In this context Italy, particularly Southern Italian regions, due to its tradition, knowledge and geographical position can play a well defined role of a bridge between the European Union and the <b>third</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>countries.</b> In the first part, we address the question of the existence of a direct relationship between liberalisation and economic growth through the analysis of the commercial flows, in particular the agricultural ones. In the second part the complementarities in the agricultural sector of both the Central Maghreb countries and the Southern Italian regions are identified, while in the third and last part, an attempt is made try to specify how those complementarities can be transformed in concrete co- operation activitiesDevelopment Cooperation, Agriculture, Euro-Mediterranean...|$|E

40|$|The Evolution of the EEC/EU Economic Policies {{towards the}} Mediterranean Gian Cesare Romagnoli- Università Roma Tre The Evolution of the EEC/EU Institutions and Policies Siena 23 - 24 maggio 2008 Abstract JEL: International Economic Policy The Mediteranean basin hosts {{countries}} {{with very different}} economic situations. The Northern side is represented by a world economic power, the European Union (EU), while the Southern one by a variegated group of <b>Third</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Countries</b> (TMC) most of which share the economic conditions of less developed countries (ldc). The EU has often declared its interest to stabilise and strengthen TMC {{from the point of}} view of regional integration and economic development, none the less the economic results of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership are shaky and poor even if one looks at the last decennium after the Barcelona Declaration. It can be argued that the premises of these results are rooted in the past trade history of this area. Therefore a brief historical reconstruction introduces this paper. The contents of these premises have to do firstly with the division of the Mediterranean civilizations and communications routes and secondly with a different attitude towards modernization and its implementation in the two different sides of the Mediterranean. From these diversities two different development paths have followed associated with different trade theories, trade models, international division of labour, productive specialization which are at the base of the different economic contexts still prevailing in the two areas where the complementarity and the competitiveness relationships with respective partner countries play a significant role for trade volumes, structures and directions. The transition of TMC, as many other ldc from the import substitution to the export led development model has delayed their option for the intraindustrial trade model. The aim of this paper is to argue that it is possible to trace out a common design either in the two different phases of the European Economic Community economic policy towards the TMC or in the Euro-Mediterranean policies which have followed them. The targets of the Barcelona Process, through the Euro- Mediterranean Partnership, financed by the Meda Program, have been mainly disattended and substituted by bilateral commercial agreements which have left the TMC with the old problem of a poor South-South trade and the more recent one of declining Foreign Direct Investments (FDI). In short the European policy for the Mediterranean has not changed much either with EEC or UE and therefore the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area planned by the Barcelona Declaration to start within 2010 is now close but the premises for it to become convenient also for the Southern side of the Mediterranean are still missing...|$|E
40|$|The {{complicated}} {{world of}} {{fresh fruits and}} vegetables commerce has inspired me to proceed with this project. The main topic of this research is the production cost of tomato and potato which are the highest- in consumption -vegetables in the Greek market. The study is focused on Greek production versus rest countries around it (European and non European countries) which export these products under specific circumstances. By stating European countries, it is implied that the countries are laid geographically in European continent and they are included in the European Monetary Union. In non European countries there are either countries that belong geographically to Europe but they are not included in the European Monetary Union. Or countries that do not lay geographically in Europe. Therefore the methodology is divided geographically in two main levels of research: 1. Data collection from Greece where there are focus groups of agronomists, cooperative unions, traders. There’s a base of around two hundred farmers who have filled in questionnaires regarding the crops mentioned above. 2. Data collection from rest countries is based from interviews of foreign exporters, local importers – traders, embassies and also from colleagues of the mother company that I am working for. The questionnaires are structured in such a way to avoid coincidental answers by the interviewed people. The analysis was based on the SPSS statistical program and this has led to several findings: - Contracted agriculture in Greece may keep production costs low and reinforce the competitive power towards rest countries. In future, it should obviously expand to more crops. - Low income farmers pay more attention to finding cheap equipment than the rest. - Most farmers, especially the ones with big lands (more than five hectares per person) make precautionary use of chemicals to protect their crops from plant diseases. - Young farmers invest more in new technology and equipment than older generations. - Farmers, who invest in their crop business, believe in the future of biological agriculture. - The current evolution of biological agriculture in Greece remains lower than the average European one. - Large production farmers are more professional and they work on economies of scale to minimize their costs. - The expansion of organic crops in the Greek market can lead to a sustainable level of income for both producers and traders - Apart from unpredictable parameters like weather, the marketing of agricultural production can fully guarantee positive income. - The more professional the farmers are the more the investment in their crops - On a contract basis agriculture, farmers and super markets may become valuable partners Furthermore, the conclusions of this project can probably lead to future research on the topics below: - The successful minimization of production cost to contracted potato crops should find application in other cultivations. - The development of private labels in {{fresh fruits and vegetables}} is another exit to large scale Greek agricultural production. - Once the consumers become familiar with private labels, then the future researchers should concentrate on the evolution of these products. - The Greek exports should prioritize on the production of competitive, safe and qualitative products. These are the key factors to adapt to the European consumers’ demands. - The typical bureaucracy regarding imports and exports to and from Greece has to be lessened, because it often causes delays to loadings and quality reduction. - Exports to Scandinavian countries need to be further investigated in future. These countries have the financial ability to pay the added value of products, but they have high quality standards. The risk of rejection and a permanent collaboration break is quite high in such countries, if there is quality uncertainty. - Commercial challenges among rest countries should also be analyzed in future studies (exports from Fyrom to north Europe, from Turkey to north Europe, from China to Europe and Russia). - New legislation that eliminates the export barriers from the <b>third</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>countries</b> (Egypt, Morocco, Lebanon etc) should change the balances in the European agriculture.
