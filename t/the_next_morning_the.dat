5|$|Because {{of the bad}} weather, the B-17s {{returned}} individually to Mitchel Field. Cousland's Flying Fortress encountered severe hail, damaging all {{the forward}} surfaces of the plane, and ice caused a temporary shutdown of one engine. As a result, Cousland lagged behind the others, landing at 16:30. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>the</b> three bombers took off to return to Harrisburg and spotted the Rex passing the Statue of Liberty at 09:30 as it entered New York Harbor.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone soon {{moved on}} a northwestward course and {{encountered}} wind shear. Bret weakened into a depression on August 23, {{due to the}} wind shear over the system. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> depression became a tropical wave with no low-level circulation left.

5|$|After his release, Money {{immediately}} {{spoke to}} his official contacts, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>the</b> matter {{was raised in the}} House of Commons. It was suggested that the police evidence was perjured, and as a result the Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks instructed Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, to investigate the possibility of perjury. Bodkin had the Metropolitan Police Commissioner appoint Chief Inspector Collins, one of his most experienced CID officers, to investigate the claims and interview Savidge.|$|E
5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure that nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.|$|E
5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> loyalist {{forces had}} collapsed. Diệm {{and his younger}} brother and chief adviser, Ngô Đình Nhu, agreed to surrender, and coup plotter Đôn promised them safe passage out of the country. In the meantime, Minh left Joint General Staff (JGS) {{headquarters}} and travelled to Gia Long Palace in a sedan, accompanied by Nhung. He arrived at the palace at 08:00 in full military uniform to supervise the arrest of Diệm and Nhu for the surrender ceremony.|$|E

5|$|However, Peloponnesians {{may have}} been party to Themistocles's stratagem, so serenely did they accept that they would now have to fight at Salamis. The Allied navy was thus able to prepare {{properly}} for battle the forthcoming day, whilst the Persians spent the night fruitlessly at sea, searching for the alleged Greek evacuation. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> Persians rowed into the straits to attack the Greek fleet; {{it is not clear}} when, why or how this decision was made, {{but it is clear that}} they did take the battle to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|In 1275, Magnús Óláfsson's illegitimate son, Guðrøðr, led {{a revolt}} on Mann and {{attempted}} to establish himself as king. According to the Chronicle of Mann and the Chronicle of Lanercost, a Scottish fleet landed on Mann on 7 October, and early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>the</b> revolt was crushed as the Scots routed the rebels at the Battle of Ronaldsway. Guðrøðr {{may very well have}} been slain in the defeat, although one source, the continuation of Historia rerum Anglicarum, states that he, his wife and his followers escaped the carnage to Wales.|$|E
5|$|In October 1840, their {{paternal}} grandfather Kamanawa II requested his grandsons {{to visit}} him {{on the night before}} his execution for the murder of his wife Kamokuiki. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>the</b> Cookes allowed ʻĪʻī to bring Kaliokalani and his brother Kalākaua to see Kamanawa for the last time. It is not know if their sister was also taken to see him. Later sources, especially in biographies of Kalākaua indicated that the boys witnessed the hanging of their grandfather at the gallows. Historian Helena G. Allen noted the indifference the Cookes' had toward the request and the traumatic experience it must have been for the boys.|$|E

5|$|In the south, the 3rd Parachute Brigade started {{crossing}} the River Dives on 18August, delayed {{by the need}} to build a crossing to replace the bridge destroyed by the division during Operation Tonga. By nightfall the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was engaging the German rearguard and the 8th Parachute Battalion reached the outskirts of Goustranville. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>the</b> brigade advance continued into Goustranville, where they came under heavy artillery fire from the high ground at Putot. Their attack faltered and Gale decided to restart the advance that night. He ordered the 3rd Parachute Brigade to secure the start point along the Dives canal and railway line, while the 5th Parachute Brigade assaulted the artillery position at Putot.|$|E

When Nagaraju blames Krishnadevaraya for sending a palanquin to her house for Rani Vasam, Krishnadevaraya defends his action and reminds Nagaraju that {{it was he who}} had asked him to send Malliswari to Rani Vasam. Krishnadevaraya forgives both Nagaraju and Malliswari, and their {{marriage}} is conducted in a grand manner at the palace.|$|E
5|$|Milhouse {{rolls over}} the side of the treehouse, but Bart catches him precariously by his sleeve. When a gale of wind takes hold of the comic so that it flies towards the treehouse's {{entrance}}, Bart is forced to decide between it and Milhouse. After mulling over his options, Bart chooses Milhouse and pulls him up into the treehouse. The comic flies out the entrance and is shredded by Santa's Little Helper on the ground, hit by lightning, and completely destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> three boys reflect on how their inability to share led to the destruction of the comic, although Bart, has forgotten the experience.|$|E

5|$|Not {{long after}} the alert was issued, deep {{convection}} disappeared from the low while located 400mi (645km). Convection was anticipated to redeveloped later that night or early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>The</b> low was moving slowly towards the northwest due to a deep trough located over the Gulf of Mexico and a ridge of high pressure located over western Mexico. By the morning of July 3, convection had redeveloped near the low and its forward motion quickly increased to 11mph (18km/h). The low remained disorganized {{for the next two}} days as it steadily moved towards the northwest.|$|E

The party elected George D. Grant as their captain. Throughout October more wagon trains were assembled, {{and by the end}} of the month 250 relief wagons were on the road.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Cape Mendocino {{earthquakes}} (or 1992 Petrolia earthquakes) occurred {{along the}} Lost Coast of Northern California on April 25 and 26. The three largest events were the M7.2 thrust mainshock that struck near the unincorporated community of Petrolia midday on April 25 and two primary strike-slip aftershocks measuring 6.5 and 6.6 that followed early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>The</b> sequence encompassed both interplate and intraplate activity that {{was associated with}} the Mendocino Triple Junction, a complex system of three major faults (including the Cascadia subduction zone, San Andreas Fault, and Mendocino Fracture Zone) that converge near Cape Mendocino. The total number of aftershocks that followed the events exceeded 2,000.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>the</b> three {{companies}} of 4-503 {{were chosen to}} set out and relieve the men on Hill 875. Because of intense PAVN sniper and mortar fire (and the terrain) it took until nightfall for the relief force to reach the beleaguered battalion.

Captain Edward WC Wright of the 91st Argyllshire Regiment was the most senior army officer to survive; he was awarded a brevet majority for his actions during the ordeal, dated 26 February 1852.|$|E
5|$|Washington then {{continued}} his flight across New Jersey; {{the future of}} the Continental Army was in doubt due to expiring enlistments and the string of losses.
