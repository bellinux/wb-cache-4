5|$|Chapters on {{methodology}} {{comprise a}} third of the book's core. Identical and fraternal twins were classified using fingerprints and blood groups. Follow-up interviews were recorded to monitor the progress of their patients (the probands) and their twins, some schizophrenic and others not. Two psychological teststhe MMPI and the Object Sorting Test (Goldstein Scheerer Test of Concept Formation)were used to measure mental traits and functioning. Case summaries were prepared by the Scandinavian psychiatrist Erick Essen-Moller, and these were sent, with data on identical-or-fraternal-twin status and diagnosis-of-schizophrenia removed, to six judges from the U.S., U.K. and Japan. The judges independently evaluated whether <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> schizophrenic.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{broke out}} in the factory at around 2:30 IST, as workers slept. Once they became aware of the blaze, the {{employees}} found they were unable to break through the factory's locked doors. Five fire tenders were sent to the scene, but by the time they arrived, local residents had broken down two locked gates and already rescued the surviving workers. These impromptu Rescue efforts were delayed however, when an individual carrying keys to open the door nervously dropped them while attempting to open the gate. At least 10 people were dead by the time rescuers reached the factory's interior, with a further eighteen injured. The survivors, many suffering from burns over 70 percent of their bodies, were taken to the National Medical College and Hospital, where victims had to be left on the floor due to a shortage of beds. The hospital did not have a burns unit, and the only treatments available at the hospital were ointments and saline drips. <b>The</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> eventually moved to other hospitals. Local MLA Javed Khan later said that the death toll is actually at least twelve, but there has been no official confirmation of this. The Rapid Action Force was also deployed to maintain calm.|$|E

25|$|Beginning by {{examining}} patients in whom nerves had been divided, Head and his co-worker J. Sherren soon realised the folly in using patient subjects.

25|$|A February 2011 {{report said}} the {{hospital}} had dilapidated infrastructure, poor sanitation, stifling heat, stench, lack of water and electricity, lack of drugs and maintenance.

25|$|When treated, the {{prognosis}} is better. In one review, {{the proportion of}} treated ORS cases which reported various outcomes were assessed.

25|$|Depression {{or having}} {{previously}} been depressed probably {{is due to}} altered brain structure or alters brain structure. Patients who have been depressed or are depressed show more activation to negative stimuli in emotion.

25|$|A second study, {{conducted}} by Moscovitch and Behrmann, investigated the reference frame of neglect {{with respect to}} the somatosensory system. Eleven patients with parietal lobe lesions and subsequent hemispatial neglect were analyzed during this experiment. A double simultaneous stimulation procedure was utilized, during which <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> touched lightly and simultaneously on the left and right side of the wrist of one hand. <b>The</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> tested both with their palms facing down and with their palms facing up. This experimental condition allowed the scientists to determine whether neglect in the somatosensory system occurs {{with respect to the}} sensory receptor surface (egocentric) or with respect to a higher-order spatial frame of reference (allocentric). The results of this experiment showed the hemispatial neglect patients neglected somatosensory stimuli on the contralesional side of space, regardless of hand orientation. These findings suggest that, within the somatosensory system, stimuli are neglected with respect to the allocentric, spatial frame of reference, in addition to an egocentric, sensory frame of reference. Ultimately, the discoveries made by these experiments indicate that hemispatial neglect occurs with respect to multiple, simultaneously derived frames of reference, which dictate {{the nature and extent of}} neglect within the visual, auditory, and tactile fields.|$|E

25|$|Thousands of men, {{women and}} {{children}} interned at prisoner of war camps were subjected to vivisection, often without anesthesia and usually ending {{with the death of}} the victim. Vivisections were performed on prisoners after infecting them with various diseases. Researchers performed invasive surgery on prisoners, removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body. These were conducted while <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> alive because it was feared that the decomposition process would affect the results. The infected and vivisected prisoners included men, women, children, and infants.|$|E
25|$|Spinal cord {{stimulation}} {{has been}} studied {{in the last couple}} of years.

Between 36 and 149 months after the stimulations, <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> interviewed. 6 of the 8 had received initial pain relief, and three experienced long-term pain relief. Spinal cord stimulation is cheaper than brain stimulation and less invasive, and is thus a more promising option for pain treatment.|$|E

25|$|The {{three studies}} that {{initially}} found that high-dose mannitol {{was effective in}} cases of severe head injury were {{the subject of an}} investigation published in 2007. Although several authors are listed with Dr. Julio Cruz, it is unclear whether the authors had knowledge of how <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> recruited. Further, the Federal University of São Paulo, which Dr. Cruz gave as his affiliation, has never employed him. As a result of doubt surrounding Cruz's work, an updated version of the Cochrane review excludes all studies by Julio Cruz, leaving only 4 studies. Due to differences in selection of control groups, a conclusion about the clinical use of mannitol could not be reached.|$|E
25|$|Combining {{the brain}} bias towards facial {{processing}} and surface discovery, a follow-up study by Dr. Vuilleumier exposed subjects to paired visual stimuli in three phases. In the initial phase, stimuli were simply bilateral pairs, and extinction frequency was measured. In the next stage, the stimuli were surrounded with an oval, {{so that they}} appeared to represent eyes in a face. The extinction rate for this appearance was greatly reduced. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> shown the stimuli minus the contextual oval – however, the reduced extinction rate persisted, as though the patients had learned to group these stimuli. The effect did not occur when the stimuli were surrounded by a nonoval shape, pointing towards facial processing as being {{the key to this}} phenomenon.|$|E
