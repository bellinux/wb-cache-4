40|$|AbstractAs {{pointed out}} by Taavitsainen (2001 : 141), we assume that genres or text types involve {{particular}} codifications of linguistic features and, in consequence, {{the choice of a}} given genre or text type affects the set of grammatical choices. Following the trend initiated by Biber's (1988) multidimensional analysis of textual variation, we aim at describing genres (or, better, text types) by paying attention to exclusively grammatical features. In this paper we are concerned with the connection between word order and genre, and focus on the arquitecture of the clause in a number of genres. More specifically, we analyse a representative number of clauses and classify them according to the syntactic design of their main syntactic elements. The taxonomy includes unmarked subject-verb-complement word order and, among the wide range of marked structural choices, we focus on those affecting the thematic component of the clause and involving the <b>topicalisation</b> of complements, the <b>topicalisation</b> of adjuncts and the left- dislocation of a major constituent. The examples belong to a number of genres, namely biography, diary, drama, education, fiction, handbook, history, law, letters, philosophy, science, sermon, travelogue and trials. We reach the following conclusions:(i) left-dislocation constitutes a feature of non-speech-based genres; (ii) the <b>topicalisation</b> of complements was associated with non-iconic/situational genres and becomes statistically more unmarked in the course of time; and (iii) the <b>topicalisation</b> of adjuncts is an unmarked syntactic strategy in the recent history of English. The data also pave the way for the so-called ‘hybridity’ of the genres since, as Biber and Finegan (1988 : 3) point out, “for some genre categories, greater linguistic differences exist among texts within the categories than across them”...|$|E

40|$|Romance {{languages}} {{make use}} of <b>topicalisation</b> as a grammatical strategy to mark [-focus] constituents, typically under Clitic Left Dislocation (CLLD) and Clitic Right Dislocation (CLRD). As a distinctive property, <b>topicalisation</b> involves clitic resumption (CR) of the dislocated constituent in Italian, {{as well as in}} other Romance languages (French, Spanish, Catalan). However, a great deal of variation is found in regard to the actual realisation of the resumptive clitic, which is traditionally explained by assuming that CR is optional. In Italian, CR of topic constituents proves to be optional with all phrases, except with direct objects and partitive complements. By contrast, the presence of a resumptive clitic is strictly required in all dislocation structures involving verbal arguments in other Romance varieties, such as Catalan and Sicilian. The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify the syntactic properties and the pragmatic characterisation of dislocation contructions lacking CR, and to account for the apparent optionality and the variation found across Romance. We claim that there are no optional nor null clitics, and that non-resumed dislocation actually corresponds to structures other than CLLD/CLRD, as suggested by the fact that the constructions lacking CR exhibit a wide range of syntactic differences with respect to the clitic-resumed counterparts.

40|$|The paper investigates investigates how Italian and Greek employ Clitic Left Dislocation (clld) {{to encode}} {{discourse}} topics.

By contrast, clld is the main topic-strategy in Italian including non-referential/property denoting topics. This contrast is shown to mirror variation in more general patterns of anaphoric relations in the two languages, which, in turn, relate {{to the structure of}} nominal arguments: the fact that Greek non-referential indefinites systematically involve bare nouns which may be dropped rather than picked up by a pronoun in intrasentential anaphora contexts; the fact that Italian indefinites always involve a determiner and Italian pronouns can support property anaphora.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{framework}} of a research target that aims at integration of sign language technologies to human-computer interaction applications, creation and annotation of the Greek Sign Language Corpus (GSLC) involve, on the one hand, data and analysis of the phonological structure of morphemes of Greek Sign Language (GSL) and, on the other hand, collection of sentence level language samples and assignment of their respective annotations. GSLC also entails free sign narrations fully annotated at least for sentence segmentation. Simple and complex sign morpheme formation is directly relevant to development of sign recognition prototypes. In this sense, a sign language corpus intended to support sign recognition by exploitation of a language model has to entail sufficient data from simple- to complex- morpheme level. Sentence level annotation, except for sentence boundaries, focuses on phrase boundary marking and grammar information often conveyed by multi-layer markers, as is the case of e. g. <b>topicalisation,</b> nominal phrase formation, temporal indicators, question formation and sentential negation in GSL...|$|E
40|$|Considering the {{derivation}} of null object {{structures in}} terms of VP ellipsis, the paper discusses the syntax of two verb doubling constructions in Polish, namely emphatic affrmation and V(P) <b>topicalisation.</b> These structures are analysed here within the minimalist framework of generative grammar. It is argued that in both of them the verb doubling effect follows from the acoustic realisation of two copies of the verb, which undergoes movement in the syntactic component. The structures in which the verb is not followed by an overt object (and/or other overt material interpreted within VP) are derived with the application of VP ellipsis, following {{the movement of the}} verb outside of VP. VP ellipsis is licensed in this case by the focusing of the Σ head, which introduces the polarity feature into the derivation. If this proposal is on the right track, the grammar of Polish has at its disposal more than one mechanism deriving null object structures...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} safe airway {{management}} option {{in patients with}} penetrating injury of {{the floor of the}} mouth, reinforcing the similar experience of others and illustrating the importance of proper assessment and planning before airway negotiation. Clinical features: A 23 -yr-old man was admitted with a penetrating injury of the floor of mouth caused by falling on bamboo and with the foreign body in situ. The extent of penetration could not be assessed clinically but computerized tomography (CT) was used to assist in preoperative evaluation of the airway. After atropine iv, fentanyl iv, topical cocaine and lidocaine spray, awake fibreoptic guided nasal intubation was performed successfully and the patient's airway secured before induction of anaesthesia. Elective tracheostomy was performed postoperatively which was removed on day 5. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Conclusion: Awake fibreoptic guided nasal intubation was useful in managing the airway of a patient with a penetrating injury of the floor of mouth and foreign body in situ. Thorough previous evaluation of the patient's airway by CT scan, careful <b>topicalisation</b> of the airway, and judicious use of iv sedation and anti-sialogue contributed to the safe and successful airway management. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} a set of {{unexpected}} contrasts {{in the interpretation of}} Clitic Left Dislocated (CLLD-ed) indefinites in Italian and Greek derive from structural variation in the nominal syntax of the two languages. Greek resists nonreferential indefinites in CLLD resorting to the <b>Topicalisation</b> of an often bare noun for non-referential topics. By contrast, CLLD is employed in Italian for topics irrespective of their definite/indefinite interpretation. We argue that this contrast is directly linked to the wide availability of bare nouns in Greek which stems from a structural difference in nominal syntax of the two languages. In particular, we hypothesise that Greek nominal arguments lack a D-layer. Rather, they are Number Phrases. We situate this analysis in the context of Chierchia’s typology. We argue that, on a par with Italian, Greek nouns are [-arg, +pred]. However, they do not employ a syntactic head (D) for type shifting to e.

The study is carried out {{within the framework of}} Govern-ment and Binding as developed in Chomsky (1981, 1986 b) and the subsequent works. In the traditional form of the X-bar model, subject is considered to be generated in Spec. of IP where it is assigned nominative case by the tense and agreement features of INFL. This research deals with a proposal which has recently been gaining ground in the literature through a number of studies by Fukui and Speas (1986), Kitagawa (1986), Kuroda (1988), Sportiche (1988) and Koopman and Sportiche (1991).

40|$|The {{patterns}} {{found with}} Taiwanese object <b>topicalisation</b> now importantly seem to exclude {{this as a}} possibility and suggest the conclusion that only CP phases can occur as the input to cyclic Spell-Out. The {{reason for this is}} that if vP phases could occur as the input to cyclic Spell-Out, one would expect (incorrectly) that Taiwanese topicalised objects would indeed be able to trigger tone sandhi on their selecting verbs, as at the hypothetical point of vP cyclic Spell-Out, such objects would occur in situ following the verb in VP. 20 The fact that tone sandhi does not however occur in the verb in such cases therefore clearly suggests the broad conclusion that phonology has access to mid-derivational syntactic forms only at the clausal level after CPs have been constructed, and does not apply directly to smaller syntactic cycles such as vP phases. 21 The Taiwanese kong paradigm thus generally both adds interesting positive empirical support for the idea of cyclic Spell-Out itself and also allows one to understand more precisely what may be involved in such a process, indicating that the input to cyclic Spell-Out is a clausal CP constituent prior to the creation of its external Specifier position. 2...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} Early Modern English (EModE) passive constructions, {{specifically the}} factors that render a non-agent NP inherently topical (ie human and animacy features, semantic role and degree of definiteness). The {{aim of this study}} is to ascertain whether these factors determine, as in Present-day English (PE), the eligibility of non-agent NPs to become topics via passivisation in this period. Statistical data drawn from the Helsinki Corpus show that, in contrast with PE, only the degree of definiteness of non-agent NPs conditions the use of the passive as an object foregrounding device in EModE. Passive constructions in this period, therefore, run counter to the PE cross-linguistic tendency, reflected in the animacy and semantic hierarchies, to topicalise human, animate, benefactive NPs over non-human, non-animate, patient NPs. 1 Object foregrounding function of the passive The object foregrounding function of the passive, which has also been referred to as the <b>topicalisation</b> function (Givón 1981 and 1982), refers to the assignment of subject/topic or merely topic function to a non-agent. In the case of the passive, this process involves the active object becoming passive subject, which Givón terms clausal topic assignment: ‘the subject/agent of the active clause ceases to be the topic, and a non-actor argument of the active then assumes, by whatever means, the clausal-topic function ’ (1981 : 168; cf also Langacker an...|$|E

40|$|Stylistic Fronting is a {{phenomenon}} that has been intensively studied {{with respect to the}} symmetric Germanic Verb Second languages: Old/Modern Icelandic, Old/Modern Faeroese but also Middle English and Modern Yiddish. Standardly Stylistic Fronting is seen as an operation that moves an element in front of the finite verb in order to rescue the verb second constraint, in sentences that contain a subject gap. With the claim that the Old Romance languages are symmetric verb second languages, it soon followed that inverted elements in embedded contexts were analysed analogously to the Germanic inverted elements, i. e. as displaying Stylistic Fronting (Cardinaletti & Roberts 1991, Fontana 1993). In this paper I will present examples that show an nearly identical case of inversion in Old Catalan; nearly identical, because in Old Catalan there are examples with stylistically fronted elements that don’t obey one of the formulated constraints of Stylistic Fronting: they appear next to a full subject. Furthermore, we find an interesting interplay between Stylistic Fronting and enclitic pronouns: not only that they disappear exactly {{at the same time in}} the history of Catalan, they also exclude each other during the time they were possible in Old Catalan. In this paper I hope to show that contrary to recent opinions Stylistic Fronting in Old Romance does have an effect on the information structure of the sentence comparable to the effect that <b>topicalisation</b> has on the information structural interpretation...|$|E
