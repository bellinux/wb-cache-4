The Maestrat and Cameros basins {{developed during the}} Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous rifting cycle 2. There are two main controls on sedimentation: (1) tectonics, (2) climate, and these together control sea-level and paleoecosystems. Cameros and Maestrat basins display different styles of extensional tectonic structure probably due to a crust thermally weakened. Biotic changes in freshwater plants, continental faunas, and marine carbonate producers, reveal the evolution from Late Jurassic-Earliest Cretaceous climate to show hydrological seasonality in a general warm and humid context. This is confirmed by the coexistence of biotic markers of hydrological stress (closed stomatal structures in plants, small size in animals) with sedimentologic indicators of a long-lasting humid climate (lateritic soils and karstic bauxite deposits).

Luminescence dating of aeolian and lagoon deposits was performed to confirm our hypothesis about the deposits chronology and recent tectonic movements. However, the marine deposits can not be dated by TL and even OSL is quite problematic due to the small thickness of the beds.

The stream length of various orders is presented in the Table  2. Generally, the total length of stream segments is the maximum in first-order streams and decreases with an increase in the stream order. The law holds true in the present case study. The results reveal that the first-order streams are short in length and are found in the upstream area; similar observations are conformed by Chitra et al. (2011). Streams with relatively short lengths are representative of areas with steep slopes and finer texture, whereas longer lengths of stream are generally indicative of low gradients (Strahler 1964).|$|R

A more detailed investigation of the relationship between backscatter and age of the surfaces was undertaken with calibrated aircraft SAR data. The quantitative relationship between backscatter coefficient and age for the three polarizations is shown. The straight lines connecting the measured data points imply a steady-state process, although the process or processes leading to this relationship may have operated at rates that varied with climate fluctuations, such as the glacial ages. It is expected that the relationship between radar brightness and age is a consistent one, and that with the wider availability of calibrated radar backscatter data, these relationships can be less well-known areas.

A marl formation which began depositing about 25, 000 years ago and continued until the lake diminishe to about its present state 13, 000 years ago, indicates a warm, moist climate at that time.

50|$|These fairly thin beds {{then give}} way to a massive, homogeneous, {{normally}} 8-10 m thick, chalky, rudist-bearing limestone of pure white colour. The massive bed stands out geomorphologically, sometimes forming small cliffs in the countryside. Generally this rock is quite soft (it can be cut with a handsaw), it was therefore quarried extensively for building stone with hundreds of small quarries in operation; most of them have closed down by now. The massive member is affected by important thickness variations (its total thickness normally can vary from 5-12 m, sometimes even reaching 15 m), caused either by <b>tectonic</b> <b>disturbances</b> or by post-depositional erosion (for instance, in the Mareuil Anticline, the upper Angoumian discordantly overlies the lower Angoumian, occasionally even cutting down into it). The chalky limestones are mainly composed of rudist debris with comparatively little cement. The rudist debris consists almost exclusively of the species Biradiolites lumbricalis accompanied by minor Durania cornupastoris, Praeradiolites peroni, Radiolites peroni, Radiolites ponsi, Radiolites beaumonti, Radiolites socialis, and Hippurites requieni. In some places, undamaged rudists (mainly the small-sized Biradiolites) can be encountered in numerous biostromes.
