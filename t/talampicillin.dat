50|$|<b>Talampicillin</b> is a beta lactam {{antibiotic}} {{from the}} penicillin family. It is an acid stable prodrug that was administered orally. It is not {{approved by the}} FDA {{for use in the}} United States.|$|E
50|$|Ampicillin {{remains the}} {{penicillin}} {{of choice for}} many infections because of its oral activity and good potency against Gram-negative bacteria. A number of prodrugs have been examined in attempts to improve upon the pharmacodynamic characteristics, and {{one of these is}} talampicillin.One synthesis involved protecting the primary amino group of ampicillin (1) as the enamine with ethyl acetoacetate (2). THis was then esterified by reaction with 3-bromopthalide (3), and the enamine was carefully hydrolyzed with dilute HCl in acetonitrile to produce <b>talampicillin</b> (4).|$|E
40|$|<b>Talampicillin</b> is a thiazolide {{carboxylic}} ester of ampicillin and is hydrolysed in {{the intestinal}} mucosa to release free ampicillin. The mean peak serum concentration of ampicillin occurred one hour after {{a dose of}} <b>talampicillin</b> and was about twice that attained by an equivalent dose of ampicillin. The presence of food in the stomach reduced and delayed the peak blood levels but {{did not affect the}} total amount of antibiotic absorbed or the urinary recovery. <b>Talampicillin</b> had less effect on the faecal flora in volunteers than ampicillin, and no overgrowth with Candida spp or Staphylococcus aureus was seen. Thirty-eight out of 47 urinary infections were eradicated by a seven-day course of <b>talampicillin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Four {{hundred and}} sixty women with {{uncomplicated}} gonorrhea were treated with a single oral dose of 1. 5 g <b>talampicillin.</b> The success rate among those who attended {{for at least one}} follow-up examination after treatment was 99. 14 %. The antibiotic was well tolerated and no side effects were reported. <b>Talampicillin</b> given under supervision has proved to be the most effective and safest treatment in this area. A smaller dosage of <b>talampicillin</b> than ampicillin is required, the drug is better tolerated by the patient, and the time of nursing staff is saved...|$|E
40|$|<b>Talampicillin</b> was {{effective}} in eradicating the causitive organism in uncomplicated gonorrhoea, with only four treatment failures (1 - 6 %) in 245 patients seen at least once after treatment. Symptoms, such as discharge, were seen in 61 patients at some stage after treatment but 31 of these cases were clear after one or two follow-up visits. The anitbiotic was well tolerated. One patient developed a maculopapular rash, penicillin allergy was reported in two patients, and a generalised itch (possibly penicillin allergy) in one further patient. A total of 241 out of 245 (98 %) cases had the urethral gonococcus successfully eradicated with <b>talampicillin.</b> <b>Talampicillin</b> given in single doses {{appears to be an}} extremely good choice of antibiotic in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea in men...|$|E
40|$|Two {{hundred and}} ten men {{suffering}} from uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis {{were treated with}} one of two treatment schedules. Of 109 patients treated with 3 g ampicillin and 2 g probenecid (group A) there were two recurrences {{in the first week}} after treatment and none in the second week. Of 101 patients treated with 1. 5 g <b>talampicillin</b> and 2 g probenecid (group B), there were three recurrences in the first week and none in the second week. Both antibiotics were well tolerated, but one patient vomited two hours after taking <b>talampicillin.</b> The sensitivity pattern of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to penicillin at The London Hospital has shown an increase in the proportion of more sensitive strains during the last three years. <b>Talampicillin</b> given in a single dose with probenecid is satisfactory in the treatment of acute gonococcal urethritis but, apart from the smaller dosage, it does not offer any advantage over ampicillin with probenecid...|$|E
40|$|Ampicillin {{concentrations}} in human serum and dental granulomas of 31 patients were determined after a single oral dose of <b>talampicillin</b> (equivalent to 500 mg of ampicillin) {{was administered to}} each. The specimens were taken at 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0, and 3. 5 h after the administration of <b>talampicillin.</b> The mean peak ampicillin {{concentrations in}} serum and dental granulomas occurred at identical times, 2. 5 h, and were 8. 29 micrograms/ml (range, 1. 81 to 13. 20 micrograms/ml) and 2. 94 micrograms/g (range, 1. 14 to 7. 16 micrograms/g), respectively. The mean dental granuloma/serum ampicillin concentration ratio at the peak time (2. 5 h) was 0. 42 (range, 0. 29 to 0. 56). Ampicillin concentrations in dental granulomas exceeded most of the MICs for the bacteria commonly isolated from odontogenic infection...|$|E
40|$|<b>Talampicillin</b> was {{administered}} to 31 cases of urinary tract infections. In 31 cases of urinary infections having underlying diseases, the clinical results of trial were excellent in 13 cases, good in 9 cases, moderate in 7 cases and poor in 2 cases. As to the side effect, whole body eruption was found in one case and administration of the drug was discontinued...|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{levels and}} urinary {{concentration}} of <b>Talampicillin</b> were determined in nine healthy 9 men. 691 Talampicilln {{was administered to}} 33 cases of urinary tract infections, mainly female uncomplicated cystitis. The clinical results showed excellent in 16 cases, good in 11 cases and poor in 6 cases. The side effects were found in three cases, gastrointestinal symptom in 1 case, and eruption in 2 cases...|$|E
