50|$|However, the {{electrical}} plugs {{turned out to}} {{not be the only}} problem with the booster. Examination of telemetry also showed that the Titan had actually began experiencing <b>thrust</b> <b>decay</b> before the plug dropped out. Engine No. 1 was unaffected and nearly reached 100% thrust at shutdown, while Engine No. 2 never transitioned to in-flight performance levels. Engineers spent all night combing through the first stage, but failed to find any cause for the <b>thrust</b> <b>decay.</b> Eventually however, one technician identified the problem, which was a plastic dust cover inside the gas generator that had been carelessly left inside when the booster was assembled months earlier at the Martin-Marietta plant, blocking the flow of oxidizer. The cover was removed and the Titan II cleared for another launch attempt.|$|E
50|$|Titan IIIB rockets {{suffered}} four outright failures, and two partial failures. The first failure {{occurred on}} 26 April 1967 during {{the launch of}} a Gambit 3 satellite when the second stage suffered a sudden <b>thrust</b> <b>decay</b> which left it unable to achieve orbital velocity, sending the Agena and GAMBIT into the Pacific Ocean some 400 miles downrange. It {{was not possible to}} determine the cause of the malfunction with certainty, but a fuel line obstruction was believed to be the most likely explanation. Martin-Marietta had no answers except to suggest implementing better quality control measures during assembly of the Titan vehicles. The next launch, on 20 June 1967 was a partial failure; due to a problem with the protective skirt on the second stage, a lower-than-planned orbit was achieved. On 24 October 1969 OPS 8455 was placed into a higher-than-planned orbit by another 23B due to an engine failing to cut off after completing its planned burn, however the payload was able to correct its own orbit.|$|E
50|$|The first {{failure was}} a {{launch of a}} KH-11 photoreconnaissance {{satellite}} on August 28, 1985 when the core stage suffered a propulsion system malfunction and was destroyed by Range Safety. The flight proceeded normally until core engine start at T+108 seconds. An abnormal start transient occurred and Engine 2 began experiencing <b>thrust</b> <b>decay</b> at T+112 seconds. At T+212 seconds, Engine 1 shut down, causing loss of attitude control. The onboard computer shut off Engine 2 at T+256 seconds and began a premature separation and ignition of the second stage. With the Titan now tumbling and headed back towards land, the destruct command was issued at T+272 seconds and the KH-11 crashed into the Pacific Ocean. In addition, during Stage 1's powered flight, the oxidizer tank began leaking N2O2 which was thought to have resulted in loss of lubrication to the Engine 1 turbopump and breakdown of the pinion gear. Attempts by the Navy to salvage booster debris from the ocean floor were largely unsuccessful. Investigators also complained that tracking camera coverage during the core stage burn was inadequate.|$|E
5000|$|Thrust-decay time [...] is a {{term used}} in rocket engine technology. It is the time (usually in seconds) between engine cut-off as ordered by human or {{computer}} guidance input, and the actual complete loss of thrust. Usually engine cut-off is achieved by closing valves that supply propellant to the engine combustion chamber or feed pumps. However, in all practical designs the combustion chamber will still have an amount of propellant in it undergoing the chemical process (or thermal process {{in the case of}} nuclear rocket engines) that creates <b>thrust.</b> <b>Thrust</b> <b>decays</b> to zero when chamber pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure (essentially zero in vacuum).Thrust-decay time is not very predictable and can usually only be measured by firing tests of the particular engine.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} the Variscan orogeny on the Upper Palaeozoic {{succession}} are recognizable throughout central and southern Ireland. The deformation can be zoned using structural styles and trends which illustrate a northward decrease in deformation intensity coupled with increasing control by pre-Variscan structures in the basement. The most intense deformation occurs {{to the south of}} the Dingle-Dungarvan line, where shortening approaches 50 % as a result of layer-parallel shortening, followed by buckling and finally thrusting. The deformatipn is considered to have developed above a shallow-dipping sole thrust which has been located offshore by the SWAT seismic reflection profiles. Cross-faults, which are common throughout the orogen, resulted from N-S shear couples; this is consistent with their origin as accommodation structures due to differential shortening along strike. The original shape of the Munster Basin has exerted a control on the distribution and overall facing of the major structures. The sole thrust extends {{to the north of the}} Dingle-Dungarvan line and the structural zonation of the orogen is due to variations in the stratigraphic level of this thrust. The Leinster Massif is considered to be essentially autochthonous; slip on the sole <b>thrust</b> <b>decays</b> towards the Massif which acted as a rigid, passive block and was partially responsible for the arcuate trend of the orogen...|$|R
40|$|A {{closed form}} {{solution}} is presented for the coplanar transfer between nearby circular orbits for spacecraft {{using their own}} blow down propulsion system. The <b>decaying</b> <b>thrust</b> is applied along the local horizontal and the linearized equation of motion in the orbital elements formulation are {{used to describe the}} transfer which consists of a thrust-coast-relight program. Sensitivity partials are also presented analytically in order to study the effect of maneuver execution errors and various other parameters affecting the blow down propulsion system characteristics on the transfer. This strategy is applied to study the transfer of the TOPEX spacecraft from the Shuttle parking orbit to its final operational orbit...|$|R
40|$|The {{difference}} between the AS- 510 observed and predicted separation distance is attributed to a greater F- 1 engine "tail off" impulse than that used in the separation distance prediction.. The F- 1 <b>thrust</b> <b>decay</b> was normal and not appreciably different from previous (AS- 505 through 509) flights.. Analysis indicates that with an S-IC stage having only four retro motors, failure of one retro motor to ignite would result in marginal separation distances and, in the 3 -sigma case, re-contact of the two stages.. S-IC- 11 and subsequent flight stages were equipped with eight retro motors rather than the planned four...|$|E
40|$|Noncoplanar {{transfers}} between neighboring circular orbits {{are presented}} for spacecraft {{using their own}} low-thrust blow down propulsion system. It is assumed that the out-of-plane angle between the <b>decaying</b> <b>thrust</b> vector and the current orbit plane remains constant for each extended burn. Switching conditions are derived for the cutoff and relight of the propulsion system in order {{to carry out a}} given transfer with inclination change. Furthermore the location where the thrust acceleration is initially applied with respect to the line of nodes of the two orbits is uniquely determined. Finally an analytic derivation of the linearized coplanar motion for stationkeeping and terminal rendezvous studies is also presented and a scheme for deriving the second order correction shown...|$|R
50|$|The {{association}} of the church with these events {{and the absence of}} a royal court until George IV visit in 1822 left the building out of public or architectural interest. The ageing timber roof trusses were replaced by stone walls in 1758-60 by the architect John Douglas and the stonemason James mcPherson. The excessive weight could not be supported by the badly maintained church, probably weakened by the damage during the earlier political events and warfare. The strength of stone vaults truly depends on the containment of their <b>thrusts,</b> which the <b>decayed</b> flying buttresses could not perform any more, and a small movement (less than 1/30 of the span) can cause severe deformation and collapse. It took however six years for the deformation to become alarming, forcing the Barons of the Exchequer (the administrators of the Palace at the time essentially) to close the church in 1766, following inspection by William Mylne. On 2 December 1768 the roof collapsed in two stages, leaving the abbey as it currently stands, a roofless ruin.|$|R
40|$|IUS/SPINSIM {{was written}} to {{evaluate}} a proposed spinning third stage for the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) Jupiter Mission. The third stage of the IUS was not to have altitude control during the solid motor burn for this mission. IUS was to be spun up about its principle thrust axis in the desired attitude prior to ignition of its solid motor. IUS/SPINSIM {{can also be used}} to evaluate the performance of other spinning stages that utilize a fixed burn motor. IUS/SPINSIM is a Six-Degree-of-Freedom simulation for exo-atmospheric flight of an IUS. It assumes the stage is released in orbit at or near its desired inertial attitude, and is spinning slowly. The code models three phases: a coast phase in which further spin-up may occur, a burn stage during which a solid rocket motor (SRM) burn injects the space craft into a transfer trajectory, and a final coast phase. IUS/SPINSIM takes into account the effects of the following: a reaction control system (RCS) spinning the vehicle; SRM <b>thrust</b> buildup, <b>decay,</b> and misalignment; changing mass, center of gravity, principle moments of inertia, cross products of inertia, time derivatives of inertia; jet damping moments; and an oblate gravity model. Numerical integration of the equations of motion using a Runge-Kutta fourth order integrator and small step sizes is used to track the vehicle's position, velocity, attitude and spin rates. Instead of using Euler angles or the Direction Cosine Matrix, Quarternions are used to model the attitude and spinning of the vehicle. This eliminates the renormalization difficulties associated with either of the other methods. Program input is taken from a file, and output is to a print file and a data file suitable for use in plotting. The IUS/SPINSIM is written in FORTRAN 77 for DEC VAX series computers running VMS. The standard distribution medium for this program is a 9 ~track 1600 BPI magnetic tape in DEC VAX BACKUP format. It is also available on a TK 50 tape cartridge in DEC VAX BACKUP format. This program was developed in 1992...|$|R
50|$|Nearly a year {{passed between}} the first Atlas-Able launch in November 1959 and this second attempt due to a {{shortage}} of Atlas boosters as well as intense competition between NASA and the U.S. Air Force {{for use of the}} pads at Cape Canaveral. The spacecraft was launched on Atlas 80D coupled to Thor-Able upper stages including a Hercules ABL solid propellant third stage, one year and a day after the Atlas-Able pad explosion on LC-12. While P-3 had used a recycled booster from the Mercury program, which had a number of custom modifications, P-30's launch vehicle (Atlas 80D) was a standard-configuration Atlas D ICBM with the exception of thicker skin to support the additional weight of the upper stages. Atlas BECO was performed at T+250 seconds and SECO at T+275 seconds. Vernier solo mode was not planned for this launch due to the direct ascent trajectory and VECO was to take place at T+280 seconds, however a malfunction of a timer relay prevented this from happening and the verniers continued operating until propellant depletion. There were also minor problems with the Atlas pneumatic and flight control systems, however none of them negatively affected overall booster performance. At an altitude of about 370 km, the first stage separated from the second stage. The Able second stage ignited and started up properly, however <b>thrust</b> quickly <b>decayed</b> and then dropped to zero. The vehicle was unable to achieve Earth orbit, re-entered, and was believed to have come down somewhere in the Indian Ocean. Signals were returned by the payload for 17 minutes after launch. The mission was designed to reach the Moon approximately 62 hours after launch. The second stage malfunction was attributed to a loss of pressure in the propellant feed system, starving the engine of oxidizer. Although the mission was a failure, ground controllers fired Able VA's onboard liquid propellant hydrazine rocket engine — the first time that an onboard motor was fired on a space vehicle.|$|R
