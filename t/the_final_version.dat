5|$|In the {{drafts of}} the Alien Resurrection screenplay, writer Joss Whedon {{included}} a death {{scene in which}} a lifeform was sucked through {{a gap in the}} hull of a ship. In the second draft, Perez was sucked through a fist-sized breach in the hull of the Auriga; this was changed in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>version</b> to the Newborn being sucked through the window of the Betty. 20th Century Fox executives were skeptical about <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>version,</b> seeing it as a comedic scene contrasting with the overall tone of the Alien franchise, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet persuaded them to leave the scene in.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>versions</b> of <b>the</b> sonatas {{convey the}} {{impression}} of a single unit, and were likely notated in close succession during September 1828. The sonatas were labeled Sonate I, II, III, respectively, and Schubert wrote {{at the bottom of the}} last folio of the third sonata the date September 26. As compared to <b>the</b> sketches, <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>versions</b> are written much more neatly and orderly, with full notation and greater care for small details.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} filming, {{more than}} a million feet of {{negative}} had been used, necessitating significant editing.

5|$|Despite the limitations, Robinett {{was able}} to {{introduce}} concepts {{that at the time}} were unfamiliar to players. He had been able to construct different rooms in the games (thirty in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>version),</b> in days where most games took place only on a single screen. Further, off-screen objects such as the bat would continue to move according to their programming behavior.|$|E
50|$|The {{extent of}} Conradi's help with Liszt's early {{orchestration}} {{has been well}} documented by Liszt scholar Peter Raabe, who demonstrated that, whatever the position regarding initial drafts, <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>versions</b> were always Liszt's own.|$|R

5|$|Fauré {{revised and}} {{enlarged}} the Requiem {{in the years}} between its first performance in 1888 and the publication of <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>version</b> in 1901.

5|$|Ibira {{initially}} pictured Karas as {{a horror}} {{story with a}} vengeance theme. It had a simple plot similar to the manga, Dororo. The protagonist karas is on a quest, slaughtering mikuras to recover the body parts of his murdered lover. Until he recovers all the parts, he assembles them into a katana to kill the mikuras. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>version</b> of Karas {{was more of a}} superhero action story, and originally intended for three leading heroes in the same vein as the Japanese period drama, Sanbiki ga Kiru!. The characters Otoha, Nue, and the human detective Kure were the leads but <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>version</b> primarily focused on Otoha. The presentation of Karas differs in several ways from typical anime. The show maintains a serious tone and never indulges in slapstick, exaggerated facial expressions, or super deformed characters. It avoids heavy expositions. Dialogue tends to be short and viewers have to infer what is going on based on very little presented information. The team had left out substantial amounts of information from the show, printing them in a booklet of the final DVD package.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to official localizations, {{for example the}} one by CD Projekt for the Polish market, fan communities developed Spanish, Hungarian, and Italian fan translations of the game. When Interplay dropped support for Planescape: Torment after the official 1.1 patch, several not yet fixed bugs were corrected by fan created unofficial patches. Other mods add back items and quests omitted from <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>version</b> of the game or new features such as widescreen support.|$|E

5|$|Platform A2 {{is built}} {{along the edge}} of the {{retaining}} wall behind Pyramid A1. It faces west towards the pyramid and has two access stairways. Three successive versions of the platform were built, each overlying the previous.
