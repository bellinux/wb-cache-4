By providing the schools with the resources needed to implement the programme, the Ministry of Education has succeeded in significantly increasing the number of participating schools. More importantly, the programme was also well received by students.|$|E
25|$|Controversy about {{currency}} speculators {{and their}} effect on currency devaluations and national economies recurs regularly. Economists, such as Milton Friedman, have argued that speculators ultimately are a stabilizing influence on the market, and that stabilizing speculation performs the important function of providing a market for hedgers and transferring risk from those people who don't wish to bear it, <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do.</b> Other economists, such as Joseph Stiglitz, consider this argument to be based more on politics and a free market philosophy than on economics.|$|E

For mosques in other areas, it has most commonly been taken that non-Muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by Muslims and if they have a legitimate reason. All entrants regardless of religious affiliation are expected to respect the rules and decorum for mosques.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{study showed}} that among churchgoers, those who go to {{segregated}} or primarily white churches {{are more likely to}} exhibit racist behaviors or to have prejudiced ideas about African Americans.

25|$|Modern {{international}} vocabulary, {{much of it}} Latin or Greek in origin, is {{of course}} used as well, but frequently {{for a family of}} related words only the root will be borrowed directly, and the rest will be derived from it using Esperanto means of word formation. For example, the computer term 'bit' was borrowed directly as bito, but 'byte' was then derived by compounding bito with the numeral ok (eight), for the uniquely Esperanto word bitoko ('an octet of bits'). Although not a familiar form to speakers of European languages, the transparency of its formation is helpful <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not have this advantage. Moreover, even bito has the synonym duumo, based on du (two) and -um- (the affix with undefined meaning).|$|E
25|$|In England and Wales, a Youth Offending Team (YOT) is a multi-agency {{team that}} is coordinated by a local authority, which is overseen by the Youth Justice Board. It deals with young offenders, sets up {{community}} services and reparation plans, and attempts to prevent youth recidivism and incarceration. YOTs were set up following the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act {{with the intention of}} reducing the risk of young people offending and re-offending, and to provide counsel and rehabilitation <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> offend. Youth Offending Teams engage {{in a wide variety of}} work with young offenders (those under 18) in order to achieve their aims. YOTs supervise young people who have been ordered by the court to serve sentences in the community or in the secure estate. Sometimes, teams organise meetings between offenders and victims to encourage apologies and reparation.|$|E
25|$|A team {{consists}} of minimum seven (maximum 21) players, of which six {{are always on}} the pitch, those being the three chasers, one keeper, and two beaters. Besides the seeker who is off-pitch, the six players are required {{to abide by the}} gender rule, which states that a team may have a maximum of four players who identify as the same gender, excluding the seeker, making quidditch one of the few sports that not only offers a co-ed environment but an open community <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not identify with the gender binary. Matches or games often run about 30 to 40 minutes but tend to be subject to varying lengths of time due to the unpredictable nature of the snitch catch. If the score {{at the end of the}} match including the 30 point snitch catch is tied (such that the team that caught the snitch was 30 points behind the other), the game moves to overtime where the snitch is constrained to the pitch's dimensions and the game ends after five minutes or when the snitch is legally caught.|$|E

500|$|Catholics, even if {{they were}} in danger of death and unable to {{approach}} a Catholic minister, may not ask for the sacraments of the Eucharist, penance or anointing of the sick from someone, such as a Protestant minister, who is not known to be validly ordained in line with Catholic teaching on ordination. Likewise, even in grave and pressing need, Catholic ministers may not administer these sacraments <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not manifest Catholic faith in the sacrament. In relation to the churches of Eastern Christianity not in communion with the Holy See, the Catholic Church is less restrictive, declaring that [...] "a certain communion in sacris, and so in the Eucharist, given suitable circumstances and the approval of Church authority, is not merely possible but is encouraged." ...|$|E
500|$|Through the {{depiction}} of the polytheism of Ansul, Le Guin suggests that their beliefs make them more tolerant of religious difference. The Alds refer <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not believe in their god as heathens. Memer, however, thinks to herself that [...] "If [...] meant anything, it meant people who don’t know what’s sacred. Are there any such people? 'Heathen' is merely a word for somebody who knows a different sacredness than you know." [...] Literature scholar Elizabeth Anderson argues that Le Guin's critique is directed more at religious fundamentalism than at monotheism. The Alds' beliefs are more complex than Memer believes: while they despise writing, they value poetry and spoken words, and are moved by Orrec's recitations. While Le Guin criticizes {{the violence of the}} Alds, she also depicts the failed violent uprising in a negative light. A diplomatic settlement is ultimately what ends the conflict, though Memer acknowledges her unsatisfied desire for revenge as Iddor and his followers are escorted out of Ansul to be tried for treason.|$|E
500|$|Trueblood also {{delivered}} {{speeches and}} gave dramatic readings on tours {{all over the}} world. One newspaper noted: [...] "As a reader Prof. Trueblood is well known throughout the west. [...] His readings are taken from the best literature, with special attention to Shakespearean work. [...] It is his plan to give the principal scenes of the play, narrating the unimportant parts, thus providing an entertainment acceptable <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not attend the theater." [...] After a performance of Hamlet in 1908, an Iowa newspaper wrote: [...] "Prof. Trueblood {{is a man of}} remarkable personality. [...] His cuttings of the play were taken from the most dramatic parts, giving a wide range of understanding of all the characters. [...] Not only were the different parts interpreted with extremely keen judgment of the most real kind, but the speaker introduced each division with a brief description and delineation {{of the men and women}} who appeared. [...] Prof. Trueblood's manner of speaking and his diction are acquirements of a very high character and he held the interest of his hearers from beginning to end." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{major theme}} {{in the book is}} the {{characterization}} of child abuse. The story follows Bruce Wayne as he learns about the different categories of child abuse, from the ignorant to the incapable and <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> it for pleasure. Batman, whose motivation is to prevent crimes like the murder of his parents, is contrasted against a social worker whose motivation is protecting children; Batman realizes that throughout his career he had been fighting criminals, not crime. Vachss asserts that [...] "child protection and crime prevention are the same thing"; he believes that child abuse is never just a random crime but is done with intent. While Vachss warns that those abused can become future abusers, he also states that [...] "abuse can push two similarly maltreated children in opposite directions. One incest victim becomes a promiscuous adult, another never engages in sex again. ... If you excuse a serial killer because he was tortured as a child, you disrespect the thousands of children who were treated worse and never imitated their oppressor." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{attempting}} {{to apply the}} Near and Pentagon Papers standards, the court {{was concerned about the}} prospect of publication causing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and potentially a global nuclear holocaust. The government did not {{go so far as to}} claim that publication might pose an immediate or inevitable danger, only that it [...] "would substantially increase the risk that thermonuclear weapons would become available or available at an earlier date <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not now have them. If this should occur, it would undermine our nonproliferation policy, irreparably impair the national security of the United States, and pose a threat to the peace and security of the world." [...] However, the court still found that [...] "a mistake in ruling against the United States could pave the way for thermonuclear annihilation for us all. In that event, our right to life is extinguished and the right to publish becomes moot", and that publication could indeed cause [...] "grave, direct, immediate and irreparable harm to the United States", thereby meeting the test the Supreme Court had enunciated in the Pentagon Papers case. The preliminary injunction was therefore granted.|$|E
