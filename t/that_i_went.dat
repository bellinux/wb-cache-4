Regarding this change in her career path, Fields told Peary in 1980 that [...] "All these young filmmakers are possessive. They feel I belong to them, and they feel a certain resentment - <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to the other side. In calmer moments, of course, they know it isn't true, that I can do more for them now." [...] Of Fields' work at Universal, Joel Schumacher was quoted in 1982 as saying: [...] "In the record business, you have Berry Gordy and Ahmet Ertegün. They're {{executives}} who actually made records. In the movie business, as an executive who's worked with film, you have only Verna. She saves Universal a fortune...every day." ...|$|E

500|$|Killen {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} for the Brittens after creating and developing Lone Star for the Fox network. NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so freaked out by the script <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox.|$|E

The most famous scene {{in this film}} is when Kelly dances with the cartoon mouse Jerry. The animation was supervised by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera and is credited to cartoonist Fred Quimby, but {{the idea for the}} scene was Donen's. Originally Donen and Kelly wanted to use either Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck for the sequence and met with Walt Disney to discuss the project. At the time Disney was working on a similar idea in The Three Caballeros and was unwilling to allow one of his characters to appear in an MGM film. They spent two months shooting Kelly's dancing and Donen spent a year perfecting the scene frame by frame. According to Barbera [...] "the net result at the preview of Anchors Away <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to, blew the audience away." ...|$|E

All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' really is a reflection of that." [...] She stated that {{when it came to the}} production of the track she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it was what she was into at that point. The track was written in February 2010, and when asked about working with Dragonette on the track, Roberts responded, [...] "I was with them for quite a while writing, and they were the first people <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> in with when I started making the record. I learnt a lot from them. They're really lovely people, they work really hard, they're so talented." ...|$|E

500|$|Paolini {{chose to}} have Eragon mature {{throughout}} the book because, [...] "for one thing, it's one of the archetypal fantasy elements". He thought Eragon's growth and maturation {{throughout the book}} [...] "sort of mirrored my own growing abilities {{as a writer and}} as a person, too. So it was a very personal choice for that book." [...] Eragon's dragon, Saphira, was imagined as [...] "the perfect friend" [...] by Paolini. He decided to go in a more [...] "human direction" [...] with her because she is raised away from her own species, in [...] "close mental contact" [...] with a human. [...] "I considered making the dragon more dragon-like, if you will, in its own society, but I haven't had a chance to explore <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> with a more human element with Saphira while still trying to get a bit of the magic, the alien, of her race." [...] Paolini made Saphira the [...] "best friend anyone could have: loyal, funny, brave, intelligent, and noble. She transcended that, however, and became her own person, fiercely independent and proud." [...] Saphira's blue tinted vision was in turn inspired by Paolini's own color-blindness.|$|E

Ganatra explained that although Yusef allegedly tried to save Zainab from the fire, all Masood saw was Zainab locked in a burning kitchen: [...] "we are only playing it from each person's point of view. Yusef is playing it {{from his point of view}} that he did try and save her. Masood is saying, 'All I know is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> back to get her and she had been locked in this kitchen and it was on fire'." [...] Patel said the storyline is a shocking one with a clever twist. In March2011, Bhatti said he was staying with EastEnders until around June 2011, and would [...] "see from there". He made his first appearance on 23November2010. Ganatra spoke at the British Soap Awards 2011 to Digital Spy and praised the impact of Yusef saying,"He's very much an arch-villain - he's a great character who's there to put jeopardy into the Masoods' relationship. Zainab and Masood have been married for 28 years and they're mad about each other - for someone to come and destroy that slightly, it's exciting. It's exciting for us to play." ...|$|E

Many filming locations were established in Downtown Vancouver and its surroundings. Stage shooting for the film {{took place at the}} Canadian Motion Picture Park studio in Burnaby, an adjacent city that forms part of Metro Vancouver. Kosinski devised and constructed twelve to fifteen of the film's sets, including Kevin Flynn's safe house, a creation he illustrated on a napkin for a visual effects test. [...] "I wanted to build as much as possible. It was important to me that this world feel real, and anytime I could build something I did. So I hired guys <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to architecture school with to work on the sets for this film, and hopefully people who watch the film feel like there’s a certain physicality to this world that hopefully they appreciate, knowing that real architects actually put this whole thing together." [...] The film was shot in dual camera 3D using Pace Fusion rigs like James Cameron's Avatar, but unlike the Sony F950 cameras on that film, Tron used the F35s. [...] "The benefit of ," [...] according to director Kosinski, [...] "is that it has a full 35mm sensor which gives you that beautiful cinematic shallow depth of field." [...] The film's beginning portions were shot in 2D, while forty minutes of the film were vertically enhanced for IMAX. Digital Domain was contracted to work on the visual effects, while companies such as Prime Focus Group, DD Vancouver, and Mr. X were brought on to collaborate with producer on the post-production junctures of Tron: Legacy.

[...] A played defending national champion Centre College in the first postseason game in the southwest. [...] In this hard-fought game, which produced national publicity, an underdog Aggie team was slowly defeating a team which had allowed fewer than six points per game. The first half produced so many injuries for A, Coach D. X. Bible feared {{he would not have}} enough men to finish the game. [...] At that moment, he called into the Aggie section of the stands for E. King Gill, a student who had left football after the regular season to play basketball. Gill, who was spotting players for a Waco newspaper and was not in football uniform, donned the uniform of injured player Heine Weir and stood on the sidelines to await his turn. Although he did not actually play in the game, his readiness to play symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game. When the game ended in a 22-14 Aggie victory, Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies. Gill later said, [...] "I wish I could say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> in and ran for the winning touchdown, but I did not. I simply stood by in case my team needed me." [...] A statue of E.
