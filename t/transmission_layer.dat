In the European SuperSmart Grid proposal and the US Unified Smart Grid concept, such super grids have intelligence features in the wide area <b>transmission</b> <b>layer</b> which integrate the local smart grids into a single wide area super grid.

The claim is made that super grids open up markets.In the same way that freeways revolutionized interstate transport and the internet revolutionized online commerce when comprehensive high capacity networks were built, it is argued that a high capacity super grid must be built in order to provide a distribution network so comprehensive and with such available capacity that energy trading is only limited by how much electricity entrepreneurs can bring to market.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanisms {{are given}} as {{conceptual}} {{elements of a}} networked communication system and are linked to specific functional units, for example, as a service or protocol component. In some cases, a mechanism can also comprise an entire protocol. For example on the <b>transmission</b> <b>layer,</b> LTE {{can be regarded as}} such a mechanism. Following this definition, there exist numerous communication mechanisms that are partly equivalent in their basic functionality, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee for local wireless networks and UMTS and LTE for broadband wireless connections. For example, LTE and Wi-Fi have equivalent basic functionality, but they are technologically significantly different in their design and operation. Mechanisms affected by transitions are often components of a protocol or service. For example, in case of video streaming/transmission, the use of different video data encoding can be carried out depending on the available data transmission rate. These changes are controlled and implemented by transitions; A research example is a context-aware video adaptation service to support mobile video applications. Through analyzing the current processes in a communication system, it is possible to determine which transitions need to be executed at which communication layer {{in order to meet the}} quality requirements. In order for communication systems to adapt to the respective framework conditions, architectural approaches of self-organizing, adaptive systems can be used, such as the MAPE cycle [...] (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute). This central concept of Autonomic Computing can be used to determine the state of the communication system, to analyze the monitoring data and to plan and execute the necessary transition(s). A central goal is that users do not consciously perceive a transition while running applications and that the functionality of the used services is perceived as smooth and fluid.|$|E

30|$|More {{sophisticated}} adaptive techniques apply varying antenna weight vectors to the transmit antennas {{depending on}} the radio channel state information. Information about the radio channel state is obtained by explicit feedback from the user equipment to the base station, e.g. in LTE transmission mode TM 4 [13], denoted as closed-loop MIMO transmission. In this case, the UE measures the channel state from known cell-specific reference signals (CRS) on the downlink and determines the best suited transmit antenna weight vector {{to be used by}} the base station on the DL. In order to limit the necessary overhead for such feedback, the transmit weights can only be selected from a standardised codebook containing a limited set of precoding matrices, each containing the weight vectors for the parallel <b>transmission</b> <b>layers.</b> The UE feedback can thereby be limited to the rank indicator (RI) defining the number of possible parallel <b>transmission</b> <b>layers</b> and the precoding matrix indicator (PMI) pointing to the best suited precoding matrix in the codebook.

40|$|Many {{proteins}} and signaling pathways {{are present in}} most cell types and tissues and yet perform specialized functions. To elucidate mechanisms by which these ubiquitous pathways are modulated, we overlaid information about cross-cell line protein abundance and variability, and evolutionary conservation onto functional pathway components and topological layers in the pathway hierarchy. We found that the input (receptors) and the output (transcription factors) layers evolve more rapidly than proteins in the intermediary <b>transmission</b> <b>layer.</b> In contrast, protein expression variability decreases from the input to the output layer. We observed that the differences in protein variability between the input and <b>transmission</b> <b>layer</b> {{can be attributed to}} both the network position and the tendency of variable proteins to physically interact with constitutively expressed proteins. Differences in protein expression variability and conservation are also accompanied by the tendency of conserved and constitutively expressed proteins to acquire somatic mutations, while germline mutations tend to occur in cell type-specific proteins. Thus, conserved core proteins in the <b>transmission</b> <b>layer</b> could perform a fundamental role in most cell types and are therefore less tolerant to germline mutations. In summary, we propose that the core signal transmission machinery is largely modulated by a variable input layer through physical protein interactions.

40|$|AbstractThe recent {{discussion}} on “Digital Mine” (DM) and “Next Generation Network” (NGN) {{has made them}} the hot topics in both the research area of mining and communication network. Then the concept of “Mine Next Generation Network” (MNGN) came up. Following the idea of MNGN, It was also proved to be so clear that the DM integrated transmission platform should be set up first to work as carrier platform. And it was called Mine Next Generation Network <b>Transmission</b> <b>Layer</b> Platform (MNGN-TLP) in this paper. RPR technology was preferred for transmission construction in MNGN-TLP.

On this basis, some crucial technologies in the <b>transmission</b> <b>layer</b> were put more emphasis on. We propose a ring-label based inter-ring transmission method for inter-ring transmission. The proposed loose explicit routing algorithm works well for inter-ring transmission. Each ring in the network has its own ring label. The labels of each ring that the packets would pass by were recorded by reverse order in the header of the packet, which helps {{to build up the}} path for the reply packet. Based on the scheme, we built up the simulation platform for inter-ring transmission of MNGN-TLP platform in NS 2 environment for validation.

The feedback calculation is an intelligent way of quantizing the CSI, it comprises the precoding matrix indicator (PMI), rank indicator (RI) and channel quality indicator (CQI). By the CQI feedback, the transmitter selects one of 15 MCSs.

40|$|Abstract- Recently, the {{importance}} of underwater wireless optical communication has been grown for applications of underwater observation and sea monitoring systems. This communication technology is expected to play {{a prominent role in}} investigating climate changes, prediction of natural disasters, discovery of natural resources, marine biology in lake, sea, and ocean environment. Though acoustic modems have long been the default wireless communication method for under water applications due to their long range, the need for high speed communication has prompted the exploration of non-acoustic methods that `have previously been overlooked due to their distance limitations. Optical wireless communication has been proposed as the best alternative in order to overcome the limitations in acoustic underwater communication. In this paper we have presented three scenarios regarding underwater optical wireless communication. They are a) Line of sight (LOS) b) Modulating Retro Reflector link c) Reflective link. In this analysis, each scenario has been tested with water having different extinction coefficient and various noise backgrounds. We analysed these links in OPTI SYSTEM.

The first layer of the interference network is the backhaul layer between macro base stations (MB) and {{small cell base stations}} (SB), which is modeled as a Wyner type linear network. The second layer is the <b>transmission</b> <b>layer</b> between SBs and mobile terminals (MTs), which is modeled as a linear Wyner L_T network, i. e., each MT is connected to L_T+ 1 SBs. The SBs are assumed to be half-duplex, thus restricting the per user degrees of freedom (puDoF) in the system to 1 / 2. The puDoF can be further restricted by the number of antennas at the MB. For L_T ∈{ 1, 2 }, the optimal puDoF can be achieved by using simple interference avoidance schemes. The increase in the connectivity of <b>transmission</b> <b>layer</b> beyond L_T= 2 limits the achievable puDoF using only zero-forcing schemes to less than 1 / 2, even in the presence of large number of antennas at each MB but the optimal puDoF can be achieved by making each message available at multiple SBs. This is done by sending an appropriate linear combination to the SB to zero-force interference at the intended user. The maximum per user DoF of 1 / 2 can be achieved in the linear network with sufficient number of antennas using only interference avoidance schemes.
