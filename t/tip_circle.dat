5000|$|Certain cams can be {{characterized}} by their displacement diagrams, which reflect the changing position a roller follower (a shaft with a rotating wheel at the end) would make as the cam rotates about an axis. These diagrams relate angular position, usually in degrees, to the radial displacement experienced at that position. Displacement diagrams are traditionally presented as graphs with non-negative values. A simple displacement diagram illustrates the follower motion at a constant velocity rise followed by a similar return with a dwell in between as depicted in figure 2. The rise is {{the motion of the}} follower away from the cam center, dwell is the motion where the follower is at rest, and return is the motion of the follower toward the cam center.However, the most common type is in the valve actuators in internal combustion engines. Here, the cam profile is commonly symmetric and at rotational speeds generally met with, very high acceleration forces develop. Ideally, a convex curve between the onset and maximum position of lift reduces acceleration, but this requires impractically large shaft diameters relative to lift. Thus, in practice, the points at which lift begins and ends mean that a tangent to the base circle appears on the profile. This is continuous with a tangent to the <b>tip</b> <b>circle.</b> In designing the cam, the lift and the dwell angle [...] are given. If the profile is treated as a large base circle and a small <b>tip</b> <b>circle,</b> joined by a common tangent, giving lift [...] , the relationship can be calculated, given the angle [...] between one tangent and the axis of symmetry ( [...] being [...] ), while [...] is the distance between the centres of the circles (required), and [...] is the radius of the base (given) and [...] that of the <b>tip</b> <b>circle</b> (required) ...|$|E

In {{order to}} obtain 3 D solid model of an Oerlikon system’s prolate epicycloidal bevel gear by full {{generating}} processing, the solid modeling method for the gear was studied in Pro/E. First, Drawing benchmark circles (base on the circle and reference circle as well as <b>tip</b> <b>circle</b> and root circle) and involute tooth profile of virtual equivalent gears of both large end and small end of the real gear, and then an intercepted segment of prolate epicycloid which has the same trend to the tooth and is controlled by prolate epicycloidal equations is projected {{to the surface of}} the gear’s root cone for the sake of getting tooth curve along axial direction. In the end, along the tooth curve and on the root cone conducting a variable cross section solid scanning to tooth shaped cross section, a complete gear tooth will be gained and at last model establishing will be finished. This method provided digital basis for optimization design, reverse design and rapid prototyping of this kind of gear, and so its design efficiency is improved...|$|E

In order to improve the bending strength of gear, the shape of three kinds of transition curve (ordinary fillet cutter <b>tip,</b> single <b>circle</b> arc cutter <b>tip</b> and double <b>circle</b> arc cutter <b>tip)</b> was analyzed respectively, the relationship of double <b>circle</b> arc cutter <b>tip</b> parameters was established, the relation model of sensitive part of gear and stress concentration factor (J and γ) was determined, the effect of different transition curves of gear on bending strength (minJ) was explored. The results of analysis show that the bending strength of gear cut by double <b>circle</b> arc cutter <b>tip</b> increases by 10 % comparing with that of gear cut by ordinary fillet cutter tip.

40|$|A {{computer}} model of flagella in which oscillation results from regulation of active sliding force by sliding velocity can simulate {{the movements of}} very short flagella and cilia. Of particular interest are {{the movements of the}} short (2 – 3 µm) nodal cilia of the mammalian embryo, which determine the development of the asymmetry of the internal organs. These cilia must generate a counterclockwise (viewed from base to <b>tip)</b> <b>circling</b> motion. A three-dimensional {{computer model}}, with active force generated by a simple mathematical formulation and regulated by sliding velocity, can generate this circling motion if a time delay process is included in the control specification. Without the introduction of a symmetrybreaking mechanism, the computer models start randomly in either direction, and maintain either clockwise or counterclockwise circling. Symmetry can be broken by at least two mechanisms: (1) control of dynein activity on one outer doublet by sliding velocity can be influenced by the sliding velocity experienced on an adjacent outer doublet, or (2) a constant twist of the axoneme caused by an off-axis component of dynein force. This second mechanism appears more reasonable, but its effectiveness is highly dependent upon specifications for the elastic resistances of the model. These symmetry-breaking mechanisms need to be present only at the beginning of circling. With these models, once a circling direction is established, it remains stable even if the symmetry-breaking mechanism is removed...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{describe}} an innovative 1. 7 -mm-diameter, latex-free aspirator <b>tip</b> attachment (<b>Circle</b> Medical B. V. Wijchen, The Netherlands). This tip {{is designed to}} be used during tumor resection to avoid surgical trauma to the spinal cord surrounding an intramedullary tumor and the associated blood vessels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 2004, we have used a this device during tumor dissection for 36 patients with intramedullary spinal cord tumors (21 ependymomas, 7 astrocytomas, 6 hemangioblastomas, and 2 cavernomas) and 1 patient with an arteriovenous malformation. The innovative feature of this attachment is the removable and disposable, soft, thermoplastic elastomer tip that is fenestrated to keep air flowing and prevent a vacuum. RESULTS: During its use, this aspirator tip did not adhere to tissue, including swollen spinal cord tissue that surrounded the tumors. We found that the tip is used more as a dissector than an aspirator. It must be cleaned two or three times per intervention; however, it was never necessary to change it. CONCLUSION: This new, safe, soft-tipped suction tip attachment can increase surgical safety during intramedullary tumor removal and its use may be extended to other neurosurgical indications such as cauda equina tumors and any lesion that requires nerve and vessel dissection.

5000|$|In basic Baithak Gana {{there are}} three {{instruments}} (though there are other instruments that could {{be added to the}} ensemble), harmonium, dholak and the dhantal. The harmonium is a free-standing keyboard instrument similar to a reed organ. The dholak is a double headed drum that originated in Northern India, however, it is still used in the folk songs from Pakistan or Nepal. The last instrument that is used in this style of music is the dhantal which serves as the rhythmic piece of the ensemble, it consists of a long steel rod which is then [...] "struck" [...] by a U-formed piece, the origin of this device is unclear, as it may have been brought by the Indian indentured-laborers.

The U-shaped handle piece was derived the use of a horse shoe.|$|R
5000|$|When the First World War {{started in}} 1914 {{it was the}} habit of ground troops to fire on all aircraft, friend or foe, so {{that the need for}} some form of {{identification}} mark became evident. At first the Union Flag was painted under the wings and {{on the sides of the}} fuselage. It soon became obvious that at a distance the St George's Cross of the Union Flag was likely to be confused with the Iron Cross that was already being used to identify German aircraft. After the use of a Union Flag inside a shield was tried it was decided to follow the lead of the French who used a tricolour cockade (a roundel of red and white with a blue centre). The British reversed the colours and it became the standard marking on Royal Flying Corps aircraft from 11 December 1914, although it was well into 1915 before the new marking was used with complete consistency. The official order stated: All aeroplanes of the RFC to be marked on the underside and on the rudder with concentric circles similar to those on the French machines but with the colours reversed, that is with a red circle inside a blue ring. The circles to be as large as possible. In addition a Union Jack 2ft x 1½ft will be painted on the wing <b>tips</b> outside the <b>circles.</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} account for the {{peculiar}} trend in the SiNW etch rate, the etch rates at the tip and base of the SiNWs were also determined from the cross-sectional SEM images by aligning the micrograph of an etched Si sample with that of an unetched Si sample from the same wafer at the backside (see Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). From Fig.  2 c, {{it can be seen that}} the etch rate at the SiNW base (square symbols) monotonically increases with AgNP deposition time. On the other hand, three domains can be seen from the trend line of the SiNW <b>tip</b> etch rate (<b>circle</b> symbols): (a) ≤ 1  min, where the etch rate is relatively high; (b) between 1 and 6  min, where the etch rate is relatively low; and (c) ≥ 6  min, where the etch rate is the highest. Thus, the initial increase in SiNW etch rate from the deposition time of 10  s to 1  min was due to the constant increase in etch rate at the base, while the subsequent increase in etch rate at deposition times of 2 and 4  min was due to the relatively low etch rates at the tips. Meanwhile, the drop in SiNW etch rate at the deposition time of 6  min and the relatively low etch rates in the succeeding deposition times were caused by the increase in etch rate at the tips.|$|R
60|$|If we {{take hold}} of a growing sapling, we can of course bend it to all sides in succession, {{so as to make}} the <b>tip</b> {{describe}} a <b>circle,</b> like that performed by the summit of a spontaneously revolving plant. By this movement the sapling is not in the least twisted round its own axis. I mention this because if a black point be painted on the bark, on the side which is uppermost when the sapling is bent towards the holder's body, as the circle is described, the black point gradually turns round and sinks to the lower side, and comes up again when the circle is completed; and this gives the false appearance of twisting, which, in the case of spontaneously revolving plants, deceived me for a time. The appearance is the more deceitful because the axes of nearly all twining-plants are really twisted; and they are twisted in the same direction with the spontaneous revolving movement. To give an instance, the internode of the Hop of which the history has been recorded, was at first, as could be seen by the ridges on its surface, not in the least twisted; but when, after the 37th revolution, it had grown 9 inches long, and its revolving movement had ceased, it had become twisted three times round its own axis, in the line of the course of the sun; on the other hand, the common Convolvulus, which revolves in an opposite course to the Hop, becomes twisted in an opposite direction.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{model for}} stress-induced phase {{transformation}} surrounding the crack tip during mode III fracture of shape memory alloys (SMAs) is introduced. Considering {{a state of}} small-scale yielding and J 2 plasticity (loading only), the shape {{and size of the}} martensite (M), the austenite (A) and the transformation zone (A→M) are fully determined. For a fixed crack length, the zones of constant strain around the crack <b>tip</b> develop as <b>circles.</b> The width of the A→M transformation zone and the martensite both depend linearly on the crack length. Moreover, the crack tip is surrounded by martensite under plastic deformation. The theoretical model is then extended to examine the mode III fracture behavior of Nickel–Titanium (Nitinol), and these results are compared to FEM analysis of a edge crack torsion (ECT) test for an isotropic material. The size of stress-induced martensite zone in the FEM analysis is underestimated by about 50 % from the theoretical model, due largely to the difference in the computed and theoretical stress–strain relation. However, the model and simulation show remarkable agreement {{on the size of the}} A→M transformation zone (error< 5 %), which dominates the region surrounding the crack tip. In addition, the model predictions accurately match the FEM analysis in determining the radii circles of constant strain in the vicinity of the crack tip, and the shape and size of the plastically deformed martensite zone. The results presented in this paper provide a first step to better understand the mechanics of fracture in shape memory alloys under mode III loading...|$|R
50|$|Paeonia mairei is a {{perennial}} herbaceous plant {{of up to}} 1 m high, that dies down in the autumn, and overwinters with buds just {{under the surface of}} the soil. It has thick roots that become thinner towards their tips, while the rootstocks is approximately 2 cm in diameter. Young shoots and leaves are initially red-purple to pink. The stems and leaves are hairless. The largest leaves, near the base of the stem are split into three, which parts themselves are split into leaflets, some of which may be incised, up to nineteen in total, 6—16½ × 1¾—7 cm, gradually broadening at their base and usually pointy at their tip. Veins are deeply sunken on the top-side of the leaf. Each stem bears only one flower at its tip of between 7½ and 14 cm wide. Each flower is accompanied by one to three leaflike or linear bracts of up to 9 cm long. Each flower has three to five, green and broadly oval sepals of 1—1½ × ⅞—1¼ cm. The seven to nine, inverted egg-shaped, pink to Spanish carmine petals are 3½—7 × 2—4½ cm, with a usually rounded <b>tip.</b> Within the <b>circle</b> of petals is a circle of stamens that consist of purple-red filaments topped by yellow anthers. Within is a low, yellow, ring-shaped disc, that encircles the base of the two or three carpels, which may be sparsely to densely covered in short yellow or golden brown felty hairs, or rarely hairless. Those are topped by styles of up to 4 mm long, that have red stigmas. Each carpel develops into a dry fruit that opens with a suture (or follicle) of 3—3½ × 1—1¼ cm. The inside of the fruit is bright red which contrast well with the blue shiny seeds. This peony species in his native range flowers in April and May, and produces seed in August. Paeonia mairei has both diploid and tetraploid populations (2n=10, 4n=20).|$|R
