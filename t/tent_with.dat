5|$|A {{century of}} storms and snow have covered the cairn and tent, {{which are now}} encased in the Ross Ice Shelf as it inches towards the Ross Sea. In 2001 {{glaciologist}} Charles R. Bentley estimated that the <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> the bodies was under about 75feet (23m) of ice and about 30miles (48km) from {{the point where they}} died; he speculated that in about 275 years the bodies would reach the Ross Sea, and perhaps float away inside an iceberg.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the final}} scene, other aspects were discussed: Garcia noted the acting of Richard Madden {{and how the}} Freys had been introduced. Ryan praised {{the wide range of}} {{emotions}} used by Emilia Clarke while playing Daenerys, and how Peter Dinklage played Tyrion's frustration and confusion during the episode. Both she and McNutt were glad that Tyrion's exposition scene in the <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> Bronn and Shae did not use sex to keep viewers, as was done in past episodes.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 1944, Derrick {{was posted}} to an officer cadet {{training}} unit in Victoria. He requested {{that he be}} allowed to rejoin the 2/48th Battalion {{at the end of}} the course; contrary to normal Army policy that prevented officers commissioned from the ranks from returning to their previous units. An exemption was granted to Derrick only after much lobbying. While at this unit, Derrick shared a <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> Reg Saunders, who later became the Army's first Indigenous Australian officer.|$|E
50|$|The basic dome {{design has}} been {{modified}} extensively, producing <b>tents</b> <b>with</b> three poles, <b>tents</b> <b>with</b> irregularly-shaped bases, and other unusual types. A common variation {{is to add}} a third pole between two adjacent corners; this is angled away from the tent and supports {{an extension of the}} flysheet, to give a porch/storage area.|$|R
50|$|The display {{includes}} seven miniature video stations {{positioned in}} various <b>tents</b> <b>with</b> documentary footage of circus {{life from the}} 1920s and 1930s.|$|R
5000|$|Dome tents have a {{very simple}} {{structure}} and are available {{in a wide variety}} of sizes ranging from lightweight 2-person <b>tents</b> <b>with</b> limited headroom up to 6 or 9-person <b>tents</b> <b>with</b> headroom exceeding 180 cm. These may be single wall, or single-wall with partial flysheet, or double wall. Depending on the pole arrangement, some models pitch outer-tent first, while others pitch inner-tent first. The former helps keep the inner tent dry, but the latter is easier to pitch.|$|R
5|$|The {{plot of the}} novella {{describes}} the life journey of fourteen-year-old Eréndira, who is living with her grandmother when she accidentally sets fire to their home. The grandmother forces Eréndira to repay the debt by becoming a prostitute as they travel the road as vagrants. Men line up to enjoy Eréndira's services. She eventually escapes {{with the assistance of}} her affectionate and somewhat gullible lover, Ulises, but only after he murders her grandmother. After the murder, Eréndira runs off into the night alone, leaving him in the <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> the dead body of her grandmother.|$|E
25|$|By 1620 Kepler used a {{portable}} camera obscura <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> a modified telescope to draw landscapes. It {{could be turned}} around to capture the surroundings in parts.|$|E
25|$|Sarno later {{developed}} the Circus Circus. The attraction featured a circus <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> daily acts, and Sarno would dress up as a ringmaster and attend to {{families and children}} personally. Sarno subsequently leased it to Bill Pennington and Bill Bennett, a Del Webb executive, and they purchased it in 1983.|$|E

25|$|Claus sees {{stockings}} {{placed by}} the fire to dry are {{a good place for}} his surprises; but when he finds a family (sometimes taken to be Native Americans, or caricatures of the same) living in a <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> no fireplaces, he places the gifts on the branches of the trees just outside the tent.|$|E
25|$|The Faisal Mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan, in a {{relatively}} unusual design fuses contemporary lines with the more traditional look of an Arab Bedouin's <b>tent,</b> <b>with</b> its large triangular prayer hall and four minarets. However, unlike traditional mosque design, it lacks a dome. The mosque's architecture is {{a departure from the}} long history of South Asian Islamic architecture.|$|E
25|$|The Arabs {{took great}} booty, {{including}} the entire imperial army's baggage train, which the Byzantines abandoned in their hasty flight. Among the spoils was the sumptuous imperial <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> its treasures, which allegedly {{had to be}} carried off on seventy camels. According to historian Thierry Bianquis, Nasr's Numayri allies alone captured 300 mules carrying gold denarii coins. Only the holy icon of the Theotokos, which the Byzantine emperors habitually carried along on campaigns, was saved.|$|E
50|$|It is {{recommended}} that wall tents are set up by two or three people. <b>Tents</b> <b>with</b> a sewn-in floor are typically harder to set up if they have internal frames.|$|R

25|$|Their first {{display of}} the VK-30 was at the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh airshow in 1987, before the plane had taken its first flight. The {{brothers}} set up a small <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> the aircraft out front and were prepared to greet potential buyers as they approached. Still young and new to the industry, {{the two of them}} anticipated large crowds at their booth after printing several order forms, but zero kit orders were received then and only a few pilots expressed serious interest in making a purchase.|$|E
25|$|Simonides, his {{daughter}} Esther, and Malluch talk together, and conclude that Judah is who {{he claims to}} be, {{and that he is}} on their side in the fight against Rome. Messala realizes that Judah Ben-Hur has been adopted into a Roman home and his honor has been restored. He threatens to take revenge. Meanwhile, Balthasar and {{his daughter}} Iras arrive at the Sheik's <b>tent.</b> <b>With</b> Judah they discuss how the Christ, approaching the age of thirty, is ready to enter public leadership. Judah takes increasing interest in the beautiful Iras.|$|E
25|$|Orr {{shares a}} <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> Yossarian, {{and is very}} {{mechanically}} adept, as he manages to make for them the most luxurious tent in the squadron. When working on small pieces for an oven stove in the tent, Yossarian sees his work as arduous and highly unnecessary as the pieces are too small for anything of real concern, yet at the end while using his stove, he realizes the intricate simplicity of improving the stove's performance. Although this tinkering drives Yossarian mad, any idea of harming Orr is so absurd that Yossarian can't follow through with it.|$|E
60|$|The new-comers were halting for the day, and Mr Harvey and {{the boys}} were soon seated in <b>tents,</b> <b>with</b> three bottles of beer in front of them, a luxury which they heartily enjoyed, having been a any months without tasting it.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} a tourist destination. There are {{numerous}} campsites including an anchorage for the Southport Yacht Club and Dux Campsite, owned by The Southport School. Tipplers {{was purchased by}} the Gold Coast City Council in 2009. Due to ongoing encroachment of the sand dunes, the Council-run Bedrooms Campsite was closed in 2013. The Council has three alternate campgrounds: Tipplers that accommodates up to 100 <b>tents</b> <b>with</b> gas BBQs, a children's play area, and a kiosk that has basic camping supplies including ice and firewood; and North and South Currigee that together accommodates up to 80 <b>tents</b> <b>with</b> access to BBQs, a children's play area, and a mini kiosk for basic camping supplies.|$|R
5000|$|Instead of {{following}} Thon's Byzantine five-dome canon, Gornostaev chose to reincarnate the tented roofs of traditional northern Russia. At the same time, feeling {{limitations of this}} narrow approach, he augmented Russian <b>tents</b> <b>with</b> Romanesque vaults and arches. His input to Valaam reconstruction include: ...|$|R
25|$|In {{his history}} of the 32nd Armoured Regiment, Maurizio Parri wrote that a company of the II Medium Tank Battalion with its M11/39s had tried to {{counter-attack}} the British Matildas but the crews misunderstood flag signals, which caused delays and the attack failed. In 1944, Moorehead wrote that Maletti was wounded while rallying his men, then retreated to his <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> a machine-gun, where he was killed. Maletti's mortal remains were to be seen {{at the entrance of}} his tent when war correspondents visited the camp. Moorehead wrote that he saw unattended donkeys wandering around looking for water and soldiers looting extravagant Italian army uniforms and lunching on luxury foods, wines and Recoaro mineral water. New equipment, weapons and ammunition strewed the ground, already disappearing under the sand and dozens of dug-outs were found to be full of food, new equipment and ammunition.|$|E
25|$|He is briefly {{mentioned}} in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where following the Death Eaters attack at the Quidditch World Cup, Mundungus {{put in an}} insurance claim to the Ministry of Magic for a twelve-bedroomed <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> an en-suite jacuzzi, while in reality he had been sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks. As a member of both the original and the newly reformed Order of the Phoenix, he is assigned guard duty to protect Harry, but abandons his position to conduct a shady cauldron-trading deal, leaving a critical opening through which Dementors manage to attack Harry. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry catches Mundungus outside the Three Broomsticks trying to sell what had been Sirius's property (which now belongs to Harry after Sirius's death) to Aberforth, and the boy confronts him. Mundungus goes into hiding but is later jailed in Azkaban for impersonating an Inferius during a botched robbery.|$|E
25|$|In 200, Xu Chu {{followed}} Cao Cao to the Battle of Guandu {{against the}} northern warlord Yuan Shao. During the battle, Xu Ta (徐他) and some conspirators plotted to assassinate Cao Cao. They feared Xu Chu so they {{waited until he}} went to rest before they entered Cao Cao's <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> swords hidden under their clothes. Xu Chu felt uneasy earlier on, so he had returned to Cao Cao's tent to protect his lord. When Xu Ta and the others showed up in Cao Cao's tent, they were very surprised to see Xu Chu there and could not contain their astonishment. Xu Chu sensed their intentions and killed them. After this incident, Cao Cao trusted Xu Chu even more and would go nowhere without Xu by his side. Xu Chu participated in the Battle of Ye in 204 and received {{the title of a}} Secondary Marquis (關內侯) as a reward for his efforts.|$|E
60|$|He gloated on fly-rods and {{gorgeous}} rubber hip-boots, on <b>tents</b> <b>with</b> celluloid windows and folding chairs and ice-boxes. He simple-heartedly {{wanted to buy}} all of them. It was the Paul whom he was always vaguely protecting who kept him from his drunken desires.|$|R
5000|$|Louisiana College, {{known as}} [...] "LC", {{was founded on}} October 3, 1906, in Pineville, across the Red River from the larger Alexandria.

50|$|The Gäubodenvolksfest is {{a modern}} and family-friendly festival with about 120 carousels, roller {{coasters}} and six big beer <b>tents</b> <b>with</b> 25,000 seats at an area of about 90,000 m²., but it has upheld its traditional character. Many of the approximately 1.2 million visitors wear Bavarian costume ("Trachten").|$|R
25|$|His {{childhood}} was impoverished; as a boy, Stu Hart {{lived in a}} <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> his family on the prairie in Alberta, living off the land, milking cows and wild game that Stu took down with his slingshot. As a child Hart and his sisters were often mistreated at school by both fellow students and teachers since it was well known that they were from such a poor family. Hart was also berated and treated with disdain for being lefthanded, something seen as deviant at the time. Like most lefthanded children at the time, {{he was forced to}} work with his right, and as a result he became ambidextrous. In 1928, his father was arrested for failure to pay back taxes, while the Salvation Army sent Stu, his mother, and two sisters, Sylvester and Edrie to live in Edmonton. Due to his destitute childhood and youth Hart did not experience a dramatic shift in life quality or mentality during the Great Depression which affected most others around him in Edmonton.|$|E
25|$|Rabbinic {{literature}} also records {{a tradition}} of eating cheese and other dairy products during Hanukkah. This custom, as mentioned above, commemorates the heroism of Judith during the Babylonian captivity of the Jews and reminds us that women also {{played an important role}} in the events of Hanukkah. The deuterocanonical book of Judith (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the Tanakh, records that Holofernes, an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the beheading of Holofernes by Judith has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.|$|E
500|$|Tom fills his <b>tent</b> <b>with</b> {{electronics}} and other extravagant items from Sky Mall, {{a chain of}} luxury item retail stores. He nicknames the tent [...] "The Thunderdome", named after the gladiator arena in the action film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985). While watching TV inside his tent, Tom claims to be recording the Food Network show Cupcake Wars, the CBS police procedural drama [...] and the sixth season of the Bravo reality series Top Chef. Later, while pitching his idea for a Pawnee amphitheatre, Tom expresses hope it would entice performances from such rappers as Lil Wayne, Drake and Jay-Z.|$|E
50|$|In a nine-minute procession, 51 {{members of}} the Imperial Household Agency, clad in {{traditional}} gray Shinto costumes, carried the 1.5 ton Sokaren (Imperial Palanquin) containing the 3-layered coffin of the Shōwa Tennō into the funeral hall, as they walked up the aisle between the white <b>tents</b> <b>with</b> domestic and foreign dignataries.|$|R
60|$|As {{they climbed}} the slope {{on the other}} side of the river, they looked back at the <b>tents</b> <b>with</b> their wilted streamers, at the {{swarming}} bug-like teams and the ant-like human beings, and it seemed to Rose as if she should weep, so poignant was her sense of personal loss.|$|R
60|$|While {{this was}} doing, others cut down {{branches}} {{of trees and}} built us two large booths, and five or six smaller, and we made two <b>tents</b> <b>with</b> some old sails; and thus we encamped, {{as if we had}} been to take up our dwelling, and intended to people the island.|$|R
