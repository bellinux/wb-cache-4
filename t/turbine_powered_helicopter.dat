50|$|The {{tail rotor}} is <b>powered</b> by the <b>helicopter's</b> main <b>power</b> plant, and rotates {{at a speed}} {{proportional}} {{to that of the}} main rotor. In both piston and <b>turbine</b> <b>powered</b> <b>helicopters,</b> the main rotor and the tail rotor are mechanically connected through a freewheeling clutch system, which allows the rotors to keep turning {{in the event of an}} engine failure by mechanically de-linking the engine from both the main and tail rotors. During autorotation, the momentum of the main rotor continues to power the tail rotor and allow directional control. To optimize its function for forward flight, the blades of a tail rotor have no twist to reduce the profile drag, because the tail rotor is mounted with its axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction of flight.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{and compares}} regression and {{artificial neural network}} models used for the estimation of wind <b>turbine</b> <b>power</b> curves. First, characteristics of wind <b>turbine</b> <b>power</b> generation are investigated. Then, models for <b>turbine</b> <b>power</b> curve estimation using both regression and neural network methods are presented and compared. The parameter estimates for the regression model and training of the neural network are completed with the wind farm data, and the performances of the two models are studied. The regression model is shown to be function dependent, and the neural network model obtains its power curve estimation through learning. The neural network model is found to possess better performance than the regression model for <b>turbine</b> <b>power</b> curve estimation under complicated influence factors. #DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 1413216 #...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} the fuzzy modeling {{approach to the}} description of wind <b>turbine</b> <b>power</b> curve. The fuzzy system model is basically a collection of fuzzy IF-THEN rules that are combined via fuzzy reasoning for describing the features of a system under study. The method of fuzzy modeling has been proven to be well-suited for modeling nonlinear industrial processes described by input-output data. In view of the nonlinear characteristic of wind <b>turbine</b> <b>power</b> curve, the method of fuzzy modeling is employed for representing the curve. Based on the Sugeno-type fuzzy model, various models with different numbers of modeling rules are used to describing the power curve which depicts the <b>turbine</b> output <b>power</b> under various wind speeds. It is found that such fuzzy model offers both quantitative and qualitative descriptions for the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>power</b> curve.
