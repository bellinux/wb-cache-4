40|$|Traditionally, {{efficient}} algorithms for computing {{a minimal}} triangulation of a graph (i. e. embedding a graph into a <b>triangulated</b> <b>graph</b> {{by adding a}}n inclusion-minimal set of edges) required first computing a special ordering on the vertices of the graph, called a minimal ordering.

Computing a minimal triangulation consists in embedding a given graph into a <b>triangulated</b> <b>graph</b> by adding a set of edges (called a fill). If the set of edges added is inclusion-minimal, the fill {{is said to be}} minimal, and the corresponding <b>triangulated</b> <b>graph</b> is called a minimal triangulation.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Computing and Information SciencesWilliam HsuBayesian {{networks}} are graphical models whose nodes represent random variables and whose edges represent conditional dependence between variables. Each node in a Bayesian network {{is equipped with}} a conditional probability function that expresses the likelihood that the node will take on different values given the values of its parents. A common task for a Bayesian network is to perform inference by computing the marginal probabilities of each possible value for each node. In this thesis, I introduce three new algorithms for approximate inference of Bayesian networks that use edge deletion techniques. The first reduces a network to its maximal weight spanning tree using the Kullback-Leibler information divergence as edge weights, and then runs Pearl’s algorithm on the resulting tree. Because Pearl’s algorithm can perform inference on a tree in linear time, as opposed to the exponential running time of all general exact inference algorithms, this reduction results in a tremendous speedup in inference. The second algorithm applies triangulation pre-processing rules that are guaranteed to be optimal if the original graph has a treewidth of four or less, and then deletes edges from the network and continues applying rules so that the resulting <b>triangulated</b> <b>graph</b> will have a maximum clique size of no more than five. The junction tree exact inference algorithm can then be run on the reduced <b>triangulated</b> <b>graph.</b> While the junction tree algorithm has an exponential worst-case running time {{in the size of the}} maximum clique in the <b>triangulated</b> <b>graph,</b> placing a bound on the clique size effectively places a polynomial time bound on the inference procedure. The third algorithm deletes edges from a triangulation of the original network until the maximum clique size in the <b>triangulated</b> <b>graph</b> is below a desired bound. Again, the junction tree algorithm can then be run on the resulting <b>triangulated</b> <b>graph,</b> and the bound on the maximum clique size will also polynomially bound the inference time. When tested for efficiency and accuracy on common Bayesian networks, these three algorithms perform up to 10, 000 times faster than current exact and approximate techniques while achieving error values close to those of sampling techniques...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A BN 2 O {{network is}} a Bayesian network having the {{structure}} of a bipartite graph with all edges directed from one part (the top level) toward the other (the bottom level) and where all conditional probability tables are noisy-or gates. In order to perform efficient inference, graphical transformations of these networks are performed. The efficiency of inference is proportional to the total table size of tables corresponding to the cliques of the <b>triangulated</b> <b>graph.</b> Therefore in order to get efficient inference it is desirable to have small cliques in the <b>triangulated</b> <b>graph.</b> We analyze existing heuristic triangulation methods applicable to BN 20 networks after transformations using parent divorcing and tensor rank-one decomposition and suggest several modifications.

We {{propose a}} new set of preconditioners for the {{iterative}} solution, via a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method, of the KKT systems that must be solved at each iteration of an interior point (IP) algorithm for the solution of linear min cost flow (MCF) problems. These preconditioners are based on the idea of extracting a proper triangulated subgraph of the original graph which strictly contains a spanning tree. We define a new class of <b>triangulated</b> <b>graphs,</b> called brother-connected trees (BCTs), and discuss some fast heuristics for finding BCTs of “large ” weight.
