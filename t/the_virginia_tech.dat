5|$|After {{some members}} of <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> panel complained about the missing paper, Virginia Tech decided to release {{a copy of the}} paper to the panel during {{the latter part of the}} week of August 25, 2007.

5|$|That {{starting}} field position {{proved a}} boon for <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> defense, which only allowed 200total yards in the game. Tech linebacker Vince Hall led the Hokies and all defensive players with 13tackles in the game. Tech recorded one interception during the game, courtesy of Brenden Hill, who also made threetackles. Georgia's offensive line, despite starting only six scholarship offensive linemen, allowed just twosacks to <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> defense. Chris Ellis and Noland Burchette each earned a single sack, accounting for a loss of 15totalyards.|$|E
5|$|The Tech kickoff was {{returned}} 17 yards by Gilyard to the Cincinnati 40-yard line, giving the Bearcats good field position {{to start their}} drive. Two rushes by Goebel resulted in 11 yards and a first down at the Tech 49-yard line. This success on the ground was followed by more through the air, as Pike completed three consecutive passes: a 16-yarder to Gilyard, a 3-yarder to Goodman, and a 14-yarder to Gilyard. Goebel then ran five yards to the Tech 11-yard line. Two Pike passes fell incomplete, setting up fourth down. Rather than attempt to kick a field goal, Cincinnati head coach Brian Kelly ordered the offense to attempt to convert the fourth down. This was done when Pike completed a seven-yard pass to Goodman for a first down at <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> four-yard line. Two more Pike passes fell incomplete before Goebel rushed three yards to <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> one-yard line. Cincinnati again faced a fourth down, and again, Kelly elected to attempt to score a touchdown rather than kick a field goal. Pike attempted to cross the goal line on a running play, but was stopped by <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> defense. With 7:25 remaining in the game, Cincinnati turned the ball over on downs to <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> offense, which returned to the field.|$|E
5|$|With Glennon behind center, <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> offense {{utilized}} {{several different}} wide receivers {{in the passing}} game. Eight different players caught at least one pass, and the leading receiver, Justin Harper, hauled in fourcatches for 64yards and a touchdown. Receiver Josh Morgan, meanwhile, caught threepasses, bringing him to 122receptions for his career, passing Antonio Freeman for second place all-time at Virginia Tech. Ernest Wilford remains first in <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> record book, with 126receptions.|$|E

5|$|With the game's {{momentum}} now {{firmly in}} their favor, <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> defense stopped Kansas' offense on three straight plays, forcing another Kansas punt. The kick traveled 62yards and was recovered at <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> 18-yard line. Virginia Tech's offense, despite the poor field position, moved quickly, {{partly due to}} a 15-yard pass interference penalty against Kansas. Sean Glennon completed a controversial 37-yard pass to tight end Greg Boone to drive the Hokies deep into Kansas territory. Initially, the pass {{appeared to have been}} intercepted by a Kansas defender, but subsequent replays revealed that Boone had wrested possession of the ball away from the defender. Three rushes deep inside the Kansas red zone netted the Hokies just nine more yards, setting up a fourth-and-one scenario for <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> offense. Rather than risk a failed fourth-down conversion, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent in kicker Jud Dunlevy to attempt a 25-yard field goal. During the kick, however, Kansas defender Joe Mortensen rushed through <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> line and blocked the kick, denying the Hokies three points and preserving a 1714 Kansas lead with 6:31 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> kickoff and a Florida State {{return to}} their 17-yard line, Florida State began running out the clock to bring the half to an end. At halftime, Florida State held a 2814 lead over Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|Auburn's offense {{took over}} at its one-yard line after Tech's failure to score. Jason Campbell orchestrated a {{successful}} drive that took Auburn from {{the shadow of}} its own end zone, completing passes of 16yards, 15yards, and 37yards in the process. Inside <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> red zone, however, the Auburn offense again stumbled. As it had in its two previous scoring drives, Auburn was forced to send in kicker John Vaughn despite being inside <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> 10-yard line. Vaughn's 24-yard kick was successful, and with 1:50 remaining in the second quarter, Auburn extended its lead to 9–0.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> Hokies {{allowed an}} average of 308 yards per game and 18.4 points per game. During {{the last two games}} of the regular season, however, the Hokies {{permitted}} 34 points and 42 points to Rutgers and Virginia, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> defense was led by two strong performers in the defensive secondary. Safety Torrian Gray intercepted four passes during the regular season, returning one of the catches for a touchdown. He tied with cornerback William Yarborough for the most interceptions on the team during the regular season. Neither player was the team's leading tackler, however. That honor went to linebacker George DelRicco, who had 130 tackles during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Following the Tech touchdown, Louisville {{attempted}} to answer with points {{of its own}} before halftime. After starting on his own 20-yard line, Hunter Cantwell completed two quick passes that resulted in 26yards. Two plays later, Michael Bush broke free for a 34-yard run, driving Louisville deep into <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> side of the field. Despite having a first down at <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> 18-yard line, Louisville was unable to gain any yards on three consecutive plays. Bush was stopped for no gain on a rushing attempt, and two Cantwell passes fell incomplete. Kicker Arthur Carmody came in to complete a 35-yard field goal, and with 2:16 remaining in the first half, Louisville led by a score of 17–10.|$|E

5|$|Linton ran {{for nine}} yards, {{then picked up}} a first down with a five-yard gain on second down. Keldorf {{completed}} a 12-yard pass to Barnes for a first down, Linton ran seven yards to the Carolina 43-yard line, then gained another first down with a run to the 50-yard line. From midfield, Keldorf attempted a deep pass on first down, but the ball fell incomplete. On second down, Keldorf completed a four-yard pass to Linton but was sacked on third down by <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> defense. The sack forced Carolina to punt {{for the second time}} in the game, and the ball rolled out of bounds at <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> 11-yard line.|$|E
5|$|On the Seminoles' first {{offensive}} {{play of the}} drive, {{they attempted}} a flea flicker pass, which was caught by Warrick at <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> 33-yard line for a 33-yard gain. Following the play, Weinke was sacked {{for the first time}} by the Tech defense. This was followed immediately by Tech's second sack, which pushed Weinke back into the Seminoles' side of the field. On the third play of the Seminole drive, Weinke attempted to scramble for yardage, but was stopped short of the needed mark. Florida State's punt was downed at <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> one-yard line, which was where the Tech offense began work. Florida State's defense prevented the Hokies from gaining a first down, and Tech again had to punt from its end zone.|$|E

5|$|Tech {{received}} Florida State's kickoff at {{its goal}} line {{and returned the}} ball to the 11-yard line, where Tech's offense took over. Kendrick ran for 12yards and a first down, but then Vick fumbled on a rush to the left. Florida State recovered the ball, and the Seminoles' offense was given the ball at <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> 35-yard line. On the first play after the fumble, Chaney broke free for a long run that gave State a first down inside <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> 10-yard line. The Seminoles were pushed backward on two consecutive plays and committed a chop block before Bowden was forced to send in Janikowski to kick a 32-yard field goal. The kick gave Florida State a 3929 lead with 10:26 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|A 19-yard {{punt return}} by Mikey Henderson put Georgia into good field position. Stafford {{capitalized}} on the opportunity, completing a 26-yard pass to put Georgia into field-goal range. After three unsuccessful plays, kicker Brandon Coutu connected on a 51-yard field goal to cut <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> lead to 21–6.|$|E
5|$|Because Florida State had {{received}} the game's opening kickoff, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half. As in the first half, however, <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> offense failed to advance the ball in any meaningful fashion. Marcus Vick threw two incompletions and running back Cedric Humes managed a short three-yard dash. Forced to punt the ball away yet again, Virginia Tech set up the game's critical play. From his 34-yard line, punter Nic Schmitt kicked the ball 49yards to the Seminoles' Willie Reid, who broke through <b>the</b> <b>Virginia</b> <b>Tech</b> special teams punt coverage for an 89-yard punt-return touchdown. Reid's return was the first touchdown {{of the game and}} the first touchdown in ACC Championship Game history. With 13:46 remaining in the third quarter, Florida State had taken a 103 lead.|$|E
