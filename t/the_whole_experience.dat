Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles, his friend, Phidias, died in prison and another friend of his, Anaxagoras, was attacked by the ecclesia for his religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences. He greatly enjoyed the horror and action aspects, but felt that the character-driven segments in early episodes threatened to drag down <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>experience</b> due to mundane content and poor characters. Talking about the anime's second half, {{he said that it}} drastically altered the pace and content to the point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters and viewers alike—Meek was ultimately angry at the series' brutal ending, but it also left him eager to see its movie conclusion.|$|E

He praised the narrative for its tone {{and efforts to}} [...] "roll back" [...] from the tone and gruesome violence of the series, but {{felt that it was}} impacted by the need to conclude the story of Blood-C and the incorporation of emotional scenes negatively impacted the movie's pacing in the second half. Kimlinger gave unreserved praise for Production I.G's illustration and animation, only faulting the CGI segments and expression limitations of CLAMP's character designs. He also praised Satō's musical score. THEM Anime gave the film 3/5 stars, enjoying its animation quality and action choreography despite some pacing issues.

40|$|Nurses {{increasingly}} use online {{research to}} inform their evidence-based practices. To prepare nursing graduates, universities {{have turned to}} self-directed learning (SDL) so students can {{take responsibility for their}} learning. While SDL tasks can include online research, there has been little research investigating the student experience of this. Without understanding the online part of the student SDL experience education leaders cannot gauge if that experience relates either helpfully or negatively to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> learning <b>experience.</b> This study considers how the online part of students’ SDL task experience is qualitatively related to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> SDL <b>experience.</b> It investigates how students conceive of nursing, their approach to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> SDL <b>experience</b> and to SDL tasks when online research is involved, their perceptions of the learning context and their academic achievement. The research site is a 2 nd year nursing unit in an Australian university. To understand changing relationships in students’ learning experiences as well as triangulating results the methodology includes qualitative and quantitative studies. Informed by nursing education and relational Student Learning Research methodologies, a clearer picture of the issue is likely. A relational interpretation of the 3 P model of student learning is used as the orientating view, with phenomenography describing relationships and associations amongst variables from a student’s perspective. This researcher found that educating students in a changing learning context creates challenges. Qualitative variations in approaches to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> and online part of the SDL experience are related to positive perceptions of aspects of the learning context (workload, assessment, online resources) and to qualitatively different learning outcomes (cohesive or fragmented nursing conceptions and differences in achievement). These findings offer implications for successful student experiences of nursing education and for research into SDL. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.
