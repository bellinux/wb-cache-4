50|$|A purely {{software-based}} {{implementation of}} the receiving <b>traffic</b> <b>distribution,</b> known as receive packet steering (RPS), distributes received traffic among cores later in the data path, {{as part of the}} interrupt handler functionality. Advantages of RPS over RSS include no requirements for specific hardware, more advanced <b>traffic</b> <b>distribution</b> filters, and reduced rate of interrupts produced by a NIC. As a downside, RPS increases the rate of inter-processor interrupts (IPIs). Receive flow steering (RFS) takes the software-based approach further by accounting for application locality; further performance improvements are achieved by processing interrupt requests by the same cores on which particular network packets will be consumed by the targeted application.|$|E

50|$|To {{implement}} {{an adaptive}} multipath routing scheme, three functions distributed {{in different parts}} of the network are needed. First, a modified dynamic source routing function is needed. It handles route discovery and collecting the local QoS-related information along the selectedroutes. Second, there is a local statistical computation and link monitoring function located in each node. This function is used to support the above routing function. It will manageand build the local routing information in each node, which includes a QoS-related table. The third function will be in charge of the final decision-making process. The adaptiverouting parameters are derived from the decision-making algorithm based on the QoS constraints. They are the number N of selected paths, parity length k of the FEC, code and the set {R} of the <b>traffic</b> <b>distribution</b> rates on each path. With these functions, adaptive multipath QoS routing is implemented.|$|E

The latter policy was officially known as the [...] "London Air <b>Traffic</b> <b>Distribution</b> Rules". It came into effect on 1 April 1978 and was applied retroactively from the beginning of April 1977. These rules were designed to achieve a fairer distribution of traffic between London Heathrow and London Gatwick, the UK's two main international gateway airports. The policy was aimed at increasing Gatwick's utilisation to help the airport make a profit.|$|E
50|$|Three {{functions}} (routing function, local statistic computation {{and monitoring}} function, and integrated decisionmaking function) are {{implemented in the}} {{different parts of the}} mobile network. Due to the distributed structure, the computation and implementation complexity of therouting scheme are reduced. Also, since routes are discovered based on the up-to-date local information and selected by the optimization computation, routing parameters (e.g., number of paths, FEC parity length, and <b>traffic</b> <b>distribution</b> rate) are dynamic and optimized. In additionto supporting multiple QoS requirements, traffic balancing and bandwidth resources are factored into our decisionmaking process. The distributed structure of the local QoS statistics used in the routing enables this QoS support mechanism to be scalable in mobile networks. Simulationresults indicate that the performance (i.e., packet loss and end-to-end delay) are much better and less susceptible to the state changes (i.e., node mobility, transmission power, channel characteristics, and the traffic pattern) of the network, compared to a nonadaptive routing strategy.|$|E

The heterogeneity in medium access parameters, transmit power and activity levels among the coexisting networks leads to detrimental cross-technology interference. The stochastic <b>traffic</b> <b>distributions,</b> shaped under CSMA/CA rules, of an interfering network and channel fading makes it challenging to model and analyze the performance of an interfered network. In this paper, to study the temporal interaction between the <b>traffic</b> <b>distributions</b> of two coexisting networks, we develop a renewal-theoretic packet collision model and derive a generic collision-time distribution (CTD) function of an interfered system. The CTD function holds for any busy- and idle-time distributions of the coexisting traffic. As the earlier studies suggest a long-tailed idle-time statistics in real environments, the developed model only requires the Laplace transform of long-tailed distributions to find the CTD. Furthermore, we present a packet error rate (PER) model under the proposed CTD and multipath fading of the interfering signals. Using this model, a computationally efficient PER approximation for interference-limited case is developed to analyze the performance of an interfered link. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
50|$|Since the 1980s finding {{solutions}} {{to address the}} shortage of airport capacity has become more difficult because of the growth and development of Heathrow Airport as the UK’s only hub airport, as opposed to all other UK airports {{which are based on}} the point to point airport operating model. The provision of additional capacity at major point to point airports, such as Gatwick or Stansted, would not address the UK’s shortage of hub airport capacity. In 1978 the <b>Traffic</b> <b>Distribution</b> Rules were introduced to try and encourage British Airways (BA) to make greater use of Gatwick Airport as a second hub. However, in 1991, having incurred significant financial losses, BA ceased most of its operations from the airport. Today, Stansted—despite having very low landing charges—operates at less than 50% capacity and is home to a completely different set of low cost airlines compared to the full service airlines which operate at Heathrow.|$|E
50|$|The first code {{selectors}} had {{levels for}} local exchange calls and {{calls to the}} local tandem exchange. An exchange with up to 23 outgoing routes would require a second code selection stage on some calls, and for more outgoing routes (up to 93) some third selection stages. But as a nearby business exchange might have 50 TU (traffic units) in the BH (busy hour), and more distant exchanges might have only 2 or 3 TUs, the busy routes {{should be on the}} first code selectors and the least busy routes only via a second and perhaps a third selection stage. Hence for a hypothetical example with 30 outgoing routes, three schemes are possible with (A) three second and no third code selector groups, (B) two second and one third code selector groups, and (C) one second and two third code selector groups. The number of switches for the hypothetical <b>traffic</b> <b>distribution</b> is 348, 302 and 315 switches, i.e. scheme B is the optimum; but each exchange must be calculated individually. The busy routes should also be allocated to the lower levels on the selectors to minimise setting-up time and also the number of operations of the mechanism and hence the wear on them.|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in using entropy-based analysis of <b>traffic</b> <b>distributions</b> for anomaly detection. These approaches are appealing since they provide more fine-grained insights into traffic structure than traditional traffic volume analysis. While previous work has demonstrated {{the benefits of}} entropy-based anomaly detection, {{there has been little}} effort to comprehensively understand the detection power of using entropy-based analysis of multiple <b>traffic</b> <b>distributions</b> in conjunction with each other. We consider two classes of distributions: flow-header features (IP addresses, ports, and flow-sizes), and behavioral features (degree distributions measuring the number of distinct destination/source IPs each host communicates with). Somewhat surprisingly, we observe that the entropies of the address and port distributions are strongly correlated with each other and provide very similar detection capabilities. The behavioral and flow size distributions are less correlated and detect incidents that do not show up as anomalies in the port and address distributions. Further analysis using synthetically generated anomalies also suggests that the port and address distributions have limited utility in detecting scan and bandwidth flood anomalies. Based on our analysis and understanding of the correlations among the different distributions, we discuss important implications for entropybased anomaly detection. 1...|$|R
