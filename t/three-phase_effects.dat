40|$|Immiscible water-alternating-gas (IWAG) {{experiments}} {{performed on}} equilibrated fluids are summarised {{together with the}} corresponding two-phase gas-oil and water-oil displacements. Experimental studies at reservoir condition and also mechanistic experiments over many years have shown accelerated oil production and higher core flood oil recovery {{as a result of}} three-phase flow. The <b>three-phase</b> <b>effects</b> that are included and analysed are; trapped gas, and mobility for secondary processes (ex. water after gas injection). The oil recovery from the different oil recovery processes represented by; gas, water, and WAG core displacements are also compared. The oil recovery has been related to the trapped gas saturation, and the efficiency of the trapped gas on oil recovery is found to be varying with core wettability. Experimental results have shown that both gas and water relative permeability generally is reduced during three-phase flow. Multivariate analysis has been used to investigate relations between variables like Sgt = f(k,, Sgi, krwe), Sorm = f(k, WI, Sorw, Sgt) and Sorg = f(k, WI, Sorw, krge). The paper tries to address the question of what three-phase parameters influence oil recovery, and how these parameters are related. This is an important question for modelling and optimising the WAG process...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the effects of low doses of haloperidol on the open-field behavior of mice. A <b>three-phase</b> <b>effect</b> of haloperidol on the motor activity of mice was observed (depression, no <b>effect,</b> depression). This <b>three-phase</b> action was clear-cut in three experimental approaches (amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, and apomorphine- and bromocriptine-induced hypoactivity). A differential action of haloperidol on dopamine receptors mediating motor stimulation and motor depression was proposed. the present data indicate that considerably more attention should be paid to the novel behavioral and biochemical actions of neuroleptic drugs in the microgram dose range.

30|$|Christensen et al. (1998) {{showed that}} this process {{has been applied to}} rocks from very low {{permeability}} chalk up to high permeability sandstone. Most of the applied processes were miscible. The miscibility issue is generally based on gas availability, but is mainly reported as an economic consideration and the extent of reservoir re-pressurization required for process application. The major design issues for WAG are reservoir characteristics and heterogeneity, rock and fluid characteristics, composition of injection gas, injection pattern, WAG ratio, <b>three-phase</b> relative permeability <b>effects</b> and flow dispersion. It {{is important to note that}} plain gas injection is considered as a part of WAG process with a WAG ratio of 0 : 1, hence the design issues pertinent to WAG are applicable to plain gas injection as well.|$|R
40|$|The current {{exploratory}} {{study examined the}} relationships between intimacy or mutuality and expression of violence among a sample of Spanish-speaking immigrant men (N = 70) mandated to a batterer intervention program in the Western United States. Correlations, hierarchical regressions, ANOVAs, and t-tests were used to explore the <b>three-phase</b> program’s <b>effects</b> on changes in men’s self-reports of mutuality, physical violence, and total emotional violence and its components - verbal emotional violence and controlling behavior. The study found that higher reports of mutuality {{were significantly related to}} lower reports of all three measures of emotional violence at intake. It was also found that reports of total emotional violence and verbal emotional violence, but not controlling behavior were reduced with participation in the program. Two distinct groups of participants emerged, with men measured in the second phase of intervention reporting higher initial verbal emotional violence and mutuality than those measured in the third phase. In addition, men measured in the second phase reported greater changes in both verbal-emotional violence and mutuality than those who reported in the third phase. The findings appear to show limitations of the measurement methods and instruments. They also seem to indicate that batterer intervention programs in general may need to examine other ways to address the more pernicious social and political roots of domestic violence...|$|R

In order to overcome the impact of measurement deviation the oilfield production management, the flow field of three-phase separator is studied numerically in this paper using Fluent 6. 3. 26. Taking into consideration the production situation of PetroChina Huabei Oilfield and the characteristics of <b>three-phase</b> separator, the <b>effect</b> of internal flow status {{as well as other}} factors such as varying flow rate, gas fraction, and water content on the separation efficiency is analyzed. The results show that the separation efficiencies under all operation conditions are larger than 95 %, which satisfy the accuracy requirement and also provide the theoretical foundation for the application of three-phase separators at oilfields...|$|R

However, numerous publications show the complexity of the fluid dynamics which the particles and constituents undergo aside of Brownian motion [18], gravity [19], and buoyancy during the evaporation. Phenomena such as capillary flows [20], convectional flows [21], and nonetheless the attractive (e.g., van der Waals) and repulsive forces (1) amongst particles [8, 16], (2) between particles and substrate [15, 22, 23], and/or (3) at the <b>three-phase</b> boundary (line-tension <b>effects)</b> [19, 24] will contribute to the final shape of the deposit. The deposits obtained by an evaporating droplet containing nanoparticles on non-absorbent and rigid surfaces can range from uniform patterns [11] to a ring-like pattern via the so-called coffee ring effect [20], central bumps [21], and inner coffee ring deposits [22] or and a number of further patterns in between [9].|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Thyristors are {{now widely}} used in many power {{electronics}} and motors drives applications. This is due to their several advantages such as relatively small size, low losses, market availability, and low cost. In this paper, a stator voltage control of three-phase induction motor by using thyristors is analyzed and simulated in details. The stator voltage has been controlled by phase angle control of <b>three-phase</b> supply. The <b>effect</b> of harmonic distortion in the line voltage and current have been studied and shown. The study reveals that, this method is suitable for applications requiring a low torque and low speeds. The power factor, efficiency and torque capability of the motor drop dramatically for lower voltages. Firing requirements and limits of control have also been studied. Recent PSIM 6. 1 program {{has been used to}} simulate the whole system. The simulation results from PSIM 6. 1 have been found in correlation with their counterpart from MATLAB 7.

40|$|Electric motors are {{important}} machines {{as they are}} widely used in industry. Unfortunately, they produce annoying noise {{which is a big}} concern. In order to obtain better understanding of vibrations and noise produced by induction motors, extensive investigations have been conducted on a specially designed test motor. It is well known that electromagnetic forces cause vibrations of the motor, producing radiated acoustic noise. The physical interpretations drawn from the experimental results reported in this thesis are beneficial to correlate the vibrations and the radiated noise. ISO and IEEE standards stipulate the procedures for conducting acoustic measurements so that reliable, reproducible results with specified level of accuracy can be obtained. ISO and IEEE standards describe suitable methods and measuring systems in order to arrange all the investigations {{in such a way that}} a systematic analysis can be performed. Relevant discussions with reference to these standards are presented in the thesis. After discussing the noise problems of induction motors encountered in industry and the workplace, the basic definitions and terms used for sound measurements are provided. Brief descriptions of various instruments used for vibration and noise measurements are also given. Before proceeding with the actual experimental investigations, it is essential to summarize the theoretical analyses of electromagnetic fields and electromagnetic forces produced in an induction motor. Harmonic analysis of the stator current, spectral analysis of the induced voltage in stator search-coils, and noise measurements using a sound-level-meter form the preliminary investigations which bridge theoretical analyses and detailed experimental investigations. Vibration measurements are fundamental in providing information on spectral distributions of noise. Mode-shape measurements show the stator deformations under electromagnetic forces, which are created by the <b>three-phase</b> currents. The <b>effects</b> of impressed voltage and the change ofload on vibration levels are also investigated. Noise measurements are conducted in both an ordinary laboratory and an anechoic chamber. The ordinary laboratory is similar to the practical workplace, which is neither a free-field nor a reverberant-room. The measurement results obtained in the laboratory are of practical importance. The anechoic chamber provides the free-field condition, where measurements corresponding to various standards are required. The results obtained in both ordinary laboratory and anechoic chamber are compared to produce useful practical information about the noise level change caused by sound fields. Also, the directional characteristics are carefully studied in the anechoic chamber. The results obtained are very helpful in understanding the nature of the noise radiation patterns of the motor...|$|R
