40|$|Exhaustive torsional-vibration {{investigations}} {{are required to}} determine the reliability of aircraft engines. A general outline of {{the methods used for}} such investigations and of the theoretical and mechanical means now available for this purpose is given, illustrated by example. True vibration diagrams are usually obtained from vibration measurements on the completed engine. Two devices for this purpose and supplementing each other, the D. V. L. <b>torsiograph</b> and the D. V. L. torsion recorder, are described in this report...|$|E
40|$|Summary. [...] Reasons for Enquiry. The {{instrument}} {{that forms the}} subject for this report has a condenser pick-up unit to which a carrier wave is applied: it measures, directly, instantaneous angular displacements due to shaft twist. The pick-up originated in a surface-strain gauge (embodying serrated-condenser elements) which had {{been the subject of}} some preliminary experiment M work. Range of Investigation. [...] Two main types of torsiogra'ph are contrasted in relation to [heir application and the present <b>torsiograph</b> is described. Results of calibration tests with different serration ~ and air-gaps are given, together with a general account of experience gained during a total of some 10 hours running with the instrument fitted to a Merlin n engine. Some typical records are included but not the results of the torsional vibration investigation [...] which will form the subject of a separate report. Calibration resultg are given from which the serrations appropriate to particular applications can be decided. Conclusions. [...] The <b>torsiograph</b> gives very satisfactory results when due care is taken with electronic equipment. The natural frequency of the instrument is such that torsional vibrations having a frequency as high as 80, 000 cycles per minute can be recorded with ease. The instrument provides a means of making continuous observations of torsional vibration at a moderately remote station and it can be adapted for making observations in flight...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of uneven active electric load of diesel generator system with heat {{recovery of the}} secondary heat fluxes and the electric heater on the pa-rameters of the diesel is examined. The results of series of experiments on the in-fluence of uneven active load of diesel generator on the temperature of exhaust gases, the sum of concentrations of nitrogen oxides, the concentration of carbon monoxide in the exhaust gases are given. The results of <b>torsiograph</b> oscillations of the bow end of the crankshaft of the primary motor are shown taking into ac-count the uneven active load on the synchronous generator phases. The research cogeneration plant with electric boilers {{and a series of}} experiments made to de-termine the amount of utilizable heat from the generator load, taking into account the load of the generator with electric boilers and other consumers of electricity in different proportions is described. The energy performance of each of the ele-ments of cogeneration plant and efficiency in general {{in a wide range of}} load conditions is determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{ships of}} design 1570 are {{operated}} in the Volga-Caspian Basin, their propulsion units comprise both the main engine 6 NVD 48 AU with silicone damp-er (B- 790) installed on "Nefterudovoz- 31 M", "Vicont", "Graf", "Markiz", etc {{and the main}} engine 6 NVD 48 A 2 U with silicone damper (A- 710) installed on "Nefterudovoz- 29 M". The discrete torsion scheme of the propulsion unit of the former ships differs from discrete torsion scheme of the propulsion unit of «Nefterudovoz- 29 M» by the diesel flywheel moment of inertia (flywheel ac-tion GDi 2 = 2 200 кg • m 2, instead GDi 2 = 1 200 кg • m 2). The analysis of torsion vibrations of the propulsion unit of the ship of design 1570 data on <b>torsiographing</b> have shown that without silicone damper the total stress {{as a result of}} torsion vibrations does not exceed the allowable limit throughout the whole engine speed range. Therefore the propulsion unit of the ship of design 1570 can be operated without barred speed zones and without the necessity of installing torsion vibra-tion damper. The discrete torsion scheme of the propulsion unit of ship "Nefteru-dovoz- 31 M" without a damper should be considered to be preferable among the discrete torsion schemes of the propulsion unit of the ship design 1570...|$|R
