5|$|The {{rules of}} chess were amended {{to make this}} clear. Today, it is settled that the player must make that move (or resign). The same is <b>true</b> <b>if</b> an enpassant capture is the only move {{to get out of}} check.|$|E
50|$|A {{truth is}} all the <b>truer</b> <b>if</b> it is {{sometimes}} false.|$|R
50|$|For example, <b>if</b> it's <b>true</b> that I'm {{breathing}} if {{and only}} if I'm alive, then it's <b>true</b> that <b>if</b> I'm breathing, I'm alive; likewise, it's <b>true</b> that <b>if</b> I'm alive, I'm breathing.|$|R

5|$|While some 19th-century {{experiments}} {{suggested that}} the underlying premise is <b>true</b> <b>if</b> the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: a frog that is gradually heated will jump out. Indeed, thermoregulation by changing location is a fundamentally necessary survival strategy for frogs and other ectotherms.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{original}} deployment plans for Zeus had been a defensive system for SAC. The Air Force argued against such a system, in favor of building more ICBMs of their own. Their logic was that every Soviet missile launched in a counterforce strike could destroy a single US missile. If both forces had similar numbers of missiles, such an attack would leave both forces with few remaining missiles to launch a counterstrike. Adding Zeus would {{reduce the number of}} losses on the US side, helping ensure a counterstrike force would survive. However, the same was <b>true</b> <b>if</b> the US built more ICBMs instead. The Air Force was far more interested in building its own missiles than the Army's, {{especially in the case of}} Zeus, which appeared to be easily outwitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem had}} already been solved by Pontecorvo in 1968. In 1959, a {{powerful}} accelerator (that was never built) was being designed, and he began considering experiments that could be performed with it. He contemplated a project investigating muons. Julian Schwinger had hypothesised that particles experience the weak interaction through exchanging W bosons. The W boson would not be discovered until 1983, but a problem immediately surfaced. Gerald Feinberg pointed out that this implied that some interactions {{that had never been}} observed should occur, but conceded that this was only <b>true</b> <b>if</b> the neutrinos associated with electrons were the same as those associated with muons.|$|E

5000|$|Biconditional {{elimination}} is {{the name}} of two valid rules of inference of propositional logic. It allows for one to infer a conditional from a biconditional. <b>If</b> [...] is <b>true,</b> then one may infer that [...] is true, and also that [...] is <b>true.</b> For example, <b>if</b> it's <b>true</b> that I'm breathing if and only if I'm alive, then it's <b>true</b> that <b>if</b> I'm breathing, I'm alive; likewise, it's <b>true</b> that <b>if</b> I'm alive, I'm breathing. The rules can be stated formally as: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being such as it is, {{under the assumption that}} the hypothesis being tested is <b>true.</b> <b>If</b> the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, and the difference between correlation and causation.|$|E
5|$|Women with anti-TPO {{antibodies}} who {{are trying}} to become pregnant (naturally or by assisted means) may require thyroid hormone supplementation even if the TSH level is normal. This is particularly <b>true</b> <b>if</b> they have had previous miscarriages or have been hypothyroid in the past. Supplementary levothyroxine may reduce the risk of preterm birth and possibly miscarriage. The recommendation is stronger in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as TSH 2.5–10mIU/l) who are anti-TPO positive, in view of the risk of overt hypothyroidism. If a decision is made not to treat, close monitoring of the thyroid function (every 4 weeks in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy) is recommended. If anti-TPO is not positive, treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism is not currently recommended. It has been suggested that many of the aforementioned recommendations could lead to unnecessary treatment, {{in the sense that the}} TSH cutoff levels may be too restrictive in some ethnic groups; there may be little benefit from treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in certain cases.|$|E

25|$|This {{means that}} for a system which is not in equilbrium, its Gibbs energy will always be decreasing, {{and when it is}} in {{equilibrium}} (i.e. no longer changing), the infinitesimal change dG will be zero.
