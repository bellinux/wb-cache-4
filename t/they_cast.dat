5|$|In {{the first}} days of the blockade, someone managed to smuggle a letter out of the Jewish quarter to the Jewish {{leadership}} in Constantinople. It was not until March 27 that the leaders of the Jewish community in the Ottoman capital forwarded it to the Rothschild family, together with a similar call for help from the Jews of Damascus. To these documents, the Jewish leaders attached their own statement in which <b>they</b> <b>cast</b> doubt on their ability to influence the sultan.|$|E
5|$|The cast {{consisted}} {{mostly of}} unknowns, though Isabel Bigley, {{who had just}} originated Sister Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls, was given the leading role of chorus girl Jeanie. For Larry, the assistant stage manager {{who falls in love}} with Jeanie, <b>they</b> <b>cast</b> Bill Hayes, a well-known stage and television actor. William Tabbert, the original Lt. Joe Cable in South Pacific was considered for the part of Larry, but lost out because he was thought to be too tall to be afraid of Mark Dawson, hired as the towering bully Bob.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{plot was}} {{inspired}} by a similar incident in which Johnson discovered a gun and a bone in his backyard. Instead of a traditional script, he and Swanberg wrote an outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue. <b>They</b> <b>cast</b> the film mainly by contacting their friends and other actors who they knew had enjoyed their previous work. It was filmed over 15 days in Los Angeles County, California. Swanberg dedicated the film to filmmaker Paul Mazursky.|$|E
50|$|The voter {{has only}} two votes, which <b>they</b> have <b>cast</b> for Brian and Berryl Blue. <b>They</b> cannot <b>cast</b> a vote for the third {{available}} seat. Each vote counts as one towards the total for the candidate they have put their mark against.|$|R

50|$|Each {{director}} (or {{his or her}} alternate {{acting in}} the place of the director) has at least one vote on all Board matters. Directors representing members that participate in a power supply project, but not the ARP get an additional one-half vote (thus, <b>they</b> may <b>cast</b> 1.5 votes). Directors representing members that participate in the ARP get one additional vote (thus, <b>they</b> may <b>cast</b> 2 votes).|$|R
5|$|Kreia {{is shown}} as an elderly blind woman, whose eyes have atrophied {{from lack of}} use in {{preference}} of viewing things through the Force, viewing normal sight as a distraction. Dialogue in The Sith Lords establishes her past as a Jedi historian {{and one of the}} teachers of Revan, who became a Sith Lord and was the player character of , and how her teachings were blamed for his fall. The Sith Lords reveals she as Sith trained two antagonists of the game, Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus, before <b>they</b> <b>cast</b> her out. She is initially depicted in earth-brown hooded Jedi robes with empty white eyes, though after the revelation of her identity as Darth Traya, both a Sith and a being of betrayal, both her robes and eyes are changed to black, and she becomes more pale.|$|E
5|$|The EBRC's {{terms of}} {{reference}} are issued by the Prime Minister, and are not embodied in legislation. In giving recommendations for boundary changes over the years, the Committee has considered various factors, including using hill ridges, rivers and roads as boundaries rather than arbitrarily drawn lines; {{and the need for}} electoral divisions to have approximately equal numbers of voters so that electors' votes carry the same weight regardless of where <b>they</b> <b>cast</b> their ballots. In 1963, the EBRC adopted a rule allowing the numbers of voters in divisions to differ by no more than 20%. The permitted deviation was increased to 30% in 1980. It is up to the Cabinet {{to decide whether or not}} to accept the Committee's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930, and particularly its edicts concerning on-screen violence, Warners allowed Cagney a change of pace. <b>They</b> <b>cast</b> him in the comedy Blonde Crazy, again opposite Blondell. As he completed filming, The Public Enemy was filling cinemas with all-night showings. Cagney began to compare his pay with his peers, thinking his contract allowed for salary adjustments based on the success of his films. Warner Bros. disagreed, however, and refused to give him a raise. The studio heads also insisted that Cagney continue promoting their films, even ones he was not in, which he opposed. Cagney moved back to New York, leaving his brother Bill to look after his apartment.|$|E

25|$|The Electoral College never meets as one body. Electors meet {{in their}} {{respective}} state capitals (electors for the District of Columbia meet within the District) on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, at which time <b>they</b> <b>cast</b> their electoral votes on separate ballots for president and vice president.|$|E
25|$|When a {{crew from}} ABC came to Lawrence in 1982 {{to shoot the}} {{controversial}} television movie on nuclear war, The Day After, <b>they</b> <b>cast</b> Harvey, along {{with a handful of}} other local thespians, in a small speaking role as a farmer. The film was broadcast to much international publicity and controversy in 1983.|$|E
25|$|Appellants {{invoke the}} right to vote and to have their votes counted. But they are {{permitted}} to vote and their votes are counted. They go to the polls, <b>they</b> <b>cast</b> their ballots, they send their representatives to the state councils. Their complaint is simply that the representatives are not sufficiently numerous or powerful.|$|E

25|$|Clark and Washoe {{counties}} have long dominated the state's politics. Between them, <b>they</b> <b>cast</b> 87 percent of Nevada's vote, and elect a substantial {{majority of the}} state legislature. The last Republican to carry Clark County was George H.W. Bush in 1988, and the last Republican to carry Washoe County was George W. Bush in 2004. The {{great majority of the}} state's elected officials are either from Las Vegas or Reno.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, {{producers}} {{created an}} extended family for Grace. First <b>they</b> <b>cast</b> the roles of half-brothers Liam (Maxim Baldry), Jesse (Luke Jerdy) and Adam Donovan (Jimmy Essex). It was revealed that on-screen Grace would not be happy with them being in her life again. During the casting process the three actors had to complete a day long acting workshop with Wall. They conversed about Grace's history within Hollyoaks to help with their introduction to the show. Liam is introduced to the show first. Grace is annoyed when she notices him and gives him money to leave the village for good.|$|E
25|$|On the 18th <b>they</b> <b>cast</b> {{anchor in}} Smerwick, where they garrisoned at Dún an Óir (Fort of Gold), and were joined on the 25th by two galleys with 100 troops; {{four days later}} their ships were {{captured}} by the English fleet {{under the command of}} Sir William Winter. Having exhorted the Earl of Desmond and the Earl of Kildare, as Geraldine leaders, to fight the heretics, FitzMaurice left the fort to await the arrival of Stukley (who, unknown to him, had been killed at the Battle of Alcácer Quibir in the previous year, during a campaign by King Sebastian of Portugal).|$|E

25|$|Ashby was busted for {{possession}} of marijuana while scouting locations in Canada. This almost changed the studio's mind about backing the project, but the director's drug bust was not widely reported and Nicholson remained fiercely loyal to him, which was a deciding factor. Just as the film {{was about to go}} into production, Crosse was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Ashby postponed principal photography for a week to allow Crosse to deal with the news and decide if he still wanted to do the film. The actor decided not to do the film, and Ashby and Stalmaster scrambled to find a replacement. <b>They</b> <b>cast</b> Otis Young.|$|E
25|$|Nicholas is {{horrified to}} {{discover}} his employers, the sadistic Mr and Mrs Squeers, run their boarding school like a prison and physically, verbally, and emotionally abuse their young charges {{on a regular}} basis. He eventually rebels and escapes, taking with him the young, crippled Smike. As they journey to London, they stumble upon a theatrical troupe {{owned and operated by}} Mr. and Mrs. Crummles. <b>They</b> <b>cast</b> them in a production of Romeo and Juliet, but despite a successful first night and the couple's invitation to stay, Nicholas is determined to continue their journey to London to learn how his mother and sister are faring.|$|E
25|$|Between 1609 and 1611, {{after several}} voyages {{on behalf of}} English merchants to explore a {{prospective}} Northeast Passage to India, Kingdom of England's Henry Hudson, {{under the auspices of}} the Dutch East India Company (VOC), explored the region around present-day New York City, while looking for a western route to Asia. He explored the Hudson River and laid the foundation for Dutch colonization of the region. Hudson's final expedition ranged farther north in search of the Northwest Passage, leading to his discovery of the Hudson Strait and Hudson Bay. After wintering in the James Bay, Hudson tried to press on with his voyage in the spring of 1611, but his crew mutinied and <b>they</b> <b>cast</b> him adrift.|$|E

25|$|Most top Navy officers, however, were {{comfortable}} with the old system, enjoying the perks and the prestige the Navy provided. Life in the high echelons of the Spanish Navy was more glamorous than among Army and Air Force officers, for it often included Yacht Club membership, with regattas, gala dinners and balls. <b>They</b> <b>cast</b> a dim eye on the reforms {{of the armed forces}} introduced by newly nominated Republican Minister of War Manuel Azaña within {{the first few months of}} the new government. Azaña's aim was to modernize the Spanish Military and cut down the expenses of the state in the aftermath of the Great Depression, but the naming of Santiago Casares Quiroga, a civilian without a Navy background, as Minister of the Navy was unwelcome by the traditional Spanish Navy officers who despised Casares Quiroga and privately mocked him.|$|E
25|$|The new unit's {{first task}} was {{the design of}} {{armoured}} observation posts disguised as trees, following the pioneering work of the French Section de Camouflage led by Lucien-Victor Guirand de Scévola. The first British tree observation post was put up on 22 March 1916. Solomon was effective at the artistic and technical tasks of designing trees and nets, but not as a commander. He was replaced in March 1916, instead becoming a technical advisor, a role that suited him better. In May 1916, {{he was sent to}} England to help develop tank camouflage. Solomon doubted that tanks could be effectively camouflaged since <b>they</b> <b>cast</b> a large shadow. Instead, he argued for the use of camouflage netting, with which he gradually became obsessed, claiming that the Germans were hiding huge armies under immense nets. Camouflage netting was at first considered unimportant by the army; it was not manufactured in large quantities until 1917. Eventually, in 1920, he published a book, Strategic Camouflage, arguing this case, to critical derision in England but with some support from German newspapers.|$|E
25|$|Jamie Bell's {{audition}} {{for the role}} of Smike in a London hotel room left McGrath and the producers in tears, and <b>they</b> <b>cast</b> him on the spot. While considering Mrs. Crummles, a smug, opinionated, but lovable dowager, McGrath realized all her traits and characteristics were embodied by Dame Edna Everage, alter ego of actor Barry Humphries, but was hesitant to suggest casting a male in the role. The producers, however, agreed Humphries was an ideal choice. Nicholas {{was one of the last}} roles to be cast. Charlie Hunnam had been sent the script, but several months passed before he had an opportunity to read it. He met with McGrath, and based on a couple of hours of conversation with the actor, the director felt he finally had found the right man for the part. Ironically, the British Hunnam had to work with a dialect coach; having lived and worked in the US for the past several years, he had perfected an American accent in order to ensure regular employment.|$|E

25|$|Sovereigns {{start with}} a certain amount of magical essence, {{determining}} how much mana they have, and so how many spells <b>they</b> may <b>cast.</b> <b>They</b> may imbue essence into champions, granting limited power at the cost of their own abilities. Essence may also be expended by sovereigns to escape death and return to a nearby settlement. Marriages involving magic-using characters may result in children with magical skills of their own.|$|R
