40|$|As is {{commonly}} known, the steganographic algorithms employ images, audio, video or text files as the medium to ensure hidden {{exchange of information}} between multiple contenders to protect {{the data from the}} prying eyes. However, using text as the target medium is relatively difficult as compared to the other target media, {{because of the lack of}} available redundant information in a text file. In this paper, in the backdrop of the limitations in the prevalent text based steganographic approaches, we propose simple, yet novel approaches that overcome the same. Our approaches are based on combining the random character sequence and feature coding methods <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>a</b> <b>character.</b> We also analytically evaluate the approaches based on metrics viz. hiding strength, time overhead and memory overhead entailed. As compared to other methods, we believe the approaches proposed impart increased randomness and thus aid higher security at lower overhead. Comment: 13 page...|$|E
500|$|Yet another private {{joke was}} the hidden {{character}} Noob Saibot, who {{has appeared in}} various versions of the game starting with Mortal Kombat II. The character's name derived from two of the series' creators' surnames, Ed Boon and John Tobias, spelled backwards. In addition, a counter for ERMACS on the game's audits screen (ERMACS being short for error macros), was generally considered by some players to be <b>a</b> reference <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>hidden</b> <b>character.</b> The development team decided to turn the rumor into reality, introducing Ermac in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 as <b>an</b> unlockable secret <b>character.</b> The character Mokap, introduced in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, {{is a tribute to}} Carlos Pesina, who played Raiden in MK and MKII and has served as a motion capture actor for subsequent titles in the series.|$|R
