5|$|Fifty-six {{individuals}} {{have served as}} governor, four of whom served non-consecutive terms, totaling 60 distinct terms; the official numbering only lists each governor once, so there have officially been fifty-six governors. This numbering includes one acting governor: the lieutenant governor who filled the vacancy after {{the resignation of the}} governor, under the 1777 State Constitution. The list does not include people who have acted as governor when the governor was out of state, such as Lt. Gov. Timothy L. Woodruff during Theodore Roosevelt's vice presidential campaign in 1900, or Acting Speaker of the New York State Assembly Moses M. Weinstein, who acted as governor for ten days in 1968 while the governor, the lieutenant governor, and <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> <b>majority</b> <b>leader</b> were out of the state, attending the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida.|$|E
5|$|When news of {{the attack}} on Camp Holloway reached Saigon on the morning of 7 February 1965, General William Westmoreland, McGeorge Bundy and Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, flew out to Pleiku to survey the damage. Bundy then called President Johnson to put forward the MACV's request for retaliatory air strikes against North Vietnam. In {{response}} to Bundy's request, Johnson hastily convened a session of the National Security Council, which involved the speaker of the House of Representatives and <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>majority</b> <b>leader,</b> to discuss the need for reprisal against the Communists in Vietnam. That afternoon, General Nguyễn Khánh arrived in Pleiku to meet with Westmoreland and Bundy, and they both informed him that recommendations for air strikes against North Vietnam had been made to the President of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Rogers {{outlined}} {{the request for}} the establishment of the commission, with four members to be appointed by each house of Congress and three by President Calvin Coolidge. Rodgers and Dallinger wanted $10,000 for the commission, and for Congress to authorize the issuance of commemorative coins and stamps. Rogers told the committee that the language for the legislative provisions for the coin had been borrowed from the bill for the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar (1920–1921), and reminded them of other commemorative coins that had been issued. At the time, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. A maximum of 300,000 coins was requested. Dallinger noted that the government would incur no cost from the commemorative half dollars: it would profit from the seignorage and would never be called upon to redeem them, as they would be retained by collectors. After the two congressmen appeared, Chairman Luce introduced a letter from <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader,</b> Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, indicating his support for the bill. Luce reported his own version of the resolution the following day, with his committee's recommendation that it pass.|$|E

25|$|Unlike in Westminster style legislatures or as with <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader,</b> the House Majority Leader's {{duties and}} {{prominence}} vary {{depending upon the}} style {{and power of the}} Speaker of the House. Typically, the Speaker does not participate in debate and rarely votes on the floor. In some cases, Majority Leaders have been more influential than the Speaker; notably Tom DeLay who was more prominent than Speaker Dennis Hastert. In addition, Speaker Newt Gingrich delegated to Dick Armey an unprecedented level of authority over scheduling legislation on the House floor.|$|E
25|$|During the 1998 and 2000 {{election}} cycles, McConnell {{was chairman}} of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Republicans maintained control of the Senate after both elections. He was first elected as Majority Whip in the 108th Congress and unanimously re-elected on November 17, 2004. Senator Bill Frist, the Majority Leader, did not seek re-election in the 2006 elections. In November 2006, after Republicans lost control of the Senate, they elected McConnell to replace Frist as Minority Leader. After Republicans took control of the Senate following the 2014 Senate elections, McConnell became <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{serving as}} Chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Frist succeeded Trent Lott as <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader.</b> Frist helped pass several parts of President George W.

50|$|By rule, the Presiding Officer {{gives the}} <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> {{priority}} in obtaining recognition {{to speak on}} the floor of <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> customarily serves as the chief representative of their party in <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> and sometimes even in all of Congress if the House of Representatives and thus the office of Speaker of the House is controlled by the opposition party.|$|R
25|$|Ruppersberger was {{the first}} Democratic {{freshman}} ever to be appointed to the House Intelligence Committee. He was named to this committee because his district {{is home to the}} National Security Agency. From January 3, 2011 to January 3, 2015, he served as this committee's ranking Democrat. The position placed Ruppersberger on the elite “Gang of Eight”, which refers to the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees along with <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>majority</b> <b>leader,</b> Senate minority leader, House speaker and House minority leader. By law, the president must keep the Gang of Eight informed of the country's most secret intelligence activities to maintain proper oversight.|$|E
25|$|Two more anthrax letters, {{bearing the}} same Trenton postmark, were dated October 9, {{three weeks after}} the first mailing.

At the time, Daschle was <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>leader</b> and Leahy was head of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Daschle letter was opened by an aide, Grant Leslie, on October 15, and the government mail service was shut down. The unopened Leahy letter was discovered in an impounded mailbag on November 16. The Leahy letter had been misdirected to the State Department mail annex in Sterling, Virginia, because a ZIP code was misread; a postal worker there, David Hose, contracted inhalational anthrax.|$|E
25|$|Laxalt {{retired from}} the Senate in 1987 and was {{replaced}} by the man he had defeated in 1974, Harry Reid, who would go on to become <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader.</b> Laxalt made a brief run for the Republican Presidential nomination during 1987. The campaign lasted only four months after Laxalt determined that the effort had fallen short of its fundraising goals. Political commentators at the time concluded that he had waited too long to enter the race, which meant that not only did his competitors have a leg up in organization, but many of the top political strategists and fundraisers had already signed on with other camps. He was eventually named a co-chairman of George H.W. Bush's successful presidential campaign. Eight years later, he served in a similar capacity in Bob Dole's failed presidential bid.|$|E
