5|$|In every {{review and}} study {{conducted}} to date, the courage, valor, and {{discipline of the}} soldiers who fought at Wanat have been universally praised. These soldiers were well-trained, well-led, and fought bravely to defeat a determined and intense enemy action to overrun their base in Wanat. They persevered in a fashion <b>that</b> <b>deserves</b> broad recognition of their bravery and tenacity. Our hearts {{go out to the}} families of the fallen soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The Western Gangas used Kannada and Sanskrit {{extensively}} {{as their}} language of administration. Some of their inscriptions are also bilingual in these languages. In bilingual inscriptions the formulaic passages stating origin myths, genealogies, titles of Kings and benedictions {{tended to be}} in Sanskrit, while the actual terms of the grant such as information on the land or village granted, its boundaries, participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues and other local concerns were in the local language. The usage of these two languages showed important changes over the centuries. During the first phase (350–725), Sanskrit copper plates dominated, indicating the initial ascendancy of the local language as a language of administration {{and the fact that}} majority of the records from this phase were brahmadeya grants (grants to Brahmin temples). In the second phase (725–1000), lithic inscriptions in Kannada outnumbered Sanskrit copper plates, consistent with the patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains who used Kannada as their medium to spread the Jain faith. Recent excavations at Tumbula near Mysore have revealed a set of early copper plate bilingual inscriptions dated 444. The genealogy of the kings of the dynasty is described in Sanskrit while Kannada was used to describe the boundary of the village. An interesting inscription discovered at Beguru near modern Bangalore <b>that</b> <b>deserves</b> mention is the epigraph dated 890 that refers to a Bengaluru war. This is in Hale Kannada (old Kannada) language and is the earliest mention of the name of Bangalore city. The Western Gangas minted coins with Kannada and Nagari legends, the most common feature on their coins was the image of an elephant on the obverse and floral petal symbols on the reverse. The Kannada legend Bhadr, a royal umbrella or a conch shell appeared on top of the elephant image. The denominations are the pagoda (weighing 52 grains), the fanam weighting one tenth or one half of the pagoda and the quarter fanams.|$|E

25|$|This {{proposed}} {{amendment was}} intended to give Congress the right to enact statutes criminalizing the burning or other desecration of the United States flag in a public protest. Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture <b>that</b> <b>deserves</b> to be outlawed. Opponents maintain that giving Congress such power would essentially limit the principle of freedom of speech, enshrined in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and symbolized by the flag itself.|$|E
25|$|The general {{military}} {{character of}} the country is that of extreme difficulty. Immediately {{at the front of the}} hills the plain is covered with the Great Saul Forest, for an average width of ten or twelve miles; the masses of the mountains are immense, their sides steep, and covered with impenetrable jungle. The trenches in these ridges are generally water-courses, and rather chasms or gulfs than any thing <b>that</b> <b>deserves</b> the name of a valley. The roads are very insecure, and invariably pathways over mountains, or the beds of rivers, the usual means of transport throughout the country being by hill porters. Notwithstanding this general description, spaces comparatively open and hollow, and elevated tracts of tolerably level land, are to be met with, but so completely detached as to contribute but little to facilitate intercourse.|$|E

500|$|Between the {{publication}} of The Pothunters 1902 and that of Mike in 1909, Wodehouse wrote eight novels and co-wrote another two. The critic R.D.B. French writes that, of Wodehouse's work from this period, almost all <b>that</b> <b>deserves</b> to survive is the school fiction. Looking back in the 1950s Wodehouse viewed these as his apprentice years: [...] "I was practically in swaddling clothes and it is extremely creditable to me that I was able to write at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Cobb was {{convinced}} that Alfred North Whitehead was right in viewing both nature and human beings as more than just purposeless machines. [...] Rather than seeing nature as purely mechanical and human consciousness as a strange exception which must be explained away, Whiteheadian naturalism went {{in the opposite direction}} by arguing that subjective experience of the world should inform a view of the rest of nature as more than just mechanical. In short, nature should be seen as having a subjective and purposive aspect <b>that</b> <b>deserves</b> attention.|$|E

500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} The Little Mermaid II: Pinball Frenzy was primarily positive, with many video game commentators complimenting its visuals and appeal to girls. It {{was determined to}} be a good fit for a female gamer by IGN's Craig Harris. However, Harris was more critical of the physics of the pinballs, describing the mechanics as [...] "a little on the floaty side" [...] and [...] "not as quick as the previous pinball incarnations". Frank Provo felt the game would be popular with a younger audience, and complimented the vibrant colors of the tables and recreation of the films' soundtracks. The minigames and tables' designs were praised by a writer from Spong.com, who felt the game was a [...] "polished, playable pinball title <b>that</b> <b>deserves</b> checking out". Brett Allan Weiss of AllGame thought the game's multiplayer tournaments and adjustable difficulties encouraged family members to play together.|$|E

Conversely, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic was critical of M2M's new image in the album artwork. Erlewine said they had ditched their sweet and innocent look from Shades of Purple, for [...] "lots of makeup, crimped hair [...] fairly low-cut tops". He gave the album four and a half stars out of five, concluding [...] "If M2M needs to play up their good looks to sell an album this pleasing, so be it.
