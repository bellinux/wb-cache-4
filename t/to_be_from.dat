5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>from</b> a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E

This article raises four interrelated questions: what young people <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ‘diverted’ <b>from</b> and to; whether young people <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ‘diverted’ <b>from</b> the criminal justice system or from offending; whether young people <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ‘diverted’ <b>from</b> criminal justice processes or outcomes; and whether ‘diversion’ should <b>be</b> considered distinct <b>from</b> crime prevention and early intervention. The article concludes that the confusion about youth ‘diversion’ may foster individualised interventions in young people’s lives...|$|R
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from London, the Demerara Court of Policy eventually passed an 'Ordinance for the religious instruction of slaves and for meliorating their condition' in 1825 which institutionalised working hours and some civil rights for slaves. The weekend was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>from</b> sunset on Saturday to sunrise on Monday; field work was also defined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>from</b> 6 am to 6 pm, with a mandatory two-hour break. A Protector of Slaves was appointed; whipping was abolished for women as was {{its use in}} the field. The rights to marriage and own property was legalised, as was the right to acquire manumission. Amendments and new ordinances continued to flow from London, each progressively establishing more civil rights for the slaves, but they were strongly resisted by the colonial legislature.|$|E

5|$|A charter {{purporting}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>from</b> King Æthelberht, dated 28 April 604, survives in the Textus Roffensis, {{as well as}} a copy {{based on}} the Textus in the 14th-century Liber Temporalium. Written mostly in Latin but using an Old English boundary clause, the charter records a grant of land near the city of Rochester to Justus' church. Among the witnesses is Laurence, Augustine's future successor, but not Augustine himself. The text turns to two different addressees. First, Æthelberht is made to admonish his son Eadbald, who had been established as a sub-ruler in the region of Rochester. The grant itself is addressed directly to Saint Andrew, the patron saint of the church, a usage parallelled by other charters in the same archive.|$|E

5|$|A fossil {{discovered}} in the Horse Room of the Salamander Cave in the Black Hills of South Dakota may possibly be C.dirus; if so, this fossil {{is one of the}} earliest specimens on record. It was catalogued as Canis cf. C.dirus (where cf. in Latin means confer, uncertain). The fossil of a horse found in the Horse Room provided a uranium-series dating of 252,000 yearsYBP and the Canis cf. dirus specimen was assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>from</b> the same period. C.armbrusteri and C.dirus share some characteristics (synapomorphies) that imply the latter's descent from the former. The fossil record suggests C.dirus originated around 250,000YBP in the open terrain of the mid-continent before expanding eastward and displacing its ancestor C.armbrusteri. The first appearance of C.dirus would therefore be 250,000YBP in California and Nebraska, and later {{in the rest of the}} United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru, but the identity of these earliest fossils is not confirmed.|$|E
5|$|A {{key point}} of {{contention}} in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>from</b> a male, it was later determined {{to be that of}} Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{find in the}} Fosse Way burials was a Chi-Rho amulet, at {{the time}} thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>from</b> the 5th century, and {{considered}} {{to be among the}} earliest definite evidence of Christianity in England. A copy of the amulet was presented to the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, by the churches of the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Although the amulet is in the Museum of Somerset, analysis by Liverpool University in 2008 using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy demonstrated that it was a hoax, as its silver content dated to the 19th century or later.|$|E
