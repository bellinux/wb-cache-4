5|$|Aubrey, {{who left}} CBS with $2.5 million in network stock, {{moved to the}} Sunset Strip {{and set up a}} {{production}} company, The Aubrey Company. His attorney, Gregson E. Bautzer, in 1967 tried to buy the American Broadcasting Company for another client, the Las Vegas-based millionaire Howard Hughes. Aubrey was to have run ABC after the takeover, but the reclusive Hughes refused to <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> person at hearings before the Federal Communications Commission, which had to approve the purchase, and the deal collapsed.|$|E
5|$|By {{examining}} unique striations, or markings, {{left behind}} on the bullet as it passes through the barrel and on the cartridge as it is hit by the firing pin, individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a comparison microscope. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings {{can be compared to}} other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> court as expert witnesses.|$|E

5|$|Macnamara {{found himself}} {{in trouble with the}} law after killing a man in a duel, but summoned a bevy of naval {{officers}} to <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> his defence, and was acquitted. He commanded a number of ships of the line in the following years, in the Baltic, North Sea and off of the French coast. He was promoted to rear-admiral in 1814, but did not receive a seagoing command. He married in 1818 and died in 1826, having served with prominent naval officers like Hood, Jervis and Nelson in a long and distinguished career.|$|E
5|$|McConnell {{was raised}} in Colorado and after {{studying}} chemistry she became a high school teacher. She later attended medical school at the University of Colorado Denver, graduating in 1925. She specialized {{in the fields of}} toxicology and forensic pathology, which led her to <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> many high-profile criminal cases throughout her career. In addition to working as Denver's city toxicologist, she held positions in multiple hospitals and administrative boards. After battling lifelong health problems, including rheumatic heart disease and a leg amputation, McConnell died in 1975. She was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Sundiata Acoli, Assata Shakur, Trooper Harper, and a New Jersey Turnpike {{driver who}} saw {{part of the}} {{incident}} were the only surviving witnesses.

5|$|Taylor was {{the first}} Compulsory Process Clause case since Washington v. Texas to provide a {{specific}} limitation {{on the right of}} defendants to force their witnesses to <b>testify.</b> <b>In</b> that case, the Court construed a defendant's right very broadly in his ability to present a defense. Here, however, the Court restricted that ability to comply with court rules, especially if those rules were of equal consequence upon both the prosecution and the defense. This decision was reached over the dissent of three Justices, all of whom felt a defendant's case should not be limited based on an error solely by the defendant's attorney to list appropriate witnesses.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of World War II, Gheorghe Tătărescu {{initiated}} a move to rally political forces in opposition to Ion Antonescu's dictatorship, and sought an alliance with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). He was twice expelled from the PNL, in 1938 and 1944, creating instead his own group, the National Liberal Party-Tătărescu, and representing it inside the Communist-endorsed Petru Groza cabinet. In 1946-1947, {{he was also the}} President of the Romanian Delegation to the Peace Conference in Paris. After that moment, relations between Tătărescu and the PCR began to sour, and he was replaced from the leadership of both his own party and the Foreign Ministry when his name was implicated in the Tămădău Affair. Following the Communist takeover, he was arrested and held as a political prisoner, while being called to <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> the trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu. He died soon after his release from prison.|$|E
5|$|From 1910 {{until his}} death from typhoid fever in 1912, Wilbur took the {{leading role in the}} patent struggle, {{traveling}} incessantly to consult with lawyers and <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> what he felt was a moral cause, particularly against Curtiss, who was creating a large company to manufacture aircraft. The Wrights' preoccupation with the legal issue stifled their work on new designs, and by 1911 Wright airplanes were considered inferior to those of European makers. Indeed, aviation development in the U.S. was suppressed {{to such an extent that}} when the U.S. entered World War I no acceptable American-designed airplanes were available, and U.S. forces were compelled to use French machines. Orville and Katharine Wright believed Curtiss was partly responsible for Wilbur's premature death, which occurred in the wake of his exhausting travels and the stress of the legal battle.|$|E

5|$|In 1795, Rebecca and {{he moved}} back to Kentucky, living in present Nicholas County on land owned by their son Daniel Morgan Boone. The next year, Boone applied to Isaac Shelby, the first {{governor}} of the new state of Kentucky, for a contract to widen the Wilderness Road into a wagon route, but the contract was awarded to someone else. Meanwhile, lawsuits over conflicting land claims continued {{to make their way}} through the Kentucky courts. Boone's remaining land claims were sold off to pay legal fees and taxes, but he no longer paid attention to the process. In 1798, a warrant was issued for Boone's arrest after he ignored a summons to <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> a court case, although the sheriff never found him. That same year, the Kentucky assembly named Boone County in his honor.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Collins' husband, Bill, {{was charged}} in an influence-peddling scandal. The {{prosecution}} claimed that while Collins was governor, Dr. Collins exploited {{a perception that}} he could influence the awarding of state contracts through his wife. It was alleged that he exploited this perception to pressure people who did business with the state to invest nearly $2million with him. He was convicted on October 14, 1993, after a seven-week trial; {{he was given a}} sentence of five years and three months in federal prison, which was {{at the low end of}} the range prescribed by the federal sentencing guidelines. He was also fined $20,000 for a conspiracy charge that involved kickbacks disguised as political contributions. Governor Collins was called to <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> the trial, but was not charged. The scandal tarnished her image, however, and may have cost her an appointment in the administration of President Bill Clinton. Collins was also rumored to be considering running for the U.S. Senate, a bid which never materialized following her husband's conviction. The Collinses reunited following Dr. Collins' release from prison on October 10, 1997.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} by Evan Chandler, on behalf of his then-13-year-old child, Jordan Chandler. To the father's disapproval and concern, his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan Chandler, a dentist, his son said that Jackson had touched his penis. Evan Chandler was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement. Jordan Chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan Chandler refused to <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> the criminal proceedings, the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jordan Chandler later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|Milošević's term {{in office}} in Yugoslavia {{was coming to an}} end, and the {{elections}} that came on September 24, 2000, were protested due to allegations of fraud and rigged elections. This all came to a head on October 5 in the so-called Bulldozer Revolution. Milošević resigned on October 7. The Democratic Opposition of Serbia won a majority in parliamentary elections that December. Milošević was taken into custody on April 1, 2001, and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on June 28 to face charges of war crimes and genocide. Clark was called to <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> a closed session of Milošević's trial in December 2003. He testified on issues ranging from the Srebrenica massacre to conversations Clark had had with Milošević during his career. Some anti-war activist groups also label Clark and Bill Clinton (along with several others) as war criminals for NATO's entire bombing campaign, saying the entire operation was in violation of the NATO charter.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{announcement}} that Toyota was moving to Georgetown, Martha Lane Collins, within her capacity as Governor condemned a portion of land belonging to real estate developer Gordon Taub. Taub owned 60 acres within the Toyota plant site and 4.2 acres were condemned to build a four-lane highway to the Toyota plant entrance. Taub challenged the condemnation stating that the Commonwealth {{did not have the}} right to condemn private property for the use of a for profit, public corporation. At trial, Martha Lane Collins became the first sitting governor of Kentucky to <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> court.She was represented by former governor, Bert T. Combs, Taub was represented by former governor Louis B. Nunn; this was also the first time in the history of Kentucky that two former governors represented opposing parties in a legal action.|$|E
5|$|This came on {{the heels}} of controversies about whether some of Oppenheimer's students, {{including}} David Bohm, Ross Lomanitz and Bernard Peters, had been Communists at the time they had worked with him at Berkeley. Oppenheimer was called to <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> front of the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he admitted that he had associations with the Communist Party in the 1930s, and named some of his students as being Communists or closely associated with them. Bohm and Peters eventually left the country, while Lomanitz was forced to work as a laborer. Frank Oppenheimer was fired from his university position, and could not find work in physics for a decade. He and his wife Jackie became cattle ranchers in Colorado. Their reputations were rehabilitated in 1959, and they founded the San Francisco Exploratorium in 1969.|$|E

5|$|While ashore {{during the}} peace Macnamara {{contrived}} to become {{embroiled in a}} duel. While walking his Newfoundland dog in Hyde Park on 6 April 1803 he had an altercation with Colonel Robert Montgomery, when their dogs began fighting. Harsh words were exchanged, and the two parties fought a duel that evening at Chalk Farm. Both men were wounded, the colonel mortally. Macnamara was arrested {{on a charge of}} manslaughter and put on trial at the Old Bailey on 22 April. Macnamara defended himself from the charge on the grounds that he had received an affront and that it was necessary for him to challenge it in order to maintain his position as a naval officer. He summoned many of his naval friends, among whom Viscounts Hood and Nelson, Lord Hotham, Sir Hyde Parker, Sir Thomas Troubridge, Captains Martin, Towry, Lydiard, Moore and Waller; and General Churchill and Lord Minto, to <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> his defence. They supported his assertion that he was the 'reverse of quarrelsome' and the jury took ten minutes to acquit him.|$|E
5|$|After {{witnessing}} California-based gang boss Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes {{to death}} in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes {{to be placed in}} the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a bathroom, and a man using another bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX.|$|E
5|$|Chrissie {{discovers that}} Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is the mystery buyer of the pub, {{and she and}} Jake make a quick sale to Ian before fleeing the Square. At the airport, they see Sharon, Phil and Grant with the police. Sharon confronts and then punches Chrissie, who is then arrested for Den's murder. Chrissie says that she will only co-operate in {{exchange}} for a meeting with Sharon. This is earned, and she tries to make Sharon realise why she killed her father, to no avail. She reveals that she forged Den's signature on the document in which Den handed over the pub to Chrissie, thus the pub legally belongs to Sharon. Jake visits Chrissie in jail and asks her to marry him. She finds out that he has lost the £25,000 that was to be her bail money, and storms out of the visiting room, calling Jake an idiot. She begins plotting revenge on Sharon for sending her to prison by trying to force her to <b>testify</b> <b>in</b> court about what Den was really like, wanting to see Sharon crumble at confessing how he cheated and supposedly beat her mother (which he never did). After a week in prison, she gives up and dismisses her solicitor, and decides to plead guilty to murder. After an emotional farewell to Jake, she walks into her cell with a contented smile.|$|E
