5000|$|When an ESR meter {{is used as}} a milliohmmeter, any {{significant}} inductance present between the <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> will make measurements meaningless. For example, an ESR meter is unsuitable for measuring resistance in transformer windings because of their inductive characteristics. This effect is significant enough that <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> with coiled cords should not be used due to their inductance.|$|R

50|$|A <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> is a {{physical}} device used to connect electronic test equipment to a device under test (DUT). Test probes range from very simple, robust devices to complex probes that are sophisticated, expensive, and fragile. Specific types include test prods, oscilloscope probes and current probes. A <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> is often supplied as a test lead, which includes the probe, cable and terminating connector.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{devised a}} method for {{applying}} strain gage testing to determining the stresses placed on circuit boards by the {{hundreds or thousands of}} test probes used to make electrical contact therewith. [...] This is useful because each <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> (a.k.a. [...] "pogo pin") exerts several ounces of force on the DUT (Device Under Test). When the test fixture has thousands of test probes, the sum of the individual probe forces can reach hundreds of pounds. Such force is sufficient to deform the DUT (a printed circuit board, for example) {{to the point where the}} attached inflexible electronic component packages (such as Ball Grid Arrays) may fracture, or their solder joints may fail. Strain gage testing can reveal areas on the DUT where these net forces are excessive when the DUT is clamped into the test fixture, thus showing where supports must be added to the opposite side of the test fixture to counteract the <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> forces. Where a support counteracts the <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> forces, the <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> force is converted from a deformative force distorting the DUT to a compressive force, squeezing the DUT circuit board without deforming its generally planar shape.|$|E
50|$|Usually a {{very simple}} device, it {{normally}} provides an amplifier, and a loudspeaker, often battery-powered and packaged into a small, hand-held <b>test</b> <b>probe.</b> An optional diode detector is usually also provided, allowing the detection of amplitude-modulated signals.|$|E

Allows thorough evaluation of test structure characteristics and of manufacturing process parameters. Test structure consists of shift register and matrix of inverter/transmission-gate cells connected to two-by-ten array of probe pads. Entire pattern contained in square area having only 1. 6 -millimeter sides. Shift register is conventional static CMOS device using inverters and transmission gates in master/slave D flip-flop configuration...|$|R
50|$|A {{directly}} connected <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> (so called 1× probe) {{puts the}} unwanted lead capacitance across the circuit under test. For a typical coaxial cable, loading {{is of the}} order of 100pF per meter (the length of a typical test lead).|$|E
50|$|In electronics, by {{attaching}} a multimeter, oscilloscope, or other testing device via a <b>test</b> <b>probe,</b> {{small amounts of}} capacitance, resistance, or inductance may be introduced. Though good scopes have very slight effects, in sensitive circuitry these can lead to unexpected failures, or conversely, unexpected fixes to failures.|$|E
50|$|A {{logic probe}} is a {{hand-held}} pen-like <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> used for analyzing and troubleshooting the logical states (Boolean 0 or 1) of a digital circuit. While most are {{powered by the}} circuit under test, some devices use batteries. They {{can be used on}} either TTL (transistor-transistor logic) or CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) integrated circuit devices.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the testing}} of printed circuit boards, a flying <b>probe</b> <b>test</b> system {{may be used for}} testing low to mid volume production, prototypes, and boards that present {{accessibility}} problems. Flying <b>probe</b> <b>testing</b> uses electro-mechanically controlled probes to access components on printed circuit assemblies (PCAs). The probes are moved around the board under test using an automatically operated two-axis system, and one or more <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> contact components of the board or test points on the printed circuit board.|$|R
5000|$|The {{signaling}} on high-speed serial buses like PCI Express, Fibre Channel 10-Gbit/s Ethernet, InfiniBand or Intel®’s QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) is {{very sensitive}} to capacitive coupling effects. As a result, placing a test pad {{on one of these}} buses to provide access to the <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> that external instruments such as oscilloscopes and in-circuit test systems rely on will disrupt the integrity of signals on the underlying bus. As a result, today’s best practices for designing circuit boards call for the elimination of test pads, which restricts the use of <b>test</b> <b>probes.</b> The alternative is embedded instruments which are able to test from the inside out.|$|R
2500|$|Measurement of low {{resistance}} requires lead resistance (measured by touching the <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> together) to be subtracted for best accuracy. This {{can be done}} with the [...] "delta", [...] "Zero", or [...] "null" [...] feature of many digital multimeters.|$|R
5000|$|Bead probe {{technology}} (BPT) is {{technique used}} to provide electrical access (called “nodal access”) to printed circuit board (PCB) circuitry for performing [...] in-circuit testing (ICT). It makes use of small beads of solder placed onto the board's traces to allow measuring and controlling of the signals using a <b>test</b> <b>probe.</b> This permits test access to boards on which standard ICT test pads are not feasible due to space constraints.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} programming jargon, a heisenbug is a software bug {{that seems to}} disappear or alter its behavior when one attempts to study it. The term is a pun on the name of Werner Heisenberg, the physicist who first asserted the observer effect of quantum mechanics, which states {{that the act of}} observing a system inevitably alters its state. In electronics the traditional term is probe effect, where attaching a <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> to a device changes its behavior.|$|E
5000|$|The {{soldering}} {{process that}} forms the bead probe leaves a coating of flux. Depending on the manufacturing process used, this flux can have varying levels of hardness. Flux with a waxy hardness can reduce the deformation force from the bead, preventing proper contact with the <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> during the first pass contact. This becomes less of an issue on subsequent contacts as the flux is displaced. Test probes with serrated ends of an appropriate size can also aid in measuring bead probes where flux is an issue.|$|E

5000|$|A JTAG {{interface}} is {{a special}} interface added to a chip. Depending on the version of JTAG, two, four, or five pins are added. The four and five pin interfaces are designed so that multiple chips on a board can have their JTAG lines daisy-chained together if specific conditions are met. The two pin interface is designed so that multiple chips can be connected in a star topology. In either case a <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> need only connect to a single [...] "JTAG port" [...] {{to have access to}} all chips on a circuit board.|$|E
5000|$|Bead probe {{technology}} is a probing method used to connect electronic test equipment to the device under test (DUT) within a bed of nails fixture. The technique was first used in the 1990s and originally given the name “Waygood Bump” {{after one of the}} main proponents, Rex Waygood. They are also commonly referred to as solder bumps. [...] Bead probes were designed for when less than 30 mil is available for <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> points on the PCB. They are used with standard ICT spring-loaded test probes to connect the test equipment to the DUT.|$|E
50|$|Mathematically, how {{the impulse}} is {{described}} {{depends on whether}} the system is modeled in discrete or continuous time. The impulse can be modeled as a Dirac delta function for continuous-time systems, or as the Kronecker delta for discrete-time systems. The Dirac delta represents the limiting case of a pulse made very short in time while maintaining its area or integral (thus giving an infinitely high peak). While this is impossible in any real system, it is a useful idealisation. In Fourier analysis theory, such an impulse comprises equal portions of all possible excitation frequencies, {{which makes it a}} convenient <b>test</b> <b>probe.</b>|$|E

50|$|PIN diodes are {{sometimes}} {{used as input}} protection devices for high frequency <b>test</b> <b>probes.</b> If the input signal is within range, the PIN diode has little impact as a small capacitance. If the signal is large, then the PIN diode starts to conduct and becomes a resistor that shunts most of the signal to ground.|$|R

50|$|Reference Point Indentation uses {{a unique}} probe {{assembly}} {{to establish a}} surface-localized reference point to accurately “feel” a material. One specific form of RPI uses a multi-probe assembly that includes a <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> contained within the sheath of an outer reference probe. In Reference Point Indentation large loads and small tip sizes are used, so the indentation area may be up to a few hundred square micrometres. Atomic force microscopy or scanning electron microscopy techniques may be utilized to image the indentation, but can be quite cumbersome and requires that the measurement site be exposed and potentially altered {{in order to make}} the measurement. Instead, an indenter with a geometry known to high precision is employed.|$|E
50|$|Detecting and {{eliminating}} poor bonding is relatively straightforward. Detection is accomplished using a simple DC voltmeter, with <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> leads placed in various {{locations in the}} plumbing. Typically, a probe on a hot pipe and a probe on a cold pipe will tell the user if there is improper grounding. Anything beyond a few millivolts is significant, and potentials of 200 mV are common. A missing bond will show up best {{in the area of}} the gap, as the measured electrical potential dissipates over distance. The missing bond is usually located near the cold water inlet to the building, as filtration and treatment equipment are usually added there, but pinhole leaks can occur anywhere downstream or upstream from the interruption of electrical continuity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{principle}} of opponent processes describes {{the interaction between}} verbatim and gist processes in creating true and false memories. Whereas true memory is supported by both verbatim and gist processes, false memory is supported by gist processes and suppressed by verbatim processes. In other words, verbatim and gist processes work in opposition to one another {{when it comes to}} false memories. [...] Suppose, for example, that one is presented with a word list such as lemon, apple, pear, and citrus. During a recognition test, the items lemon (target), orange (related distractor), and fan (unrelated distractor) are shown. In this case, retrieval of a gist trace (fruits) supports acceptance of both test probes lemon (true memory) and orange (false memory), whereas retrieval of a verbatim trace (lemon) only supports acceptance of the <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> lemon. In addition, retrieval of an exclusory verbatim trace ("I saw only the words lemon, apple, pear, and citrus") suppresses acceptance of false but related items such as orange through an operation known as recollection rejection. If neither verbatim nor gist traces are retrieved, then one might accept any <b>test</b> <b>probe</b> on the basis of response bias.This principle {{plays a key role in}} FTT's explanation of experimental dissociations between true and false memories (e.g., when a variable affects one type of memory without affecting the other, or when it produces opposite effects on them). The time of exposure of each word during study and the number of repetitions have been shown to produce such dissociations. More specifically, while true memory follows a monotonically increasing function when plotted against presentation duration, false memory rates exhibit an inverted-U pattern when plotted as a function of presentation duration. Similarly, repetition is monotonically related to true memory (true memory increases as a function of the number of repetitions) and is non-monotonically related to false memory (repetition produces an inverted-U relation with false memory).|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to underline that the shift of the natural percolation threshold is strongly associated to dimensionality. Indeed this was determined via soil <b>test</b> <b>probes</b> in 3 D and the percolation thresholds are smaller in this dimension than in the plane. The simplification of a 2 D analysis is justified by the limitations of processing equipment and the information availability.|$|R

This deposit occurs {{at the top of}} the mounded area.|$|R
50|$|A NASA study led by David F. Dinges, {{professor}} at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, found that naps can improve certain memory functions. In that NASA study, volunteers spent several days living on one of 18 different sleep schedules, all in a laboratory setting.
