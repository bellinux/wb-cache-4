40|$|With {{the devastation}} {{wrought by the}} 2008 'property market bubble' still fresh in the mind on one hand, and a spate of recent enthusiasm {{manifested}} in the 'rush to the property ladder' on the other, the newly enacted Directive 2014 / 17 seeks to strike a middle ground of reasonableness in the delicate and sensitive matter of the security granted by the buyer of a residential property. Against this background, the present contribution analyses, first and foremost, the norms of a regulatory nature introduced by the new EU piece of legislation and the attempt to shape a new category of consumer. Among these precepts, attention is particularly afforded to the principle, of a public nature, prescribing that the bank's assessment to grant a mortgage shall be prevailingly based {{on the ability of}} the mortgagor to repay the debt, rather than on the expected (but undemonstrated) burgeoning future value of the property. Furthermore, the discussion focuses on the private law principles introduced by the Directive. Among these is <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank to provide adequate information about the terms and conditions of the mortgage. More interestingly, the directive at stake derogates from, and goes beyond, the notion of prohibition of 'agreement of forfeiture' existing in some civil law jurisdictions. This novelty, the ancillary legal provisions of art 28 of Directive 2014 / 17 as well as their impact on the system of civil proceedings and foreclosure existing in each country, provide fertile ground for a legal and comparative analysis.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIt {{is widely believed}} that the regional dynamics in South Asia, characterized by power-asymmetry and geographical Indo-centricity, make the region a particularly brittle strategic environment. In that challenging context, this study seeks to determine why regional integration, including {{the creation of an}} important role for SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation), has been so difficult in South Asia. The paper asserts that the power asymmetry between India and other South Asian countries has fueled an environment of regional discord, which has adversely affected regionalism in South Asia. The conflictual relationships, most prominent between India and Pakistan, have manifested in a regional mindset that is highly sensitive to state sovereignty and averse to the notion of relinquishing any degree of state sovereignty to a supra-national authority, which the European countries successfully accomplished. Such a mindset has made it difficult for South Asian countries to properly institutionalize the SAARC. The paper concludes that despite the setbacks, the prospects appear positive for regional integration in South Asia. But to achieve any meaningful traction in the integration process, <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> ultimately <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> SAARC members to change their attitudes vis-à-vis each other and soften their respective stances.

The major objective {{of this study is to}} establish a link between culture and development. Specifically, the study is aimed at identifying how the different components of culture can be harnessed to stimulate development in human societies. By way of research methodology, the writer made use of secondary sources of data which involves a review of works done by other researchers in this field. Thus text books, journals, institutional publications, and a host of related materials were consulted in the course of this research.

5000|$|Under the Prevention of Crime Act, {{otherwise}} 'exempt' knives carried for [...] "good {{reason or}} lawful authority" [...] may be still deemed illegal if authorities conclude the knife is being carried as an [...] "offensive weapon". In recent years, the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 has been reinterpreted by police and public prosecutors, who have persuaded {{the courts to}} minimize exceptions to prosecution {{on the grounds that}} the defendant had [...] "lawful authority or reasonable excuse" [...] in order to apply the Act to a wide variety of cases. [...] This new approach now includes prosecution of citizens who have admitted carrying a knife for the sole purpose of self-defence (in the eyes of the law, this is presently viewed as an admission that the defendant intends to use the knife as an [...] "offensive weapon", albeit in a defensive manner, and in otherwise justifiable circumstances). [...] While <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> the officer to prove offensive intent, prosecutors and courts have in the past taken the appearance and the marketing of a particular brand of knife into account when considering whether an otherwise legal knife was being carried as an offensive weapon.

A knife which is marketed as [...] "tactical", [...] "military", [...] "special ops", etc. could therefore carry an extra liability.|$|E
50|$|The above {{arguments}} are still cogent in the modern, computer-heavy military simulation environment. There remains a recognised place for umpires as arbiters of a simulation, hence {{the persistence of}} manual simulations in war colleges throughout the world. Both computer-assisted and entirely computerised simulations are common as well, with each being used as required by circumstances. The Rand Corporation {{is one of the}} best known designers of Military Simulations for the US Government and Air Force, and one of the pioneers of the Political-Military simulation. Their SAFE (Strategic And Force Evaluation) simulation is an example of a manual simulation, with one or more teams of up to ten participants being sequestered in separate rooms and their moves being overseen by an independent director and his staff. Such simulations may be conducted over a few days (thus requiring commitment from the participants): an initial scenario (for example, a conflict breaking out in the Persian Gulf) is presented to the players with appropriate historical, political and military background information. They then have a set amount of time to discuss and formulate a strategy, with input from the directors/umpires (often called Control) as required. Where more than one team is participating, teams may be divided on partisan lines—traditionally Blue and Red are used as designations, with Blue representing the 'home' nation and Red the opposition. In this case, the teams will work against each other, their moves and counter-moves being relayed to their opponents by Control, who will also adjudicate on the results of such moves. At set intervals, Control will declare a change in the scenario, usually of a period of days or weeks, and present the evolving situation to the teams based on their reading of how it might develop as a result of the moves made. For example, Blue Team might decide to respond to the Gulf conflict by moving a carrier battle group into the area whilst simultaneously using diplomatic channels to avert hostilities. Red Team, on the other hand, might decide to offer military aid to one side or another, perhaps seeing an opportunity to gain influence in the region and counter Blue's initiatives. At this point Control could declare a week has now passed, and present an updated scenario to the players: possibly the situation has deteriorated further and Blue must now decide if they wish to pursue the military option, or alternatively tensions might have eased and <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> now <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> Red as to whether to escalate by providing more direct aid to their clients.|$|R
40|$|The {{decline in}} global oil prices is {{considered}} an impetus for Nigeria to diversify into non-oil export as an additional means of generating growth. Horticultural products’ export (HPE) has been suggested as a means through which Nigeria could increase its foreign exchange earnings along similar lines as other African economies, such as Kenya and Ethiopia. However, to achieve competitive advantage in HPE necessitates participation in global horticulture value chains. Meanwhile, there are preconditions to gainful participation such as compliance with stringent food safety and quality standards, importing countries’ regulations, buyers’ specifications and other international trade regulatory standards, in addition to employing practices that can enhance market penetration. The {{aim of this study}} is to explore the potential for increasing horticultural products’ export from Nigeria. The study has employed a single-case embedded design and multiple perspectives of five stakeholder groups were explored through interviews (a focus group, in-depth and telephone interviews) in addition to direct observations and archival records. These multiple sources of evidence have enabled this study to provide valid evidence of the barriers inhibiting HPE from Nigeria. The empirical findings show that there are multi-layered issues which require that a deliberate resolution must be made to position Nigeria’s horticulture sub-sector to participate in global horticulture value chains. The main barriers identified are the existing institutional framework, infrastructure and logistics issues, market penetration issues, stakeholders' inadequacy, food safety and quality concerns, high cost of finance, export operational challenges, neglect of agriculture and the current airline market structure. While recognising there are a number of hurdles to overcome while participating in global horticulture value chains, the thesis concludes by outlining a number of recommendations to strategically improve HPE, emphasising that <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> for improvement <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Nigerian government and its institutions, private organisations and stakeholders who are seeking to increase the export of horticultural products from Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|Our task is {{to respond}} to the request by the Minister for Health for us to {{evaluate}} and meet the training and information needs of general practitioners with regard to the provision of crisis pregnancy counselling. Our response must"be in accordance with the "Regulation of Information (Services Outside State for Termination of Pregnancies) " Act, 1995. In addressing this challenge, we recognise many problems and diffIculties. The Act recognises the right of women to seek abortion information and counselling and the right of doctors to refuse to co-operate in this process. We recognise two dilemmas for doctors. • Firstly, the reservations of those doctors who do decide to give information yet are denied the time-honoured practice of giving the woman a professional letter of referral. • Secondly there is due recognition in the Act of the right of doctors who are conscientious objectors to not co-operate in the process of procuring an abortion but there is no reference in the Act as to how the woman may achieve her objective.

A situation may be compromised where intellectual contributions to a scientific investigation do not adhere to the four key guidelines of scholarship, authorship, approval and agreement as well as the protocols of ensuring good publication ethics. The objective of this review is to lay emphasis on universal standards for manuscript authorship and to fostering good practices. This in our view will bring authorship credit and accountability to the attention of our colleagues and readers at large. To achieve this, a systematic and critical review of the literature was undertaken. Electronic databases, academic journals and books from various sources were accessed. Several key search terms relating to responsible authorship, common authorship malpractices, conflict of interest, universal publication guidelines and other authorship related issues, were used. Only references deemed useful from relevant texts and journal articles were included. In this paper, the authors have sought to highlight the pitfalls researchers sometimes entangle themselves within an act of compromise thereby impinging on the ethical and professional responsibilities for the content of a paper under consideration. This article presents the case that authorship has a strong currency that brings not only personal satisfaction but also career rewards based on publication counting. In all cases described here, a universal standard for manuscript authorship will be critical in fostering good practices.

40|$|Input-output price {{ratio is}} an {{important}} factor in the use of purchased farm inputs. Sufficient empirical evidence is needed to guide rational and accurate prediction of fertilizer demand in a predominantly peasant, external input-driven agro-ecosystem. This study employed time series data for the years 1970 to 2005 to estimate relative price elasticities of fertilizer demand in Nigeria using price ratios of fertilizer to cassava. The autoregressive distributed lag error correction model (ARDL-ECM) produced a plausible estimate of short-run and long-run price elasticities of fertilizer demand with respect to the relative price ratio. The ECM coefficient showed a slow adjustment of fertilizer use to the error correction term, indicating that fertilizer use responds slowly to shifts and shocks in the determining variables. This implies that inspite of the inherent difficulties associated with using fertilizers in Nigeria, the farmers still recognize its relevance in crop production as well as the attendant economic benefits. Another plausible finding of the study was the positive correlation between fertilizer use and irrigation. Following these outcomes, it was advocated, in the main, that farmers should be well informed on market opportunities with consideration given to input and output prices. <b>The</b> <b>onus</b> <b>lies</b> in establishing a workable market information system that would provide timely information with respect to spatial and temporal price variations in both input and output markets.

When it comes to disasters, the less immediately visible sociopolitical setting cannot be ignored; Smith (2006) argues that “there {{is no such thing}} as a natural disaster. In every phase and aspect of a disaster—causes, vulnerability, preparedness, results and response, and reconstruction—the contours of disaster and the difference between who lives and who dies is to a greater or lesser extent a social calculus.” With Blowers (1999) also arguing it is impossible to assess landscapes of risk without understanding the imbalances and injustices contained within them, it follows that if GSV is to be a helpful tool for evaluating the nature of and recovery from the societal effects of disasters like Fukushima, the viewer ought to engage not only with what is happening, but also to pay attention to questions of who decides what happens in particular locations and where imbalances may exist in making these decisions. It is arguably not the aim of GSV to make visible these injustices and inequalities, but it is nevertheless crucial to consider two things: (1) whether the view is as “objective” as we may think it is; and (2) how much of the social dynamics of a disaster we can glean from GSV itself versus where <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> <b>lies</b> with <b>the</b> researcher to supplement the view “on screen” with additional understanding.|$|R

In Cuckmere Brick Co v Mutual Finance Mutual Finance auctioned Cuckmere Brick Co's property after it had defaulted on a loan, but failed to advertise that the property had secured planning permission for building more flats.

40|$|The {{quest for}} {{reliable}} integration of initial value problems (IVPs) for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a long-standing problem in numerical analysis. At {{one end of}} the reliability spectrum are fixed stepsize methods implemented using standard floating point, where <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> <b>lies</b> entirely with <b>the</b> user to ensure the stepsize chosen is adequate for the desired accuracy. At {{the other end of the}} reliability spectrum are rigorous interval-based methods, that can provide provably correct bounds on the error of a numerical solution. This rigour comes at a price, however: interval methods are generally 2 - 3 orders of magnitude more expensive than fixed stepsize floating-point methods. Along the spectrum between these two extremes lie various methods of different expense that estimate local errors and adjust the stepsize accordingly. In this paper, we continue previous investigations into a class of interpolants for use in Runge-Kutta methods that have a defect function whose shape is asymptotically independent of the problem being integrated, so that the point at which the maximum defect occurs is known a priori. In addition, we find interpolants for which the defect function is almost independent of the timestep, allowing the defect to be monitored and controlled in an efficient and robust manner even for modestly large timesteps, at a fraction of the cost of previously published methods. Our interpolants also offer the highest order possible based on the discrete method. We demonstrate the approach on three Runge-Kutta integrators of order 5, 6, and 8, and provide Fortran and preliminary Matlab interfaces to all three new integrators. We also consider how sensitive such methods are to roundoff errors. Numerical results for four problems on a range of accuracy requests are presented. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the gendered implications of Africa's transport gap (the lack of cheap, regular and reliable transport) {{for young people}} in rural Ghana, with particular reference to the linkages between restricted mobility, household work demands, access to education and livelihood potential. Our aim is to show how mobility constraints, especially as these interact with household labour demands, restrict young people's access to education and livelihood opportunities. Firstly, the paper considers {{the implications of the}} direct constraints on young people's mobility potential as they travel to school. Then it examines young people's (mostly unpaid) labour contributions, which are commonly crucial to family household production and reproduction, including those associated with the transport gap. This has especially important implications for girls, <b>on</b> whom <b>the</b> principal <b>onus</b> <b>lies</b> to help adult women carry the heavy burden of water, firewood, and agricultural products required for household use. Such work can impact significantly on their educational attendance and performance in school and thus has potential knock-on impacts for livelihoods. Distance from school, when coupled with a heavy workload at home will affect attendance, punctuality and performance at school: it may ultimately represent the tipping point resulting in a decision to withdraw from formal education. Moreover, the heavy burden of work and restricted mobility contributes to young people's negative attitudes to agriculture and rural life and encourages urban migration. Drawing on research from rural case study sites in two regions of Ghana, we discuss ethnographic material from recent interviews with children and young people, their parents, teachers and other key informants, supported by information from an associated survey with children ca. 9 – 18 years...|$|R
5000|$|Money lenders have {{extensive}} rights from common law and statute. A mortgagee's first right is to repayment of the debt, {{but if the}} borrower's circumstances mean this is impossible, a process of taking possession of the mortgaged property and selling it usually begins. Almost every step, however, is mediated through court. The Administration of Justice Act 1970 section 36 says that the court may adjourn proceedings if the [...] "mortgagor {{is likely to be}} able within a reasonable period to pay any sums due under the mortgage", and the Consumer Credit Act 1974 sections 129-130 does the same for second mortgages. In an anomalous case, Ropaigealach v Barclays Bank plc a bank had auctioned off a (second) house the owning a family was away. Clarke LJ felt unable to apply the AJA 1970, because properly construed, it was only able to halt proceedings when legal proceedings had in fact been launched, and here there were none. In a more borrower-friendly decision, Cheltenham & Gloucester Building Society v Norgan Waite LJ gave guidance that in ordering a plan for repayment, a judge should give [...] "the period most favourable to the mortgagor at the outset", so that repeated applications to court on continuing defaults could be avoided, and so that [...] "the mortgagee can be heard with justice to say that the mortgagor has had his chance". When it comes to a sale, Law of Property Act 1925 sections 101 and 103 require that the provision for sale must have been in the mortgage deed, that three months notice and space must be given. Section 88 confirms that a buyer after a sale receives an unencumbered title. In the sale process itself, there is a duty of care. In Cuckmere Brick Co v Mutual Finance Mutual Finance auctioned Cuckmere Brick Co's property after it had defaulted on a loan, but failed to advertise that the property had secured planning permission for building more flats. Salmon LJ emphasised that because the borrower will still be liable for sums on a loan if a house is undersold, because the [...] "mortgagor is vitally affected by the result of the sale", an obligation is owed to get [...] "the true market value." [...] Moreover, a higher duty of scrutiny will be imposed if a mortgagee sells to a related party. In Tse Kwong Lam v Wong Chit Sen Mr Wong sold property taken from Mr Tse to his wife, after not advertising the auction. The Privy Council advised that while delay in the claim meant the sale should not be set aside, damages could be awarded because of the significant conflict of interest. Lord Templeman emphasised that [...] "a heavy <b>onus</b> <b>lies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mortgagee to show that in all respects he acted fairly" [...] so the transaction is perfectly fair and equal.|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} countries like India, <b>the</b> <b>onus</b> of development <b>lies</b> mainly with the government, which faces the predicament of multiple demands and limited resources. This {{leads to a}} situation where even fundamental objectives such as basic literacy for all are not met. On the other hand, there exists a vibrant private sector, which has resources {{and the desire to}} undertake social responsibility. This sector is also coming up with innovative approaches to overcome barriers to education and is targeting the have-nots. This paper discusses results obtained from Madangir (New Delhi), one of the sites where Minimally Invasive Education learning stations were installed. Minimally Invasive Education (MIE) is one such endeavour. It encourages children to learn on their own, with minimal, or no intervention. Children are provided with free access to computers in an open outdoor location. The informal environment enables children to acquire computer literacy, enhance their academic levels and imbibe other life skills. This project is an illustration of a public-private partnership between the Government of NCT of Delhi and NIIT Ltd (India’s leading private sector corporation offering IT education, training and global IT learning solutions) to overcome digital illiteracy.
