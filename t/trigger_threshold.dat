40|$|Background: The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) {{is being}} {{introduced}} across the UK, {{but there are}} concerns about its specificity in patients with chronic hypoxaemia, such as some patients with COPD. This could lead to frequent clinically insignificant triggers and alarm fatigue. Aims of study: To investigate whether patients with chronic hypoxaemia trigger excessively with NEWS, and to design a simple variant of NEWS for patients with chronic hypoxaemia: a Chronic Respiratory Early Warning Score (CREWS). Methods: Data was collected from respiratory wards at two hospitals in North Wales. Components of NEWS and frequency of <b>trigger</b> <b>thresholds</b> being reached were recorded. CREWS was applied retrospectively to patients’ observations. Results: 196 admissions were analysed, including 78 for patients with chronic hypoxaemia.

Using CREWS, triggers during stability/at discharge were reduced from 32...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{equalization}} of the response functions of the SK and SNO for total event rate and event rate for the energy bins. To calculate the response functions of SNO, we have used the latest theoretical values of the {{cross section of the}} neutrino-deuteron CC process. By using these new theoretical values, we find that the <b>trigger</b> <b>threshold</b> of the SK at which its response function is equalized to the response function of SNO (at the <b>trigger</b> <b>threshold</b> of 6. 75 MeV), is 8. 5 MeV. This value is 0. 1 MeV smaller than the value calculated using the old theoretical values of the cross section of neutrino-deuteron process. The use of these new theoretical values also produces a small change in the range of the energy bins where the response functions are equalized. Comment: 16 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|The M_w = 7. 4 Izmit, Turkey {{earthquake}} triggered widespread regional seismicity in Greece over a study region {{extending from}} 400 km to nearly 1000 km {{away from the}} epicenter.

The increase in cataloged earthquakes in ordinary continental crust is a new observation and is statistically significant at the 95 % level. Unlike the previous example of distant triggering during the Landers earthquake, the activated seismicity occurred entirely in non-volcanic areas. The Greek sites were triggered by waves with amplitudes at least a factor of 3 lower than the observed <b>triggering</b> <b>threshold</b> for Imperial Valley.

30|$|The {{severity}} of job loss and persistent labor market weakness {{during and after}} the recession of 2007 – 09 resulted in an unprecedented expansion of UI benefit availability. Between mid- 2008 and late 2009, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program was slowly phased in. It initially provided for 13 additional weeks of benefits in July 2008. As listed in Table[*] 1, additional benefit tiers (based on <b>trigger</b> <b>thresholds)</b> were added in December 2008 and November 2009. From that latter date until late 2012, the combined benefits availability through four EUC tiers remained at 53 weeks. In conjunction with normal UI benefit durations of 26 weeks and a maximum of 20 weeks through the EB program, the maximum duration of available UI benefits during this EUC program peak was 99 weeks. Table[*] 1 also lists the subsequent legislative changes that raised the unemployment <b>trigger</b> <b>thresholds</b> in May 2012 and scaled back maximum EUC durations slightly in September (through changes in three of the four tiers). These provisions remained in place through the termination of the program at the end of 2013.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the utilisation of paper-based track and trigger (TandT) charts in a UK emergency department (ED). Methods: A single-centre prospective observational cohort {{study was conducted}} in the ED of a medium-sized teaching hospital. Charted vital-sign data were collected from adults attending the resuscitation room, majors or observation ward. These data were examined in parallel with clinical notes to identify 'escalation' events. For each set of vital signs, the authors calculated the TandT score retrospectively. Results: Data from 472 patient episodes (2965 sets of vital signs) were examined. 85. 8 % of patients had at least one full set of observations (CEM standard) and 60. 6 % had at least one TandT score documented. However, only 34. 5 % of observation sets had a corresponding TandT score. 20. 6 % of TandT score totals (1024) were incorrect, potentially preventing a 'trigger' from being recognised. 204 patient episodes had at least one recorded escalation. Physiological escalations were associated with vital-sign scores that met the <b>triggering</b> <b>thresholds</b> (98 / 104), while patients who had non-physiological escalations or no escalations {{were more likely to have}} scores below the <b>triggering</b> <b>thresholds</b> (88 / 100). Only 26. 9 % of physiological escalations were associated with a documented TandT score above the <b>triggering</b> <b>threshold.</b> Retrospective completion of the charts increased that figure to 94. 2 %. Conclusion: TandT in the ED is challenged by poor completion rates and numerical errors made during score calculation. However the potential for recognition of a deteriorating patient should not be ignored. The future work of the authors intends to evaluate an electronic system for automatically calculating TandT scores within the ED environment.

It is 100 % efficient for showers {{which are}} induced by primary particles with energies above 10 15 eV to pursue its main goal, {{the examination of}} the knee in the flux spectrum at ≈ 5 · 10 15 eV. A specially adapted method to calculate two observables (Nch, the number of charged particles and Nµ, the number of muons) by means of a maximum likelihood estimate will be presented. The estimate combines different detector systems and works already at energies around the <b>trigger</b> <b>threshold</b> of KASCADE at ≈ 10 14 eV. These observables are used to reconstruct a preliminary energy flux spectrum which is compared with direct measurements and previous measurements of KASCADE at energies above 10 15 eV. The reconstruction of energy spectrum and elemental composition around the <b>trigger</b> <b>threshold</b> of KASCADE is important for two reasons. First the estimated spectrum at higher energies has to be congruent with the results of direct measurements.

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{comprehensive}} investigation {{of the influence of}} current transformer (CT) saturation on restricted earth fault (REF) protection during power transformer magnetization inrush are presented. Since the inrush current during switch-on of unloaded power transformer is stochastic, its values are obtained by: (i) laboratory measurements and (ii) calculations based on the input data obtained by the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. To make a detailed assessment of the current transformer performance the uncertain input data for the CT model were obtained by applying the MC method. In this way, different levels of remanent flux in CT core are taken into consideration. By the generated CT secondary currents, the algorithm for REF protection based on phase comparison in time domain is tested. On the basis of the obtained results, a method of adjustment of the <b>triggering</b> <b>threshold</b> in order to ensure safe operation during transients, and thereby improve the algorithm security, has been proposed.

The measurement of the neutron {{detection efficiency}} of a NE 110 scintillator provided a reference calibration. At the lowest <b>trigger</b> <b>threshold,</b> the overall calorimeter efficiency ranges from 40 % to 50 %. This value largely exceeds the estimated 8 - 16 % expected if the response were proportional only to the scintillator equivalent thickness. A detailed simulation of the calorimeter and of the TSL beamline has been performed with the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. The simulated response of the detector to neutrons is presented, {{as well as a}} first data Monte Carlo comparison. The results show an overall neutron efficiency of about 50 %, when no <b>trigger</b> <b>threshold</b> is applied. The reasons of such an efficiency enhancement, in comparison with the typical scintillator-based neutron counters, are explained, opening the road to a novel neutron detector. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|The LTE systems {{focus on}} the {{services}} in the packet-switched domain to minimize the transmission latency while increasing the robustness of communication. Handover frequently occurs for the UEs of high movement speed, and thus, efficient handover is a crucial issue, especially for real-time services such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). In the traditional handover scheme, {{the difference in the}} reference signal received power (RSRP) of host node and target node is obtained, which is then compared with the <b>trigger</b> <b>threshold.</b> In [10], a scheme called Integrator Handover Algorithm was proposed. It uses a special case of first-order auto-regressive moving average filter to integrate the filtered difference as another way of handover decision for real-time services. Handover is triggered immediately if the filtered difference is greater than the <b>trigger</b> <b>threshold.</b> As a result, the ping-pong effect can exist for a UE moving {{in and out of the}} cell boundaries. Introducing time-to-trigger window is to reduce the ping-pong effect. Handover, then, is triggered only when the difference is greater than the threshold during the entire window. Even with this mechanism, the handover decision cannot be made fast due to the window and integration-based operation, which is not desired for real-time services.|$|E

The establishment of B cell repertoires, on the other hand, seems to involve selective processes that are critically dependent on B cell receptor (BCR) ligation. In order to assess the importance of BCR <b>triggering</b> <b>thresholds</b> on the selection of polyclonal unmanipulated B cell populations, we compared VH gene expression and reactivity repertoires in various B cell compartments of wild-type and IFN-I receptor-deficient mice (IFN-I-R–/–). These analyses demonstrate that increased B cell sensitivity to BCR ligation mediated by IFN-I in the bone marrow (BM) has consequences on the stringency of B cell repertoire selection. Thus, the normal counterselection of both VH 7183 gene family expression and multireactivity was impaired among immature BM B cells from mutant mice. Furthermore, {{as a result of}} reduced efficiency of BCR ligationdependent inhibition of terminal differentiation, IFN-I-R –/ – animals produce, in BM and thymus, higher numbers of plasma cells secreting antibodies that are more multireactive than wild-type animals. Finally, mutant serum IgM natural antibodies display a more reactive repertoire than controls, a likely reflection of the BM resident plasma cell repertoire.
