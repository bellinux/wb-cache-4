40|$|The {{success of}} {{training}} through virtual environments is due both to an interesting cost savings for industry and positive results for learners. However, the system behind {{this approach is}} usually hard to produce, being strongly domain-dependent {{and for this reason}} difficult to port on other domains. Here we present the design of a domain-independent training system based on simulation environments, capable to be reused in different domains and especially in the industrial ones, saving costs considerably. The main idea behind the system design is the separation between the domain logic and the trainer role. This distinction is achieved by the adoption of a modular and flexible agent-based system approach. We present a first case study for training advanced technicians to learn maintenance procedures for complex medium <b>tension</b> <b>equipments.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a 2 -D and 3 -D {{finite element}} model of roll {{tensioning}} process of circular saw blade were established by Static/General module of ABAQUS software based on finite element method. The rolling force and tensioning stress distribution of circular saw blade were calculated by these two models which were proved to be true and reliable. The effects of yield strength of circular saw blade on tensioning stress distribution and rolling force were studied. The research achievements showed that a circular saw blade made with high yield strength obtained a higher tangential compressive stress and radial compressive stress in the rolled region during roll tensioning process, which has both advantages and disadvantages for {{the stability of the}} saw blade. Besides, a circular saw blade made with high yield strength also put forward higher requirements for roll <b>tensioning</b> <b>equipment</b> because of the large rolling force during roll tensioning process.|$|R
40|$|Now, {{aging is}} {{progressing}} {{all over the}} world. Therefore, prevention of bone fracture is required. In order to do it, {{it is necessary to}} analyze deformation behavior of bone when a person falls down. However, the mechanical properties of bone have not been investigated when impact load acts on it. This study focuses on impact tension property of bone and constructs impact <b>tension</b> test <b>equipment</b> as a purpose. The theory of the split Hopkinson stick method was applied to the impact tension test. But various problems have occurred on the impact <b>tension</b> test <b>equipment.</b> The fixed method of lead wires produced a wave problem at Gauge 2 and this problem was improved by using straws. The biggest problem is occurred at Gauge 1, which is unstable output from Gauge 1. But the confirmation of this problem is difficult by experimental method.

40|$|This {{work was}} aimed at {{establishing}} a wobble friction coefficient (K) from records regarding some post-stressed bridges built in Colombia. Such records were arranged and analysed together with stress diagrams resulting from the corres-ponding plans, calculations and reports. Suitable records were produced from this review to make the analysis. Once the records had been selected, the probable wobble friction coefficient (K) was then calculated for each case and this coefficient {{was related to the}} length of the cable and the total area of the strands composing the cable. These records and their results were subsequently grouped according to the type of bridge to produce a wobble friction coefficient (K) for each specific structure. The study indicated that the wobble friction coefficient was lower than that indicated by the Colombian Seismic Bridge Design Code, Instituto Nacional De Vías, 1995]. The influence of <b>tensioning</b> <b>equipment,</b> materials and labour suggested a format for recording tensioning to reduce inaccuracy when readings are being taken.

The second method is based on the analysis of the digital images acquired by a fast camera during the tests; this permitted to calibrate the JC model by an analytical minimization procedure, without any FE simulation. A third inverse technique was also implemented, consisting in applying the FE model updating but using an enriched cost function, where also the mismatch between the numerical and acquired specimen shape profiles is included and minimized.

30|$|Based on the {{variation}} of tensile force during the start, stop {{and operation of}} belt conveyor, a <b>tension</b> technology and <b>equipment</b> of high accuracy and large tensioning stroke has been developed. It can quickly respond and automatically adjust tension and tensioning stroke with the tension variation of the belt conveyor. During normal operations, the tensile force is 0.9 – 1.1 times of the rated tensile force, during start and stop, the tensile force is 1.3 – 1.4 times of the rated tensile force, and during the shift of conveyor tail, the equipment can quickly respond and guarantee non-skid. The working principle is: based on the conveyor’s start-up and loading, with the feedback of tension sensor signal, the PLC controller and fuel tank can automatically adjust the output of tensile force to avoid slipping between belts and drive pulley, lower the safety factor selected for the belt, and ensure the normal operation of the belt conveyor. Installed with an automatic moved conveyor tail, the automatic tensioning can be achieved when the conveyor tail is automatically moved, thus to a certain extent, the downtime rate of the belt conveyor and the downtime rate of the three face machine can be reduced.|$|R

2500|$|The {{government}} of Turkey, a NATO member with the alliance′s second largest army, {{had had a}} relatively friendly relationship with Syria over a decade {{prior to the start}} of the civil unrest in Syria in 2011; Turkey, while joining calls for the Syrian government to end the violence, initially objected to the demand voiced in August 2011 by the U.S that Bashar Assad resign. Until September 2014, Turkey did not overtly participate in the international airstrikes against ISIS. Turkey trained defectors from the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011 a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army under the supervision of Turkish military intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operation.

In early February 2016, Reuters referred to Turkey as ″a major sponsor of the insurgency against President Bashar al-Assad″. Turkey provided refuge for Syrian dissidents from early days of the Syrian conflict. In early June 2011, Syrian opposition activists convened in Istanbul to discuss regime change, and Turkey hosted the head of the Free Syrian Army, Colonel Riad al-Asaad. Turkey became increasingly hostile to the Assad government's policies and came to encourage reconciliation among dissident factions. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has tried to [...] "cultivate a favorable relationship with whatever government would take the place of Assad." [...] Since May 2012, Syrian opposition forces have been receiving arms and training from Turkey and the United States. The Islamic Front and Ahrar ash-Sham in particular have received weapons and/or healthcare services from Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Turkey′s involvement in the conflict has been widely seen as going beyond combating ISIL and supporting moderate rebels: Turkey has been accused of fighting against Kurdish forces in Syria, as well as in Iraq, including intelligence collaborations with ISIL in some cases. The conclusion of a highly classified assessment made by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2013 was that Turkey had effectively transformed the secret U.S. arms program in support of moderate rebels, who in effect no longer existed, into an indiscriminate program to provide technical and logistical support to all elements of the opposition, including Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic State. Turkey's subsequent arrangements with Russia and Iran (from early 2017) caused a rift in its relationship with the Syrian opposition, as the opposition leaders criticized Russia′s plan to create safe zones in Syria as threatening the country’s territorial integrity.|$|R
