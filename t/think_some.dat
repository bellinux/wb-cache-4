Because of his difficulty walking he uses a cane or a walker, and for longer distances a wheelchair.

500|$|According to The Irish Times, [...] "Flame & Citron {{has sparked}} an emotive public debate in Denmark that has drawn {{all sorts of}} pseudo-experts out of the {{woodwork}} to debate the portrayal of the period and the two true-life figures". Madsen defended himself saying it was an interpretation that [...] "though it may not correspond absolutely to reality, is somehow more true". Mikkelsen stressed that they were the first [...] "to do the original research, yet we suddenly had a lot of so-called experts telling us how it really was and how we were wrong".

We were thinking {{a lot more about}} what we'd want to play when we were up onstage rather than actually what you'd want to hear on a record." [...] He then questioned the future of the band, saying, [...] "I {{think a lot of the}} record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band should go on. When I listened back to it, I realized how many songs are about something coming to a close, or knowing when it's time to put something away and move on." ...|$|E
500|$|McNeill {{also agreed}} with Biller's view that [...] "Unity" [...] was {{a metaphor for}} the {{break-up}} of the USSR, and McNeill read up on the subject before directing the episode, saying that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>some</b> of those ideas did come out in the story, even though it wasn't a really heavy, political episode. Yet there were some references and you could connect that to contemporary issues, individuality as opposed to group needs or desires." [...] McNeill was very happy with the resulting episode, saying that the Borg [...] "were not as one-dimensional as previously depicted, but still as evil as ever", and hoped to direct two or three more episodes in the [...] By the end of Voyager, he had directed four episodes overall; this signalled a change in direction for his career into directing full-time.|$|E

According to Ron Ellis, he had [...] "never seen another player have a period where {{there was so much}} {{pressure}} and was still able to accomplish what he did." [...] Sinden considered it to be Esposito's [...] "finest hour." [...] Esposito describes it as [...] "there was no stopping me. And I <b>think</b> <b>some</b> of the guys got a little angry with me.

500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A {{lot of people want to}} hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>some</b> people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E

I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course.

Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that Ben had feelings for , but I still think it was... it was horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben probably has a tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got this amazing mind, she has this amazing, you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her". During season four the producers deliberately left it ambiguous as to whether Ben {{was a part of the}} Oceanic 6 (six survivors of the plane crash that make it off the Island) after he appeared in one of Sayid's flashforwards.|$|E

The rabbit was a reference to Stephen King's , where King uses a rabbit in a cage with the number8 written on its back as an example for the connection between reader and writer. Emerson said that part of the appeal of the scene was that [...] "bunnies look so innocent, and the audience feels so tenderly about them you can feel nothing but beastly being mean to them". But Emerson added the rabbit in the scene had problems reacting to his attempts to scare him [...] "it was unfazed, it barely blinked".|$|E

German opera singer Diana Damrau covered [...] "Part of Your World" [...] in her native language ("Ein Mensch zu sein") for her album Forever (2013). Writing for Opera News, Judith Malafronte dismissed Damrau's rendition as one of the album's [...] "near-misses", accusing her of sounding too [...] "syrupy" [...] and [...] "brassy" [...] on the track.
