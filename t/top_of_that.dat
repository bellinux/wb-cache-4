5|$|Poor {{organization}} {{among both}} North and South Korean units made {{it extremely difficult}} to estimate total casualties for both sides. Several units were completely destroyed in the fighting, making precise casualty counting difficult. A memo from the South Korean army claimed 3,800 North Korean killed and 181 captured in the P'ohang area from 17 August onward. However, casualty numbers are likely far higher. The NK 12th Division alone likely suffered at least 4,500 casualties on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> number, reporting a strength of 6,000 on 5 August and only 1,500 on 17 August.|$|E

5|$|The Christians {{responded to}} these {{actions of the}} central {{government}} with a fresh wave of fury against the Jews so that in late May violence was in the air. The Jews described many cases in which they were assaulted or beaten by the Greeks, and the sons of the British and the Greek consuls were among those who beat up a number of Jews. When the Jews complained to the governor, he ordered the complainants subjected to four to five hundred blows of the bastinado. The qadi disassociated himself from the actions of the governor, who declared that he had acted upon the demands of the consuls. On <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> the governor ordered five other Jews arrested.|$|E

5|$|To fit {{the program}} into the 320 words {{available}} on the chip, some significant modification was used. By not using regular floating point numbers, which require lots of instructions to keep the decimal point in the right place, some space was freed up. Trigonometric functions were implemented in about 40 instructions, and inverse trigonometric functions are almost 30 more instructions. Logarithms are about 40 instructions, with anti-log about 20 on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> The code to normalize and display the computed values are roughly the same in both the TI and Sinclair programs.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mercury {{refused to}} let the band record, {{and at the same}} time Stratton-Smith {{refused to let}} the other members of the band sign to Mercury too, as he did not think the deal was fair to the band (only Hammill {{remained}} now of the original three who had signed with Mercury). On <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> in late January 1969 the band's van and equipment were stolen. The theft aggravated their financial difficulties. Although the band was touring successfully, which included a concert in February at the Royal Albert Hall in support of Jimi Hendrix, it broke up in June after playing a final gig at Nottingham's Pop & Blues Festival on 10 May entirely with borrowed equipment. John Peel, who was compering the show, announced their break-up to the audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{exact number}} of {{casualties}} is unknown. There are different numbers that each derive from different investigations that used different definitions of what a victim in this case should be. Therefore, the numbers are hardly comparable. On <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> some results are published infrequently or investigations were ceased with a provisional number. There is also a publicly held controversy between two groups regarding the number of victims. The opponents are the Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August and the ZZF. The former's numbers are higher, as they include, according to ZZF's Hans-Hermann Hertle, victims with an unclear or unsure connection to the border regime. After the ZZF published its interim results in August 2006, Alexandra Hildebrandt of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft has accused them of withholding numbers to invoke a more positive picture of East Germany. She argues that the ZZF project was funded {{by a coalition of}} social democrats and leftists.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} the raid are {{difficult}} to judge given the confusion over loss records. It is likely more aircraft were destroyed than listed. The Americans failed to keep a proper record of their losses and it appears the U.S. 8th Air Force losses {{were not included in}} loss totals. When these estimates and figures are added to the losses listed in the table below, {{it is likely that the}} correct figures are 232 destroyed (143 single-engine, 74 twin-engine and 15 four-engine) and 156 damaged (139 single-engine, 12 twin-engine and five four-engine). Researching individual squadron records confirms the destruction of even more USAAF aircraft. This suggests at least a further 16 B-17s, 14 B-24s, eight P-51s, and at least two P-47s were destroyed on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> total. A total of 290 destroyed and 180 damaged seems a more realistic summation than the conservative figures given by the USAAF, RAF, and RCAF. Including the 15 Allied aircraft shot down and 10 damaged in aerial combat, 305 destroyed and 190 damaged is the sum total of the attack.|$|E
