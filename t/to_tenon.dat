40|$|Background: Topical {{anesthesia}} is a {{safe and}} cost-effective method considered as the first-choice in many procedures. Due to the physiological characteristics of eye, most of the local anesthetics cannot efficiently penetrate through the conjunctiva deep <b>to</b> <b>tenon.</b> The aim of this pilot study {{was to find a}} new form of lidocaine to give a sufficient level of anesthesia. Methods: Lidocaine Cyclodextrin complex ophthalmic drop was produced and its pharmacological properties were studied [tested] in standard temperature and pressure. 30 patients (18 males, 12 females) with the mean age of 30. 68 ± 8. 02 years enrolled in this clinical trial. All the patients were fully informed and signed the ethics committee consent forms. The patients were given tetracaine drop as the anesthetic: 3 drops separated 2 minute apart 10 min before the intervention. If we achieved a sufficient level of anesthesia, the procedure was done after. If the patient could not tolerate the procedure, the method was changed to lidocaine drop (administered after wash-out period like the first drop). The last option was conventional injection method if the patient could not tolerate the procedure with the second method either. We used this type of anesthesia for conventional procedures such as forced duction test, symblepharon, pterygium, and disport injection into extra-ocular muscles. All the procedures were done b...|$|E
40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) plays an {{important}} role in both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Our previous studies showed a differential role of VEGF isoforms in retinal physiological angiogenesis. We also demonstrated that non-selective inhibition of VEGF by bevacizumab had a beneficial effect on surgical outcome after glaucoma filtration surgery by reducing angiogenesis as well as fibrosis. However, the function of the VEGF isoforms in pathological angiogenesis and wound healing in the eye still remains unidentified. This study was designed to elucidate the differential roles of VEGF isoforms in scar formation after trabeculectomy. Furthermore, we also investigated whether pegaptanib (Macugen™, Pfizer), an aptamer which specifically blocks VEGF(165), could improve surgical outcome by reducing postoperative scarring. VEGF-R 2 and neuropilin- 1 (NRP- 1) expression was analyzed in vitro by RT-PCR, and were found to be expressed at higher levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as compared <b>to</b> <b>Tenon</b> fibroblasts (TF). The effect of the different VEGF isoforms (VEGF(121), VEGF(165) and VEGF(189)) and pegaptanib on cell proliferation was determined via WST- 1 assay. Endothelial cell proliferation was stimulated after addition of VEGF(121) and VEGF(165), whereas VEGF(121) and VEGF(189) increased fibroblast growth. These effects on proliferation were associated with an activation of the ERK pathway, as revealed using the TransAM c-Myc assay. Inhibition of the ERK pathway, by PD 98059 administration, significantly reduced VEGF isoform induced cell growth. A dose-dependent reduction of endothelial cell proliferation was observed after pegaptanib administration, while only the highest dose was able to inhibit fibroblast growth. Next, the in vivo effect of pegaptanib was investigated in a rabbit model of trabeculectomy. The surgical outcome was evaluated by performing clinical investigations (IOP, bleb area, height and survival), as well as histomorphometric analyses of angiogenesis (CD 31), inflammation (CD 45) and fibrosis (Sirius Red). A single postoperative application of pegaptanib had a beneficial impact on surgical outcome, mainly by reducing angiogenesis, but not inflammation or collagen deposition. Repeated injections slightly improved surgical outcome, but again solely by reducing angiogenesis. In summary, our results revealed that the VEGF isoforms play a differential role in ocular wound healing: VEGF(165) and VEGF(121) predominantly affect blood vessel growth, whereas VEGF(189) is rather involved in fibrosis, an important process in wound healing. status: publishe...|$|E

However, I would {{like to point out that}} the mechanism underlying the association between the two conditions is still unclear. Subconjunctival fat prolapse is usually caused by forward herniation of intraconal fat tissue due <b>to</b> dehiscence of <b>tenon</b> capsule precipitated by aging process or trauma. 2 In TAO, swelling and inflammation of orbital fat can lead to separation of the orbital septum from the capsulopalpebral fascia, which can cause fat prolapse into the orbit. 3 Previous studies showed that intraorbital inflammation in TAO can lead to apical crowding in orbit and intracranial fat prolapse. 4, 5 Therefore, as the authors postulated, it would be plausible that elevated intraorbital pressure and increase in orbital fat in TAO can also allow anterior herniation of intraorbital fat.

5000|$|There are {{a number}} of houses in north Wales that have been {{traditionally}} associated with Owain Glyndŵr and there is also the Parliament House of Edward I at Ruthin. They may not be certainly associated with these historic figures, but they are important as evidence for early stone buildings in Wales. Best known is Glyndŵr's Parliament house in Machynlleth. This building has been substantially altered in more recent times, but fortunately Edward Pugh published a fine coloured lithograph of the building in 1816. [...] Recent dendrochronological dating of the felling of a roof timber to 1470, {{does not necessarily mean that}} the stone structure of the building in not associated with Glyndŵr. The original building is a hall house with a four-unit plan: storeyed outer room of two bays, open passage (2 bays between partition trusses), open hall (three bays with dais-end partition), and a storeyed inner-room of two bays. The carpentry is refined: purlins and ridge are tenoned into the trusses. The principal rafters of each truss are unusually shaped ('extruded') <b>to</b> receive the <b>tenoned</b> collar. In the hall the purlins are moulded with two tiers of wind braces (replaced), and the trusses have shaped feet. The upper-end truss is set forward from the dais partition to form a shallow canopy.At Carrog near Corwen parts of Owain's Prison stood, possibly into the 20th century. Thomas Pennant wrote in about 1776 that [...] "The prison where Owen confined his captives was not far from his house, in the parish of Llansantfraid Glyndwrdwy and the place is to this day called 'Carchardy Owen Glyndwrdwy'. Some remains are still to be seen near the church, which form part of a habitable house. It consists of a room 13 feet square and ten and a half high. The sides consist of three horizontal beams, with upright planks, not four inches asunder, mortised into them. In these are groves in the bottom, as if there had been cross bars, or grates. The roof is exceedingly strong, composed of strong planks almost contiguous. It seems as if there had been two stories; but the upper part at present is evidently modern". [...] In 1794 John Ingleby was employed to make a watercolour record of the building, which stood just to the SE of the church and overlooked the River Dee. The building which was thatched and has some timber close studding and also a Gothic arched window and Gothic arched doors. There seems to be evidence for an outer stair leading to a first floor hall, which suggests that parts of the building could well have been contemporary with Owain Glyndŵr. The site of the building was on the modern Glyndŵr Terrace. There was another Parliament House of Glyndŵr in the centre of Dolgellau. It was moved in 1885 to Newtown and re-erected in a much altered form. It may have been first referred to as the Parliament House in 1555. This is building is now known as Plas Cwrt yn Dre. It was an aisled hall house, so is likely to have been a building of considerable importance, but is unlikely to date back to the time of Glyndŵr. Much restored by A B Phipson for Sir Pryce Pryce-Jones as a two storey three bay house. Largely timber framed with stone end walls with interlocking herring-bone decorative framing to a jettied first floor, which is supported by vine scroll brackets. There is an external stone staircase to a plank door at extreme left and square panelled timber framing to ground floor. The right stone bay incorporates re-used medieval masonry and a two light window with a central stone mullion. Arcade patterns in tile inset to stack may reproduce the arcade designs on the chimney stack shown in a lithograph of 1810 by Cornelius Varley.Another building that might be of considerable antiquity is the Parliament House of Edward III in Rhuddlan where it was thought that the Statute of Rhuddlan was promulgated. Thomas Pennant remarks in 1778 A piece of antient building called the Parlement is still to be seen in Rhuddlan: probably where the king sat in council. Pennant was to get John Ingleby to provide a watercolour of the building. Today the building still partially stands in Parliament Street, with a late 13th-century doorway and a 14th-century cusped ogee door head. There is no definite evidence that this building is connected with Edward III.|$|R
40|$|Glaucoma is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease and {{the second most important}} cause of irreversible blindness. This disease is characterized by a raised intraocular pressure (IOP) and by progressive retinal ganglion cell degeneration, resulting in irreversible visual field loss. Filtration surgery (trabeculectomy) remains the most effective therapy to reduce IOP in glaucoma patients. However, in 30 % of the cases this surgery fails due to subconjunctival wound healing. Pharmacological enhancement of trabeculectomy using different anti-scarring agents was found to significantly improve rates of surgical success. However, the nonspecific mechanism of action of these agents may result in severe side-effects. Therefore, there is still a need for alternative strategies to prevent filtration failure. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) {{plays an important role in}} both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. VEGF-R 2 mediates most biologically relevant VEGF responses, including vascular permeability, cell migration and proliferation. Alternative splicing of a single VEGF-gene results in multiple isoforms, such as VEGF 121, VEGF 165 and VEGF 189. Different anti-VEGF treatments are used in the ophthalmological practice, some of which have more selective properties. Pegaptanib (Macugen, Pfizer) is an aptamer that selectively prevents the binding of VEGF 165 to its receptor, whereas bevacizumab (AvastinTM; Genentech) is a humanized, monoclonal full-length antibody against all isoforms. Placental growth factor (PlGF) is a VEGF-homologue which only binds to VEGF-R 1. Therefore, this growth factor only acts on pathological angiogenesis and inflammation and is not involved in physiological angiogenic processes. A monoclonal anti-PlGF antibody against mouse PlGF- 2 was developed by ThromboGenics NV. In this thesis work, we explored the hypothesis that VEGF and PlGF are playing an important role in scar formation after glaucoma filtration surgery and that they may be targets for improvement of filtration surgery outcome. The exact role of the different VEGF isoforms in the process of wound healing was also studied. The effect of non-selective and selective VEGF inhibitors and inhibition of PlGF on ocular wound healing was investigated in vivo using different animal models of glaucoma filtration surgery. In the first part of this thesis, we demonstrated that VEGF and PlGF are important players in scar formation in vitro. Aqeuous humor of glaucoma patients was collected and aqueous levels of VEGF and PlGF were significantly upregulated compared <b>to</b> control (cataract). <b>Tenon</b> fibroblasts (TF) and endothelial cells, both regarded as key players in wound healing after glaucoma surgery, were cultured and the expression of VEGF, PlGF and their receptors was determined. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that both growth factors and their receptors (VEGF-R 1 and VEGF-R 2) were indeed expressed on these cells. Moreover, VEGF and PlGF were able to significantly stimulate proliferation of Tenon fibroblasts. &nbsp; In a second chapter, we showed that the different VEGF isoforms were differentially involved in ocular wound healing. We demonstrated that VEGF 121 and VEGF 165 significantly stimulated proliferation of endothelial cells, by activating the ERK pathway. PD 98059, an inhibitor of the ERK pathway, significantly inhibited VEGF 121 and VEGF 165 -induced endothelial cell proliferation. We also reported the effect of the different isoforms on TF growth. We showed that TF proliferation was mainly induced by VEGF 121 and VEGF 189, associated with an activation of the ERK pathway. These proliferative effects were significantly reduced by the ERK pathway inhibitor PD 98059. Thus, our results indicated that VEGF isoforms play a differential role not only in ocular angiogenesis but also in wound healing. VEGF 165 was found to be the most important isoform in inducing endothelial cell proliferation, while VEGF 189 was the most prominent in inducing TF proliferation. VEGF 121 clearly affected both cell types. In a third section, the therapeutic potential of selective versus non-selective VEGF inhibition (pegaptanib versus bevacizumab) was investigated in vitro and in vivo by analyzing the area and survival of the filtration bleb area and process of wound healing of rabbit eyes following surgery. Proliferation assays on endothelial cells and TF suggested that non-selective VEGF inhibition might be anti-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic, while selective VEGF 165 blockage might mainly inhibit angiogenesis. Indeed, these results were confirmed in our rabbit model for glaucoma surgery. A single administration of bevacizumab at the time of trabeculectomy could improve the surgical outcome by reducing postoperative angiogenesis during the initial phase, and collagen deposition at later stages. Pegaptanib injection(s) improved surgery outcome less efficiently by reducing angiogenesis only. Thus, our in vitro and in vivo data indicated that selective VEGF 165 inhibition by pegaptanib was less effective than non-selective VEGF inhibition by bevacizumab in reducing scarring after glaucoma surgery, presumably due to retained action of VEGF 121 and VEGF 189 isoforms, which had a more pronounced effect on the Tenon fibroblasts as compared to VEGF 165. Finally, in the last part, the therapeutic potential of PlGF inhibition was investigated. We showed that anti-VEGF therapy prevented post-surgical scarring by inhibiting angiogenesis and collagen deposition, but did not influence inflammation. Therefore, in collaboration with ThromboGenics NV, the known anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory, and possibly anti-fibrotic properties of anti-PlGF-antibody were studied in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model of glaucoma surgery. Administration of anti-PlGF antibody could reduce proliferation of TF in vitro and could improve the surgical outcome in vivo. Postoperative inflammation and angiogenesis was reduced during the initial phase and collagen deposition at later time points. Direct comparison showed that inhibition of PlGF possibly seemed to be even more effectively than inhibition of VEGF-R 2, which only had an effect on angiogenesis and fibrosis. In conclusion, we showed that VEGF and PLGF are playing an important role in the process of wound healing after glaucoma surgery. Our study also sheds new light on the differential function of the VEGF isoforms in the mechanisms of angiogenesis and wound healing. VEGF 165 and VEGF 121 predominantly affect blood vessel growth, whereas VEGF 189 seems to be more important in fibrosis. These insights may have important therapeutic implications for glaucoma patients. VEGF treatment - particularly non-selective - could improve the surgical outcome in glaucoma patients by reducing angiogenesis and fibrosis. On the other hand, inhibition of PlGF seems effective in improving surgical outcome by reducing inflammation, angiogenesis and collagen deposition. The insights generated within this thesis may open new perspectives not only for glaucoma surgery, but also for modulation of postoperative scarring in general. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This was a single-blind placebo {{controlled}} {{study conducted}} at the Muhimbili Medical Centre between March 1989 and May 1990. It involved 60 patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis, an ocular allergic inflammatory condition of world-wide distribution, involving mainly the conjunctiva and the cornea. The objective {{of the study was}} to find out the most efficacious therapeutic method in alleviating the signs and symptoms of the disease in our environment since different authori ties from different parts of the wold have claimed success using different therapeutic methods. The patients were randomly selected into four (4) groups, each subjected to a different therapeutic method. The therapy groups were: (i) placebo (ii) cryotherapy (iii) oral aspirin and (vi) steroid-antibiotic. The intensity of signs and symptoms were graded using a prepared score table. The higher the score, the more intense the disease was. After initial assessment, the patients were subjected to their respective therapies and signs and symptoms assessed and graded first weekly then twice weekly. The mean follow up period was 4 weeks. The odds-ratio method was used to assess the effectivity of the drugs with respect to placebo. Cryotherapy was found to be the most effective therapeutic method in alleviating signs and symptoms of the disease compared to other drugs used. A recommendation is made that patients with intractable vernal keratoconjunctivitis should be subjected to cryotherapy for relief of signs and symptoms. iii [...] .

It is associated with inflammation of both the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva and sometimes corneal manifestations like corneal ulcers and keratoconus. Though the dangers of visual loss are minimal in this condition, the persistent itching and tearing is a source of great discomfort to the victim of the disease, so much so that very often medical advice is sought. There is no single specific treatment so far for this condition, though various authors have reported success in abolition of the sYmptoms with steroids (Neumann, 1958; Dahan et al., 1983), sodium cromoglycate (Easty et al., 1972; Forster, 1988) and cryotherapy (Amoils, 1975; Mtanda and Sangawe, 1983). Aspirin has once been tried in this condition with success (Abelson et al., 1983). There is a need to establish the efficacy of various reported therapies in this condition, in order to come out with the best alternative in our environment. This is possible in a placebo controlled, blind study comparing the various methods simultaneously. The resulting evidence may help us in managing the scores of patients with this condition with the best available medical or surgical alternative. [...] - 2 REVIEW OF LITERATURE THE CONJUNCTIVA 1. ANATOMICAL CONSIDERATIONS: A. 	Gross anatomy: The conjunctiva is a thin, transparent mucous membrane that covers the posterior surface of the lids, and the anterior surface of the sclera, on the eyeball. It is continuous with the skin at the lid margins (mucocutaneous junction) and with corneal epithelium at the limbus. For the purposes of description, it is divided into three portions; the bulbar portion, palpebral portion and the fornix (Wolf E., 1968). I) 	The bulbar conjunctiva: This is a thin and transparent membrane, covering the anterior portion of the sclera, through which it clearly shows. It is loosely bound by loose areolar tissue <b>to</b> the underlying <b>Tenons</b> capsule and the sclera until about 3 mm from the limbus where it is more closely bound to them. At this point, the conjunctiva is slightly raised by a small ridge. This is known as the limbal conjunctiva, and the raised edge becomes more apparent in vernal conjunctivitis and other inflammatory conditions. At the limbus, the conjunctiva, Tenons capsule and sclera are all fused into a dense tissue. The bulbar conjunctiva is in continuity with the corneal epithelium and often diseases involving the conjunctiva may spread to involve the cornea and vice versa (Morehead R. P., 1965). 3 II) The Palpebral conjunctiva: This may be subdivided into the marginal zone, tarsal zone and orbital zone. The marginal zone: This is a 2 mm transition zone between the skin of the eyelids and the conjunctiva. It communicates with the nasal cavity through the lacrimal puncta whic...|$|R
