5|$|Chesney {{witnessed}} a charter of Henry fitzEmpress' before Henry's succession {{to the throne}} as Henry II, and {{was present at the}} consecration of Roger de Pont L'Évêque as Archbishop of York on 10October 1154. The bishop then was present at Henry II's coronation on 19 December 1154, and appears to have continued to act as a royal justice in Lincolnshire during <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> King Henry II's reign; the 1156 Pipe Roll has the sheriff of the county accounting for 10 marks arising from the pleas of the bishop in the county. Chesney was often with the royal court, as he attested a number of Henry II's charters during <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the king's reign, and accompanied him to northern England in 1158 and to Normandy in 1160.|$|E
