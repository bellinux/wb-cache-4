50|$|Anticonvulsants are {{the most}} {{successful}} medication in reducing and preventing seizures from reoccurring.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the release of carbamazepine (CBZ) from hydrophobic (Compritol 888 ATO) and hydrophilic-hydrophobic matrix combination (Compritol 888 ATO-hydroxpropyl methylcellulose, HPMC). Hydrophobic matrix tablets were prepared by hot fusion technique, while hydrophilic-hydrophobic matrix tablets were prepared by wet granulation technique. The properties of the compressed matrix tablets were determined according to the US Pharmacopoeia. Both matrix formulations displayed a controlled-release profile {{when compared to the}} reference formulation (<b>Tegretol</b> CR 200).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the problems of interdosage fluctuations of body fluid concentrations of carbamazepine, a slow-release formulation has been developed. In an open, controlled, within-patient study, the diurnal plasma concentrations of carbamazepine and its 10, 11 -epoxide were measured in 25 epileptic children first treated with conventional carbamazepine tablets (<b>Tegretol)</b> {{and then with the}} <b>Tegretol</b> slow-release preparation. The diurnal plasma concentration curves during treatment with the slow-release formulation showed significantly less variation over 24 hours than during treatment with the ordinary preparation, as measured by the fluctuation index. Mean concentration values also differed significantly, which is explained by a somewhat reduced bioavailability (22 % less) of the slow-release formulation. There were no dif-ferences in efficacy and tolerability between the two formulations, but there was a clear-cut reduction of reported side effects, especially tiredness, on treatment with the slow-release formulation. For that reason, the slow-release formulation should be a major advantage in treating children with epilepsy, in order to avoid interference with cognitive functions. In 12 children, simultaneous measurements of the concentration of carbamazepine and its epoxide in saliva were made and compared with the plasma values.

40|$|PURPOSE: Two cases {{illustrate}} the symptoms, signs, etiologies, {{and treatment of}} ocular neuromyotonia (ONM). METHODS: The histories, neuroradiologic tests, and/or biopsy revealed the etiologies of ONM in both patients. Clinical observations, videotaping, and electronic eye movement recordings documented the eye movements. RESULTS: A 72 -year-old man with chronic arachnoiditis following myelography with thorium dioxide (Thorotrast) developed intermittent diplopia and a partial right third nerve palsy. Left gaze induced spasm of the right medial rectus. Right gaze produced right lateral rectus spasm. A 66 -year-old woman, who had radiation treatment for a pituitary tumor and acromegaly, had intermittent spasm of the left medial rectus muscle and left esotropia. The episodes occurred spontaneously and were induced by right gaze. A left internuclear ophthalmoplegia was also found. Carbamazepine (<b>Tegretol)</b> abolished the ONM in both patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although ONM is an unusual cause of intermittent diplopia and strabismus, its distinctive clinical features identify it. Injury to the peripheral cranial nerves probably leads to segmental demyelination, axonal hyperexcitability, and a self-perpetuating, reverberating circuit, which causes spasms of the extraocular muscles...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of lipophilic (Compritol 888 ATO) and hydrophilic components (combination of HPMC and Avicel) on the release of carbamazepine from granules and corresponding tablet. Wet granulation followed by compression was employed for preparation of granules and tablets. The matrix swelling behavior was investigated. The dissolution profiles of each formulation were compared to those of <b>Tegretol</b> CR tablets and the mean dissolution time (MDT), dissolution efficiency (DE %) and similarity factor (f(2) factor) were calculated. It was found that increase in the concentration of HPMC results in reduction in the release rate from granules and achievement of zero-order is difficult from the granules. The amount of HPMC plays a dominant role for the drug release. The release mechanism of CBZ from matrix tablet formulations follows non-Fickian diffusion shifting to case II by the increase of HPMC content, indicating significant contribution of erosion. Increasing in drug loading resulted in acceleration of the drug release and in anomalous controlled-release mechanism due to delayed hydration of the tablets. These results suggest that wet granulation followed by compression could be a suitable method to formulate sustained release CBZ tablet...|$|E

Clinical manifestations consisted of fever, rash, facial oedema, lymphadenopathy, impaired liver function, eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. Lymphocyte-stimulation tests with carbamazepine in vitro showed positive results in all cases; patch tests with carbamazepine were positive in six cases. In two cases the lymphocyte-stimulation tests with carbamazepine {{were found to be}} negative during, and shortly after, the illness. However, when the tests were repeated several months later, {{they turned out to be}} positive. Lymphocyte reactivity to PPD and PHA in vitro was also impaired during the acute phase of the disease. Thus false-negative lymphocyte-stimulation tests may be found in the first months following such a hypersensitivity reaction, probably due to impaired lymphocyte reactivity. As carbamazepine is a potent drug and is often prescribed for long periods together with other anticonvulsants, it seems important to prove that the allergic reaction is caused by carbamazepine. If the lymphocyte-stimulation test in vitro or the patch test with carbamazepine is found to be negative during or shortly after the illness, they should be repeated several months later...|$|E

She then underwent a tem-poral bone CT scan and MRI with gadolinium enhancement of the temporal bones, internal auditory canals, and skull base, which were unremarkable. An evaluation by an oral surgeon failed to reveal temporomandibular joint arthropathy. A trial of carbamazepine (<b>Tegretol),</b> followed by baclofen (Lioresal) and gabapentin (Neurontin) for 12 months, was completed without change in her otalgia.

40|$|We {{describe}} a rapid enzyme immunoassay for carbam-azepine with a centrifugal analyzer (Rotochem IIA- 36).

Assay temperature is 30 #{ 176 }C,the wavelength 340 nm. Linearity is excellent for a carbam-azepine concentration range of 1 to 12 mg/L; analytical recovery is quantitative. Results correlate well with those by liquid- and gas-liquid chromatography. Absorbance rates for each carbamazepine concentration are acquired by a multi-point kinetic rate program and a computer program provides a logit-log transformation of absorbance rate vs. concentration data for final calculations in the assay. Hemoglobin interference precludes analysis of severely hemolyzed specimens. Monitoring antiepileptic drug concentrations is important, to help prevent seizures or drug toxicity in patients. Fre-quently combined with other anticonvulsant drugs, carbam-azepine (<b>Tegretol,</b> Geigy) has been advocated for the control of partial, psychomotor, grand mal, and mixed seizures, as well as for trigeminal neuralgia. Monitoring carbamazepine in serum is especially important because of its narrow thera-peutic index. Oral doses of 600 to 1200 mg of carbamazepine per day can give serum values that range from 3 to 16 mg/L. The therapeutic range of carbamazepine is considered to be 2 to 8 mgfL; toxic effects usually are seen when concentrations in serum reach 9 mg/L (1). We undertook to adapt the carbamazepine enzyme im-munoassay to the centrifugal analyzer. We wished to reduce reagent costs, yet maintain adequate sensitivity, precision, and accuracy.

40|$|SUMMARY Lipoid proteinosis (Urbach-Wiethe disease) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive disorder associated with deposition of hyalinised material in the skin, mucous membrane, and brain. Corectopia has not been described in this disorder. A case is presented of lipoid proteinosis with bilateral corectopia. Lipoid proteinosis (Urbach-Wiethe disease) is a rare {{autosomal recessive}} genetic disorder characterised by hoarseness beginning in infancy and multiple lesions of mucous membrane and skin. ' The skin lesions are composed of hyalinised material and appear as clusters of white to yellow papules on the elbows, knees, axillae, perineum, and scrotum. Persons with lipoid proteinosis can present with psychomotor seizures. In some cases intracranial calcification of the hyalinised material has been documented within the hippocampal gyri. 2 Ocular manifestations include papules along the lid margins and retinal drusen. To our knowledge pupillary abnormalities have never been reported in this dis-order. We report a case of lipoid proteinosis with bilateral corectopia.

Five of the seven patients complained of pain in the oral mucosa, vestibule, teeth, and around the lips. Two of the patients complained of facial pain in the zygoma, masseter, and temporal muscle. The primary drugs used were carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, amitriptyline, and nortriptyline. Physical therapy with either soft laser or EAST was performed additionally in most cases. Two of the patients were treated with <b>Tegretol</b> (carbamazepine), six were treated with Trileptal (oxcarbazepine), six were treated with Neurontin (gabapentin), two were treated with Lyrica (Pregabalin), one was treated with amitriptyline, and three were treated with Sensival (nortriptyline). Laser therapy was performed on all seven patients, while EAST was performed on two patients. Of the seven patients, five patients complained of oral pain. They received injections at the affected site. The remaining two patients received injections outside the oral cavity, specifically in the masseter and temporal muscles. Three types of BTX-A were used: Meditoxin (Medytox Inc., Seoul, Korea), Innotox, and Dysport (Ipsen Biopharm Ltd., Slough, UK), and the number of injections ranged from at least once to a maximum of three times every 3  months. In five of the patients with painful traumatic trigeminal neuropathy, pain was significantly reduced after BTX-A injection. The neuropathic pain in all patients who received implant surgery or facial nerve reconstruction was improved. However, in two patients with atypical orofacial pain who complained of persistent pain without any causative factors, the pain did not disappear after the injection. These patients were referred to the anesthesiology department for stellate ganglion block (SGB), but this treatment was not effective either (Table  1). After BTX-A injection, transient facial unbalance, unnatural movements, and facial asymmetry occurred. However, all these symptoms disappeared over time and there were no more complaints.|$|E
40|$|AbstractElementary osmotic pump (EOP) is {{a unique}} {{extended}} release (ER) drug delivery system {{based on the principle}} of osmosis. It has the ability to minimize the amount of the drug, accumulation and fluctuation in drug level during chronic uses. Carbamazepine (CBZ), a poorly water-soluble antiepileptic drug, has serious side effects on overdoses and chronic uses. The aim {{of the present study was}} to design a new EOP tablet of CBZ containing a solubility enhancers and swellable polymer to reduce its side effects and enhance the patient compliance. Firstly, a combination of solubilizing carriers was selected to improve the dissolution of the slightly soluble drug. Then, designing the new EOP tablet and investigating the effect of different variables of core and coat formulations on drug release behavior by single parameter optimization and by Taguchi orthogonal design with analysis of variance (ANOVA), respectively. The results showed that CBZ solubility was successfully enhanced by a minimum amount of combined polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP K 30) and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). The plasticizer amount and molecular weight (MW) together with the osmotic agent amount directly affect the release rate whereas the swellable polymer amount and viscosity together with the semi-permeable membrane (SPM) thickness inversely influence the release rate. In addition, the tendency of following zero order kinetics was mainly affected by the coat components rather than those of the core. Further, orifice size does not have any significant effect on the release behavior within the range of 0. 1  mm to 0. 8  mm. In this study we report the successful formulation of CBZ-EOP tablets, which were similar to the marketed product <b>Tegretol</b> CR 200 and able to satisfy the USP criterion limits and to deliver about 80 % of CBZ at a rate of approximately zero order for up to 12  h...|$|E
40|$|Fifty {{million people}} around the world are {{currently}} affected by epilepsy. Fortunately, the disease responds to treatment 70 % of the time, but many of the medications prescribed require multiple dosages per day. To ensure patient compliance, prevent adverse consequences due to missed dosing, and to enhance medicative convenience for the patient, <b>Tegretol</b> has engineered as extended-release pill, Tegretol-XR, which delivers carbamazepine at a nearly constant rate for a twelve hour time period. The design of these tablets involves a drug infused matrix surrounded by an insoluble shell, with a small orifice to allow drug release. When water diffuses through the orifice, the interior pill matrix saturates, and carbamazepine begins to elute out of the orifice until depletion, a process that is designed to take twelve hours. Using COMSOL, a Tegretol-XR tablet was modeled as a 2 D rectangular, axisymmetrical slab. Researched diffusivity constants were found to precisely model the water and drug flow {{into and out of the}} pills. The diffusion of the drug is coupled with the concentration of water, and as the water infuses into the pill, the diffusivity of the drug is altered, ultimately leading to a sustained release of carbamazepine over the allotted twelve hours. Results from our model indicate that drug release closely follows ideal release kinetics and keeps an ample amount of drug in the bloodstream at all times. It was found that altering the orifice size by 5 % resulted in changes of up to 16 % in final average drug concentration, implicating that this is the most sensitive variable analyzed. Variables like water diffusivity were much less influential to the final solution. Our model of Tegretol-XR gives epileptic patients the option of taking only two pills a day, and thus, significantly lowers the risk of a missed dose...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS Twenty-five {{patients}} {{affected by}} 30 episodes of tic douloureux {{were treated with}} a new anticonvulsant, clonazepam. In 400 % there was complete control of the neuralgia and an additional 23. 3 % were significantly helped by the drug. Sixteen patients had previously been resistant to carbamazepine, and eight of them were completely and one partially relieved by clonazepam. The side-effects, somnolence and unsteadiness of gait, were present to some extent in 80 and 88 % of the cases respectively, being severe in about half of them. It is concluded that clonazepam can be con-sidered as a second choice {{for the treatment of}} this condition, after proven failure with carbamaze-pine. Possible mechanisms of action are discussed. Tic douloureux is a condition characterized by brief paroxysms of extremely severe pain re-stricted to the distribution of one or more cutaneous branches of the trigeminal nerve. These often recur several times a day and are usually triggered by tactile or painful stimulation of the skin or mucosa innervated by branches of the trigeminal nerve. The episodes of neuralgia usually last for months or years, then subsiding for variable periods of time, to recur again with comparable severity. It is a disease of the adult, and its aetiology is unknown. The first successful drug for its treatment was diphenylhydantoin (phenytoin, Dilantin, Epanu-tin) introduced by Braham and Saiz in 1960. In different series, it was reported that from 540 to 700 of patients were improved completely or significantly by this drug (Braham and Saiz, 1960; Blom, 1962, 1963). Because of its common side-effects (ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus) and a significant incidence of recurrence of the neuralgia despite its continuous use, a new drug, carbamazepine (<b>Tegretol),</b> was introduced by Blom in 1962. Its reported effectiveness has been around 90 %o (Blom, 1962), with most patients responding after 24 hours of treatment. It has been suggested that its effect on trigemina...|$|E
40|$|Summary: A 23 -year-old man was {{admitted}} to the intensive care unit for respiratory failure, global lower and upper limb palsy, and higher cognitive function deterioration. Imaging, performed with a combination of the MR diffu-sion tensor imaging, fiber tracking, and MR spectroscopy, suggested the diagnosis of an acute severe unusual mito-chondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike event, which was confirmed by muscle biopsy, but fiber tracking showed unexpected unaltered white matter tracts. MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic ac-idosis, and strokelike events) is a mitochondrial dis-order that can be diagnosed using both T 2 -weighted, diffusion-weighted, and MR spectroscopy imaging. The natural history of MELAS is strokelike events that can definitely alter both the brain and spinal cord. We describe here an unusual MELAS case involving the brain stem and spinal cord, diagnosed by using diffusion-weighted imaging, MR spectroscopy, and fiber tracking.
