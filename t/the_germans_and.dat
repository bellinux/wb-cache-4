5|$|A {{significant}} number of non-Jewish Poles also did not trust <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> decided not to leave the city. Many wounded Home Army soldiers became stranded during the uprising and were simply not able to evacuate in time. For others, the choice to remain resulted from feelings of despair and hopelessness brought {{by the fall of}} the uprising; at least initially, they simply did not have the motivation to leave.|$|E
5|$|Almost all of Ukraine {{had been}} {{occupied}} by <b>the</b> <b>Germans,</b> <b>and</b> Khrushchev {{returned to his}} domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained. One out of every six Ukrainians was killed in World War II.|$|E

5|$|As the war progressed and Germany's lighter {{tanks were}} {{replaced}} by the Panzer III, Panzer IV and heavier tanks, such as the Panther, the T-26 was gradually replaced through attrition by the vastly superior T-34. The remaining T-26s participated in battles with <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> their allies during the Battle of Moscow from 1941–42, the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of the Caucasus from 1942–1943. Some tank units of the Leningrad Front used their T-26 tanks until 1944.|$|E
5|$|Axis forces {{employed}} {{biological and}} chemical weapons. The Imperial Japanese Army {{used a variety of}} such weapons during its invasion and occupation of China (see Unit 731) and in early conflicts against the Soviets. Both <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> Japanese tested such weapons against civilians and, sometimes on prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Brand {{was hidden}} in a safe house by Josef Winniger, a courier for German {{military}} intelligence, who had been selling Brand information about Jewish refugees; Kasztner and Komoly also went into hiding.

5|$|Home Army {{arms and}} {{equipment}} came mostly from four sources: arms {{that had been}} buried by the Polish armies on battlefields after the 1939 invasion of Poland; arms purchased or captured from <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> their allies; arms clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army itself; and arms received from Allied air drops.|$|E
5|$|On 14 November, the Germans {{launched}} an assault from Podgorica towards Nikšić {{to clear a}} corridor through which the German forces in Montenegro could withdraw towards the Reich. This operation {{was supported by the}} Italian 86th National Republican Guard (GNR) Battalion. Around 1,200 of Đurišić's Chetniks were deployed on the flanks of the attack. Twelve days of fierce fighting resulted in significant casualties, and the Germans made no progress, losing Boka in the meantime. On 25 November, the Germans decided to abandon this line of attack and attack Kolašin. Chetniks under Đurišić's command continued to fight alongside the Germans. After reaching Kolašin, Đurišić's force separated from the Germans to relieve pressure on the German route of march and headed towards Bosnia, marching to the west of <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> bypassing Pljevlja. During the breakout and subsequent withdrawal, both <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> Chetniks were subjected to frequent attacks by the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Pećanac was {{eventually}} denounced as a traitor by the Yugoslav government-in-exile, and the Germans concluded that his detachments were inefficient, unreliable, and of little {{military aid to}} them. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> the puppet government disbanded the organisation between September 1942 and March 1943, and Pećanac was interned for some time afterwards before being killed in mid-1944 by forces loyal to his Chetnik rival Draža Mihailović.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} not yet over for the New Zealand Division as it was ordered to {{continue}} to chase <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> secure the Bancourt Ridge, in front of which the villages of Bancourt and Frémicourt lay. The advance was renewed on 30 August, with two battalions of the 1st Infantry Brigade tasked with capturing Bancourt while the New Zealand Rifle Brigade was to take Frémicourt. They were then to push onto Bancourt Ridge.|$|E
5|$|The decisive {{victory of}} Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery's Eighth Army over <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> Italians at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October–November 1942 turned {{the tide of}} the North African war {{strongly}} in favour of the Allies, and did much to revive Allied morale.

5|$|After 24 hours, only 2,500 {{men of the}} 101st and 2,000 of the 82nd Airborne {{were under}} the control of their divisions, {{approximately}} a third of the force dropped. This wide dispersal had the effect of confusing <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> fragmenting their response. The 7th Army received notification of the parachute drops at 01:20, but Rundstedt did not initially believe that a major invasion was underway. The destruction of radar stations along the Normandy coast in the week before the invasion meant that the Germans did not detect the approaching fleet until 02:00.|$|E
5|$|After Kiev, the Red Army {{no longer}} outnumbered <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> {{there were no}} more trained {{reserves}} directly available. To defend Moscow, Stalin could field 800,000 men in 83 divisions, but no more than 25 divisions were fully effective. Operation Typhoon, the drive to Moscow, began on 30 September 1941. In front of Army Group Center was a series of elaborate defense lines, the first centered on Vyazma and the second on Mozhaysk. Russian peasants began fleeing ahead of the advancing German units, burning their harvested crops, driving their cattle away, and destroying buildings in their villages as part of a scorched-earth policy designed to deny the Nazi war machine of needed supplies and foodstuffs.|$|E
5|$|After {{peace talks}} between <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> the Finnish Reds were broken off on 11 April, the true {{battle for the}} capital of Finland began. On 12 April, at 5 a.m. 2,000–3,000 German {{soldiers}} from the Brigade von Tshirsky attacked the city from the north-west, supported via the Helsinki-Turku railway. The Germans broke through the area between Munkkiniemi and Pasila, and advanced on the central-western parts of the town. The German naval squadron Meurer blocked the city harbour, bombarded the southern town area, and landed naval troops at Katajanokka.|$|E

It then fought through Italy and, with the help of American, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Indian and Free French forces, took part in the D-Day invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944; nearly half the Allied soldiers were British. In the Far East, the British Army rallied against the Japanese in the Burma Campaign and regained the British Far Eastern colonial possessions.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, and while living in northern France, Wodehouse was captured by <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> was interned for over a year. After his release he was tricked into making five comic and apolitical broadcasts on German radio to the still neutral US. After vehement protests in Britain, Wodehouse never returned to his home country again, despite being cleared by an MI5 investigation. He moved to the US permanently in 1947 and took American citizenship in 1955. He continued writing until his death in 1975.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} the 6th Brigade– {{consisting}} of the 19th, 36th and 14th/32nd Battalions– was led by Brigadier Raymond Sandover. A Militia formation, it had not previously seen combat as a whole, though one of its infantry battalions– the 36th– had fought in the Battle of Buna–Gona during late 1942 and early 1943. Nevertheless, Sandover and his three battalion commanders were all Australian Imperial Force veterans who had taken part in the fighting against <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>and</b> Italians in North Africa, Greece and Syria during 1941 and 1942. The 36th Battalion was dispatched to Cape Hoskins in early October, and relieved a battalion of the US 158th Infantry Regiment.|$|E
