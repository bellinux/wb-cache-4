5|$|Carte {{was brought}} up in Dartmouth Park Road. His cultured mother exposed her family to art, music and poetry, and young Carte studied the violin and then the flute at an early age. The family spoke French at home two days a week, and his parents often took <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theatre. He was educated at University College School, which he left in 1860. In 1861, he {{achieved}} First Class level in the matriculation examination and then attended University College, London. However, he left later that year to work in his father's business, along with his brother, Henry. He studied music during this time and composed some pieces, which he dedicated to the actress Kate Terry. He also acted in amateur theatricals.|$|E
5|$|When Ross {{arrived at}} the school, he found no running water, a housing shortage, a disgruntled faculty, and many {{students}} running wild. As Ross began to make improvements, parents began to send <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school {{in the hopes that}} they would learn from Ross's example. Although enrollment had always been limited to men, in 1893, Ethel Hudson, the daughter of an A professor, became the first woman to attend classes at the school and helped edit the annual yearbook. She was made an honorary member of the class of 1895. Several years later her twin sisters became honorary members of the class of 1903, and slowly other daughters of Aggie professors were allowed to attend classes.|$|E

25|$|A {{key factor}} was the disinterest of the parents, whose main {{motivation}} for sending <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Scoletas {{appears to have}} been that they were looked after for a few hours and given a meal every day, rather than an interest in preserving Romansh. The other factor was that after entering primary school, the children received a few hours a week of Romansh instruction at best. As a result, the last Scoletas were closed in the 1960s with the exception of Präz, where the Scoleta remained open until 1979.|$|E
25|$|In 1098 {{there were}} 35 {{dependent}} priories of Molesme, and other annexes and some priories of nuns.

25|$|Red Shirt {{was born}} near Fort Fetterman, Wyoming. There are several {{accounts}} of Red Shirt's early life. One account is that Red Shirt {{is the son}} of a white man and a Lakota mother. Another account, by Red Shirt, is that {{he was the son of}} a great warrior chief. Will Rogers reported that Red Shirt was the son of Red Dog, a progressive headman of the Oyuhpe band who settled at Pine Ridge, South Dakota. Red Shirt and Red Dog were Lakota delegates to Washington in 1880, served as Pine Ridge Indian Police and sent <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Carlisle Native Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

25|$|As the 20th century progressed, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} popular among the Scottish upper classes to send <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country's oldest higher learning institution, and the university's student population rose sharply. This revival has been maintained {{to the present}} day. Despite this, {{there have been some}} notable changes. In 1967, the union with University College Dundee ended, when that College became an independent institution under the name of the University of Dundee. As a result of this, St Andrews lost its capacity to provide degrees in many areas such as Law, Accountancy, Dentistry and Engineering, while it also lost the right to confer the undergraduate medical degree MBChB. However, the university has prospered in other ways. In 1972, the College of St Leonard was reconstituted as a postgraduate institute.|$|E
25|$|As People of the Book Christians {{were given}} dhimmi status (along with Jews, Samaritans, Gnostics and Mandeans), which was {{inferior}} {{to the status of}} Muslims. Christians thus faced Religious discrimination and Religious persecution in that they were banned from proselytising (spreading or promoting Christianity) in lands conquered by the Muslims on pain of death, they were banned from bearing arms and undertaking certain professions. Under sharia, non-Muslims were obligated to pay jizya and al-kharaj taxes, together with periodic heavy ransoms levied upon Christian communities by Muslim rulers in order to fund military campaigns, all of which contributed a significant proportion of income to the Islamic states while conversely reducing many Christians to poverty, and these financial and social hardships forced many Christians to convert to Islam. Christians unable to pay these taxes were forced to surrender <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Muslim rulers as payment who would sell them as slaves to Muslim households where they were forced into Islam According to the Hanafi school of sharia, the testimony of a non-Muslim (such as a Christian) was not considered valid against the testimony of a Muslim in legal or civil matters. Islamic law forbid Muslim women from marrying Christian men, but Muslim men were permitted to marry Christian women.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was <b>to</b> obtain <b>the</b> basic data for the study of "Death {{education}} on nursing education". We investigated 235 students aged 18 - 21 in the school of allied health science O University (return rate 100 %). The questionnare was composed of the questions about experience to be presented at the familiar person's last moment, experince to be attended at <b>the</b> funeral, intention <b>to</b> take <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> funeral in the future, and knowledge of ritual behaviors for the dead. The results are as follows: 1) About 20 % of students had experienced the dying hour familiar persons who were almost grandfather, grandmother, great-grandfather and great-grandmother. 2) Almost all students had attended at the funeral as the survivors. 3) About 2 / 3 students had intention <b>to</b> take <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> funeral in <b>the</b> future <b>to</b> let them learn death. About 1 / 3 students had no intention <b>to</b> take <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> funeral, or did not decide their intention yet. 4) Among ritual behaviors for the dead, students well recognized "Kiyome no sio" and "Kita makura" that were well known in the daily life, and "Hidarimae" and "Tatemusubi" that had learned in the lecture of nursing for the dead. Conversely, despite of learning "Yukan", few students knew it because they didn't conscious of it as the ritual behavior. The ritual behavior is important <b>to</b> alleviate <b>the</b> survivors' grief.

25|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the Reformation, baptism was often {{conducted}} in private as a celebration of the birth of children. The rite was considered necessary for salvation, and so midwives often baptized children to avoid the risk that the child would die unbaptized. Strasbourg reformer Martin Bucer made it a part of the worship service so that parishioners could be reminded of their own baptism, which was to be the sign of their incorporation into the church. The parents of children were to bring <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> font following the sermon, and were admonished to catechize their children, a process which was intended to begin around age ten. Catechesis was considered to be entailed in baptism itself, and weekly catechetical services were instituted for this purpose. Zwingli understood baptism to be a sign of membership in a community rather than a ritual which conferred salvation on individuals. He, or possibly Oecolampadius, can be credited with first articulating this line of thought, later called covenant theology, which became the Reformed sacramental theology. During the Reformation, Anabaptists opposed the practice of infant baptism, arguing that only those who had made a profession of faith should be administered the rite. This was based on a theology of decisional regeneration, the teaching that only those who had made a decision for Christ could be saved. Against this, the Reformed believed that justification is only by grace, rather than based on any human decision.|$|E

500|$|Van Hoëvell {{played an}} {{important}} part in the short-lived protest in Batavia that has been called the [...] "1848 Batavian Revolution". Partly inspired by the February 1848 uprising in Paris, Batavian citizens began to challenge the authorities; one of their grievances was an 1842 decree that dictated that positions in the upper echelons of the Dutch administration could be held only by those who had received the appropriate certificate from the Royal Academy in Delft. The measure discriminated against both [...] "Dutch-born and creole Dutch" [...] who could not or did not want to send <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands for a decade of education. The measure also discriminated against the class referred to as Indo-Europeans, who were thus barred from promotion above the level of [...] "the lowliest civil service jobs." [...] As a consequence of this discrimination across racial barriers, the May 1848 protest could draw a mixed group of citizens, [...] "identified as 'Europeans,' 'creoles,' and 'colored'" [...] by the authorities.|$|E

With {{the outbreak of}} the Second World War, Charles sent Vaughan along with <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States, where they stayed there from 1939 to 1943, and The Fair Woman was published whilst there, although it was later published in England under the title Iron and Gold (1948). An exception to this more muted success was the short story or novella A Thing of Nought (1934; revised edition 1948), which returns to some of the same themes as The Battle to the Weak; as well as being critically acclaimed, it was an unexpected commercial success {{to the extent that it}} was out of print within four days of publication.

500|$|According to Baley, at {{approximately}} 2 p.m. on August 30, 1858, the emigrants camped near the Colorado River heard Alpha Brown's step-daughter, Sallie Fox, screaming. She {{had been playing}} in a wagon when she noticed several Mohave nearby. Having lost the element of surprise, three hundred warriors then let out war whoops as they shot arrows into the camp, mortally wounding Rose's foreman, Alpha Brown. Udell described the attack as [...] "like a shower" [...] of arrows. According to Rose, [...] "I have no doubt they expected to massacre us. But we were well armed and the men that were in camp ready to receive them." [...] As the men mounted a defense, the women ran with <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> covered wagons. Both Udell and Rose stated that the fighting lasted for approximately two hours. Baley explains that when a Mohave chief {{who appeared to be}} leading the attack stepped out in front of his warriors and taunted the emigrants, Gillum Baley, a veteran of the Black Hawk War and a noted marksman, took him down with a single rifle shot. The Mohave warriors then retrieved the chief's body and retreated from the battle.|$|E
