5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages the {{problems}} of schism in the Catholic Church allowed the Scottish Crown to gain greater influence over senior appointments and two archbishoprics had been established {{by the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Historians have discerned a decline in traditional monastic life in the late Middle Ages, but the mendicant orders of friars grew, particularly in the expanding burghs, emphasised preaching and ministering to the population. New saints and cults of devotion also proliferated. Despite problems over the number and quality of clergy after the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and evidence of heresy in <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the Church in Scotland remained stable before the Reformation in the sixteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Edinburgh {{had emerged}} as the capital in <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b> It was the wealthiest and largest city in the kingdom and held the central law courts, {{parliament}} and royal residence at Holyrood Palace. After James VI left for London at the Union of Crowns in 1603, it continued to be the centre of government. Even after the Acts of Union in 1707 removed the parliament, it retained the exchequer and law courts.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine. By <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century,</b> beginning in northern Italy, universities had become strongly influenced by Humanist thinking. This put an emphasis on classical authors, questioned some of the accepted certainties of established thinking and manifested itself in the teaching of new subjects, particularly through the medium of the Greek language. In <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> university colleges had been founded at St John's College, St Andrews (1418) and St Salvator's College was added in 1450. Glasgow was founded in 1451 and King's College, Aberdeen in 1495. St Leonard's College was added at St. Andrews in 1511. Initially, they were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law.|$|E

5|$|One {{effect of}} Jagiello's {{measures}} {{was to be}} the advancement of Catholics in Lithuania at the expense of Orthodox elements; in 1387 and 1413, for example, Lithuanian Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied to the Orthodox boyars.

5|$|The {{kingdom of}} Qatna had a {{predominantly}} Semitic Amorite population; all the personal names from Qatna in the Mari archive were Amorite.

5|$|From {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century, universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine. Until <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century,</b> those Scots who wished to attend university had to travel to England, to Oxford or Cambridge, or to the Continent. Just over 1,000 students have been identified as doing so between the twelfth century and 1410.

5|$|In 1946, the {{historian}} Boris Rybakov, while analysing miniatures of ancient Russian chronicles, {{pointed out that}} most of them, from the thirteenth century onward, display churches with onion domes rather than helmet domes. Nikolay Voronin, the foremost authority on pre-Mongol Russian architecture, seconded his opinion that onion domes existed in Russia {{as early as the}} thirteenth century, although they presumably could not be widespread. These findings demonstrated that Russian onion domes could not be imported from the Orient, where onion domes did not replace spherical domes until <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{end of the}} Medieval Greek {{period and}} the {{beginning}} of Modern Greek is often symbolically assigned to the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, even though that date marks no clear linguistic boundary and many characteristic modern features of the language arose centuries earlier, between the fourth and <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>centuries</b> AD.|$|R
5|$|Likewise, in Middle English {{and early}} modern Scottish evidence, while still {{appearing}} as causes of harm and danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings.

5|$|Seddon {{thought that}} the church had once been much more elaborate, like the South doorway, and {{proposed}} inserting a matching West crossing arch, and also more a complex spire, but this was opposed by Bishop Basil Jones, and was abandoned.

5|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 19th century, Masonic historians have sought the origins of the {{movement}} in a series of similar documents known as the Old Charges, dating from the Regius Poem in about 1425 {{to the beginning of the}} 18th century. Alluding to the membership of a lodge of operative masons, they relate a mythologised history of the craft, the duties of its grades, and the manner in which oaths of fidelity are to be taken on joining. <b>The</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> also sees the first evidence of ceremonial regalia.|$|E
