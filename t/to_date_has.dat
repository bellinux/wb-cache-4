An interview with Robert Clotworthy, the voice of Jim Raynor in all released StarCraft games <b>to</b> <b>date,</b> <b>has</b> revealed {{that for the most}} part the voicing for the characters was done over only a few days in sessions of up to four hours, a fact mirrored in a similar interview with Sarah Kerrigan's actress, Glynnis Talken Campbell. Clotworthy also stated how the concept art for the game usually used for the visual development of characters and locales in games was used by him in order to develop the personality of his character.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous analysis, You and Dodson find Chaoyangsaurus {{to be the most}} basal neoceratopsian, more derived than Psittacosaurus, while Leptoceratopsidae, not Protoceratopsidae, is recovered as the sister group of Ceratopsidae. This study includes Auroraceratops, but lacks seven taxa found in Xu and Makovicky's work, so it is unclear how comparable the two studies are. Asiaceratops and Turanoceratops are each considered nomina dubia and not included. Along with Dong Zhiming, You described Magnirostris in 2003, but <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>has</b> not included it in any of his cladograms.|$|E
5|$|Looking 4 Myself was {{predicted}} to sell 120,000 – 130,000 units during its first-week in the United States, based upon first day sales. The figure was under-weight compared to his previous effort Raymond vs. Raymond (2010), which sold 329,000 units {{during the same}} period and <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>has</b> sold over two million copies worldwide. Despite the low figure estimation, Looking 4 Myself was still expected to top the Billboard 200 chart on the week ending June 17, 2012, and did so with 128,000 first-week copies sold domestically. The album marks Usher's fourth consecutive number one studio album in the United States. The following week of the album's release, Looking 4 Myself dropped to number six on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 48,000 copies. In its third week, the album again dropped positions, falling three spots to number nine, selling 36,000 units. In its fourth week, Looking 4 Myself fell to number fifteen, and in its fifth week rose to number fourteen, selling 20,178 copies. As of October 2014, Looking 4 Myself has sold 504,000 copies in the United States.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} solar missions <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>has</b> been the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995. Originally intended to serve a two-year mission, a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October 2009. It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), was launched in February 2010. Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch. Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery {{of a large number of}} comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin is {{territorial}} {{during the}} breeding season; the area occupied has been measured between 0.25 and 1.2ha (0.6–3acres). A pair lives and forages within their territory before dispersing in autumn. The male proclaims ownership by singing loudly from a suitable perch at the territory boundary, and confronts other males with a harsh scolding call should they make an incursion. Two males {{have been seen}} to face one another 30cm to 1m (12–40in) apart, flicking wings and manoeuvring for position in a threat display while the female is incubating her eggs. Both sexes also react to the playback of song recordings. The male will also defend against incursions by male scarlet robins, and conversely avoid foraging in the latter species' territories. Most juvenile red-capped robins are unable to live in territories occupied by adult birds, and need to travel to find unoccupied land; the furthest dispersal recorded <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>has</b> been 36km (22mi), from Terrick Terrick National Park across farmland to Gunbower State Forest in northern Victoria.|$|E
