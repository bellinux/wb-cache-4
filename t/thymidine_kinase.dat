25|$|Some {{antiviral}} drugs, such as acyclovir (ATC: J05AB01) and ganciclovir (ATC: J05AB06) as well {{as other}} nucleoside analogs make use of the substrate specificity of viral <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase,</b> as opposed to human thymidine kinases. These drugs act as prodrugs, which in themselves are not toxic, but are converted to toxic drugs by phosphorylation by viral <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase.</b> Cells infected with the virus therefore produce highly toxic triphosphates that lead to cell death. Human <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase,</b> in contrast, with its more narrow specificity, is unable to phosphorylate and activate the prodrug. In this way, only cells infected by the virus are susceptible to the drug. Such drugs are effective only against viruses from the herpes group with their specific <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase.</b> In patients treated with this type of drugs, the development of antiviral drug resistance is frequently observed. Sequencing the <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> gene in Herpes simplex virus and Varicella zoster virus shows the rapid genetic variability and may facilitate the diagnosis of antiviral drug resistance.|$|E
25|$|The {{mutation}} rate {{has been estimated}} to be ~1.38×10−7 substitutions/site/year. In clinical setting, the mutations in either the <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> gene or DNA polymerase gene has caused resistance to aciclovir. However, most of the mutations occur in the <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> gene rather than the DNA polymerase gene.|$|E

40|$|The <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinases</b> encoded by herpesviruses {{of higher}} {{vertebrates}} form a distinct group and are {{unrelated to the}} <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinases</b> (TKs) of other organisms. Their evolutionary source has not been identified, but our analysis has revealed a clear relationship with a sequence of human deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) published recently. We report the sequence of the putative TK of channel catfish virus, a herpesvirus of a lower vertebrate, and show that it is also related to dCK. We propose, therefore, that the TKs of herpesviruses of higher and lower vertebrates have evolved, either independently or successively, from a cellular dCK...|$|R

Most of these analogs are capable of being phosphorylated by both human and viral enzymes. On the assumption that inhibition constants (Ki) reflect binding affinity, Ki values were determined for these analogs with the same <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinases.</b> In general, these analogs have a greater affinity for the viral enzymes. The amount of the analogs phosphorylated to the monophosphate form, which is presumably necessary to produce cytotoxic effects, {{was determined by the}} combined effects of phosphorylation rates and binding affinities. All of these analogs act as preferential substrates for the viral <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinases</b> at low concentrations, which {{may be one of the}} main reasons for their selective antiviral action...|$|R
25|$|<b>Thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> is a salvage {{enzyme that}} is only present in {{anticipation}} of cell division. The enzyme is not set free from cells undergoing normal division where the cells have a special mechanism to degrade the proteins no longer needed after the cell division. In normal subjects, the amount of <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> in serum or plasma is therefore very low. Tumor cells release enzyme to the circulation, probably {{in connection with the}} disruption of dead or dying tumor cells. The <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> level in serum therefore serves as a measure of malignant proliferation, indirectly as a measure of the aggressivity of the tumor.|$|E
25|$|Molecular combing of DNA fibers {{can be used}} {{to monitor}} the {{structure}} of chromosomes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This provides DNA replication profiles of individual molecules. This requires that the yeast strains express <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase,</b> which wild type yeasts so not, being fungi (see occurrence). Therefore. a gene for <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> must be incorporated in the genome.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{use of the}} <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> {{makes use}} of the {{presence}} in some tumor cells of substances not present in normal cells (tumor markers). Such tumor markers are, for instance, CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) and AFP (alpha fetoprotein). The genes for these tumor markers {{may be used as}} promoter genes for <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase.</b> <b>Thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> can then be activated in cells expressing the tumor marker but not in normal cells, such that treatment with ganciclovir kills only the tumor cells. Such gene therapy-based approaches are still experimental, however, as problems associated with targeting the gene transfer to the tumor cells have not yet been completely solved.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{functions}} in dephosphorylating nucleoside triphosphates, especially the 5′- and 2′(3′)-phosphates of uracil and thymine, {{as well as}} inosine and guanine, dNTPs (dUMPs, dTMPs, dIMPs, and dGMPs, respectively). Due to this function, cdN regulates the size of dNTP pools in cells, {{in conjunction with the}} cytosolic <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinases,</b> as part of the dNTP substrate cycle.|$|R
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of transferases, {{specifically}} those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:dTMP phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include <b>thymidine</b> monophosphate <b>kinase,</b> thymidylate kinase, thymidylate monophosphate kinase, thymidylic acid kinase, thymidylic kinase, deoxythymidine 5'-monophosphate <b>kinase,</b> TMPK, and <b>thymidine</b> 5'-monophosphate <b>kinase.</b> This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism.|$|R
40|$|<b>Thymidine</b> <b>kinases</b> (TKs) {{appear to}} be almost {{ubiquitous}} and are found in nearly all prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and several viruses. They are the key enzymes in thymidine salvage and activation of several anti-cancer and antiviral drugs. We show that bacterial TKs can be subdivided into 2 groups.

25|$|The {{formation}} of tetramer after modification of <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> 1 after synthesis enhances the enzyme activity.

Its use for fine regulation of DNA synthesis is suggested to have been established in warm blooded animals after they branched out from the vertebrates. Also the development of <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> like enzymes in the development has been studied.|$|E
25|$|Another use of {{gene therapy}} is the {{introduction}} of enzymes into these cells that make them susceptible to particular chemotherapy agents; studies with introducing <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> in gliomas, making them susceptible to aciclovir, are in their experimental stage.|$|E
40|$|Mammals {{have four}} {{deoxyribonucleoside}} kinases, the cytoplasmic (TK 1) and mitochondrial (TK 2) <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinases,</b> and the deoxycytidine (dCK) and deoxyguanosine (dGK) kinases, which salvage the precursors for nucleic acids synthesis. In {{addition to the}} native deoxyribonucleoside substrates, the kinases can phosphorylate and thereby activate a variety of anti-cancer and antiviral prodrugs. Recently, the crystal structure of human TK 1 has been solved and has revealed that enzymes with fundamentally different origins and folds catalyze similar, crucial cellular reactions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExisting {{data on the}} {{structure}} of human deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) diverge. A monomeric 60 kDa form has been isolated and the cloning of a cDNA coding for 626 amino acids corresponding to a 71 kDa protein has been reported. However, pure dCK isolated from leukemic spleen is a dimer of 30 kDa subunits. Amino acid sequences of peptides from digests of this protein are now presented. None of the peptide structures obtained correspond to the cDNA for the 71 kDa protein, but to a cDNA for a 30. 5 kDa dCK recently cloned.

40|$|Human {{herpesvirus}} 8 (HHV- 8) {{sensitivity to}} the nucleoside analog ganciclovir (GCV) suggests {{the presence of a}} virally encoded kinase that catalyzes the initial phosphorylation of GCV. Analysis of the HHV- 8 genome identified two candidate kinases: proteins encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 21, with homology to the herpesvirus <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinases</b> (TK), and ORF 36, with homology to the herpesvirus phosphotransferases (PT). Experiments presented here show that both ORF 21 and ORF 36 encode GCV kinase activities as demonstrated by GCV phosphorylation and GCV-mediated cell death. In both regards the PT homologue ORF 36 was more active than the TK homologue ORF 21. ORF 21, but not ORF 36, weakly sensitized cells to killing by penciclovir.

25|$|There are {{different}} classes of drugs directed against thymidine metabolism and thereby involving <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> {{that are used}} to control cancer associated cell division. Chain terminators are thymidine analogues that are included in the growing DNA chain, but modified so that the chain cannot be further elongated. As analogs of thymidine, this type of drugs are readily phosphorylated to 5'-monophosphates. The monophosphate is further phosphorylated to the corresponding triphosphate and incorporated in the growing DNA chain. The analog has been modified so that it does not have the hydroxyl group in the 3'-position that is required for continued chain growth. In zidovudine (AZT; ATC:J05AF01) the 3'-hydroxyl group has been replaced by an azido group, in stavudine (ATC: J05AF04) it has been removed without replacement. AZT is used as substrate in one of the methods for determination of <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> in serum. This implies that AZT interferes with this method and may be a limitation: AZT is a standard component of HAART therapy in HIV infection. One common consequence of AIDS is lymphoma and the most important diagnostic application of <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> determination is for monitoring of lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Aciclovir is {{converted}} by viral <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> to aciclovir monophosphate, {{which is then}} converted by host cell kinases to aciclovir triphosphate (ACV-TP). ACV-TP, in turn, competitively inhibits and inactivates HSV-specified DNA polymerases preventing further viral DNA synthesis without affecting the normal cellular processes.|$|E
25|$|Thymidine monophosphate is also {{produced}} by the cell in a different reaction by methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate, a product of other metabolic pathways unrelated to thymidine, by the enzyme thymidylate synthase. The second route is sufficient to supply thymidine monophosphate for DNA repair. When a cell prepares to divide, a complete new set-up of DNA is required, and the requirement for building blocks, including thymidine triphosphate, increases. Cells prepare for cell division by making some of the enzymes required during the division. They are not normally present in the cells and are downregulated and degraded afterwards. Such enzymes are called salvage enzymes. <b>Thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> 1 is such a salvage enzyme, whereas <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> 2 and thymidylate synthase are not cell cycle-dependent.|$|E

25|$|The viral <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinases</b> differ {{completely}} {{from the}} mammalian enzymes both structurally and biochemically and are inhibited by inhibitors {{that do not}} inhibit the mammalian enzymes.

However, the form of enzyme present in the circulation does not correspond to the protein as encoded by the gene: the main fraction of the active enzyme in the circulation has a molecular weight of 730 kD and is probably bound in a complex to other proteins.

25|$|Resistance to {{aciclovir}} is rare {{in people}} with healthy immune systems, but is more common (up to 10%) in people with immunodeficiencies on chronic antiviral prophylaxis (transplant recipients, people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome due to HIV infection).

25|$|After {{smallpox}} {{was declared}} eradicated by WHO in December 1979, vaccination programs were terminated. A re-emergence {{of the disease}} either by accident or {{as a result of}} biological warfare would meet an unprotected population and could result in an epidemic that could be difficult to control. Mass vaccination would be unethical, as the only efficient vaccines against smallpox include live vaccinia virus with severe adverse effects on rare occasions. As one protective measure, large amounts of vaccine are kept in stock, but an efficient drug against smallpox has high priority. One possible approach would be to use the specificity of the <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> of poxvirus for the purpose, in a similar way that it is used for drugs against herpesvirus. One difficulty is that the poxvirus <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> belongs to the same family of thymidine kinases as the human thymidine kinases and thereby is more similar chemically. The structure of poxvirus thymidine kinases has therefore been determined to find potential antiviral drugs. The search has, however, not yet resulted in a usable antiviral drug against poxviruses.|$|E
25|$|Thymidine monophosphate, {{the product}} of the {{reaction}} catalyzed by <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase,</b> is in turn phosphorylated to thymidine diphosphate by the enzyme thymidylate kinase and further to thymidine triphosphate by the enzyme nucleoside diphosphate kinase.

B 3 TK recognized the enzyme's natural substrates, thymidine, deoxycytidine, dTMP and ATP as well as the wt enzyme. In contrast, Tr 7 and S 1 TKs failed to bind deoxycytidine and bind thymidine less well than wt. Tr 7 and S 1 TKs had affinities for dTMP similar to those of B 3 and the wt enzymes. ATP binding to wt, Tr 7 and B 3 enzymes was similar but this substrate bound only weakly to S 1 TK.

25|$|TK1 is {{synthesized}} by {{the cell}} during the S phase of cell division. After cell division is completed, TK1 is degraded intracellularly {{and does not}} pass to body fluids after normal cell division. There is a feed-back regulation of the action of <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase</b> in the cell: thymidine triphosphate (TTP), {{the product of the}} further phosphorylation of thymidine, acts as an inhibitor to <b>thymidine</b> <b>kinase.</b> This serves to maintain a balanced amount of TTP available for nucleic acid synthesis, not oversaturating the system. 5'-Aminothymidine, a non-toxic analogue of thymidine, interferes with this regulatory mechanism and thereby increases the cytotoxicity of thymidine analogues used as antineoplastic drugs. The reaction kinetics of thymidine and thymidine analogues phosphorylation is complicated and only partly known. The overall phosphorylation of thymidine to thymidine triphosphate does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the various phosphates of thymidine and uridine interfere with the phosphorylation of each other. The kinetics of TK from different species differ from each other's and also the different forms from a given species (monomer, dimer, tetramer and serum form) have different kinetic characteristics.|$|E

40|$|<b>Thymidine</b> <b>kinases</b> (TKs) {{have been}} {{considered}} one of the potential targets for anticancer therapeutic because of their elevated expressions in cancer cells. However, nucleobase analogs targeting TKs have shown poor selective cytotoxicity in cancer cells despite effective antiviral activity. 3 ′-Deoxythymidine phenylquinoxaline conjugate (dT-QX) was designed as a novel nucleobase analog to target TKs in cancer cells and block cell replication via conjugated DNA intercalating quinoxaline moiety. In vitro cell screening showed that dT-QX selectively kills a variety of cancer cells including liver carcinoma, breast adenocarcinoma and brain glioma cells; whereas it had a low cytotoxicity in normal cells such as normal human liver cells. The anticancer activity of dT-QX was attributed to its selective inhibition of DNA synthesis resulting in extensive mitochondrial superoxide stress in cancer cells. We demonstrate that covalent linkage with 3 ′-deoxythymidine uniquely directed cytotoxic phenylquinoxaline moiety more toward cancer cells than normal cells. Preliminary mouse study with subcutaneous liver tumor model showed that dT-QX effectively inhibited the growth of tumors. dT-QX is the first molecule of its kind with highly amendable constituents that exhibits this selective cytotoxicity in cancer cells...|$|R
