On arrival, the new locomotives received the next available classification of DJ. They were the first locomotives in New Zealand to employ an AC/DC transmission, all previous diesel locomotive types had DC/DC transmissions. They were also turbocharged rather like an early 1980s F1 car, max, 1050 hp rating, only safe for 5 minutes an hour, with operation at 975 hp for an hour on, and 835 hp for the next hour, but it took expensive experience to appreciate, boost power levels of 800hp plus, were not reliably sustainable, for all trip operation, such as the first passenger DJ express use on the 11hr run, summer SI Limited in 1969-70, when 2DJ pulled up to 14 cars[...] The order for the DJ was in two batches, 55 on 1 August 1966 [...] and the second delayed order of 9 on 1 November 1967 [...] while consideration was made how best to complete dieselisation on the West coast which had the best hard coal and on the heavy Passenger and express services on the SIMT for which the DJ lacked power. The initial tender for the SI diesels, had attracted offers which included diesel hydraulics from the Mitsubushi itself as an alternative offer, Hitachi and the German Export company, all three designs, variations essentially variations of BR Warship 42/43 design single engined, narrow gauged and single cab and without steam heat boiler to reduce from 82 tons to 64 tons and with similar Maybach engines and Mekhydro transmission or Man engines and Voith transmission. At the same weight power {{could easily have been}} doubled to the Warships 2200 hp to give 80 mph performance on the Southerner and much better hillclimbing than the French designed gas turbine train sets favoured for South Island expresses by the Minister of Railways Peter Gordon. Although the diesel hydraulic offers were 3 or the 4 lowest bid they rejected out of hand by the NZR staff who being dominated by electrical engines thought diesel hydraulics unsuitable for NZ. It had been intended to call full tenders for the last 9 engines in mid 1967, but Treasury suggested that the offer be restricted to Mitsubushi and the best 2 other DE offers to the first tender, but after unofficial discussion with World Bank staff, the last 9 were simply ordered direct from Mitsubushi because, the World Bank staff advised no other rail company would be able to deliver in the time and funding available {{for the remainder of the}} World Bank grant.|$|E
40|$|When {{government}} entities procure {{goods or}} services, they generally consider and award contracts only to bidders who {{complied with the}} specifications and conditions of tender as laid down in the tender invitation. Tenders received must in other words be conforming, compliant or responsive. This enables procuring entities to compare tenders {{on an equal footing}} and ensures equal treatment amongst bidders. In South Africa the extent to which bidders must comply with <b>tender</b> <b>specifications</b> and conditions is a thorny issue in practice. In 2008 the Supreme Court of Appeal in Millennium Waste Management (Pty) Ltd v Chairperson, Tender Board: Limpopo Province confirmed the views of the courts in South Africa regarding compliance with tender conditions and the amendment of tenders before award. The recent 2013 decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal in Dr JS Moroka Municipality v The Chairperson of the Tender Evaluation Committee of the Dr JS Moroka Municipality, however, has moved public procurement regulation in South Africa to a point where procuring entities have very limited discretionary powers when evaluating compliance with <b>tender</b> <b>specifications</b> and conditions. This paper argues for an approach that allows procuring entities in South Africa more discretion when evaluating compliance with <b>tender</b> <b>specifications</b> and conditions. In doing so, reliance is placed on the treatment of "responsiveness" in international instruments as well as the views of the South African courts since first they were confronted with the issue. ...|$|E

40|$|Innovation is a {{key driver}} for social {{development}} and {{economic growth in the}} Netherlands. To remain the position in the top 20 th economies worldwide the Dutch government initiated several incentives for innovation. Public procurement is considered a powerful tool to stimulate innovation in private companies. Various studies showed a great potential of the procurement-instrument through efficient use of this tendering tool. However, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge and understanding of the conditions that stimulate of hinder innovation. The problem statement of this study is: To what extent are factors, related to public procurement, a barrier to innovation in the private sector? This study is conducted in the construction industry which, in comparison with other sectors, is seen as less innovative and is depended of the workload from the public sector through public procurement. A survey was conducted among employees of construction and consulting companies with experience in participating in public tenders. A total number of 102 public tenders were included in this study. Literature describes various barriers to innovation and has led to seven hypotheses of factors that influence company’s innovation propensity. The factors that form a barrier to innovation in construction and (construction) consulting companies are: procurement competences, management of risk during the procurement process, interaction with the procurer, public demand for innovation, <b>tender</b> <b>specifications,</b> incentives and management of intellectual property rights. There was also the expectation that a company with higher scores on innovation culture will experience less resistance of barriers to their propensity to innovate. The research revealed a positive effect of flexibility and freedom in the <b>tender</b> <b>specifications</b> on innovation propensity. Also, confirmation was found for the positive influence of incentives on innovation propensity. These factors may be a barrier to innovation in tenders with lack of incentives and very narrow <b>tender</b> <b>specifications.</b> Remarkably, we found a negative relation between interaction with the procurer and the innovation propensity of construction companies. For the other factors no significant impact was found on the innovation propensity in the private sector. No support was found for the expected moderating effects of innovation culture of the company in relation to barriers to innovation. This study provides some recommendations for practice. Public procurers should allow flexibility of specifications in order to stimulate the development of innovative solutions by (private) suppliers. Suppliers also need to be stimulated by increasing size and duration of the contracts or use stimulating selection criteria in the tender (EMVI). The procurer must create conditions within the procurement process where there is space for suppliers creativeness and innovativeness. The interaction between the procurer and suppliers should focus on the conditions of the innovation process, not on the innovation itself. The study had a limited research group of 51 respondents, mainly from the southern Netherlands. Therefore, the research should be extended to other regions in the Netherlands. The conclusions are based on opinions and judgments of the respondents. The results of this study should be supported by qualitative research. Further research could also focus on the perspective of public organizations on the innovation in public procurement and on the obstacles within the influence of private organizations...|$|E

The main {{aim of the}} thesis is to draw a set of relevant recommendations for proper construc-tion of public <b>tender</b> <b>specifications,</b> which are used to tender external evaluations. The author performed a research with the usage of empirical and statistical methods on a sample of tender documentations and evaluation reports, which were carried out for ESF operational programs 2004 [...] 6 and 2007 [...] 13 in the Czech Republic. Author also used {{a case study of}} an evaluation performed on Objective 3 Single Programming Document (Prague), co-financed by the ESF in the period 2004 [...] 6. In addition to the main objective stated above, the thesis includes data on real public tender documentations and evaluation reports. The output is represented by data on estimated prices of external evaluation, tender documentation contents and also on methods and techniques, which were used in the evaluations examined. Such set of empirical data has been scarcely found in recent studies, which adds to usability of this thesis for expert audience. External evaluation is an expert project financed with public resources, carried out through public procurement. Based on the model process of such evaluation, the author searches for preconditions of realizing an efficient external evaluation. Efficiency and its factors then become main subject of research. As a key factor of performing an efficient evaluation through public procurement, the author identifies the tender documentation and its qualities. This thesis contains a research performed on a sample of evaluations of five programs co-financed by the ESF in the Czech Republic. Examined tender documentations contained serious drawbacks, namely incomplete and inexact definitions of expected outputs, missing list of required methods for the evaluation and also missing scale of statistical samples for the research. Quantitative tests also did not prove any dependence of estimated price of the evaluation stated by the tenderers on pre-defined cost-effective factor. The thesis ends with summative conclusions of the drawbacks and, in accordance with research findings, brings a set of methodical recommendations for proper construction of public <b>tender</b> <b>specifications</b> of an evaluation, which may lead to increase in efficiency of tendering external evaluations...|$|E
