50|$|SignEasy {{allows users}} <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>documents</b> to others for signatures. SignEasy was Featured among Best Business Apps in App Store 2014 & 2015. And the only eSignature app {{featured}} in Apple’s global TV commercials.|$|E
50|$|EDT Hub {{is used by}} over 40 NHS Trusts <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>documents</b> {{electronically}} from NHS Secondary Care Trusts to NHS Primary Care Trusts. More {{recently the}} solution has been chosen by NHS Scotland for a national roll-out as reported in The Guardian.|$|E
5000|$|One {{of those}} so called [...] "alternative methods" [...] is <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>documents</b> by mail. The {{argument}} {{in this case}} largely revolves around {{whether or not the}} right to [...] "send" [...] includes the right to [...] "effect service" [...] of a legal document.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Bronze edicts {{written in}} the Tangut script of the Western Xia; edict plates were used <b>to</b> <b>send</b> urgent <b>documents</b> and messages, under {{imperial}} orders. When these matching pieces are joined together, they prove the bearer's identity.|$|R
5000|$|PaperWorks {{could be}} used <b>to</b> <b>send</b> and {{retrieve}} <b>documents</b> between the fixed computer system and the business traveler, by using fax machines.|$|R

5000|$|There is an {{increasing}} trend for new photocopiers to adopt digital technology, thus replacing the older analog technology. With digital copying, the copier effectively consists of an integrated scanner and laser printer. This design has several advantages, such as automatic image quality enhancement {{and the ability to}} [...] "build jobs" [...] (that is, to scan page images independently of the process of printing them). Some digital copiers can function as high-speed scanners; such models typically offer the ability <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>documents</b> via email or to make them available on file servers.|$|E
5000|$|Users {{would be}} able <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>documents</b> {{directly}} to other users simply by dropping the address on the document, or vice versa, bypassing a [...] "message" [...] at all [...] - [...] the document would arrive, by itself, in the other user's mailbox. Delivery of e-mail (which in this scenario {{is nothing more than}} a text document in a specialized format), or of anything else for that matter, was handled entirely by plug-ins, allowing the user to collect mail from all of their sources and collect it into a single inbox.|$|E
50|$|The Playbook OS 2.0 was {{released}} on February 21, 2012. The software update added integrated native email, calendar, and contact apps. It also included visual changes to the operating system, support {{for a variety of}} Android applications and also brought three new applications built into the OS: Press Reader, a newspaper reader; News, an RSS reader; and Print To Go, which can be used <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>documents</b> from a PC to the PlayBook. BBM (aka BlackBerry Messenger) support was not included with the 2.0 update, although BlackBerry intends to support BBM in a future update. BBM is still supported through the BlackBerry Bridge software, allowing users to continue to have access to it while bridged to their BlackBerry smartphone.|$|E
50|$|In 2011-2012, Swartz and Kevin Poulsen {{designed}} and implemented DeadDrop, {{a system that}} allows anonymous informants <b>to</b> <b>send</b> electronic <b>documents</b> without fear of disclosure. In May 2013, the first instance of the software was launched by The New Yorker under the name Strongbox. The Freedom of the Press Foundation has since taken over development of the software, which has been renamed SecureDrop.|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} {{established}} for those desiring <b>to</b> <b>send</b> a <b>document</b> quickly. The document {{would be taken}} to the post office and rolled up into a metal capsule. The clerk would then drop the metal capsule down a hatch leading to a predestined location. After the clerk pressed a button, the capsule would be moved by compressed air along a network of tubes beneath the pavement.|$|R
50|$|The user {{connects to}} the {{supplier}} Web site, specifies the receiving fax number, and uploads the <b>document</b> <b>to</b> <b>send.</b> The <b>document</b> is usually converted to PDF or TIFF format and sent by the Web server to the fax server, which then transmits it to the receiving fax machine via the telephone network. The sender usually receives confirmation that transmission was successful, either in the web interface or by email.|$|R
5000|$|Such a system, with an [...] command <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>documents</b> to the queue, {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1973 in Version 4 of Unix. By the release of System V Release 4, the suite of utilities had grown to include commands for canceling print jobs, moving jobs among queues, enabling and disabling queues, enabling and disabling a job scheduler daemon, and status reports of the print system. The [...] command handled queue documents to be printed and had over 20 different options that controlled {{the appearance of the}} document and its place in the queue, and even handled email notification of the user once the document had finished printing. The command returned a [...] "job id" [...] which could be used by the cancel or lpstat commands to remove the job from the queue or check on its progress, respectively. While the system was considered to be quite complex to set up and administer, most uses were expected to only use these three commands.|$|E
50|$|As {{soon as the}} Franco-Spanish {{siege of}} 1704-1705 had been lifted, Romero de Figueroa began {{secretly}} <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>documents,</b> religious jewellery and plate, pictures, and ornaments to the settlements established in the Campo de Gibraltar. He was also responsible for the safekeeping and rescue {{of the statue of}} Our Lady of Europe from the shrine of the same name. Soon after the capture of Gibraltar in 1704, the shrine was sacked and stripped of all its valuables by soldiers running amok, disobeying the orders of their officers. The statue of Our Lady was mutilated and flung onto the rocks below, where it was found by a fisherman. He took the remains to Romero de Figueroa, who sent them to the neighbouring Algeciras, where the statue was repaired and given a new home in a small chapel then dedicated to Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, which was later rededicated as the Chapel of Our Lady of Europe. In 1864 the statue was returned to Gibraltar, at the request of John Baptist Scandella, Vicar Apostolic of Gibraltar.|$|E
40|$|Wikis may be {{on track}} to take the {{academic}} world by storm. Though researchers have used them as collaborative tools {{for more than a}} decade, {{it is only in the}} past year or two that they have become widespread in education. Of the articles published by SIGCSE on wikis, nearly two-thirds (30 out of 46) of them gave appeared since the beginning of 2006. References to wikis in the educational database ERIC are approximately doubling each year. 1 What is it about wikis that has suddenly made them so attractive? Among other things, it is the fact that collaboration becomes so easy. Students have the opportunity to revise each other’s work without the need <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>documents</b> back and forth. Because an edit history is kept, it is easy to see how much work each student has done—and to verify that it has not been downloaded from a third-party source on the eve of the due date. Wikis have been used for a wide variety of assignments, from discussion boards to writing a textbook from student contributions. This panel will present several collaborativelearning exercises that have been carried out with wikis, and give advice to instructors who want to use wikis in their classes...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{integration}} between electronic mail and web services for people such as library operators who need <b>to</b> <b>send</b> large files <b>to</b> Internet users. The proposed solution permits librarians to continue using the e-mail service <b>to</b> <b>send</b> large <b>documents,</b> {{but at the same}} time overcomes problems that users can encounter downloading large size files with e-mail agents. The library operator <b>sends</b> the <b>document</b> as an attachment to the destination address, on fly the e-mail server extracts and saves the attachments in a web-server disk file and substitutes then with a new message part that includes the URL pointing to the saved document. The receiver can download these large objects using user-friendly browser...|$|R
5000|$|The {{notice is}} {{delivered}} to the plaintiff by either physically delivering it to his address, or via registered mail. There is no requirement <b>to</b> <b>send</b> the <b>document</b> through the sheriff. The word [...] "deliver" [...] entails that {{a copy of the}} document is served on the opposite party and the original filed with the clerk of the court. In the event of a notice to defend being filed, a plaintiff may, under certain circumstances, file an application for summary judgment.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our experience}} in implementing an Internet Document Delivery Service (IDDS) {{based on an}} e-mail/web gateway. The proposed solution permits librarians to continue using the e-mail service <b>to</b> <b>send</b> large <b>documents,</b> {{but at the same}} time overcomes problems that users can encounter downloading large size files with e-mail agents. The library operator <b>sends</b> the <b>document</b> as an attachment to the destination address, on fly the e-mail server extracts and saves the attachments in a web-server this file and substitutes then with a new message part that includes the URL pointing to the saved document.

This integration between electronic mail and web-services is useful for people such as library operators who need <b>to</b> <b>send</b> large files <b>to</b> Internet users and can be customized in order to be satisfying for different organizations...|$|R
40|$|Document Management is {{the initial}} stage of most {{electronic}} publishing endeavours. Individuals need to organise documents {{in such a}} way that they can be retrieved and accessed on demand, shared selectively, integrated with the work of others and preserved forever. Publishing of documents is another very important aspect of document management. However, tools that exist for publishing documents are limited in that they only allow a user <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>documents</b> to local devices such as disk drives. No tools exist in the user workspace to publish documents in a wide area network. The report outlines the development of a document management tool that is aimed at addressing the issues of integrating document management and the publishing of documents in the user workspace. The components of the system are the metadata extractor, the publishing tool, the user interface and the email gateway. The system was tested and evaluated, yielding the following results that show that metadata can be extracted from research documents by defining simple heuristics that define properties of the document and using a statistical learning model. Publishing of documents to a repository in the wide area network and version control of documents was also integrated into the user workspace...|$|E
40|$|Informatisation of {{the private}} and public sector is a {{significant}} social phenomenon whose first wave was noted in the 1990 s. With the gradual development and availability of ICT means, traditional personal or post communication has been replaced by electronic correspondence because of the user´s comfort as well as financial savings. The Czech strategy of information society formation is represented e. g. by the e-Government Project whose key tool is electronic communication via data boxes. The Act No. 300 / 2008 Coll. On Electronic Acts and Authorised Conversion of Documents establishes data boxes for public authorities, legal entities formed by the law, legal entities incorporated in the Commercial Register and trustees in bankruptcy. After a three-month transitional trial period, since November 1, 2009, communication via data boxes is carried out reciprocally among public authorities {{and in the case of}} service by public authorities to other users of data boxes. Other entities than public authorities do not thus have the duty <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>documents</b> from their data boxes. Compulsory establishment of data boxes is often criticized mainly by the private sector as many enterpreneurs perceive them as a means of carrying over costs of public authority to private entities. As problematic issues are viewed especially the duty of frequent password changes and the fact that data boxes are only short-term deposits of data messages...|$|E
50|$|On New Year's Eve 1986, {{professional}} thief Jim Rawlings {{breaks into}} the apartment of a senior civil servant, and inadvertently discovers stolen top secret documents. Despite {{being one of the}} most notorious thieves in London, he is enough of a patriot <b>to</b> anonymously <b>send</b> the <b>documents</b> <b>to</b> MI5 so that they might locate the traitor.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, two Flemish ministers (Leo Peeters and Luc Vandenbrande) {{proposed}} a stricter {{interpretation of the}} above laws and instructed the Flemish municipalities with facilities for the French speakers <b>to</b> <b>send</b> all <b>documents</b> only in Dutch {{and to provide a}} French translated version only to people who would place an individual formal request which should be renewed for every document. These instructions sharpened the practice until then condoned by the Permanent Commission for Language Control, a joint commission set up by the law to control the correct application of the language laws in Belgium.|$|R
50|$|Benedict Arnold's British contact John André {{was caught}} {{and was taken}} to North Castle, where {{commander}} Colonel Jameson ordered lieutenant Allen to take the incriminating documents found with André to their commander Benedict Arnold at West Point. Tallmadge suspected André to be a spy and Benedict Arnold to be his accomplice, {{and he tried to}} have Jameson reverse his orders. He was unsuccessful, but did convince Jameson <b>to</b> <b>send</b> a rider and take Andre to Salem, eight miles east of the Hudson River and <b>to</b> <b>send</b> the <b>documents</b> <b>to</b> George Washington. Allen still reported to Benedict Arnold with Jameson's note outlining the events. Later, Jameson was chastised by Washington for warning Arnold and allowing his escape. André was placed in Tallmadge's custody awaiting execution.|$|R
50|$|On January 25, 2006, Ologun {{allegedly}} assaulted Katsuyuki Ito, {{the president}} of the entertainment agency, R&A Promotions, to which Ologun belongs in Shibuya. Police deliberated whether <b>to</b> <b>send</b> prosecution <b>documents</b> <b>to</b> court in lieu of the charges. According to the investigation, Ologun reportedly seized the president's clothes and acted violently by throwing around furniture because of a dispute over payment. John Muwete Muruaka, who is famous in Japan as the former private secretary of the scandalized Representative Muneo Suzuki {{and a member of the}} same agency as Ologun, happened to be there and tried to stop the fight, resulting in a scuffle between the two men.|$|R

500|$|Edward caused unease in {{government}} circles with actions that were interpreted as interference in political matters. His comment during {{a tour of}} depressed villages in South Wales that [...] "something must be done" [...] for the unemployed coal miners {{was seen as an}} attempt to guide government policy, though it has never been clear what sort of remedy he had in mind. Government ministers were reluctant <b>to</b> <b>send</b> confidential <b>documents</b> and state papers to Fort Belvedere, because it was clear that Edward was paying little attention to them, and it was feared that Simpson and other house guests might read them, improperly or inadvertently disclosing information that could be detrimental to the national interest.|$|R
50|$|Gorsuch's {{nomination}} was first {{considered by the}} Senate Judiciary Committee, which holds hearings on all federal judicial nominations and decides whether or not <b>to</b> <b>send</b> nominations <b>to</b> the full Senate for a final confirmation vote. The committee consists of 11 Republican Senators and 9 Democratic Senators, and is chaired by Republican Chuck Grassley (R-IA). In February 2017, the committee requested the Justice Department <b>to</b> <b>send</b> all <b>documents</b> they had regarding Gorsuch's work in the George W. Bush administration. , the Justice Department had turned over more than 144,000 pages of documents and, according to a White House spokesman, more than 220,000 pages of documents in total {{had been sent to}} the committee. Gorsuch's confirmation hearings started on March 20, 2017, and lasted four days. On April 3, the Judiciary Committee approved Gorsuch by in an 11-9 in a party-line vote.|$|R

5000|$|In 1975, Tormes González was {{instrumental}} in identifying a new headquarters to consolidate all the documents of related {{to the history of}} Ponce. Under her guidance, the Archivo Histórico de Ponce was first headquartered on the second level of Teatro La Perla. It was inaugurated on 19 June 1975, with a budget of only $5,000. [...] She was also instrumental in ensuring that the documents about the history of Ponce were not moved to San Juan when a proposal to annex then to the Puerto Rico Historical Archive in San Juan was gathering support.
