30|$|As {{several studies}} have {{demonstrated}} [18 – 21], RSH {{can be used as}} a key-indicator of the degree of weathering of a surface. In this study, an Equotip 3 with a D-type probe was used to map variations in weakening of the stone surface. This equipment was originally developed for the testing of metals [22], but is now used in both natural settings [23, 24] and the built environment [25]. The surface hardness is measured through rebound of a 3 [*]mm diameter spherical tungsten carbide <b>test</b> <b>tip</b> against the rock surface. This tip is mounted in an impact body and impacts under spring force against the test surface from which it rebounds [26]. The velocity before impact (V,) and after impact (V 2) are measured automatically and displayed as a ratio (V 2 /V,[*]×[*] 1000) which is denoted by the unit ‘L’, or Leeb unit [27]. The nine blocks were each subdivided into 50 measurement points, noting distance from nearest bullet impact.|$|E

40|$|The new Wind Technology Test Center is {{the only}} {{facility}} in the nation capable of testing wind turbine blades up to 90 meters in length. A critical factor to wind turbine design and development {{is the ability to}} test new designs, components, and materials. In addition, wind turbine blade manufacturers are required to test their blades as part of the turbine certification process. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) partnered with the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Wind Program and the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC) to design, construct, and operate the Wind Technology Center (WTTC) in Boston, Massachusetts. The WTTC offers a full suite of certification tests for turbine blades up to 90 meters in length. NREL worked closely with MTS Systems Corporation to develop the novel large-scale test systems needed to conduct the static and fatigue tests required for certification. Static tests pull wind turbine blades horizontally and vertically to measure blade deflection and strains. Fatigue tests cycle the blades millions of times to simulate what a blade goes through in its lifetime on a wind turbine. For static testing, the WTTC is equipped with servo-hydraulic winches and cylinders that are connected to the blade through cables to apply up to an 84 -mega Newton meter maximum static bending moment. For fatigue testing, MTS developed a commercial version of NREL's patented resonant excitation system with hydraulic cylinders that actuate linear moving masses on the blade at one or more locations. This system applies up to a 21 -meter tip-to-tip fatigue <b>test</b> <b>tip</b> displacement to generate 20 -plus years of cyclic field loads in a matter of months. NREL also developed and supplied the WTTC with an advanced data acquisition system capable of measuring and recording hundreds of data channels at very fast sampling rates while communicating with test control systems...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: <b>Tip</b> <b>test</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} to characterize the friction during cold forging process based on a linear relationship between the maximum load and radial tip distance measured. In this previous investigation, a negative slope of linearity between maximum load and tip distance was observed which was totally opposite to the conventional <b>tip</b> <b>test</b> results although the linear relationship was still consistent. The present study investigates feasibility to utilize the <b>tip</b> <b>test</b> to differentiate the effect of surface roughness of the punch and dies on friction effect. Design/methodology/approach: For experiments, commercial aluminum alloys of 2024 -O and 6061 -O were used. Lubrication was varied with four different kinds of VG 32, VG 100, cooking corn oil, and grease. Maximum load and radial tip distance of deformed specimens were measured to determine {{the correlation between the}} two. Finite element simulation was utilized to calibrate and quantitatively determine friction factors at punch/work piece and die/work piece interfaces, respectively. Downsized <b>tip</b> <b>test</b> was performed with an experimental set-up by employing the punch, lower die, and counter punch working as bottom die. Findings: It was found that the ratio between these two friction factors and the slope between the tip distance and maximum load were dependent on the relative levels of surface roughness of the punch and dies. It was found that the <b>tip</b> <b>test</b> can be used to determine the effect of relative surface characteristics on friction behavior and material flow. Research limitations/implications: Interestingly this x ratio obtained in the downsized experiment was similar to the values obtained from the conventional <b>tip</b> <b>test</b> with the larger specimens. This recovers the validity of the <b>tip</b> <b>test</b> to determine the effect of the surface quality on friction behavior and material flow more scientifically. Originality/value: According to the present investigation only, the friction factors increased as surface roughness increased except for the case of conventional <b>tip</b> <b>test</b> results. The present investigation should be extended further to consider the effect of other processing parameters involved with forming processes on friction effect...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{application of}} image processing for precise distance measurement in self acting {{production of a}} tip for AFM microscopes. The main goal is to measure distances between assembly parts during fabrication process. The purpose is to acquire a data for self acting assembly line which have to substitute inaccurate and nonrecurring manual assembly process. The assembly process consists of three technological steps. In first two steps the tungsten wire is glued to the cantilever. Distance measurement is necessary in all axes for proper alignment of parts. In third step the sharp tip is etched by KOH solution. The right distance between liquid level and the cantilever must be kept. A camera with high resolution and macro objective is used to acquire an image. Camera image is then calibrated to suppress distortions and scene position with respect to camera position. Length conversion coefficient is also computed. Object recognition and distance measurement is based on standard computer vision methods, mainly: adaptive thresholding, moments, image statistics, canny edge detector, Hough transform… Proposed algorithms have been implemented in C++ using Intel OpenCV library. The final achieved distance resolution is about 10 µm per pixel. Algorithm output was successfully used to assembly few <b>test</b> <b>tips...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a comparative analysis to determine life history and ecological correlates of pollen limitation among 224 species of animal-pollinated ¯owering plants. To test predictions concerning {{the occurrence of}} pollen limitation, species were classi®ed categorically for six life-history traits (self-compatible vs. self-incompatible, autogamous vs. non-autogamous, specialized vs. unspecialized ¯oral morphology, nectariferous vs. nectarless, monocarpic vs. polycarpic, herbaceous vs. woody) and two ecological conditions (presence in open vs. forested habitats and temperate vs. tropical biomes). Pollen limitation of species in contrasting categories was compared using non-parametric <b>tests</b> (<b>TIPs</b> analysis) and phylogenetically-independent contrasts (PICs). The results of TIPs and PICs analyses were generally congruent, although fewer signi®cant contrasts were evident with PICs, probably because of low statistical power.

Nonetheless, signi®cant variation in the degree of pollen limitation was demonstrated among seven angiosperm families suggesting some phylogenetic component to the phenomenon. With both TIPs and PICs, pollen limitation was less intense in self-compatible and autogamous species. TIPs analysis demonstrated that herbaceous, nectariferous, and temperate species {{were less likely to be}} pollen-limited, but using PICs this could only be corroborated for those that were self-incompatible.

40|$|Tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 {{residues}} (TIP 39) is a neuropeptide localized to neural circuits subserving emotional processing. Recent work {{showed that}} mice with null mutation for the gene coding TIP 39 (TIP 39 -KO mice) display increased susceptibility to environmental provocation. Based on this stressor-dependent phenotype, the neuroanatomical distribution of TIP 39, and knowledge that novelty-induced arousal modulates memory functions via noradrenergic activation, {{we hypothesized that}} exposure to a novel environment differently affects memory performance of mice with or without TIP 39 signaling, potentially by differences in sensitivity of the noradrenergic system. We <b>tested</b> <b>TIP</b> 39 -KO mice and mice with null mutation of its receptor, the parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH 2 -R), in tasks of short-term declarative and social memory (object recognition and social recognition tests, respectively), and of working memory (Y-maze test) under conditions of novelty-induced arousal or acclimation to the test conditions. Mice lacking TIP 39 signaling demonstrated memory impairment selectively under conditions of novelty-induced arousal. Acute administration of a PTH 2 -R antagonist in wild-type mice had a similar effect. The restoration of memory functions in TIP 39 -KO mice after injection of a β-adrenoreceptor-blocker, propranolol, suggested involvement of the noradrenergic system. Collectively, {{these results suggest that}} the TIP 39 /PTH 2 -R system modulates the effects of novelty exposure on memory performance, potentially by acting on noradrenergic signaling...|$|R
