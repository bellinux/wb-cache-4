Fluorine doped {{tin oxide}} (FTO) thin film was {{prepared}} by using two different precursor solutions which are <b>tin</b> (ii) <b>chloride</b> dihydrate and <b>tin</b> (iv) <b>chloride</b> pentahydrate. These two precursors {{are used in}} spray pyrolysis method to compare which one can give the best performance to be applied as transparent conducting oxide. In order to clarify the characteristic of FTO thin film, surface morphology of the thin film was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM).

Two point probe I-V measurement and UV-Vis spectroscopy were used to study the electrical and optical properties of both films. Both precursors produced different particles distribution, electrical properties and also optical properties.

The true relation, however, of conduction and decomposition in those bodies governed by the general law which it is the object of this paper to establish, can only be satisfactorily made out from a far more extensive series of observations than those I have yet been able to supply[A].|$|E

5000|$|For many salts, {{the exact}} bonding {{of the water}} is {{unimportant}} because the water molecules are labilized upon dissolution. For example, an aqueous solution prepared from CuSO4•5H2O and anhydrous CuSO4 behave identically. Therefore, knowledge {{of the degree of}} hydration is important only for determining the equivalent weight: one mole of CuSO4•5H2O weighs more than one mole of CuSO4. In some cases, the degree of hydration can be critical to the resulting chemical properties. For example, anhydrous RhCl3 is not soluble in water and is relatively useless in organometallic chemistry whereas RhCl3•3H2O is versatile. Similarly, hydrated AlCl3 is a poor Lewis acid and thus inactive as a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts reactions. Samples of AlCl3 must therefore be protected from atmospheric moisture to preclude the formation of hydrates.Crystals of hydrated copper(II) sulfate consist of Cu(H2O)42+ centers linked to SO42− ions. Copper is surrounded by six oxygen atoms, provided by two different sulfate groups and four molecules of water. A fifth water resides elsewhere in the framework but does not bind directly to copper. [...] The cobalt chloride mentioned above occurs as Co(H2O)62+ and Cl−. In <b>tin</b> <b>chloride,</b> each Sn(II) center is pyramidal (mean O/Cl-Sn-O/Cl angle is 83°) being bound to two chloride ions and one water. The second water in the formula unit is hydrogen-bonded to the chloride and to the coordinated water molecule. Water of crystallization is stabilized by electrostatic attractions, consequently hydrates are common for salts that contain +2 and +3 cations as well as −2 anions. In some cases, the majority of the weight of a compound arises from water. Glauber's salt, Na2SO4(H2O)10, is a white crystalline solid with greater than 50% water by weight.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} novel {{synthesis}} of ZnO nanorods with hexagonal pyramid-like heads {{by a simple}} and low cost technique of spray pyrolysis {{with the help of}} zinc acetate and <b>tin</b> (IV) <b>chloride</b> pentahydrate precursors. In the present study, the growth of ZnO nanorods is optimized by varying a number of sprays and annealing temperatures in the synthesis process. FESEM analysis reveals that ZnO nanorods are observed when the number of sprays exceeds 150 and film-like structure is observed below 150 sprays. Nanorods are formed when the molar ratio of zinc acetate to <b>tin</b> (IV) <b>chloride</b> pentahydrate in the solution mixture is 3 : 1. The optimum annealed temperature for the growth of nanorods is determined to be 350 degrees C. The length and diameter of the vertically aligned nanorods are in the range of 1 - 3 mu m and 80 nm, respectively. XRD diffraction patterns and HRTEM analysis confirm that the ZnO nanorods are single crystals with a preferred growth direction of 0 0 0 1. The effect of various growth parameters including molar ratio of zinc acetate to <b>tin</b> (IV) <b>chloride</b> pentahydrate in the mixture, number of sprays and annealing temperatures on the growth of ZnO nanorods are systematically studied. A plausible growth mechanism for hexagonal pyramidal heads of ZnO nanorods is discussed. These ZnO nanorods with hexagonal pyramid tips have potential application in photovoltaic devices.
