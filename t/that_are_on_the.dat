25|$|Until recently, the X and Y {{chromosomes}} {{were thought}} to have diverged around 300 million years ago. However, research published in 2010, and particularly research published in 2008 documenting the sequencing of the platypus genome, {{has suggested that the}} XY sex-determination system would not have been present more than 166 million years ago, at the split of the monotremes from other mammals. This re-estimation of the age of the therian XY system is based on the finding that sequences <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> X chromosomes of marsupials and eutherian mammals are present on the autosomes of platypus and birds. The older estimate was based on erroneous reports that the platypus X chromosomes contained these sequences.|$|E
25|$|Seventy of the 270 London Underground {{stations}} use buildings <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest, {{and five}} have entrances in listed buildings. The Metropolitan Railway's original seven stations {{were inspired by}} Italianate designs, with the platforms lit by daylight from above and by gas lights in large glass globes. Early District Railway stations were similar and on both railways the further from central London the station the simpler the construction. The City & South London Railway opened with red-brick buildings, designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis, topped with a lead-covered dome that contained the lift mechanism. The Central London Railway appointed Harry Bell Measures as architect, who designed its pinkish-brown steel-framed buildings with larger entrances.|$|E

25|$|The outlay of the {{buildings}} is three stories on Balcarce Street and four storys plus a basement/galleries of Government House Museum, on Avenida Paseo Colón, practically covering the footage of a whole bloc. All the original rooms <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> three main façades have direct ventilation and lighting, while the original internal rooms were designed {{in such a way}} that ventilation and light should come from the loggia that surround internal patios designed for this purpose. All, except one, were crowned by skylights, of which only two remain. The original structure consists of packwalls of varying thickness and slabs supported by brick counter ceilings with steel or wood roof lines, according to the sector. Following a long process of construction the current building was officially inaugurated in 1898, during the second presidency of General Julio Roca.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} {{stations are}} located virtually {{on the edge}} of the city, and one, Devyatkino, is territorially in Leningrad Oblast, far away from the harsh underground geology that forms the Neva Delta. The three shallow column stations that are located in the southwestern section of the city and are all on the Kirovsko-Vyborgskaya Line. The first one, Avtovo is considered to be one of the most beautiful stations in the world and was opened as part of the first stage in 1955, while the other two were built in the late 1970s as typical Moscow-style pillar trispan stations. In addition, there are four termini stations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface and are located near the lines' connection with the train depots. The city's northern climate means that even here all of the station space is inside an enclosed structure.|$|E
25|$|SCNT {{is seen as}} a good {{method for}} {{producing}} agriculture animals for food consumption. It successfully cloned sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Another benefit is SCNT {{is seen as a}} solution to clone endangered species <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verge of going extinct. However, stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus can be enormous, which led to a high loss in resulting cells in early research. For example, the cloned sheep Dolly was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood. As the procedure could not be automated, and had to be performed manually under a microscope, SCNT was very resource intensive. The biochemistry involved in reprogramming the differentiated somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from being well understood. However, by 2014 researchers were reporting cloning success rates of seven to eight out of ten and in 2016, a Korean Company Sooam Biotech was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos per day.|$|E

500|$|Green roofs: Green roofs {{are another}} method of {{decreasing}} the urban heat island effect. Green roofery is {{the practice of}} having vegetation on a roof; such as having trees or a garden. The plants <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof [...] increase the albedo and decreases the urban heat island effect. This method has been studied and criticized {{for the fact that}} green roofs are affected by climatic conditions, green roof variables are hard to measure, and are very complex systems ...|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{watershed}} of Messers Run is on rock of the Mauch Chunk Formation. This rock formation consists of siltstone, sandstone, grayish-red shale, and conglomerate. However, areas <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pottsville Formation are scattered throughout {{the watershed}}, mainly along its southern and northern edges. This rock formation is especially common in the sub-watershed of Negro Hollow and near {{the upper reaches of}} [...] "Trib 27609 To Messers Run". The Pottsville Formation contains claystone, limestone, conglomerate, shale, and gray sandstone.|$|E

The bridge is [...] long and holds one single lane of Skinners Falls Road, a local road. The bridge was {{constructed by the}} American Bridge Company and funded by the Milanville Bridge Company. The bridge replaced a ferry run by raftsman Daniel Skinner and his family. The bridge opened in 1902 and remains in service today. It {{is one of several}} bridges in Sullivan County <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> National Register of Historic Places, including the Roebling Aqueduct and Pond Eddy Bridge.|$|E

500|$|Spotnitz {{later called}} the episode [...] "personal". He {{noted that the}} cards that hang on Padgett's wall were put up to emulate the {{original}} writing style of The X-Files, saying, [...] "in fact, that the cards <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> writer’s wall are the same format that we wrote The X-Files in. We would use those same cards when figuring out stories for the series." [...] Later, Spotnitz noted that the cards were also in his handwriting [...] "because the prop guy couldn’t do {{it as well as}} we could because that’s really the way we did it. It’s a very emotional love story and it’s really about our love for these characters as writers".

Green Day went into the studio to begin recording songs for a new album on February 14, 2012. Eventually, the band announced the release of albums ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré!. The official confirmation of the song came {{with the release of}} the [...] track listing of their album ¡Uno! on June 26, 2012.|$|E
500|$|Main-sequence {{stars are}} called dwarf stars, but this {{terminology}} is partly historical {{and can be}} somewhat confusing. For the cooler stars, dwarfs such as red dwarfs, orange dwarfs, and yellow dwarfs are indeed much smaller and dimmer than other stars of those colors. However, for hotter blue and white stars, the size and brightness difference between so-called [...] "dwarf" [...] stars <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main sequence and the so-called [...] "giant" [...] stars that are not becomes smaller; for the hottest stars it is not directly observable. For those stars the terms [...] "dwarf" [...] and [...] "giant" [...] refer to differences in spectral lines which indicate if a star is on the main sequence or off it. [...] Nevertheless, very hot main-sequence stars are still sometimes called dwarfs, {{even though they have}} roughly the same size and brightness as the [...] "giant" [...] stars of that temperature.|$|E
