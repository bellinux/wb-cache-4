Shoup's biographer Howard Jablon wrote that Shoup was Kennedy's favorite general. In turn, Shoup {{was the most}} supportive of Kennedy of all of <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff.</b> Kennedy had asked Shoup to remain as Commandant {{for a second term}} in 1963, but Shoup declined in order to allow the advancement of other Marine generals.|$|E

5|$|At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> {{approved}} {{the latest version}} of General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly heavy bomber aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. By July 1943, the Joint Chiefs were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul, but the navy would still need a forward fleet base. The Admiralty Islands, already a part of the Elkton plan, could serve this purpose, as they contained flat areas for airstrips, space for military installations, and Seeadler Harbour, which was large enough to accommodate a naval task force. On 6 August 1943, <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> adopted a plan that called for the neutralisation rather than the capture of Rabaul, and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff,</b> General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.|$|E

5|$|During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, {{a number}} of naval {{officers}} publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman.
