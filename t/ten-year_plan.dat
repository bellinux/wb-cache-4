With demands for infrastructure improvements {{coming in from}} all over the colony, Nkrumah approved it in general, but halved the time to five years. The colony was in good financial shape, with reserves from years of cocoa profit held in London, and Nkrumah was able to spend freely. Modern trunk roads were built along the coast and within the interior. The rail system was modernised and expanded. Modern water and sewer systems were installed in most towns, where housing schemes were begun. Construction began on a new harbour at Tema, near Accra, and the existing port, at Takoradi, was expanded. An urgent programme to build and expand schools, from primary to teacher and trade training, was begun. From 1951 to 1956, the number of pupils being educated at the colony's schools rose from 200,000 to 500,000. Nevertheless, the number of graduates being produced was insufficient to the burgeoning civil service's needs, and in 1953, Nkrumah announced that though Africans would be given preference, the country would be relying on expatriate European civil servants for several years.|$|E

The effect of the change was to increase the administrative overhead of the army, with no corresponding increase in effectiveness; new technology, tanks, motor vehicles and wireless communications were slow to arrive and were inferior to those of potential enemies. The dilution of the officer class to find extra unit staffs, was made worse by the politicisation of the army and the addition of Blackshirt Militia. The reforms also promoted frontal assaults to the exclusion of other theories, dropping the emphasis on fast mobile warfare backed by artillery.|$|E

40|$|The Department of Defense is fielding the V- 22 Osprey tilt-rotor {{aircraft}} in the Marine Corps and Air Force. Marine Medium Tilt-rotor Training Squadron 204 (VMMT- 204) in Jacksonville, North Carolina, is the sole Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) for initial V- 22 training, and planners must develop pilot training schedules that support service goals without exceeding VMMT- 204 resources. Currently, planners manually create FRS training schedules with monthly fidelity, guided by past analysis and personal experience. However, manual methods are cumbersome and provide few measures of resource utilization. Marine planners need a decision support tool to automate V- 22 FRS scheduling, given transition guidance. This thesis introduces an optimization model that takes as input Marine Corps operational requirements, Air Force and Marine annual training goals, ERS training syllabus requirements and resources available, and a prioritization scheme to resolve conflicts between competing goals. The output is a schedule of training classes identified by unit, FRS syllabus and follow-on training, and class convening date (with half-month fidelity) over a <b>ten-year</b> <b>planning</b> horizon. The model uses Microsoft Excel to input data and automate output reports for training goals, resource utilization, and training possibilities with unscheduled resources.
