500|$|Bono {{continued}} making crank {{calls as}} MacPhisto, but the targets {{changed with the}} location of each concert. Many of them were local politicians that Bono wished to mock by engaging them in character as the devil. He enjoyed making these calls, saying, [...] "When you're dressed as the Devil, your conversation is immediately loaded, so if you <b>tell</b> <b>somebody</b> you really like what they're doing, you know it's not a compliment." [...] The band intended for MacPhisto to add humour while making a point. Said the Edge, [...] "That character was a great device for saying {{the opposite of what}} you meant. It made the point so easily and with real humor." [...] A female Cardiff fan who was pulled on-stage questioned Bono's motives for dressing as the devil, prompting the singer to compare his act to the plot of the C. S. Lewis novel The Screwtape Letters.|$|E

5000|$|Recently, a Ukrainian {{word for}} this gesture [...] "дуля" [...] (dulya) {{has also become}} a jargon to refer to Control-Alt-Delete. ("...you need three fingers to press the buttons. So it's like <b>telling</b> <b>somebody</b> (a {{computer}} in this case) to get lost.") ...|$|R

50|$|Telling {{the past}} {{does not mean}} <b>telling</b> <b>somebody</b> to follow traditions. Traditions subject the {{individual}} to follow patterns which may cause more damage than good. Retelling the past is another thing. It is never pure repetition but interpretation. Transmission takes the present into consideration when turning one's attention to the past. Without transmission all we have is nostalgia.|$|R
60|$|Robinson's eyes dilated with honest pride. This was good. This {{was better}} than he had looked for. Not only were they unaware of the burglary, but they had not even an idea as to the recent event which had made the First room so fit a hunting-ground for the burgling industry. There are few {{pleasure}}s keener than the pleasure of <b>telling</b> <b>somebody</b> something he didn't know before.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said. [...] "I feel I {{ought to}} <b>tell</b> <b>somebody,</b> {{because it may}} turn out rather a serious undertaking. One reason for {{choosing}} you is that it's a complicated and unlikely tale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot say. I {{tell you}} this, Lady Ushant, because I must <b>tell</b> <b>somebody</b> in this house. I have behaved very badly to Mr. Morton, and Lord Rufford is {{behaving}} as badly to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ma was <b>telling</b> <b>somebody</b> {{that she}} heard that Mrs. Kennicott claimed she made forty dollars a week {{when she was on}} some job in the Cities, and Ma says she knows posolutely that she never made but {{eighteen}} a week--Ma says that when she's lived here a while she won't go round making a fool of herself, pulling that bighead stuff on folks that know a whole lot more than she does. They're all laughing up their sleeves at her." ...|$|R

50|$|A {{modified}} {{weight scale}} called as Tairyo Haibun Kei (体量配分計) (body mass distribution meter) {{is used to}} <b>tell</b> <b>somebody's</b> taiheki. The scale's platform is divided into left and right parts for both legs, {{and each of the}} parts is further divided into 3 parts: frontal right, frontal left, and rear parts. Thus one stands over the 6 parts of the platform. When he makes postures, such as brace and forward-bending position, the scale gives data of biased balance of his weight in certain direction for each posture. According to Noguchi, each taiheki has a distinct tendency of biased balance of weight in each posture. One can hence determine somebody's taiheki based on the collected data.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} think it's strange, my telling you this," [...] he said. [...] "It {{has come to}} the point," [...] he {{declared}} vehemently, [...] "where it relieves me to <b>tell</b> <b>somebody,</b> and you seem to be a man of discretion and common-sense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{dead man}} {{is of no}} use on a plantation. Don't {{you want to know}} about me? My vanity is hurt. Here am I, just through my first shipwreck; and here are you, not the least bit curious, talking about your miserable plantation. Can't you see that I am just {{bursting}} to <b>tell</b> <b>somebody,</b> anybody, about my shipwreck?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, I know, but--but--there is {{something}} else." [...] Plum dropped {{his hands in}} his face. [...] "I don't know how I am going to tell you, but I want to <b>tell</b> <b>somebody.</b> It's been on my mind ever since it happened." [...] And then, to Dave's amazement, Gus Plum threw himself across the bed and began to sob violently.|$|E

2500|$|Despite Carruthers {{comments}} about the Zach and Reese relationship, Reese passionately engages in a kiss with Zach the same day of The Advocate February 12, 2009 interview, the night before Reese and Bianca's wedding. Carruthers explained, [...] "The night before the wedding when Kendall, Zach’s wife, nails her with a backhanded toast, Reese gets a little drunk, {{and the person who}} consoles her is Zach." [...] Carruthers described it as a moment where she kisses him and then realizes, [...] "Oh, my god, what the heck am I doing? The person I love is Bianca, and the person you love is Kendall. What just happened?" [...] That moment, said Carruthers, is what unravels Reese's world and [...] "where someone <b>tells</b> <b>somebody</b> and it grows bigger than it ever was".|$|R
5000|$|Bataille {{drew from}} diverse {{influences}} and used various modes of discourse {{to create his}} work. His novel Story of the Eye (Histoire de l'oeil), published under the pseudonym Lord Auch (literally, Lord [...] "to the shithouse" [...] — [...] "auch" [...] being short for [...] "aux chiottes," [...] slang for <b>telling</b> <b>somebody</b> off by sending him to the toilet), was initially read as pure pornography, while interpretation of the work has gradually matured to reveal the same considerable philosophical and emotional depth that is characteristic of other writers who have been categorized within [...] "literature of transgression". The imagery {{of the novel is}} built upon a series of metaphors which in turn refer to philosophical constructs developed in his work: the eye, the egg, the sun, the earth, the testicle.|$|R
6000|$|There was a {{sound of}} running to and fro and voices saying this, {{that and the other}} thing about Kipps. Ring-a-dinger, ring-a-dinger went the dinner bell all unheeded.

60|$|She dug {{away at the}} red plush {{with the}} hatpin, picking out little bits and {{dropping}} them over the edge. I {{could see she was}} bracing herself to put me wise to the whole trouble. There's a time comes when things aren't going right, and you've had all you can stand, when you have got to <b>tell</b> <b>somebody</b> about it, no matter who it is.|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” said Appleby, {{closing the}} {{bag with a}} snap. “I fancy it would. Still, {{there will be no}} defendant, because I’m going out of the country. If you sent to the bank you might lend me fifty pounds, and <b>tell</b> <b>somebody</b> to get the dog‐cart out. There’s a train I can get through to Liverpool starts in an hour. If I am ever able, I’ll send you back the money.” ...|$|E

5000|$|With the 1970s being {{difficult}} for singers {{clinging to the}} pre-rock American songbook, Hartman turned to playing cocktail lounges in New York City and Chicago. Recording again with small labels such as Perception and Musicor, Hartman produced music of mixed quality as he attempted {{to be viewed as}} a more versatile vocalist. Referring to his approach to interpreting a song, Hartman said, [...] "Well, to me a lyric is a story, almost like talking, <b>telling</b> <b>somebody</b> a story, try to make it believable.” When he returned to the jazz combo format of his earlier albums, Hartman recorded Once in Every Life for Bee Hive, which earned him a 1981 Grammy nomination for Best Male Jazz Vocalist. This was quickly followed up by his last album of newly recorded material titled This One's for Tedi as a tribute to his wife Theodora.|$|R

6000|$|... "I know,--or fancy that I know,--that so {{many men}} love me! But, after all, what sort of love is it? It is just as when you and I, when we see {{something}} nice in a shop, call it a dear duck of a thing, and <b>tell</b> <b>somebody</b> to go and buy it, let the price be ever so extravagant. I know my own position, Laura. I'm a dear duck of a thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonder if {{that had}} {{anything}} to do with a story Bill Daws told me an hour ago," [...] said he. [...] "Bill works at the mill clown by the river.
