5|$|En {{route to}} a {{classified}} S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, tensions among <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> are high due to poor communication during the fight. This concerns Reyes, who decides to double-cross Coulson and secure the 0-8-4 for her government. Together, <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> devise a plan to activate the weapon, blowing {{a hole in the}} Bus. The drop in pressure opens the interior doors, allowing <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> to subdue the soldiers. At the facility, Reyes and her men are incarcerated and the 0-8-4 is launched into the sun in a rocket. The team watch the launch together, celebrating their combined efforts, while Ward agrees to supervise Skye's S.H.I.E.L.D. training. Skye secretly confirms her allegiance to the hacktivist group the Rising Tide.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>agents</b> later see Walter Chaco, Paula's {{grandfather}} and the plant's owner, who while shaken over Paula's death gives <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> permission {{to perform an}} autopsy. <b>The</b> <b>agents</b> find that while Paula's personnel file gives her age as 47, she appears no older than her mid-20's. They also discover that Paula suffered from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, a rare and fatal illness that causes dementia. When <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> nearly collide with a Chaco Chicken truck, they learn that the driver also suffered from the disease. Noticing the plant's blood-red runoff in a nearby stream, Mulder orders a reluctant Sheriff Arens to dredge it. They quickly find the bones of nine people, including Kearns. While inspecting the skeletal remains, <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> notice that the skeletons are all missing their skulls, and that the bones {{appear to have been}} boiled. Meanwhile, Randolph and Harold discuss the uncovered bones and increase of Creutzfeldt–Jakob cases. While Randolph complains about Chaco's inaction, Harold assures him that he will talk to Chaco.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by the FBI's presence, Zero visits Oswald at {{his home}} that night; a drunk and rowdy Oswald dismisses Zero's worries and summons {{lightning}} to strike down nearby cattle. The lightning strikes him instead, but he appears unharmed. The next day, <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> visit the scene and find a melted shoe print in the ground, linking it to Oswald. Meanwhile, Oswald uses his abilities to manipulate local traffic lights, causing a car accident. <b>The</b> <b>agents</b> visit Oswald's home and find a cut-out picture of Sharon Kiveat, Oswald's former high school teacher, inside a porn magazine.|$|E
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> is risk-neutral {{and there}} are no bounds on {{transfer}} payments, the fact that <b>the</b> <b>agent's</b> effort is unobservable (i.e., it is a [...] "hidden action") does not pose a problem. In this case, the same outcome can be achieved that would be attained with verifiable effort: <b>The</b> <b>agent</b> chooses <b>the</b> so-called [...] "first-best" [...] effort level that maximizes the expected total surplus of the two parties. Specifically, the principal can give the realized output to <b>the</b> <b>agent,</b> but let <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> make a fixed up-front payment. <b>The</b> <b>agent</b> is then a [...] "residual claimant" [...] and will maximize the expected total surplus minus the fixed payment. Hence, the first-best effort level maximizes <b>the</b> <b>agent's</b> payoff, and <b>the</b> fixed payment can be chosen such that in equilibrium <b>the</b> <b>agent's</b> expected payoff equals his or her reservation utility (which is what <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> would get if no contract was written). Yet, if <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> is risk-averse, there is a trade-off between incentives and insurance. Moreover, if <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> is risk-neutral but wealth-constrained, <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> cannot make <b>the</b> fixed up-front payment to the principal, so the principal must leave a [...] "limited liability rent" [...] to <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> earns more than his or her reservation utility).|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} can sue <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> for liability {{caused by}} <b>the</b> <b>agent's</b> wrongful acts, i.e. if {{a third party}} obtained a judgment against the principal for wrongful acts caused by <b>the</b> <b>agent,</b> <b>the</b> principal can sue <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> to recover <b>the</b> loss.|$|R
5000|$|Intentions: Intentions {{represent}} the deliberative state of <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> - what <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> {{has chosen to}} do. Intentions are desires to which <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> has to some extent committed. In implemented systems, this means <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> has begun executing a plan.|$|R

5|$|Brodeur visits Speranza in his cell, {{and offers}} {{to have his}} death {{sentence}} commuted in exchange for stopping the murders. Speranza takes the offer. That night, Parmelly visits Danielle, who has become agitated since Mulder and Scully have begun staking out her house. <b>The</b> <b>agents</b> now suspect Parmelly to be behind the murders and leave to notify Brodeur, who asks that Parmelly be arrested. Soon afterward, Danielle wakes up to see Neech standing by her room door. She grabs her gun and confronts Parmelly, thinking he is Neech's resurrected form. <b>The</b> <b>agents</b> and a police task force arrive to see her shoot and kill Parmelly. Meanwhile, Brodeurassuming that Charez and Parmelly were on the listthinks Speranza has reneged on their deal and has him taken to the showers. Before Brodeur kills him, Speranza claims that one person remains on the list.|$|E
5|$|Caudillos like Facundo Quiroga are seen, at the {{beginning}} of the book, as the antithesis of education, high culture, and civil stability; barbarism was like a never ending litany of social ills. They are <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> of instability and chaos, destroying societies through their blatant disregard for humanity and social progress.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{delegation}} contract of a risky activity under {{the presence of}} adverse selection and moral hazard. The problem is posed as providing incentives from the principal to <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> to enhance <b>the</b> protective action of <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> through payment schemes. Given non-bankruptcy of both the principal and <b>the</b> <b>agent,</b> <b>the</b> principal rewards <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> if no accident occurs but penalizes <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> if an accident occurs. Given bankruptcy of either the principal or <b>the</b> <b>agent,</b> regardless of <b>the</b> <b>agent's</b> risk type, <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> is only rewarded with {{the same amount of}} remuneration and not penalized if the accident occurs. The social welfare level resulting from contracting processes depends on the asset levels of both parties and <b>the</b> <b>agent's</b> technology to reduce risks of the activity.

50|$|Suvorov {{explained}} that new agents were separated from official Soviet institutions only after <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> has compromised himself by giving Soviet Intelligence a significant quantity of secret material; {{making it impossible}} for <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> to go to the police. <b>The</b> separated <b>agent</b> then occupies one of three guises: <b>the</b> separated acting <b>agent,</b> <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> group and <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> residency.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} asymmetric awareness {{into the}} classical principal-agent model and discusses the optimal contract between a fully aware principal and an unaware <b>agent.</b> <b>The</b> principal enlarges <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> awareness strategically when proposing the contract. He faces a trade off between participation and incentives. Leaving <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> unaware {{allows him to}} exploit <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> incomplete understanding of the world. Making <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> aware enables <b>the</b> principal to use the revealed contingencies as signals about <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> action choice. <b>The</b> optimal contract reveals contingencies that have low probability but are highly informative about <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> effort...|$|R
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{learns that}} she has a {{cancerous}} tumor between her sinus and cerebrum. She initially tells only Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) of the diagnosis, and is determined to continue to work. <b>The</b> <b>agents</b> head to Allentown, Pennsylvania to see Betsy Hagopian, a Mutual UFO Network member who was previously discovered to be suffering from similar symptoms. <b>The</b> <b>agents</b> learn that Betsy has died, yet find someone using her phone line. They trace the call to Kurt Crawford (David Lovgren), a fellow MUFON member. Crawford tells them that {{all but one of the}} MUFON members Scully previously met have died of cancer. Scully is skeptical of Mulder and Crawford's claims that a government conspiracy and her abduction are behind her illness.|$|E
5|$|Hearing noise, Mulder heads {{outside and}} {{witnesses}} a UFO flying overhead; inside, small beings run past Scully. Cars full of armed soldiers arrive, forcing <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> to flee. <b>The</b> <b>agents</b> meet with Skinner at a diner in rural Maryland. Skinner wants {{to turn over}} the tape in exchange for their reinstatement and safety. After initially objecting, Mulder agrees to let Skinner turn the tape over. Skinner heads to see Melissa in the hospital and is told by Albert of the mysterious blue-suited man outside. Skinner chases the man to a stairwell where he is attacked by Alex Krycek and Luis Cardinal, who beat him unconscious and steal the tape.|$|E
5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. <b>The</b> <b>agents</b> report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He also seems to know that someone else is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> {{substantially}} performs <b>the</b> mandate, <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> {{is entitled}} to remuneration even though the principal negligently or intentionally fails to take {{the benefit of the}} services. Even if <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> has not completed <b>the</b> mandate, <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> {{is entitled to}} remuneration where prevented by the wrongful act or dolus of the principal from so doing. Likewise, <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> is entitled to commission where the transaction was completed by another person, but <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> performed <b>the</b> acts that were the efficient cause, or causa causans, of the transaction, although not, of course, if <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> services were not the efficient cause of the transaction.|$|R
30|$|Boredom is {{dependent}} on <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> motivational state; it increases while <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> remains inactive and decreases while <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> is engaged in any sort of activity.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{substantial}} performance by <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> where, for example, the principal instructs <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> to sell land, and <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> sells <b>the</b> land {{to a person}} prohibited by law from purchasing it. In such a case, <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> is not entitled to any remuneration. Nor is <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> entitled to commission where the principal is willing to sell the property for a fixed sum, free of commission, and <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> sells <b>the</b> property for the fixed sum only. In the case of estate <b>agents,</b> <b>the</b> usual agreement is that <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> is entitled to commission if the principal actually enters into a contract with a person introduced by <b>the</b> <b>agent.</b> An agent cannot claim commission for the mere introduction of a person {{willing and able to}} contract on the principal’s terms, unless an agreement to that effect is proved. In the case of a mandate “to find a purchaser,” <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> commission is usually payable on completion of a valid sale.|$|R
5|$|Investigating further, Mulder and Scully {{learn that}} Fiore, Barbala, Felder and Morris had all worked closely {{together}} in the past. They also find that Fiore's wife Anita keeps a collection of origami animals made by her first husband—Charlie Morris. Anita tells <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> that Fiore hasn't returned home from the previous night; meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> find that pages are missing from the file on Morris' murder, and Fiore {{was the last one}} to have checked the file out.|$|E
5|$|Krycek leads <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> to Dulles International Airport, {{where they}} try to {{apprehend}} a second courier carrying a diplomatic pouch from Russia. The courier leads <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> on a pursuit through the airport, but drops the pouch before escaping. The pouch is revealed to carry a seemingly unremarkable rock. Mulder has Krycek confined at the high rise apartment of Assistant Director Walter Skinner before having the rock analyzed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Dr. Sacks, a NASA scientist, tells Mulder and Scully that the rock is a prehistoric meteorite fragment that might contain fossilized alien bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{determine}} {{that one of}} the dead men belonged to an Islamic terrorist group, the Isfahan, and using the ATM video are able to track down Lauren. A screenshot of the video reveals a blurry figure who appears to be Howard Graves. <b>The</b> <b>agents</b> meet with Lauren at her home and after initially denying it, she admits to the incident but knows nothing about the murders. Upon leaving, <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> find their car going out of control on its own, leading it to crash into another car.

40|$|We study optimal {{incentives}} in a principal-agent {{problem in}} which <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> outside option is determined endogenously {{in a competitive}} labor market. In equilibrium, strong performance increases <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> market value. When this value becomes sufficiently high, the threat of <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> quitting forces <b>the</b> principal to give <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> a raise. <b>The</b> prospect of obtaining this raise gives <b>the</b> <b>agent</b> an incentive to exert effort, which reduces the need for standard incentives, like bonuses. In fact, whenever <b>the</b> <b>agent’s</b> option to quit is close to being “in the money, ” the market-induced incentive completely {{eliminates the need for}} standard incentives...|$|R
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{travel to}} NASA and meet Belt, a {{childhood}} hero of Mulder's.

He allows <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> to watch the launch from Mission Control. The launch is successful. As <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> are leaving however, Generoo informs them that contact is lost with the shuttle in orbit.

5|$|Mulder {{is found}} {{by a group}} of Russian peasants, who help him to return to America, and rejoins his partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson).

Sercey remained in the East Indies, refitting his ships and joining his squadron to that already at Île de France. This force he divided, sending Preneuse and a corvette to patrol the Mozambique Channel. The remaining six frigates, comprising Vertu, Régénérée, Forte, Seine, Prudente and Cybèle, with the privateer schooner Alerte, Sercey took eastwards on 14 July, towards the Bay of Bengal.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>Agent</b> {{has acted}} without actual authority, but the Principal is {{nevertheless}} bound because <b>the</b> <b>Agent</b> had apparent authority, <b>the</b> <b>Agent</b> {{is liable to}} indemnify the Principal for any resulting loss or damage.|$|R
50|$|Beneath the {{knowledge}} level resides the symbol level.

5|$|Scully, who doesn't want {{to abandon}} her Christmas plans, follows Mulder {{into the house}} to {{retrieve}} her car keys from him, and {{the door to the}} mansion slams shut. Inside the house, <b>the</b> <b>agents</b> experience strange phenomena: creaks are heard in the ceiling from the upper floor, and the shadow {{in the form of an}} old woman in a nightgown is seen, among other occurrences. Mulder and Scully reluctantly decide to investigate the floor above them. There, they find a massive library storing two corpses that have the same clothes and hairstyles as <b>the</b> <b>agents,</b> along with two gunshot wounds. They decide to go search other rooms, only to find that every door they walk through is the same library room they first entered. They then decide to split up, hoping to find a way out of the room.|$|E
5|$|Ten years later, Dana Scully shows Fox Mulder a {{videotape}} of a religious service led by the now-grown Samuel (Scott Bairstow), who has become an evangelical faith healer for a ministry run by Calvin.
