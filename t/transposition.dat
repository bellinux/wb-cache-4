5|$|She {{observed}} {{the effects of}} the <b>transposition</b> of Ac and Ds by the changing patterns of coloration in maize kernels over generations of controlled crosses, and described {{the relationship between the two}} loci through intricate microscopic analysis. She concluded that Ac controls the <b>transposition</b> of the Ds from chromosome9, and that the movement of Ds is accompanied by the breakage of the chromosome. When Ds moves, the aleurone-color gene is released from the suppressing effect of the Ds and transformed into the active form, which initiates the pigment synthesis in cells. The <b>transposition</b> of Ds in different cells is random, it may move in some but not others, which causes color mosaicism. The size of the colored spot on the seed is determined by stage of the seed development during dissociation. McClintock also found that the <b>transposition</b> of Ds is determined by the number of Ac copies in the cell.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently, a new {{approach}} to analyze genomes evolving which is based on comparision of gene orders versus traditional comparision of DNA sequences was proposed (Sankoff et al. 1992). The approach is based on the global rearrangements (e. g., inversions and <b>transpositions</b> of fragments). Analysis of genomes evolving by inversions and <b>transpositions</b> leads to a combinatorial problem of sorting by reversals and <b>transpositions,</b> i. e., sorting of a permutation using reversals and <b>transpositions</b> of arbitrary fragments. We study sorting of signed permutations by reversals and <b>transpositions,</b> a problem which adequately models genome rearrangements, as the genes in DNA are oriented.

5|$|Clarinets {{have the}} largest pitch range of common woodwinds. The {{intricate}} key organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range {{is defined by the}} keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the <b>transposition</b> of the instrument in question. The nominal highest note of the B clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest note of the oboe.

The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and <b>transposition</b> can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E
5|$|McClintock {{was widely}} {{credited}} with discovering <b>transposition</b> after other researchers finally discovered {{the process in}} bacteria, yeast, and bacteriophages in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, molecular biology had developed significant new technology, and scientists were able to show the molecular basis for <b>transposition.</b> In the 1970s, Ac and Ds were cloned by other scientists and were shown to be Class II transposons. Ac is a complete transposon that can produce a functional transposase, which {{is required for the}} element to move within the genome. Ds has a mutation in its transposase gene, which means that it cannot move without another source of transposase. Thus, as McClintock observed, Ds cannot move in the absence of Ac. Spm has also been characterized as a transposon. Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed under stress, such as by irradiation or the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution. McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before other researchers grasped the concept. Nowadays, Ac/Ds is used as a tool in plant biology to generate mutant plants used for the characterization of gene function.|$|E

The product of two odd or two even permutations is even and the product of an odd permutation with an even permutation is odd.

5|$|Messiaen {{continually}} evolved new composition techniques, always integrating {{them into}} his existing musical style; his final works still retain the use of modes of limited <b>transposition.</b> For many commentators this continual development made every major work from the Quatuor onwards a conscious summation of all that Messiaen had composed up to that time. However, very few of these major works lack new technical ideas—simple examples being the introduction of communicable language in Meditations, the invention of a new percussion instrument (the geophone) for Des canyons aux etoiles..., and the freedom from any synchronisation with the main pulse of individual parts in certain birdsong episodes of St. François d'Assise.|$|E
5|$|Messiaen used modes {{he called}} modes of limited <b>transposition.</b> They are {{distinguished}} as groups of notes {{that can only}} be transposed by a semitone a limited number of times. For example, the whole-tone scale (Messiaen's Mode 1) only exists in two transpositions: namely C–D–E–F–G–A and D–E–F–G–A–B. Messiaen abstracted these modes from the harmony of his improvisations and early works. Music written using the modes avoids conventional diatonic harmonic progressions, since for example Messiaen's Mode 2 (identical to the octatonic scale used also by other composers) permits precisely the dominant seventh chords whose tonic the mode does not contain.|$|E

In order to absolve himself of these back claims, Denny Fairfax renounced his appointments of Martin and Jones, and instead appointed Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron as the sole steward of the proprietary in an official <b>transposition</b> in London on September 21, 1784.|$|E

5|$|While {{technical}} {{improvements and}} an equal-tempered scale reduced {{the need for}} two clarinets, the technical difficulty of playing in remote keys persisted, and the A has thus remained a standard orchestral instrument. In addition, by the late 19th century, the orchestral clarinet repertoire contained so much music for clarinet in A that the disuse of this instrument was not practical. Attempts were made to standardise to the B instrument between 1930 and 1950 (e.g., tutors recommended learning routine <b>transposition</b> of orchestral A parts on the B clarinet, including solos written for A clarinet, and some manufacturers provided a low E on the B to match {{the range of the}} A), but this failed in the orchestral sphere.|$|E
5|$|In Garden Rain (1974, for brass ensemble), {{the limited}} and pitch-specific {{harmonic}} vocabulary of the Japanese mouth organ, the shō (see ex. 3), and its specific timbres, are clearly emulated in Takemitsu's writing for brass instruments; even similarities of performance practice can be seen, (the players are often required to hold notes {{to the limit}} of their breath capacity). In A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden, the characteristic timbres of the shō and its chords (several of which are simultaneous soundings of traditional Japanese pentatonic scales) are emulated in the opening held chords of the wind instruments (the first chord is in fact an exact <b>transposition</b> of the shō's chord, Jū (i); see ex. 3); meanwhile a solo oboe is assigned a melodic line that is similarly reminiscent of the lines played by the hichiriki in gagaku ensembles.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa's next project, Throne of Blood, an {{adaptation}} of William Shakespeare's Macbeth—set, like Seven Samurai, in the Sengoku Era—represented an ambitious <b>transposition</b> of the English work into a Japanese context. Kurosawa instructed his leading actress, Isuzu Yamada, to regard the work {{as if it were}} a cinematic version of a Japanese rather than a European literary classic. Given Kurosawa's appreciation of traditional Japanese stage acting, the acting of the players, particularly Yamada, draws heavily on the stylized techniques of the Noh theater. It was filmed in 1956 and released in January 1957 to a slightly less negative domestic response than had been the case with the director's previous film. Abroad, Throne of Blood, regardless of the liberties it takes with its source material, quickly earned a place among the most celebrated Shakespeare adaptations.|$|E

40|$|Genome rearrangements are {{large-scale}} evolutionary {{events that}} shuffle genomic architectures. The minimal {{number of such}} events between two genomes is often used in phylogenomic studies to measure the evolutionary distance between the genomes. Double-Cut-and-Join (DCJ) operations represent a convenient model of most common genome rearrangements (reversals, translocations, fissions, and fusions), while other genome rearrangements, such as <b>transpositions,</b> can be modeled by pairs of DCJs. Since the DCJ model does not directly account for <b>transpositions,</b> their impact on DCJ scenarios is unclear. In the present work, we study implicit appearance of <b>transpositions</b> (as pairs of DCJs) in DCJ scenarios. We consider shortest DCJ scenarios satisfying the maximum parsimony assumption, {{as well as more}} general DCJ scenarios based on some realistic but less restrictive assumptions. In both cases, we derive a uniform lower bound for the rate of implicit <b>transpositions,</b> which depends only on the genomes but not a particular DCJ scenario between them. Our results imply that implicit appearance of <b>transpositions</b> in DCJ scenarios may be unavoidable or even abundant for some pairs of genomes. We estimate that for mammalian genomes implicit <b>transpositions</b> constitute at least 6 % of genome rearrangements...|$|R
