He praised Alyson Hannigan's acting, saying {{that she was able to}} be consistently emotional in every take and make him and the crew cry every time.

25|$|These {{performances}} {{caught the}} attention of Harry Jenkins, the Tasmanian-based recruiting scout for Richmond. Acting on Jenkins' recommendation, club secretary Graeme Richmond flew to the island state to watch Hart in action, but he missed seeing Hart play. Nevertheless, Richmond was prepared to sign Hart sight unseen. Hart's mother warned that he would need suitable clothing <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> work, which he didn't have. Richmond countered by offering the youngster a suit and six shirts, then posted papers to the Hart household, which were readily signed. At a time when untried players were asking VFL clubs for large signing on fees, Richmond knew he had a bargain. Aged 17, Hart crossed Bass Strait determined to develop his precocious talent, which was unusual; most Tasmania players played a number of seasons in the local competition before crossing to Victoria as mature age recruits.|$|E

While Illmatic attained gold status in the United States, Stoute convinced Nas to aim his efforts in a more mainstream, commercial direction for his second album, after which Nas enlisted the production team Trackmasters, who were known at the time for their mainstream success. Other producers for the album included DJ Premier, Dr. Dre, Havoc of Mobb Deep, L.E.S., Live Squad, and MC Serch as executive producer.

2500|$|The storyline was set {{up during}} 1988, as Kathy found {{employment}} at James's wine bar, [...] "The Dagmar", causing friction between Kathy and her husband Pete who [...] "didn't like the pub, the clientele or the clothes Kathy felt she had <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> look good for work".

2500|$|The {{name of the}} newfound {{club was}} chosen in its second meeting. Bilitis is the name given to a fictional lesbian {{contemporary}} of Sappho, by the French poet Pierre Lou√øs in his 1894 work The Songs of Bilitis in which Bilitis lived on the Isle of Lesbos alongside Sappho. The name was chosen for its obscurity; even Martin and Lyon {{did not know what}} it meant. [...] "Daughters" [...] was meant to evoke association with other American social associations such as the Daughters of the American Revolution. Early DOB members felt they had to follow two contradictory approaches: trying to recruit interested potential members and being secretive. Martin and Lyon justified the name, writing later, [...] "If anyone asked us, we could always say we belong to a poetry club." [...] They also designed a pin <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> be able to identify with others, chose club colors and voted on a motto [...] "Qui vive", French for [...] "on alert". The organization filed a charter for non-profit corporation status in 1957, writing a description so vague, Phyllis Lyon remembered, [...] "it could have been a charter for a cat-raising club." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Maria's accident, the Chapman family spoke {{publicly}} about their loss {{and the role}} that faith played in their healing. They have appeared on Good Morning America, Larry King Live, in People, The 700 Club, and Huckabee. Maria {{was buried in the}} flower girl dress that she was planning <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> Emily's October wedding. The family put Maria's ballet shoes, her favorite doll, letters from her brothers and sisters, and other personal mementos to Maria in her coffin. During the funeral service, Will kept Maria's security blanket around his shoulders. Maria is buried in Williamson Memorial Gardens in Franklin, Tennessee. Chapman's subsequent album, Beauty Will Rise, focuses on Maria's death and its aftermath. Chapman almost quit his singing career due to Maria's death and he nearly chose to never sing [...] "Cinderella" [...] again, but soon realized that Maria would have wanted him to continue singing and to honor her memory by singing [...] "Cinderella". An investigation of Maria's death was performed by the Tennessee Highway Patrol. However, it was ruled as a tragic accident and no charges were filed.
