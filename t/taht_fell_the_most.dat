Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure of the banking system when underlying hard or financial asset values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so near worthless there was no liquid market for them. This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing government bond interest rates, producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|R

40|$|Standard models {{suggest that}} adverse labor demand shocks {{will lead to}} bigger {{employment}} losses if institutional factors like minimum wages and trade unions prevent downward wage adjustments. Some economists have argued that this insight explains {{the contrast between the}} United States, where real wages <b>fell</b> over <b>the</b> 1980 s and aggregate employment expanded vigorously, and Europe, where real wages were (roughly) constant and employment was stagnant. We test this hypothesis by comparing changes in wages and employment rates over the 1980 s for different age and education groups in the United States, Canada, and France. We argue that the same forces that led to falling real wages for less-skilled workers in the U. S. affected similar workers in Canada and France. Consistent with the view that labor market institutions are more rigid in France, and more flexible in the U. S., we find that relative wages of less-skilled workers <b>fell</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> in <b>the</b> U. S., <b>fell</b> somewhat less in Canada, and did not fall at all in France. Contrary to expectations, however, we find little evidence that wage inflexibilities generated divergent patterns of relative employment growth across the three countries. ...|$|R
