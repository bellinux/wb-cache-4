40|$|Research {{findings}} within posttraumatic growth (PTG) {{and terror}} management theory (TMT) currently appear contradictory. Following confrontations with mortality, PTG research demonstrates intrinsic goal shifts, whereas TMT suggests extrinsic shifts. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>studies</b> examine {{factors contributing to}} these inconsistent results. Study 1 demonstrates that perceived death threat is associated with PTG effects. Study 2 illuminates the importance of duration of death processing. Study 3 demonstrates that existing goal values and duration and type of processing all interact in determining ultimate goal structure, with a match between level of goals and processing producing the most psychologically advantageous outcomes. Although previous research suggests that short-term confrontations with death may lead to defensiveness, <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>studies</b> suggest that encountering death {{over a longer period}} or {{in a manner consistent with}} goal structure may lead individuals to transcend defensiveness and maintain intrinsic goals or become more intrinsically oriented...|$|R

One key aspect of this concept is the improvement of students' ability to set goals and self-regulate effectively to meet those goals. As a part of this process, it is also important to ensure that students are realistically evaluating their personal degree of knowledge and setting realistic goals (another metacognitive task).|$|E

Self-reported and peer-reported data were gathered from 3 independent samples using longitudinal round-robin designs. Peers' ratings of how similar 2 persons appeared in extraversion and agreeableness predicted friendship formation likelihood between these 2 persons in all samples. This association was mediated by perceived similarity. Furthermore, another mediation effect was found for similarity in interaction style: Persons who were viewed by peers as having similar extraversion and agreeableness levels became more similar in interaction styles. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>studies</b> indicate that extraversion and agreeableness influence the emergence of social relationships through intrapersonal perceptions of similarity and interpersonal social interactions. We encourage researchers to look at specific similarity effects that influence interpersonal and intrapersonal processes to understand how relationships are formed...|$|R
