5|$|Late in 1935, after {{learning}} of The Landlord's Game and Finance, Robert Barton held a second meeting with Charles Darrow in Boston. Darrow {{admitted that he}} had copied <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> a friend's set, and he and Barton reached a revised royalty agreement, granting Parker Brothers worldwide rights and releasing Darrow from legal costs that would be incurred in defending the origin of the game.|$|E

5|$|On May 1, 2016, ShinyQuagsire {{discovered}} that the Nintendo 3DS port of VVVVVV can be exploited to load homebrew software. In a similar manner to Cubic Ninja, Nintendo removed <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> the eShop after the exploit was discovered. The game was {{brought back to the}} eShop nearly four months afterwards. The 1.1 version of the game fixes the exploit.|$|E

5|$|On September 21, 2000, Universal Interactive Studios and Konami {{announced}} that they had entered an agreement that would enable Konami to publish a Crash Bandicoot game for next-generation game systems, with Universal Interactive handling {{the production of the}} games. The agreement served to break the Crash Bandicoot franchise's exclusivity to Sony-produced consoles and effectively made Crash Bandicoot a mascot character for Universal rather than Sony. After Universal fell out with Cerny and Sony, Traveller's Tales was forced to alter <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> a free-roaming title to a standard Crash title. Traveller's Tales had to begin development of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> scratch and were given only twelve months to complete the game.|$|E
5|$|Sportswriter Fuzzy Woodruff, {{a witness}} to the game, wrote:Under Heisman's tutelage, Auburn played with a {{marvelous}} speed and dash that couldn't be gainsaid and which fairly swept Sewanee off its feet. Only the remarkable punting of Simkins kept <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> being a debacle. I recall vividly one incident of the game, which demonstrates clearly just how surprising was Sewanee's victory.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} mixed reviews. Critics {{praised the}} game's B movie-esque quality, warped humor, and smooth video animation, but criticized the shallow gameplay. The title is particularly notable for {{being one of}} the principal subjects of a 1993 United States Senate committee hearing on violent video games, along with Mortal Kombat. Night Trap was cited during the hearing as promoting gratuitous violence and sexual aggression against women. Toy retailers pulled <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> shelves that December, and Sega withdrew <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> the market by January. The Senate hearing eventually {{led to the creation of}} the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), the North American video game ratings board still used today. After the controversy subsided, Night Trap was re-released and ported to other consoles. These later ports received more harsh reviews due to the aging appeal of full motion video. A re-release of Night Trap in celebration of its 25th anniversary was released on August 15, 2017.|$|E

5|$|A Nintendo 3DS {{version of}} the game, titled 3D Sonic the Hedgehog, was {{released}} {{as part of the}} 3D Classics line in 2013. This version, unlike most downloadable re-releases of the game, is not emulated; rather, the game's code was restructured to allow it {{to take advantage of the}} 3DS system's stereoscopic 3D graphics and comes with additional enhancements, such as the option to use the Spin Dash move, a CRT-style filter, and the option to start <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> any level.|$|E
5|$|A {{collectable}} {{card game}} {{based on the}} Shaman King series was produced by Tomy in Japan and released in the United States by Upper Deck in 2005. Upper Deck originally planned a mass market release of the game for January 2005, however, it was later announced that Blockbuster Video would have exclusive rights to sell <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> January 28 to February 15, 2005, after which it would be released to other retailers. In an interview with Upper Deck's Director of Brand and New Product Development, Cory Jones stated {{that it was the}} television show's underperformance and later cancellation which led to the cancellation of the trading card game.|$|E
5|$|A {{mobile phone}} {{adaptation}} of the game was developed by Universomo and published by THQ. It was released on 19 December 2006. Several gameplay features — such as two-dimensional graphics, limited character selection, and coverage only of the film Star Wars — distinguish this version of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> the versions for other platforms. Lego Star Wars and Lego Star Wars II were later compiled in , developed by Traveller's Tales and published by LucasArts. The Complete Saga incorporated improvements from the sequel into the original game, and expanded the Mos Eisley Cantina to allow access to both games' levels. It was created for Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS. It was released on 6 November 2007.|$|E

5|$|After the Crimson Tide defense {{held the}} Aggies to a punt, McCarron threw his second {{touchdown}} pass {{of the afternoon}} on the drive that ensued {{early in the second}} quarter on a 44-yard flea flicker pass to DeAndrew White that tied the game 14–14. On the next drive, Cyrus Jones intercepted a Manziel pass in the end zone for a touchback and an Alabama possession. McCarron then threw his third touchdown pass on <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> 51yards to Kenny Bell and gave the Crimson Tide their first lead of the game, 21–14. Alabama then closed the first half with an 11-play, 93-yard drive capped with a four-yard T. J. Yeldon touchdown run for a 28–14 halftime lead.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} game's {{conversion}} to Steamworks, Gold Edition was released for Microsoft Windows on March 26, 2015. Owners of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> Steam or as a boxed retail Games For Windows Live can acquire a free Steamworks copy of the base game and purchase the new Gold Edition content. The Steamworks version did not allow the use of Nvidia's 3D Vision technology or fan modifications, though Capcom later confirmed {{a way to work}} around these issues.|$|E
5|$|Camp's new {{scrimmage}} rules {{revolutionized the}} game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play {{to slow the}} game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each down. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined {{with the establishment of}} the line of scrimmage, transformed <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{receiving}} praise in pre-release showings, Sonic the Hedgehog {{was released}} to notably negative reception. Criticism {{was directed at}} the game's perceived lack of polish, with reviewers citing long loading times, a poor camera system, gameplay glitches, a complicated plot, and imprecise control. It has been considered among the worst games {{not only in the}} Sonic series but also in the video game medium. Sega delisted <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> retailers in 2010 following its decision to remove all Sonic games with below-average Metacritic scores to increase the value of the brand.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{ceremonial}} pre-game coin toss, Auburn elected {{to kick off}} to Virginia Tech to begin the game, ensuring the Tigers would have possession to begin the second half. Tech began the first drive of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> its 20-yard line following a touchback. The Hokies initially had success moving the ball, as quarterback Bryan Randall rushed for seven yards on the game's first play, then completed a four-yard pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal two plays later for a first down. The Auburn defense recovered, however, and the Hokies did not gain another first down and were forced to punt. Auburn recovered the ball and began its first drive of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>from</b> its 26-yard line. On the Tigers' first play, quarterback Jason Campbell threw a long pass to Cooper Wallace for 35yards. This was followed by another long play as running back Ronnie Brown ran for 31yards. After the initial shock of the Auburn offense, the Virginia Tech defense firmed up, and Auburn's next three plays were stopped for losses or minimal gains. Facing a fourth down at the Virginia Tech six-yard line, Auburn sent in kicker John Vaughn, who kicked a 23-yard field goal for the game's first points. With 8:35 remaining in the first quarter, Auburn took an early 3–0 lead.|$|E
