50|$|The stick handle may be bent or 'deviated', in {{a smooth}} curve only, once only to either side. That is the handle may have one out-moving curve on the 'heel' {{side of the}} head and one out-moving curve on the <b>toe</b> <b>side.</b> It is {{therefore}} possible to have a hockey stick with a handle deviation to the front or <b>toe</b> <b>side</b> or a handle deviation to the back or 'heel' side or a stick-handle that is bent once to both the toe and 'heel' sides.|$|E

5000|$|Parahippus {{was larger}} than Miohippus, with longer legs and face. The bones in the legs were fused and this, along with muscle development, allowed Parahippus to move with forward-and-back strides. Flexible leg {{rotation}} was eliminated, so that the animal was better adapted to fast forward running on open ground without moving from side to side. Most importantly, Parahippus was able to stand on its middle toe, instead of walking on pads, which gave it the ability to run faster; its weight was supported by ligaments under the fetlock to the big central <b>toe.</b> The <b>side</b> <b>toes</b> were almost vestigial, and seldom touched the ground.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ancestors}} of the horse came to walk only {{on the end of}} the third <b>toe</b> and both <b>side</b> <b>toes.</b> Skeletal remnants show obvious wear on the back of both sides of metacarpal and metatarsal bones, commonly called the [...] "splint bones". They are the remnants of the second and the fourth toe. Modern horses retain the splint bones; they are often believed to be useless attachments, but they in fact play an important role in supporting the carpal joints (front knees) and even the tarsal joints (hocks).|$|R
5000|$|Heel side: {{the side}} of a board on the edge where a rider's heels are (opposite of <b>toe</b> <b>side).</b> [...] "Riding heel side" [...] is riding with heels down.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} grabs {{can also be}} {{combined}} into one trick. A rider may perform a tail grab going to indy by moving the rear hand {{from the back of}} the board to the middle of the <b>toe</b> <b>side</b> edge.|$|E
50|$|The term Indy grab {{may also}} be misapplied to any aerial in which the rider grabs the <b>toe</b> <b>side</b> of his board with their {{trailing}} hand (as in snowboarding). This confusion {{is partly due to}} the name's being applied to all such grabs in the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater video game.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Toe</b> side: the <b>side</b> of a {{board on}} the edge where a riders toes are (opposite of heel <b>side).</b> [...] "Riding <b>toe</b> side" [...] is riding with toes down.|$|R

5000|$|This {{condition}} often manifests in {{the form}} of lateral (little <b>toe</b> <b>side)</b> foot pain and sometimes general foot weakness. Cuboid syndrome, which is relatively common but not well defined or recognized, is known by many other names, including [...] "lateral plantar neuritis, cuboid fault syndrome, peroneal cuboid syndrome, dropped cuboid, locked cuboid and subluxed cuboid.|$|E
50|$|A heelflip is the {{opposite}} of a kickflip, the board spins toe-side (towards the toes). For a regular skater (left foot in front) the board spins clockwise from the perspective of one behind the skater. Again, there is a kick as part of the ollie but unlike the kickflip it is directed forward and outwards away from the riders <b>toe</b> <b>side</b> (diagonal), so that {{the last part of the}} foot to leave the board is the heel, hence the name.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{presently}} two styles of outfield set-back stick, {{the degree of}} setback to the head is a feature they have in common; they differ in that one has a 'kink' or shaft protrusion on the <b>toe</b> <b>side</b> above {{the head of the}} stick while the other does not. In the goalkeeper versions some also have the toe of the head cut flat (parallel to the handle) rather than rounded to allow the user to present the stick closer to the ground when stopping in a horizontal position on the reverse side, this is to more easily prevent the ball from going under the handle of the stick.|$|E
50|$|The bird's {{feathers}} are rust-colored, however darker shades are known, including maroon {{bordering on}} black. Rhode Island Reds have red-orange eyes, reddish-brown beaks, and yellow feet and legs, {{often with a}} bit of reddish hue on the <b>toes</b> and <b>sides</b> of the shanks. Chicks are a light red to tan color. The roosters usually weigh in at about 8.7 lb, the hens average slightly less at 6.5 lb.|$|R

5000|$|The Indy air was {{originally}} called the Gunnair, which {{was invented by}} Gunnar Haugo in 1977. By 1980, the trick was renamed the Indy air, which was popularized by Duane Peters. The trick involves doing a backside air while gripping one's board on the <b>toe</b> <b>side,</b> between the feet with the trailing hand. If the board is grabbed during a frontside air, the trick is simply called a [...] "frontside air", {{as opposed to a}} frontside Ollie, {{in which there is no}} grab. Many variations have come into existence as skaters push the limits of creativity and physical exertion. Two of the most popular variations are the kickflip Indy and Indy nosebone.|$|E

5000|$|Similar to a kickflip, the heelflip {{is instead}} {{executed}} {{with the heel}} section flipping away from the skater this time. For a regular-footed skater (left foot in front) the board spins clockwise {{from the perspective of}} a view from behind the skater. Again, a kick formulates part of the ollie, but unlike the kickflip, the kick is directed forward and outwards, away from the rider's <b>toe</b> <b>side</b> (diagonal), so that the last part of the foot to leave the board is the heel—hence the name. The trick was invented by Mullen in 1982. Instances of multiple spins are named according to how many spins are completed (e.g. double heelflip, triple heelflip, etc.)—skateboard videographer, Jon Fistemanu, is filmed executing a double heelflip in a 2010 web video entitled [...] "Daewon Dorking Around at DVS".|$|E
40|$|Bonham and Garside (1979, p. 64, fig. 41) briefly {{described}} fossil bird {{tracks in}} finegrained, light-gray, tuffaceous shales exposed about 5 km west of Tonopah, Esmeralda County, Nevada. Ripple marks, and raindrop impressions are preserved on the bedding surfaces. Chara (fossil algae) was also observed. Figure 41 from Bonham and Garside (1979) Avipeda sp. Dimensions: ~ 50 mm long, 65 mm long (length is distance between heel, if no hind toe impression) and top of middle toe; width is distance between tips of {{first and third}} # 2 and # 4). Total number of tracks measured: 4 Number of tracks in trackway: 6 Description: Medium-sized tracks with central toe slightly longer than <b>toes</b> on each <b>side.</b> Outside <b>toe</b> obviously curved. <b>Side</b> <b>toes</b> are at approximately 75 º, with central toe approximately bisecting that angle. Angle determined using midpoint of curving outside toe. Stride approximately 160 mm (stride is one full cycle of motion, e. g., distance from heel of foot to heel of same foot when it touches the ground). No hallux impressions. No webbing observed, but such impressions may not be preserved. Curved outside toe is reminiscent of some modern ducks...|$|R
25|$|Pliohippus {{arose from}} Callippus {{in the middle}} Miocene, around 12 mya. It was very similar in {{appearance}} to Equus, though it had two long extra <b>toes</b> on both <b>sides</b> of the hoof, externally barely visible as callused stubs. The long and slim limbs of Pliohippus reveal a quick-footed steppe animal.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{important}} parameters in undercut slopes design is {{the determination of the}} maximum stable undercut span. The maximum stable undercut span is a function of slope geometry, the strength parameters of the slope material, condition of discontinuities, underground water condition, etc. However, the desired production capacity and therefore the size of excavating equipment will sometimes ask for a wider undercut span. The influence of arching phenomenon in geo-material on the stability of undercut slopes is investigated earlier. It is believed that due to arching effect, some load transfer from the undercut area into stationary remaining <b>side</b> <b>toes</b> leads to a more stable slope. However, the transferred load may result in ploughing failure of <b>side</b> <b>toes.</b> One technique for preventing the ploughing failure is the use of counterweight balance on <b>side</b> <b>toes.</b> In this study, the influence of counterweight size on the stability of the undercut slopes was investigated through a series of numerical model tests using FLAC 3 D software. It was concluded that there is a meaningful relationship between the counterweight balance size and the maximum stable undercut span where increasing a counterweight size results in a wider stable span. Finally, the numerical results were compared with pre-conducted physical modeling test and a nonlinear relationship was proposed between the counterweight size and the maximum stable undercut span...|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{permitted}} {{width of}} the handle (51 mm) is illustrated in the diagram by {{the distance between the}} dotted lines A-A and A1-A1. A hockey stick handle will rarely be of the maximum permitted width: most are between 46 mm and 48 mm at the widest point. The maximum permitted 'deviation' is shown by the lines B-B and B1-B1 respectively. The line B-B is 20 mm further along the X- axis than the line A-A and the line B1-B1 is 20 mm further along the X+ axis than the line A1-A1. There is no limit to the length of a protrusion along the y-axis specified, so the deviation curve or curves may be of any length {{along the length of the}} stick-handle. Some goalkeeping sticks have an outward curve on the <b>toe</b> <b>side</b> (within the line B-B) that extends for almost half the total length of the stick.|$|E
5000|$|It may {{be noted}} from the diagram above {{that no matter}} how [...] "tight" [...] the heel bend, {{reversing}} the stick head over the ball, with a [...] "traditional" [...] style hockey stick head, always requires both a vertical and horizontal adjustment of the stick head position. This is not anywhere near as difficult as it was with the very long head stick and this sort of adjustment will be almost sub-conscious in an experienced player. Note too, that when the shaft is held vertically, the ball is more securely stopped, when on the ground, to the <b>toe</b> <b>side</b> of the shaft rather than {{in the middle of the}} shaft. Novice players frequently assume that the centre of the ball will align with the centre of the shaft when stopping the ball in this way and as a result, the ball deflects off to the heel side and usually into their feet. Because of the heel slope on the stick head the vertical shaft stop is actually much easier to carry out securely (when the ball is on the ground) if the handle is held at least 10° off the vertical, with the top of the handle sloped to the player's left. When the ball in the air, a little off the ground, below knee height for example, is often easier to catch the ball correctly if the handle is vertical.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of the local {{approaches}} to fatigue design of welded joints, the notch stress intensity factor (NSIF) approach assumes the weld toe as well as the weld root profile as sharp V-shaped notches, the V-notch opening angle being greater than zero at the <b>toe</b> <b>side</b> and equal to zero at the root side. The Peak Stress Method (PSM) is an engineering, finite element (FE) -oriented method to rapidly estimate the NSIF local stress parameters by means of linear elastic FE analyses with coarse meshes. By using the averaged Strain Energy Density (SED, which can be expressed {{as a function of the}} relevant NSIFs) as a fatigue strength criterion, a so-called equivalent peak stress can be defined and adopted to assess either weld toe and weld root fatigue failures in conjunction with an existing design fatigue curve, that was originally calibrated on experimental results relevant only to weld toe failures. In the present paper new fatigue test results relevant to weld root failures have been generated by testing tube-to-flange fillet-welded steel joints under torsional loading. Good agreement has been obtained between theoretical estimations according to the PSM and experimental fatigue test results...|$|E

50|$|It is speculated by paleontologists {{that during}} the Eocene period, hoofed marsh dwellers carried their body weight mainly {{on two of the}} middle toes, which grew to equal size, {{becoming}} the Artiodactyla or even-toed hoofed animals. Prior to the close of the Eocene period the <b>side</b> <b>toes</b> of some had dwindled and practically disappeared while the basal pieces or metapodium of the pair of supporting toes became fused together, thus producing the appearance of a cloven hoof.|$|R
50|$|The {{foot was}} fully {{supported}} by ligaments, {{and the middle}} toe developed into a hoof, which {{did not have a}} pad on the bottom.
