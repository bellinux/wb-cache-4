5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included Bahias sister , the aging cruiser , and the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their potential power, however, was {{dwarfed by the}} dreadnoughts—each of which outgunned all of the warships alone—and was severely tempered by personnel issues. First, naval officers were suspicious of even the enlisted men who remained loyal to the government. Officers took over all of the positions that {{would be involved in}} direct combat, and the numbers of enlisted men were reduced wherever possible. Further complicating matters were missing weapon components, such as the destroyer's torpedoes, which could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.|$|E

Westmoreland sent Colonel Wilson, Khánh's former confidant, {{to go to the}} military airport at Đà Lạt to convince the Vietnamese general to resign and allow a new military leadership to take the reins. Khánh finally agreed to leave if he was given a dignified send-off, so the other generals arranged a ceremony at Tan Son Nhut, where military bands serenaded him. He theatrically bent down and picked up some loose dirt before putting it in his pocket, saying that he was taking his beloved homeland with him. His enemies, the remaining Vietnamese officers and Taylor, all met him at the airport. He then left as Ambassador-at-Large, and was sent on a world tour, starting with a report at the United Nations in New York City.|$|E
25|$|At the {{pay-per-view}} on September 17, Steen interrupted a {{match between}} El Generico and Jimmy Jacobs {{and called out}} Steve Corino, {{who was at the}} time wrestling in Japan, before powerbombing Jacobs on the ring apron. Steen was then confronted by Jim Cornette and ROH president Cary Silkin, whom he tried to Package Piledrive, before being ushered out of the arena by the security. On the November 5 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, Steen reappeared with Ohio Valley Wrestling talent Christian Mascagni as his legal adviser, threatening Jim Cornette and Ring of Honor with legal action unless he was reinstated within three weeks. On the December 3 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, Steen was granted a match with Steve Corino at Final Battle 2011, with his ROH future on the line. At the event, Steen defeated Corino, thus granting back his career in ROH. Afterwards, he delivered a package piledriver to Jimmy Jacobs, before putting El Generico through a table with the same maneuver. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> he confronted Davey Richards and promised to become the ROH World Champion in 2012. On March 4, 2012, at the 10th Anniversary Show, Steen defeated Jimmy Jacobs in a No Holds Barred match and ended the pay-per-view by having another confrontation with Davey Richards.

His performance divided opinion. The Times commented, [...] "It is a mountain of a part, and at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> the peak remains unscaled"; in The Manchester Guardian, however, Brown wrote that Gielgud [...] "is a match for the thunder, and at length takes the Dover road with a broken tranquillity that allowed every word of the King's agony to be clear as well as poignant." ...|$|E

500|$|Possibly {{because of}} its size, The Sirens and Ulysses failed to sell at the 1837 Summer Exhibition. In October 1837 wealthy Manchester cotton {{merchant}} Daniel Grant, an admirer of Etty who had already commissioned Venus and her Doves from him, met Etty at Heaton Park races and offered to buy The Sirens and Ulysses and Etty's smaller Samson Betrayed by Delilah unseen {{for a total of}} £200. Etty was hoping for £400 for the two paintings, but on being told by Grant that his firm had lost £100,000 that year offered a price of £300 for the pair. Grant counter-offered £250 (about £ in today's terms), which Etty refused. On leaving at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> Grant suddenly said, [...] "Will you take the money?", startling Etty, who in his surprise agreed. Grant died shortly afterwards, leaving the painting to his brother William, who in turn gave it to the Royal Manchester Institution in 1839.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, 50 {{years after}} the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a {{commemorative}} performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, {{a close friend of}} the composer, Stravinsky informed him that {{he had no intention of}} hearing his music being [...] "murdered by that frightful butcher". Instead he arranged tickets for that particular evening's performance of Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro, at Covent Garden. Under pressure from his friends, Stravinsky was persuaded to leave the opera after the first act. He arrived at the Albert Hall just as the performance of The Rite was ending; composer and conductor shared a warm embrace in front of the unaware, wildly cheering audience. Monteux's biographer John Canarina provides a different slant on this occasion, recording that by <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> Stravinsky had asserted that [...] "Monteux, almost alone among conductors, never cheapened Rite or looked for his own glory in it, and he continued to play it all his life with the greatest fidelity".|$|E
