5|$|As {{with other}} sports, vinkensport {{has had its}} {{cheating}} scandals, as well as accusations of artificial enhancement. One finch sang a record 1,278 susk-e-weits in one hour, and the owner was later accused of doping the bird with testosterone. After one contestant sang exactly {{the same number of}} calls in two rounds, <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>was</b> opened and a mini CD player was discovered within.|$|E

Later in-store promotions in the U.S. have urged customers to add a six-piece portion to their meal as a snack option.|$|E

5|$|After {{several months}} he spent as an {{experimental}} case, military authorities began {{to press for}} Tarrare {{to be returned to}} active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached General Alexandre deBeauharnais with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>was</b> retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in legible condition. Courville proposed to deBeauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched.|$|E
5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>was</b> empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils {{of the world in}} the box, she placed her power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E
5|$|After another full {{examination}} in 1911, with {{comparisons to}} the Ashmolean head, archaeologists dismissed the Ashmolean head as a fake. The absence of firm {{evidence of the}} whereabouts of Cromwell's head between 1684 and 1787 made them wary about declaring the head genuine. They concluded their study unable to verify or refute the head's identity. The uncertainty increased public demand for a full scientific examination, and Wilkinson reluctantly allowed the head to be taken for examination by the eugenicist Karl Pearson and the anthropologist Geoffrey Morant. Their 109-page report {{concluded that there was}} a “moral certainty” that the Wilkinson head was that of Oliver Cromwell. Horace Wilkinson died in 1957, bequeathing the head to his son, also called Horace. Horace Wilkinson wished to organise a proper burial for the head rather than a public display, so he contacted Sidney Sussex College, which welcomed the burial. There it was interred on 25 March 1960, in a secret location near the antechapel, preserved in the oak box in which the Wilkinson family had kept the head since 1815. <b>The</b> <b>box</b> <b>was</b> placed into an airtight container and buried with only a few witnesses, including family and representatives of the college. The secret burial was not announced until October 1962.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal kicked-off {{the match}} {{and within the}} first two minutes forced Manchester United defender Gary Neville to concede a throw-in. In the fifth minute, Manchester United won a free kick, but nothing {{came out of it}} as José Antonio Reyes blocked Paul Scholes's shot. Good play by Reyes and Henry {{fashioned}} a chance for Bergkamp in the ninth minute, but his strike was off target. Two minutes later a shot by Bergkamp from outside <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>was</b> saved by Manchester United goalkeeper Tim Howard. Before Henry was about to take a corner for Arsenal in the 16th minute, a cigarette lighter was thrown at him from the section occupied by Manchester United supporters – this resulted in police making two arrests during the game. Quinton Fortune used his pace to get the better of Lauren, but his cross into the Arsenal penalty area was cleared by Pascal Cygan. Arsenal continued to threaten – Henry's free kick prompted Howard to make a save and tip the ball over the crossbar, and Bergkamp came close to scoring in the 27th minute after clever play to lose his marker John O'Shea. The football continued to move {{from one end to the}} other, with Giggs and Reyes causing problems for their respective defences. In stoppage time at the end of the first half, Henry had his shot saved by Howard, while Scholes was similarly denied by Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.|$|E
5|$|From 1277, Stratton {{acted in}} the {{capacity}} as Countess Isabella's steward, though he never officially used that title. It was in this post that he committed {{some of his most}} grievous offences. In 1278 he was accused of cutting off the seal of a charter from Quarr Abbey, thereby invalidating its authenticity. As a result, several other similar cases were brought to light, but none led to conviction. It was widely believed that he had bought himself off with bribes. Stratton's transgressions continued however, and by the late 1280s the complaints reached King Edward I. Edward returned from a prolonged stay in Gascony in late 1289, and immediately started a purge of corruption in the royal administration, including proceedings against Ralph de Hengham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench. Stratton was relieved of his office of chamberlain, along with his temporal possessions, on 17 January 1290. On his arrest, £12,666 17s 7d was found in his possession, a vast sum at the time, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. According to the chronicle of Bartholomew Cotton, a silk-lined chest was also discovered, containing fingernail and toenail clippings, women's pubic hair, and feet of toads and moles. These were considered the ingredients of witchcraft, and <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>was</b> sealed up by officials, but Stratton managed to break the seal and throw the contents down a latrine.|$|E

25|$|At {{the lower}} {{position}} {{the process was}} reversed. Here the water pressure {{was strong enough to}} press the box tightly into position against the exit opening. Another rack and pinion (again operated from above) lifted the outer gate, the levels were equalised again, the inner door on <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>was</b> swung open and the boat floated out. Apart from the inevitable small leakages, no significant amount of water had been used in the process.|$|E

40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{confirmed the}} hypothesis that observing a <b>box</b> being opened <b>is</b> intrinsically rewarding and that the positive feelings it elicits can increase evaluations of its contents independently {{of the nature of}} these contents.

This is true even when the cover of <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>is</b> transparent (and so its contents can be easily seen when <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>is</b> closed). Moreover, seeing a box being opened increases evaluations of <b>the</b> <b>box</b> even when <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>is</b> empty. When <b>the</b> contents of a <b>box</b> <b>are</b> unknown, opening <b>the</b> <b>box</b> can elicit surprise, polarizing evaluations of the product contained in it.
