He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E

The players and the crowd stood bareheaded and in silence for two minutes before the match resumed at 11:30. Five Durham cricketers acted as his pall-bearers. At the inquest his death was put down to heart disease, following double pneumonia two years earlier. A post-mortem examination disclosed an abnormally large heart that <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> made it almost unbelievable that Nichol lived such a long active life. Nichol was {{engaged to be married}} to Dorothy Ayers.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{shortly before}} his execution, Abbott spoke to the doctor at San Quentin. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> that when he asked Abbott about the crime, he said [...] "I can't admit it Doc, think {{of what it would}} do to my mother, she couldn't take it".|$|E

2500|$|A new {{scene with}} Regan at the {{hospital}} receiving treatment to diagnose her [...] "unusual" [...] behavior. The doctor tells Chris MacNeil that Regan told him to [...] "keep his fingers away from her Goddamn cunt," [...] as depicted in the novel. This scene sets up her bizarre behavior earlier and clarifies the scene where Chris tells Regan [...] "it's just like <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said,</b> it's just nerves. You just take your pills and you'll be fine." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> that Pollentier had not {{actually}} used {{the tube and}} so the test would go ahead as normal. At 8pm, the organiser, Félix Lévitan, told the press that the UCI had ruled that Pollentier would be fined 5,000 Swiss francs and start an immediate suspension of two months. The question was obvious: if a rider was prepared to take drugs and win a stage, knowing he would be tested, {{how many times had}} the ruse been shown to work before? ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 29, 1968, Don Demeter officially {{announced}} his retirement from Major League Baseball. He reported for spring training in Tucson, Arizona and successfully passed a complete physical examination, but still decided to end his career due to potential health concerns about his heart from September. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> Demeter didn't {{have a heart attack}} or suffer damages to his heart, but Demeter ended by saying, [...] "However, the doctor added that there was the possibility that I'd be running down the line some day and have an attack." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} medical regulation in the UK dates from 1421, when physicians petitioned parliament {{to ask that}} nobody without appropriate qualifications be allowed to practise medicine. <b>The</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> that unqualified practitioners caused [...] "great harm and slaughter of many men".|$|R

2500|$|In Dead Ringers 2006 series, Culshaw's Tenth Doctor {{was joined}} by Rose Tyler (portrayed by Jan Ravens) in two sketches. [...] In one, the pair complained about the {{increasingly}} loud and intrusive music in the programme, and the Doctor was forced to use his sonic screwdriver to [...] "turn on the subtitles, like everyone at home is doing." [...] In another, the Doctor remarked how easy his job had become since he could learn all about his adventures beforehand from the Radio Times, Doctor Who Confidential, Totally Doctor Who and the TARDISODEs; since everything was revealed ahead of time, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>said</b> he could [...] "phone {{the rest of the}} show in" [...] and watch the World Cup (imminent {{at the time of the}} sketch's broadcast).|$|E
2500|$|According to SEC-sponsored, ESPN Films' documentary, [...] "Lolo" [...] about Jones' life (and her {{personal}} {{telling of the}} story during it), the [...] "clipping" [...] of the ninth hurdle at the 2008 Beijing Olympics was attributed to a spinal problem. The doctor who treated her said that the problem {{was so bad that}} he would examine her feet and ask which toe of which foot he was touching and she told him that she couldn't feel anything. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> that the problem was that, since she couldn't feel her feet, her brain wasn't able to process where they were, leading to the [...] "clipping" [...] in the medal race in Beijing. Also according to the documentary, the doctor operated on Jones to repair the problem and the operation was a success.|$|E
2500|$|Both the Doctor and the Master {{have been}} shown to be skilled hypnotists, {{although}} the Master's capacity to dominate – even by stare and voice alone – has been shown to be far more pronounced. In Logopolis <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>said</b> of the Master, [...] "He's a Time Lord. In many ways, we have the same mind." [...] The Master is often able to anticipate the Doctor's moves, as seen in stories such as Castrovalva, The Keeper of Traken, Time-Flight, and The King's Demons, where he plans elaborate traps for the Doctor, only revealing his presence at the key moment. In The Deadly Assassin, the Master was able to send a false premonition as a telepathic message to the Doctor, but it is unclear whether he performed this through innate psychic ability, or was aided technologically.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the third}} day of the trial, Dr. Vernard Adams said that Anderson died from {{suffocation}} at the hands of eight boot camp employees. [...] <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> the lack of oxygen prevented Anderson's blood from producing carbon dioxide, leading to a build-up of lactic acid in his blood that ultimately put him in an irreversible coma. [...] The pathologist acknowledged that the teen's sickle-cell condition aggravated the circumstances by further impeding the flow of oxygen. He insisted, however, that the guards' actions alone would have been enough to kill even a teen who did not have sickle-cell trait. [...] From a toxicologist, Cynthia Lewis-Younger, the jury learned the highly concentrated ammonia capsules the guards used on Anderson were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use on children. [...] Acknowledging that no deaths have been reported from their use, she said that potential could not be ruled out.|$|E
2500|$|William Hartnell {{described}} the Doctor as [...] "a wizard", and [...] "a cross between the Wizard of Oz and Father Christmas". Paul McGann, {{who played a}} later incarnation of <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> <b>said</b> Hartnell's [...] "seemed like a Victorian, someone kind of stern and paterfamilias about him. Something kind but scary". One quirk of the First Doctor was his tendency to become occasionally tongue-tied and stumble over words. Sometimes this was a deliberate acting choice: William Russell recalls that it was Hartnell's idea for the Doctor to get Ian Chesterton's surname wrong, calling him [...] "Chesserman", [...] "Chatterton" [...] and even [...] "Charterhouse". This character choice also gave the series' producers {{the ability to use}} takes in which Hartnell flubbed his lines. Due to the series' tight production schedule, it was rarely possible to reshoot such scenes and dubbing the dialogue was usually not an option. Hartnell suffered from undiagnosed arteriosclerosis, which affected his ability to remember lines, increasingly so as his time on the series progressed.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{explained}} that Israel sinned with fire {{in making the}} Golden Calf, as [...] says, [...] "And I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf." [...] And then Bezalel came and healed the wound (and {{the construction of the}} Tabernacle made atonement for the sins of the people in making the Golden Calf). The Midrash likened it to the words of [...] "Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals." [...] The Midrash taught that Bezalel was the smith whom God had created to address the fire. And the Midrash likened it to the case of a doctor's disciple who applied a plaster to a wound and healed it. When people began to praise him, his teacher, <b>the</b> <b>doctor,</b> <b>said</b> that they should praise the doctor, for he taught the disciple. Similarly, when everybody said that Bezalel had constructed the Tabernacle through his knowledge and understanding, God said that it was God who created him and taught him, as [...] says, [...] "Behold, I have created the smith."

60|$|At last, Lady Barbara {{was engaged}} to be married to a brother officer of her second brother, James; but just then poor Jane fell so ill, that <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> she could not live through the year. Barbara loved her sister far too well to think of marrying at such a time, and said she must attend to no one else. All that winter and spring she was nursing her sister day and night, {{watching}} over her, and quite keeping up the little spark of life, <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said,</b> by her tender care. And though Lady Jane lived on day after day, she never grew so much better as to be fit to hear of the engagement and that if she recovered her sister would be separated from her; and so weeks went on, and still nothing could be done about the marriage.|$|R

2500|$|Houston detectives Jerry Carpenter and Joe Gamino {{were called}} to River Oaks after a boy {{discovered}} Hill's abandoned briefcase, which had been stolen during the robbery. While searching the scene, Carpenter found a gun beneath a bush. A ballistics expert was able to determine that the bullets fired at Hill had been handmade, {{and as a result}} of this Houston police were able to trace the weapon to a doctor. When questioned as to how the weapon had found its way to River Oaks, <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> it had been stolen by a woman whom he described as [...] "a whore". He went on to explain that he had entertained two prostitutes, who stole some money and one of his cars while he was sleeping. He had taken the gun and planned to go looking for the women, but as he was about to leave, he was called by another prostitute who called herself Dusty, who asked if he wanted company. While she was with him, he said, she took the gun. He then said he believed Dusty's real name was Marcia McKittrick. Carpenter, a former vice squad officer, used his old contacts to trace McKittrick, and discovered she was involved with Bobby Wayne Vandiver, an habitual criminal who had established himself as a pimp following his most recent release from prison.|$|E
