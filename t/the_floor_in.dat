5|$|Because of the {{initially}} {{broad definition}} of 12-6 elbows in the Unified Rules, referees often had differences in {{interpretation of what}} was classed as one. Referee Herb Dean differed from McCarthy's definition and argued that elbow strikes parallel with <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> side control (sometimes called 9-3 elbows) were classed as 12-6 elbows, as he considered 12-6 elbows as being based on where the fighter throwing them was positioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{court was}} told of three other cases. Captain John Bromfield, Robert Newton and James Thompson all died after similar {{treatment}} from Acton: a beating, followed by {{time in the}} hole or strong room, before being moved to the sick ward, where they were left to lie on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> leg irons.|$|E
5|$|The {{review board}} {{determined}} that the electrical power momentarily failed at 23:30:55 GMT, and found evidence of several electric arcs in the interior equipment. They were unable to identify conclusively a single ignition source.

It spread from the left wall of the cabin to the right, with the floor being affected only briefly.|$|E

50|$|There is no <b>floor</b> 1; <b>the</b> ground <b>floor</b> {{is known}} as 'Upper Ground' and the 'Lower Ground' {{basement}} floor is about {{half the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tower block. <b>The</b> first <b>floor</b> up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lift or stairs is called <b>Floor</b> 2. <b>The</b> Upper Ground <b>floor</b> is much larger than <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tower block, with a huge open-plan flat-roof office area, a coffee bar, shop, learning centre and a theatre which is used for company presentations. The building also has a large undercover car park, notorious with employees for its very narrow parking spaces.

5|$|In 1865–1867 Captain Thomas Chaloner and William Downing Bruce {{carried out}} the first major {{excavation}} by cutting a trench across the site. A number of features were discovered, including a stone coffin containing the skeleton of a tall man thought to be Robert de Brus, {{the remnants of a}} monumental shrine and painted roof bosses. Evidence of the 1289 fire was discovered in the form of pieces of fused metal – an amalgam of lead, silver and iron that had melted and penetrated <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> the heat of the fire. The Office of Works carried out excavations in 1932 in conjunction with work to consolidate the walls and grounds so they could be opened to the public. Further work was carried out by Roy Gilyard Beer between 1947–54 for the Ministry of Works, which exposed more of the site and cleared material from the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus in {{the wide}} sense, i.e. {{including}} probably several species, is found in Europe, the Black sea region in northeastern Turkey, and eastern and central North America east of Minnesota. It has been accidentally introduced into Australasia, where it is found under introduced and native trees. It is found on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> deciduous woodland, particularly under beech (Betula), {{and can be found}} throughout summer and autumn and into early winter. It is relatively common, though not as common as the similar species L. vellereus. L. piperatus is found solitarily or in scattered groups. It is sometimes found growing together with Russula cyanoxantha.|$|E
5|$|Matt Bissonnette, a SEAL {{who participated}} in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day (2012), which {{significantly}} contradicts Pfarrer's account. Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter approach and landing matched the official version. According to Bissonnette, when bin Laden peered out at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL who fired upon him hit him {{on the right side of}} the head. Bin Laden stumbled into his bedroom, where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> a pool of body matter, with two women crying over his body. The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot bin Laden repeatedly in the chest until he was dead. According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room—an AK-47 rifle and a Makarov pistol—were unloaded.|$|E

5|$|Picard confronts Q, {{who tells}} him that {{although}} the bout with the Nausicaan nearly cost him his life, it also gave him a sense of his mortality. It taught him that life was too precious to squander by playing it safe. Picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore {{the consequences of his}} indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself. Picard then declares that he would rather die as captain of the Enterprise than live as a nobody. Q sends him back to the bar fight and events unfold as they did originally, with Picard being stabbed through the heart and laughing as he collapses to <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>In</b> the present, Picard awakens in sickbay, a Captain again. As Picard recovers from his injury, he wonders if his journey into the past was one of Q's tricks or merely a dream. Nevertheless, he is grateful for the insight the experience gave him.|$|E
5|$|Since {{his first}} {{appearance}} on The Simpsons, Santa's Little Helper has appeared in merchandise relating to the show. On the board art of The Simpsons Clue, a 2000 board game by USAopoly based on Clue, he is shown drinking Duff Beer that has been spilled on <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>In</b> another board game published by USAopoly called The Simpsons Monopoly, based on Monopoly and released in 2001, the dog is featured {{as one of the}} six pewter playing pieces. Santa's Little Helper has also appeared in issues of Simpsons Comics, in the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie, and in video games based on The Simpsons such as Night of the Living Treehouse of Horror and The Simpsons Game. In addition, the dog has been made into action figures by McFarlane Toys, action figures by Playmates Toys in the World of Springfield series, and plush toys.|$|E
5|$|The Sundial Room, {{also called}} the Meridian Hall, was once the {{residence}} of Queen Christina of Sweden, then newly converted to Catholicism. The room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name: a sundial, and a delicate but sophisticated anemoscope which was fixed to {{the ceiling of the}} Meridian Hall. These were created by Ignazio Danti, the papal cosmographer, in association with the Gregorian Calendar Reform. The sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> a north-south direction, intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year.|$|E

5|$|The game restarted, {{but many}} Bayern players were {{overwhelmed}} with despair, virtually unable {{to continue and}} needed the assistance of referee Pierluigi Collina to drag themselves off the ground. They were stunned to have lost a game they had thought won just minutes before (several celebratory flares had already been ignited by the Munich fans moments before United equalised, and Bayern Munich ribbons had already been secured to the trophy itself {{in preparation for the}} presentation ceremony). United held onto their lead to record their second European Cup title. Samuel Kuffour broke down in tears after the game, beating <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> despair, and even the giant Carsten Jancker had collapsed in anguish. Matthäus had captained Bayern in the 1987 European Cup Final and lost in similar circumstances to two late Porto goals. He had been substituted with 10 minutes remaining, with victory seemingly assured, and the European Cup was the only major trophy he had failed to win during his career.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{improving}} navigation along the Kentucky River was raised numerous times by Representative James Blue during the 1876 legislative session. Despite Blue's promises of manifold {{benefits to the}} state from such an investment, parsimonious legislators defeated a bill allocating funds for the improvements. The issue gained traction with some voters during the biennial legislative elections, however, which brought it back to <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> the 1878 session. Prompted by recommendations from the Kentucky River Navigation Convention in 1877, McCreary abandoned his typical fiscal conservatism and joined the calls for improvements along the river. In response, legislators passed a largely ineffective bill providing that, if funds could be raised through special taxes in districts along the river, the state would provide the funds to maintain the improvements.|$|E
5|$|Agungs {{also play}} a major role in agung orchestras—ensembles {{composed}} of large hanging, suspended or held, knobbed gongs which act as drones without any accompanying melodic instrument like a kulintang. Such orchestras are prevalent among Indigenous Philippine groups (Bagobo, Bilaan, Bukidon, Hanunoo, Magsaka, Manabo, Mangyan, Palawan, Subanun, Suludnon, T’boli, Tagakaolu, Tagbanwa and the Tiruray), regions in Kalimantan and Indonesia (Iban, Modang, Murut) and Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysia (Bidayuh, Iban, Kadazan-Dusun, Kajan, Kayan), places where agung orchestras take precedence over kulintang-like orchestras. The composition and tuning of these orchestras vary widely from one group to another. For instance, the Hanunoo of Mindoro have a small agung ensemble consisting of only two light gongs played by two musicians on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> a simple duple rhythm while the Manobo have an ensemble (called an ahong) consisting of 10 small agungs hung vertically on a triangular frame. It includes three musicians: one standing up, playing the melody, and the rest sitting. The ahong is divided by purpose, with the higher-pitched gongs (kaantuhan) carrying the melody, three to four lower-pitched gongs (gandingan) playing melodic ostinato figures, and the lowest-pitched gong (bandil) setting the tempo.|$|E

5|$|The James Edgar and Jean Jessop Hervey Public Library {{opened in}} 2003, {{replacing}} {{a much smaller}} public library. The new library, built by Conwell Shonkwiler & Associates, was partly funded by a donation via the San Diego Foundation from the Hervey family, who had {{close ties to the}} area. Jean Jessop Hervey in particular used to visit the old Point Loma Library every Tuesday to read with her children. The library, located at 3701 Voltaire Street, is over 25,000 square feet and holds over 80,000 books. It includes a kitchen area, a community meeting room, and outdoor sitting patios. The lower floor is the largest children's library in the City of San Diego, featuring a simulated ship, reading desks shaped like surfboards, an art space and a Story Time Zone. In connecting to the place of Point Loma, the library's architectural style features a nautical theme. There is even an operating periscope, salvaged from a U.S. Navy submarine, through which visitors can see the surrounding neighborhood. <b>The</b> <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> the entry lobby features a terrazzo map of the Point Loma Peninsula. The library holds scheduled events such as story time for children, Thursday after school movies, and arts and crafts demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|Trinidad was {{subsequently}} scheduled {{to fight against}} Hacine Cherifi in a contest that he won by technical knockout in the fourth round. The event {{was part of a}} card that took place on May 11, 2002, and was organized in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Early in the first round Trinidad's strategy consisted of using his jab while Cherifi did not try to directly engage in the offensive. In the last minute of the round a punch by Trinidad hit Cherifi's chin leaving him disoriented, he followed this with a combination and scored a knockdown. In the second round, Trinidad displayed more boxing and was on the offensive by using combinations to the head and ribs. In the third Cherifi landed more punches than in the previous two, but Trinidad relied on throwing left jabs. One of his punches hit Cherifi's liver, followed by a punch to the jaw, making Cherifi fall to <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>In</b> the fourth, a series of combinations injured Cherifi, who collapsed to the floor twice, forfeiting the fight on the second occasion. Following this contest Trinidad announced his retirement, at the moment leaving the sport with a record of 41wins, one defeat, and 34wins by knockout.|$|E
