25|$|In 2006, I made {{a serious}} error in {{judgment}} and conducted {{myself in a}} way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of her birth, it was unknown if she was a male or female, as it was {{considered}} too dangerous to approach her and her parents. [...] Her handlers assumed she was a male and originally named her [...] "Sonny Jim". When it was established that Pattycake was a female, a contest was held by the New York Daily News to find her a name. [...] "Patty Cake", the winning entry, was submitted by New York fireman John O'Connor, who named the gorilla after his wife and a proposed daughter. [...] "It just so happens that we have three boys and I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> that if we ever have a girl, we should name her Patty, which happens to be her name. I thought we'd let the baby gorilla use the name in the meantime," [...] O'Connor told reporters.|$|E
2500|$|On May 9, 2011, Shriver and Schwarzenegger {{ended their}} {{relationship}} after 25 years of marriage, with Shriver {{moving out of}} the couple's Brentwood mansion. On May 16, 2011, the Los Angeles Times revealed that Schwarzenegger had fathered a son more than fourteen years earlier with an employee in their household, Mildred Patricia 'Patty' Baena. [...] "After leaving the governor's office I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> about this event, which occurred over a decade ago," [...] Schwarzenegger said in a statement issued to The Times. In the statement, Schwarzenegger did not mention that he had confessed to his wife only after Shriver had confronted him with the information, which she had done after confirming with the housekeeper what she had suspected about the child.|$|E

2500|$|The book is {{dedicated}} [...] "To the Wife of My Youth". This dedication {{appears in the}} first printing run of about 5,000 copies, all either in the 1st edition, 1st state binding or in two alternate bindings. In an 1887 printing of Ben-Hur at the Rare Books Department of the Cincinnati Public Library, Lew Wallace wrote to Alexander Hill: [...] "My Dear Friend HillWhen Ben-Hur was finished, I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{it was to be}} dedicated to her, and that she must furnish the inscription. She wrote 'To the Wife of My Youth' / The book became popular; then I began to receive letters of sympathy and enquiries as to when and of what poor Mrs. Wallace died. I laughed at first, but the condolences multiplied until finally I told the good woman that having got me into the trouble she must now get me out, which she did by adding the words--'Who still abides with me.' / The device was perfect." [...] Wallace apparently also received many marriage proposals due to the misunderstanding.|$|E

[...] "I'm <b>told</b> you've invited <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and myself here to your house in order to spy upon us, under the {{impression}} that I was Clay, the notorious swindler!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{innocent}} man," [...] he sternly declared, [...] "would have <b>told</b> me that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{had been}} to see him--you kept it a secret. An innocent woman would have given me a reason for wishing to go to you--she kept it a secret, when she left my house; she kept it a secret when she came back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} it is truthfulness," [...] he told her. [...] "That is no virtue on my part. It is sheer necessity. I am quite sure that if I had not been obliged I should never have told you that it was I who stared at you from the Common there, one of a hideous little band of trippers. I should not even have <b>told</b> you about <b>my</b> <b>wife.</b> It is all so humiliating." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So you <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> you'd {{respect her}} secret--keep her dishonor from husband and daughter?" [...] demanded Belding, his dark gaze {{sweeping}} {{back from the}} lane.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I heard a yellin' {{around the}} ice-houses, and I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> I'd dress and {{come over and}} see what it meant. Hope you ain't done no damage," [...] the man continued, {{somewhat}} anxiously.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{to make an}} offer," [...] went on {{the earnest}} whisper of the other man. [...] "A sum of money. But {{to tell you the}} truth I don't believe very much in its success." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, son, look things {{square in}} the eye. Men of violent, lonely, toilsome lives store up hunger {{for the love of}} woman. Love of a STRANGE woman, if you want to put it that way. It's nature. It seems all the {{beautiful}} young women in Utah are corralled in this valley. When I come over here I feel natural, but I'm not happy. I'd like to make love to--to that flower-faced girl. And I'm not ashamed to own it. I've <b>told</b> Molly, <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> and she understands. As for Joe, it's much harder for him. Joe never has had a wife or sweetheart. I tell you he's sick, and if I'd stay here a month I'd be sick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} it could have happened," [...] the breaker boss said, [...] "for I haven't <b>told</b> even <b>my</b> own <b>wife</b> that you was to be Joe's butty; but these young villains know all about it. I've heard Skip tellin' his cronies, an' I'm sure they're up to some mischief. Be careful, an' don't go outside alone, leastways, not till the {{business}} of the riot has blown over." ...|$|R
5000|$|A large {{bird's-eye view}} of Los Angeles is shown with {{searchlights}} moving to a conga beat. The action {{takes place in the}} famed Ciro's nightclub, where the Hollywood stars are having dinner â€” at $50 ($ today) a plate and [...] "easy terms". The first stars seen are Claudette Colbert, Don Ameche, and, at a table behind them, Adolphe Menjou and Norma Shearer, followed by Cary Grant, seated alone. Grant talks to himself: [...] "What a place! What a place! It's as pretty as a picture. But if I ever <b>told</b> <b>my</b> favorite <b>wife</b> the awful truth I'd land right on the front page. Yessireee Bobby." [...] (All these jokes are references to some of his films, although The Front Page was retitled His Girl Friday after it was mostly completed.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, no,' said I; 'as I {{have not}} <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> of course I shall not tell him. I am much obliged {{to you for}} your {{willingness}} to stay. It would be very awkward if you should go.' ...|$|E
60|$|Going {{back to the}} eating-chamber, in a {{few words}} I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and the guests how the matter stood, praying the oldest man among the latter to take my place by the bride, which he did unwillingly, muttering {{that this was an}} unlucky {{marriage}} feast.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had only}} one regret in leaving Europe, {{and that was that}} my {{faithful}} friend, the noble and devoted invisible dog, was obliged to remain {{on the other side of}} the Atlantic.

I never <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> of his existence, and if she had accidentally discovered it, I know not what might have been the effects upon her nervous system.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{being asked}} whether Bishop Iriney's actions made him suspicious, Trofimoff responded, [...] "No, {{not in the}} beginning. I said I needed money. And I <b>told</b> him <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> bought some {{furniture}} and I can't pay for it, I don't {{know how to get}} the money. And he says, 'I tell you what, I'll loan it to you.' So he gave me, I think, 5,000 marks and then, it wasn't enough, because I needed more, and about three or four weeks later I said to him, 'You gotta help me one more time, and I'll give it back to you when I have a chance.' And {{that was the end of}} it. Then he talked to me a couple times. Always like this. Then he says, 'Well, you know, I'll tell you what. You don't owe me any money. And if you need some more, I can give you some more. Don't worry about it. You're going to have to have a few things, this and that.' And this is how it started." ...|$|R

The {{soldiers}} coolly <b>told</b> me and <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> that their white man [...] did not want them to bring infants to their place. They dragged the [...] women off and left the infant beside us, but we sent the child to its [...] mother, and said we would report the matter to {{the chief of the}} post. [...] We did so, but the men were not punished. The principal offender was [...] told before me he would get fifty lashes, but I heard the same mouth [...] send a message to say he would not be flogged." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{might be}} some truth in this, I thought: at any rate, when rogues fall out, honest men come by their own: and now I began to suspect, I am sorry to say, that both the {{attorney}} and the Director had {{a little of the}} rogue in their composition. It was especially about <b>my</b> <b>wife's</b> fortune that Mr. B. showed his cloven foot: for proposing, as usual, that I should purchase shares with it in our Company, I <b>told</b> him that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> was a minor, and as such her little fortune was vested out of my control altogether. He flung away in a rage at this; and I soon saw that he did not care for me any more, by Abednego's manner to me. No more holidays, no more advances of money, had I: on the contrary, the private clerkship at 150l. was abolished, and I found myself on my 250l. a year again. Well, what then? it was always a good income, and I did my duty, and laughed at the Director.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{it seems}} {{that some of the}} neighbors had <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> of all that {{happened}} at the club, and she was nearly frightened out of her wits because I had stayed away so long. When I told her of my promise to Cheeko, she said flatly that she wouldn't lift a paw to help an idle fellow who was always finding fault with everybody instead of getting in his winter's supply of nuts; but after hearing how badly off he was, she took it all back and set about making the herb tea.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know as I've got {{any right}} to trouble you with this thing," [...] he said, in the moment while Sewell sat pondering the case, [...] "and I don't know as I've got any warrant for doing it. But, as I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> here, there was {{something}} about you--I don't know whether it was anything you SAID exactly--that made me feel as if you could help us. I guess I didn't say so much as that to her; but that's the way I felt. And here we are. And if it ain't all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 263. Then {{with joy}} I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> O now I know, I know! But {{that night was}} a good night to me, I never had but few better; I longed for the company of some of God's people that I might have {{imparted}} unto them what God had showed me. Christ was a precious Christ to my soul that night; I could scarce lie in my bed for joy, and peace, and triumph, through Christ; this great glory did not continue upon me until morning, yet that twelfth of the author to the Hebrews (Heb 12:22,23) was a blessed scripture to me for many days together after this.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> was in the room, had shaken hands with Mr. Gilbert, and had been <b>told</b> of <b>my</b> {{suspected}} madness. She turned pale, but smiled.|$|R
60|$|Still, I must go {{upon the}} king's business, and I <b>told</b> this to <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> Macropha, {{the mother of}} Nada, and, as it was thought, of Umslopogaas, the son of Chaka. But when I spoke to Macropha of the matter she burst into tears and clung to me. I asked her why she wept thus, and she {{answered}} that the shadow of evil lay upon her heart, for she was sure that if I left her at the king's kraal, when I returned again I should find neither her nor Nada, my child, nor Umslopogaas, who was named my son, and whom I loved as a son, still {{in the land of}} life. Then I tried to calm her; but the more I strove the more she wept, saying that she knew well that these things would be so.|$|R
60|$|I startled <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> at the doorway, so haggard was I. I {{went into}} the dining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could collect myself {{sufficiently}} I told her the things I had seen. The dinner, which was a cold one, had already been served, and remained neglected on the table while I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> story.|$|R
6000|$|... "The next place I live in," [...] he said, [...] "will be {{more than}} a hundred miles away. At that {{distance}} I may hope to keep events concealed which must be known only to ourselves. So far as I can see, there are no risks of discovery lurking in this place. My servants (only two in number) have both been born here, and have both <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> that they have no wish to go away. As to the person who introduced herself to me by the name of Miss Chance, she was traced to the railway station yesterday afternoon, and took her ticket for London." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> {{she was a}} fool; bade Mrs. Barry not be uneasy, and was hot upon going: I {{would take}} no denial from either party. How I {{was to get the}} money to go was the question; but that was solved by my good mother, who was always ready to help me on a pinch, and who {{produced}} sixty guineas from a stocking. This was all the ready money that Barry Lyndon, of Castle Lyndon, and married to a fortune of forty thousand a year, could command: such had been the havoc made in this fine fortune by my own extravagance (as I must confess), but chiefly by my misplaced confidence and the rascality of others.|$|E
6000|$|When I <b>told</b> <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> that I {{had caught}} three burglars, {{and they were}} fast bound in the library, she nearly fainted; and when I had revived her she begged me to promise that I would not go downstairs again until the police had carried away the horrible wretches. But I assured {{her that it was}} {{absolutely}} necessary for me to return to the library. She then declared that she would go with me, and if anything happened she would share my fate. [...] "Besides," [...] she said, [...] "if they are tied fast so they can't move, I should like to see what they look like. I never saw a burglar." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Doctor's first rhyme {{would make}} any Jew sick: I know it has made a fine lady in blue sick, For which she is gone in a coach to Killbrew sick, Like a hen I once had, from a fox when she flew sick: Last Monday a lady at St. Patrick's did spew sick: And made {{all the rest of}} the folks in the pew sick, The surgeon who bled her his lancet out drew sick, And stopp'd the distemper, as being but new sick. The yacht, the last storm, had all her whole crew sick; Had we two been there, it would have made me and you sick: A lady that long'd, is by eating of glue sick; Did you ever know one in a very good Q sick? I'm <b>told</b> that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> is by winding a clew sick; The doctors have made her by rhyme[1] and by rue sick. [...] There's a gamester in town, for a throw that he threw sick, And yet the whole trade of his dice he'll pursue sick; I've known an old miser for paying his due sick; At present I'm grown by a pinch of my shoe sick, And what would you have me with verses to do sick? Send rhymes, and I'll send you some others in lieu sick. [...] Of rhymes I have plenty, [...] And {{therefore}} send twenty.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1920s, ET Garner had {{acquired}} adjoining selection no.1174, and was resident there {{from at least}} 1921 to 1924. By late 1925, the Garners had returned to portion 10v, where they had about 800 citrus trees and 12 acres under bananas. There was a 5-roomed house on the property, 5 small accommodation huts, and a cow bail and yards. It is understood that the galvanised iron huts were erected in the 1920s as fishing/holiday accommodation {{for use by the}} Garner family, their visitors and paying holiday-makers, but served a more charitable purpose during the 1930s. JG Tierney, who married into the Garner family, later recalled:Many years later as I moved to different areas in the North with <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> and family I would work with men who, when <b>told</b> that <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> was a Garner from Garners Beach, would tell me of the fond memories of good times they had spent at Garners Beach and I started to realise that there was a story to the family that I didn't know and was never mentioned by them. As I understand it, during the 1930s depression some people who came on hard times were welcome to stay at the beach and as the area was nearly self-supporting nobody went hungry and after a period of time as they sorted themselves out would move on and continue with their lives.In 1931, ET Garner applied for an extension of his lease on Agricultural Farm no.755 (portion 10v). This was approved and extended to 30 years from 1 January 1911. A January 1931 inspection of the property concluded that it was a very well improved farm, recently extra good improvements effected for dairying.|$|R
6000|$|He sat down, and, after a pondering silence, {{in which}} he had {{remained}} with his head fallen upon his breast, [...] "My name is Jonathan Tinker," [...] he said, with the unaffected air which had already impressed the contributor, and as if he felt that some form of introduction was necessary, [...] "and the girl that I want to find is Julia Tinker." [...] Then he added, resuming the eventful personal history which the listener exulted, while he regretted, to hear: [...] "You see, I shipped first to Liverpool, and there I heard from my family; and then I shipped again for Hong-Kong, and after that I never heard a word: I seemed to miss the letters everywhere. This morning, at four o'clock, I left my ship as soon as she had hauled into the dock, and hurried up home. The house was shut, and not a soul in it; and I didn't know what to do, and I sat down on the doorstep to wait till the neighbors woke up, to ask them what had become of my family. And the first one come out he <b>told</b> me <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> had been dead a year and a half, and the baby I'd never seen, with her; and one of my boys was dead; and he didn't know where the rest of the children was, but he'd heard two of the little ones was with a family in the city." ...|$|R
