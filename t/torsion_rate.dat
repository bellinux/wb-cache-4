40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} normal values for regional and global myocardial wall motion parameters in young and elderly individuals, as detected by navigator gated high temporal resolution tissue phase mapping. Radial, longitudinal and circumferential ventricular wall motion, as well as ventricular torsion and longitudinal strain rates, were assessed in two age groups of volunteers, 23 ± 3 (n = 14) and 66 ± 7 years old (n = 9), respectively. All subjects were healthy, non-smokers without known cardiac disease. An increased global left ventricular (LV) <b>torsion</b> <b>rate</b> (peak systolic <b>torsion</b> <b>rate</b> 20. 6 ± 2. 0 versus 14. 5 ± 1. 0 °/s/cm, peak diastolic <b>torsion</b> <b>rate</b> - 25. 2 ± 1. 8 versus - 14. 1 ± 1. 3 °/s/cm) and a decrease in longitudinal LV motion (peak systolic values at mid-ventricle 5. 9 ± 0. 5 versus 8. 5 ± 0. 8 cm/s, peak diastolic values - 10. 7 ± 0. 7 versus - 15. 2 ± 0. 9 cm/s) in the older age group were the most prominent findings. Lower peak diastolic radial velocities with a longer time-to-peak values, most pronounced at the apex, are consistent with reduced diastolic function with ageing. Lower peak clockwise and counter-clockwise velocities at all LV levels revealed limitations in resting LV rotational motions in the older group. Significant changes in the undulating pattern of the rotational motions of the left ventricle were also observed. The results demonstrate distinct changes in regional and global myocardial wall motion in elderly individuals. Increased LV <b>torsion</b> <b>rate</b> and reduced LV longitudinal motion were particularly prominent in the older group. These parameters may have a role in the assessment of global LV contractility and help differentiate age-related changes from cardiac disease...|$|E

Materials and methods: This was a descriptive–retrospective study in which all consecutive cases of acute scrotum treated in our department from March 2008 to March 2012 were evaluated. Results: A total of 116 cases were included in the study. Out of these cases, 100 cases underwent surgical exploration, and the remaining 16 cases were managed conservatively. Our eligible cases were divided into three groups: the testicular torsion (TT) group (68 %); the torsion of the appendix testis (AT) group (20 %); and the epididymo-orchitis (EO) group (9 %). Testicular preservation was achieved in 39 cases of the TT group, while due to delayed referral, orchiectomy was performed in 29 cases.

Twenty-two dogs were randomly divided into three groups: control group (n =  7), PAH group (n =  8), and PAH + RSD group (n =  7). All dogs were assessed using two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging. The ventricular strain, ventricular synchrony, left ventricular (LV) twist, and <b>torsion</b> <b>rate</b> were analyzed to evaluate cardiac function. After 8 weeks, the right ventricular lateral longitudinal strain and the septum longitudinal strain were reduced in the PAH group compared with the control group (p <  0. 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain new details of {{three-dimensional}} left ventricular wall motion related to ventricular remodeling in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. METHODS: Cardiac-gated, phase-contrast measurements using navigator-gated, high temporal resolution, tissue phase mapping were obtained on 19 patients (66 ± 7 years old) before and after CABG. Left ventricular motion patterns and myocardial velocities were recorded for radial, circumferential and longitudinal motion. Radial, circumferential and longitudinal velocity curves were obtained separately for 16 ventricular segments. Ventricular <b>torsion</b> <b>rate</b> and longitudinal strain rate were also derived pre- and post-surgery. RESULTS: After CABG, there was a significant improvement in apical contraction, with an apparent paradoxical decrease in the radial inward motion of the septal segments at the left ventricular base. Despite improved ventricular contractility during systole, peak longitudinal and rotational velocities decreased or showed no significant changes. An altered pattern of rotational motion with decreased initial counter-clockwise rotation at the beginning of systole and subsequent lower amplitude of reversed motions in diastole was also noted in most left ventricular segments. Lower peak clockwise rotational velocities were recorded in the basal anteroseptal segment with relatively higher values in the rest of the basal segments. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that post-operative changes after CABG are limiting ventricular rotational and longitudinal motions, despite an increase in ventricular contractility due to revascularization. At the ventricular base, the restrained rotational motion of basal anteroseptal segment, located proximally to the right ventricular insertion, and higher rotational velocities of the rest of the segments are pushing the septum toward the right ventricle during ventricular twisting. At the ventricular apex, the restrain in rotational motion caused by post-operative adhesions is affecting all apical segments due to a much smaller left ventricular diameter at this level. The rotating apex and the apical septum are similarly displaced toward the right ventricle during ventricular twisting...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{characterize}} the early features of diabetic cardiomyopathy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tagging. BackgroundThe earliest manifestations of diabetic cardiomyopathy have not been well established, especially under tight glycemic management. We hypothesized that torsion measurements would identify subclinical contractile alterations in type I diabetics with normal left ventricular ejection fraction, mass, blood pressure, and aggressive glycemic control. We also sought to characterize the influence of elevated resting heart rates (HRs) of diabetics on torsion. MethodsSixteen patients with type I diabetes and 10 control patients underwent cine and tagged MRI with a 1. 5 -T scanner. Torsion, strain, and their rates were measured. To quantify the influence of chronotropic and inotropic stimulation on torsion, nine healthy volunteers underwent MRI tagging at rest, after atropine injection, and after exercise. ResultsDiabetic patients (hemoglobin A 1 c, 6. 8 ± 0. 4 %) had a higher resting HR (77. 0 ± 12. 4 beats/min vs. 59. 0 ± 5. 6 beats/min; p < 0. 01), higher maximal torsion by 23 % (3. 5 ± 0. 9 °/cm vs. 2. 7 ± 0. 4 °/cm; p < 0. 01) and higher maximal systolic <b>torsion</b> <b>rate</b> (TR-s) by 25 % (0. 013 ± 0. 003 °/cm/s vs. 0. 010 ± 0. 002 °/cm/s, p = 0. 01). Torsion did not significantly change with chronotropic stimulation (p = 0. 30). ConclusionsIn diabetics under tight glycemic control, we observed a surprising increase in torsion and TR-s unrelated to chronotropic influences of HR. We propose that increased torsion and TR-s could represent early predictive markers of the propensity to cardiac dysfunction in asymptomatic type I diabetics. Furthermore, these findings seem fundamental to the diabetic state itself and unaccounted for by other comorbidities...|$|E
50|$|When {{a spring}} is {{compressed}} or stretched from its resting position, it exerts an opposing force approximately proportional to its change in length (this approximation breaks down for larger deflections). The rate or spring constant of a spring {{is the change}} in the force it exerts, divided by the change in deflection of the spring. That is, it is the gradient of the force versus deflection curve. An extension or compression spring's rate is expressed in units of force divided by distance, for example lbf/in or N/m. A torsion spring is a spring that works by twisting; when it is twisted about its axis by an angle, it produces a torque proportional to the angle. A <b>torsion</b> spring's <b>rate</b> is in units of torque divided by angle, such as N·m/rad or ft·lbf/degree. The inverse of spring rate is compliance, that is: if a spring has a rate of 10 N/mm, it has a compliance of 0.1 mm/N. The stiffness (or rate) of springs in parallel is additive, as is the compliance of springs in series.|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular {{magnetic}} resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) offers quantification of myocardial deformation from routine cine images. However, data using CMR-FT to quantify left ventricular (LV) torsion and diastolic recoil {{are not yet}} available. We therefore sought to evaluate the feasibility and reproducibility of CMR-FT to quantify LV torsion and peak recoil rate using an optimal anatomical approach. Short-axis cine stacks were acquired at rest and during dobutamine stimulation (10 and 20 µg · kg(- 1) · min(- 1)) in 10 healthy volunteers. Rotational displacement was analysed for all slices. A complete 3 D-LV rotational model was developed using linear interpolation between adjacent slices. Torsion {{was defined as the}} difference between apical and basal rotation, divided by slice distance. Depending on the distance between the most apical (defined as 0 % LV distance) and basal (defined as 100 % LV distance) slices, four different models for the calculation of torsion were examined: Model- 1 (25 - 75 %), Model- 2 (0 - 100 %), Model- 3 (25 - 100 %) and Model- 4 (0 - 75 %). Analysis included subendocardial, subepicardial and global <b>torsion</b> and recoil <b>rate</b> (mean of subendocardial and subepicardial values). Quantification of <b>torsion</b> and recoil <b>rate</b> was feasible in all subjects. There {{was no significant difference between}} the different models at rest. However, only Model- 1 (25 - 75 %) discriminated between rest and stress (Global Torsion: 2. 7 ± 1. 5 ° cm(- 1), 3. 6 ± 2. 0 ° cm(- 1), 5. 1 ± 2. 2 ° cm(- 1), p< 0. 01; Global Recoil Rate: - 30. 1 ± 11. 1 ° cm(- 1) s(- 1),- 46. 9 ± 15. 0 ° cm(- 1) s(- 1),- 68. 9 ± 32. 3 ° cm(- 1) s(- 1), p< 0. 01; for rest, 10 and 20 µg · kg(-) 1 · min(- 1) of dobutamine, respectively).

Initial studies were based on tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) operating at high temporal resolution. As a user-friendly alternative, speckle tracking imaging (STI) might be used to asses LV UR. However, this technique typically works on lower temporal resolution data and might not properly resolve peak LV UR. Objectives. To estimate LV UR using STI and TDI and to correlate both with LV diastolic function. Methods. Five pigs were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. A pressure catheter was advanced into LV. A fluid-filled balloon catheter was introduced in descending aorta. A pacing catheter was inserted into right heart for atrial (RA) or ventricular (RV) pacing. Subsequent echo imaging and invasive LV pressure measurements were performed during RA pacing, dobutamine challenge, afterload increase and RV pacing. LV torsion and <b>torsion</b> <b>rate</b> profiles were analyzed from gray scale and tissue Doppler data (apical and basal short axis) at frame rate of 98. 1 ± 19. 7 and 182. 1 ± 19. 3 Hz, respectively.

Repeated-measures regression models of peak LV UR, estimated by both TDI and STI, showed a significant correlation with the time constant of LV pressure decay τ, although the correlation regarding TDI was stronger (r=-. 50, p=. 02 versus r=-. 56, p =. 01).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{establish}} prospectively {{a database}} of normal three-dimensional systolic and diastolic endocardial and epicardial velocity values for all myocardial segments in healthy volunteers by using cine phase-contrast velocity magnetic resonance imaging, also called tissue phase mapping (TPM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study {{was approved by the}} institutional ethics committee and was conducted according to principles of the Declaration of Helsinki; each subject provided informed written consent. Ninety-six healthy volunteers (57 [59 %] men, 39 [41 %] women; mean age, 38 years +/- 12 [standard deviation]) underwent cardiac phase-contrast imaging with a black blood segmented k-space gradient-echo sequence for the analysis of three-dimensional myocardial velocity with high spatial resolution at 1. 5 T on basal, midventricular, and apical short-axis views. Eighteen consecutive volunteers were imaged twice to determine interstudy reproducibility, and intra- and interobserver variability values were analyzed. Systolic and diastolic velocity curves were analyzed for peak velocity and time to peak velocity in the radial, circumferential, and longitudinal directions, as well as for <b>torsion</b> <b>rate</b> and longitudinal strain rate. Mixed-effects models with a random intercept for volunteers were used to test differences among the three ventricular sections and the transmural, endocardial, and epicardial parameters. RESULTS: TPM enabled reproducible assessment of myocardial velocity with small intra- and interobserver variability values. Systolic peak radial velocity was lowest at the apical level (P <. 001); diastolic peak radial velocity was similar at all three myocardial levels (P =. 73). As viewed from the apex, a relative counterclockwise rotation during systole was followed by a relative clockwise rotation of the apex against the base. Diastolic and systolic peak longitudinal velocity values decreased from base to apex (P <. 001). A gradient between endocardium and epicardium was observed for radial velocity values, with greater endocardial velocity values (P <. 001).

MethodsAccording to a fully randomized design, 18 goats were evenly {{divided into three}} groups: normal bone control group (Group A), autologous bone group (Group B) and experimental group (Group C). Each goat in Groups B and C were subjected to the periosteum and bone defect at middle-lower part of the right tibia (20 % of the whole tibia in length), followed by autologous bone or DPB plus autologous MSCs + rhBMP 2 implantation, respectively and semiring slot fixation; while goats in Group A did not perform osteotomy.

ECAP was performed using 4, 16 and 24 passes, and HPT was performed using 1 / 2, 1 and 10 turns. The results show that while recovery occurs during both ECAP and HPT processing, copper shows a faster recovery rate with HPT processing than ECAP.

Data relating untwisting, relax-ation, and intraventricular pressure gradients (IVPG), which represent another manifestation of elastic recoil, are sparse. To understand {{the interaction between}} LV mechanics and inflow during early diastole, Doppler tissue images (DTI), catheter-derived pressures (apical and basal LV, left atrial, and aortic), and LV volume data were obtained at baseline, during varying pacing modes, and during dobutamine and esmolol infusion in seven closed-chest anesthetized dogs.

40|$|Next {{generation}} fast spectrum reactors require {{structural materials}} that can tolerate higher temperature and radiation damage {{compared to the}} currently used metal alloys. It has been discovered that the ferritic steels having bcc structure have higher swelling and creep resistance than the fcc austenitic steels. However, once the ferritic steels reach the steady state swelling regime, they can end up with considerable swelling. Radiation damage resistance in metals is directly correlated with the microstructure. In terms of microstructure tailoring to reduce radiation damage, the density of sinks (dislocations, grain boundaries, phase boundaries, twin boundaries etc.) can be increased. In this research, engineering alloys were produced with increased sink densities by various processing methods {{in order to improve}} swelling resistance. Various alloys of EK- 181, HT- 9 and 14 YWT were processed by high pressure <b>torsion</b> (HPT), high <b>rate</b> shock deformation and hydrostatic extrusion, respectively. The effects of the resultant microstructures on the irradiation response of the materials were investigated with special interest paid to the influence of grain boundaries, phase boundaries and dislocations on swelling. In this study, we reported that initial stable and homogenous microstructure is the key to determine swelling resistance. Homogenously distributed nano-sized oxide dispersoids act as sinks for defects and help to stabilize microstructures through pinning dislocations and grain boundaries. The stability of oxide dispersoids is determined by irradiation conditions and key parameters influencing dispersoids? stability are identified. The study is important for development of accident tolerant components for fast reactors...|$|R

Methods and resultsTwo-dimensional strain echocardiography was performed in 98 patients with HT and 22 age-matched normal controls. The LV mass index and relative wall thickness were used to assign patients into 3 groups with normal geometry (N-LV, n= 31), concentric hypertrophy (C-LVH, n= 25), and eccentric hypertrophy (E-LVH, n= 42). The LV ejection fraction was preserved (≥ 50 %) in the 3 HT groups. The mean peak systolic longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strains in the C-LVH group were lower compared to the control and other 2 HT groups. The mean peak systolic strain rates in the 3 directions in the C-LVH group {{and those in the}} longitudinal and radial directions in the E-LVH and N-LV groups were lower compared to the control group. In addition, the mean peak systolic circumferential strain rate was lower in the C-LVH group than in the other 2 HT groups. There were no differences in the LV <b>torsion</b> and torsional <b>rate</b> between the control and 3 HT groups. The mean peak systolic circumferential strain was an independent predictor related to LV ejection fraction in all patients.

Torsion at the anastomosis site {{is one of}} the most basic technical errors. In this study, we investigate the effect of different degrees of microarterial torsion on patency and its physical changes on anastomosis in a rat model. A total of 144 microanastomosis were performed in 72 Sprague-Dawley rats. They were divided into 9 groups. The anastomosis was performed at 0 °, 45 °, 90 °, 135 °, 180 °, 225 °, 270 °, 315 °, and 360 ° of <b>torsion</b> randomly. Patency <b>rates</b> and the narrowest point of the artery after the anastomosis were recorded after 1 hour for each group. In the second stage of the study, the 9 groups were divided into 2 groups for patency rates and histopathological sampling at the second and seventh days postoperatively. The femoral arteries in all groups were all patent at the end of 1 hour. Only 5 microanastomosis were thrombosed (one in the 45 ° group, one in the 225 ° group, one in the 270 ° group, and two in the 315 ° group) at the second day of exploration. Only two arteries were thrombosed (one in the 45 ° group and one in the 315 ° group) at the seventh day of exploration. The patency rate was 96. 8 % in experimental groups excluding the control group. Different degrees of torsion had no statistically significant effect on the patency rates of microvascular anastomosis. Torsional repair of the femoral artery in the rat has no significant histopathologic changes, but alternately, endothelial integrity was affected by excessive degrees of torsion. Different degrees of torsion at the anastomosis site do not affect patency rates and cross sectional histology of rat femoral arteries. In clinical practice, minor torsion can be tolerated, however, factors affecting patency such as tension, diameter disproportion, and tight closure can affect the final result of anastomosis. We observed that torsional force of the vessel is distributed along the artery to the weakest point. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Crystallographic texture in {{polycrystalline}} {{materials are}} known {{to play an important}} role in tailoring suitable properties for various technological applications. In addition, the evolution of texture provides a profound basis to develop scientific understanding of physical processes occurring in the material during deformation and annealing. Between the two, the understanding of deformation texture is much broader. However, certain issues pertaining to the evolution of deformation texture evolution are yet to be explored or not uniquely agreed upon. A few notable examples are the effects of extreme grain sizes and strain rates. Moreover, most of the studies are pertaining to single phase metals and alloys. While many engineering alloys consist of two phase microstructures, the effect of second phase in the microstructure on the evolution of texture in the individual phases has not been studied in a comprehensive manner. The present thesis is an attempt to addresses these issues in a more generic manner. The studies have been specifically aimed at examining the aforesaid issues in the close packed Face Centre Cubic (FCC) and Hexagonal Close Packed (HCP) metals and alloys. In brief, this thesis addresses the following problems pertaining to deformation texture: (i) the effect of extreme grain sizes, (ii) the effect of extreme strain rates and (iii) the effect of a second ductile phase. Chapter 1 of the thesis gives a detailed survey of literature pertaining to the evolution of deformation textures in different metals and alloys, while chapter 2 includes the details of the experimental techniques and simulation procedures, which are mostly common for the entire work. The issue of grain size is addressed in chapter 3. In the present investigation, the evolution of deformation texture in nickel (FCC) and titanium (HCP) with the extreme grain sizes (nanometre and millimetre) has been studied. Nanocrystalline nickel with the grain size ~ 20 nm was obtained by pulse electro-deposition while the other extreme of the grain size in nickel was obtained by annealing of a cold rolled sheet at 1373 K. The rolling texture in nanocrystalline nickel had a higher volume fraction of Brass component than in nickel with normal grain size. These results have been explained on the basis of inhibition of cross slip in small grain sizes and the operation of planar slip. This has been validated by viscoplastic self-consistent simulations. The texture of coarse grain nickel samples (typified as oligocrystalline, owing to the lesser number of grains in the thickness direction) also had higher Brass component like the nanocrystalline sample. A detailed analysis was performed by examining misorientation development in the grain interior and in the vicinity of the grain boundaries. The similarity at the two extreme length scales has been explained on the basis of lower “Grain Boundary Affected Zone” at the extreme length scales. To examine the effect of grain size in the case of HCP materials, commercially pure titanium with ultra-fine (500 nm) and normal grain size (~ 50 μm), was investigated. A monotonic evolution of texture was observed in the former, which has been attributed to the absence of twinning, a situation that could arise due to the lack of coordinated movement of twinning partials in the sub-micron grain size regime. Thus, a reasonable understanding of the evolution of deformation texture in hitherto unexplored regime of grain sizes was developed for the two materials. The chapter 4 of the thesis is dedicated to the study of strain rate effects in both FCC and HCP materials. The issue of strain rate has been addressed by two ways: (a) deforming the materials at extreme strain rates, namely 10 - 3 s- 1 to 10 + 3 s- 1 under compression up to a reasonable strain, and (b) deforming the materials under torsion within a reasonable range of strain rates, but up to large strains. In this case, in addition to nickel, copper was also investigated owing to the different strain hardening behaviour of the two materials. The compression texture in nickel and copper was characterized by the presence of component at low strain rates. At high strain rate, ~ 10 + 3 s- 1, there was a decrease in the intensity of the component for nickel but it strengthened for copper. This has been explained on the basis of continuous dynamic recrystallization in copper. The torsion texture evolution in nickel and copper was similar at low strain rate (10 - 3 s- 1) and was characterized by the presence of important shear texture components. At high strain rate (1 s- 1), texture weakened for nickel, while for copper a rotated cube component was observed which has been attributed to dynamic recrystallization. The effect of strain rate was studied more comprehensively in hexagonal titanium by adding one more variable, that is, the initial texture. Extreme strain rates were imparted using static and dynamic compression tests. It was found that different initial textures led to different mechanical response in terms of yield strength and strain hardening as well as microstructural response in terms of twin fractions. The samples deformed at high strain rate showed increased twinning that led to some scatter in the texture components compared to low strain rate deformed samples. VPSC simulations were able to successfully capture the evolution of texture as well as microstructural evolution in terms of twin activity in the deformed samples at the extreme strain <b>rates.</b> <b>Torsion</b> tests on titanium at different strain rates indicated evolution of inhomogeneous nature of fibre texture components with increase in strain rate. Thus, weakening of texture was observed irrespective of the strain path (compression or torsion) and crystal structure (FCC or HCP) unless additional restoration mechanism like recrystallization (continuous or discontinuous) intervened. In chapter 5, the evolution of rolling texture in two phase FCC + BCC (Ni-Fe-Cr alloys) and HCP + BCC (Ti- 13 Nb- 13 Zr) alloys has been studied. This study was aimed at examining the effect of second deforming phase on the texture evolution in the primary phase. The effect of various parameters like volume fraction and morphology of the second phase on deformation texture evolution was studied experimentally as well as by VPSC simulations. A reduction in the Brass component of texture was observed in the austenite phase due to the presence of harder ferrite phase while a characteristic rolling texture evolved in the ferrite phase. It has been established that the softer austenite phase carried maximum strain at low volume fractions of ferrite while the harder ferrite phase carried the maximum strain at higher volume fractions of ferrite. In case of the two phase HCP+BCC alloy Ti- 13 Nb- 13 Zr, both the hexagonal α and the cubic β phases showed a characteristic rolling texture irrespective of two different morphologies. For both the equiaxed and colony microstructures, the softer β phase carried the maximum strain. VPSC simulations were able to model the deformation texture evolution as well as microstructural parameters like strain partitioning and twin fraction satisfactorily for both the microstructural conditions. It was found that the deformation mechanism in one phase could be affected by the presence of the second phase and that a characteristic change in deformation texture could be produced in the presence of the second phase. Thus, a comprehensive perspective has been developed pertaining to the evolution of texture in FCC and HCP phases in the presence of a second ductile phase. The overall findings of the three investigations carried out for the thesis are summarised in chapter 6...|$|R
