The actors playing Ariel and the other merfolk had wire-frame tails attached to <b>their</b> <b>hips.</b> Subsequent productions feature different designs for Ariel and the merfolk; the Dutch and Japanese productions use wirework and aerial stunts {{to create the illusion}} of underwater swimming.|$|E
5|$|The video {{features}} Beyoncé {{and her two}} companions dancing {{inside an}} infinity cove, which alternates {{between black and white}} and places the focus on the complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake <b>their</b> <b>hips</b> and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move. At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to Shirley MacLaine's act in the 1969 film Sweet Charity. Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.|$|E
5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by <b>their</b> <b>hips</b> and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E

25|$|The {{rules of}} the ballgame are not known, but it was {{probably}} similar to volleyball, where {{the object is to}} keep the ball in play. In the most well-known version of the game, the players struck the ball with <b>their</b> <b>hips,</b> although some versions used forearms or employed rackets, bats, or handstones. The ball was made of solid rubber, and weighed up to 4kg or more, with sizes that differed greatly over time or according to the version played.|$|E

25|$|The lead jammer {{can stop}} the jam at any time by {{repeatedly}} placing both hands on <b>their</b> <b>hips.</b> If the jam is not stopped early, it ends after two minutes. If time remains in the period, teams then have 30 seconds {{to get on the}} track and line up for the next jam. Team members typically rotate between jams from the 14 players on the team's roster. Designations may change between jams: a pivot in one jam might be the jammer in a later jam.|$|E
25|$|Outriggers {{are used}} to stop using a {{technique}} that involves bringing the skiers elbows from their raised position down to <b>their</b> <b>hips</b> while pushing the outriggers down. When using the outrigger, skiers do not rotate their arms as this changes {{the location of the}} ski on the snow. Skiers with below the knee amputations get on and off the ski lift using the same technique as able-bodied skiers. Cerebral palsy skiers in this class may have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier with cerebral palsy may tire more quickly.|$|E
25|$|The correct {{position}} for this discipline, {{as in all}} forms of riding, is a balanced seat. This is seen when a bystander can run an imaginary straight line that passes through the rider's ear, shoulder, hip, and heel. This means the rider's feet and legs must hang directly in balance so that the heel hits this line, with heels down. The rider should also be sitting as straight as possible, but with <b>their</b> <b>hips</b> under their body, sitting firmly on their seat bones, not sitting on one's crotch with an arched back. The rider should have their weight sunk into their seat and distributed through their legs. The rider's shoulders should be rolled back and their chin up {{to show that they}} are looking forward.|$|E
50|$|The {{standards}} for Miniature Texas Longhorns {{are very similar}} as the guidelines for the main trache. Their general conformation is a good length with moderate depth and thickness. The tops of the hips should be higher than {{the tops of the}} shoulders. They often have squarely set legs with sound feet and joints that have strength, but also allow free movement. Bulls should be slightly thicker and heavier than cows showing masculinity. Texas Longhorns have a mild, tractable disposition, not showing aggressiveness or nervousness. According to the TLBAA, mature Miniature Texas Longhorns must have horns (measured tip-to-tip) of at least 50% <b>their</b> <b>hip</b> height with > 100% <b>their</b> <b>hip</b> height considered to be desirable. Miniature Texas Longhorns are not considered to be mature until they are 5 years of age.|$|R

25|$|The IRB trialled 23 {{changes to}} the modern laws in 2006 and some {{competitions}} in Scotland and Australia adopted them in 2007. In 2008, 13 of the variations were trialled globally. Important changes included; no gain in ground if the ball is kicked directly into touch {{after it has been}} moved back into the 22 by a player from the same team as the kicker, the offside lines for backs moved five metres from the scrum, allowing mauls to be legally pulled down and players to enter with their head lower than <b>their</b> <b>hips,</b> no restrictions on the number of players in a line-out, and allowing pregripping and lifting. In 2009 the IRB approved 10 of the laws, rejecting the laws relating to mauls, and numbers in a line-out.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, in two handed bowling, {{two fingers}} are {{inserted}} into the ball with the thumb left out. The dominant hand is then used to cradle the ball and creates extra spin on the release. Then, the opposite hand is used to guide the ball through the throwing motion, with the ball delivered shovel-style. Two handed bowlers are forced to flex forward farther and rotate <b>their</b> <b>hips</b> {{more than a single}} handed bowler. These bowlers are placing more torque through the spine in order to increase the ball speed and revolution rate. This form of bowling, if done correctly, increases force, revolutions and pin carry. A two handed bowler's revolution rate can reach up to 700 revolutions per minute, which is up to 17% more rotation than the nearest elite single handed bowler and twice what some top professional bowlers generate.|$|E
25|$|Free kicks {{are awarded}} for {{technical}} infringements {{that do not}} warrant a penalty. This includes indiscretions like players time wasting, charging over the 22-metre line during the oppositions drop-out, pushing in a ruck with their head lower than <b>their</b> <b>hips,</b> returning the ball to a ruck or maul, pretending to clear the ball from a ruck or maul and preventing the ball being thrown in at a quick line-out. Many infringements are penalised by free kicks during line-outs, including delaying or pretending {{to throw the ball}} in (balking), having less than two or more numbers than the opposition, leaving once the line-out has formed, failure to form a line-out, standing closer than five metres or over fifteen metres from the sideline, the receiver or opposition hooker (or equivalent player) standing in the incorrect position, not forming a straight line, not keeping a metre gap between the two lines, lifting a player below the shorts from behind or below the thighs from in front, jumping before the ball is thrown in, not lowering any lifted player, using only the outside arm to catch or deflect the ballor leaving the line-out before the ball is thrown, Free kicks are awarded at scrums are for delay in forming a scrum, incorrect or early binding of the front rows, pushing before the ball is fed, front rows feet off the ground before the ball is fed, the scrumhalf not feeding the ball in correctly or straight, intentionally kicking the ball out of the tunnel, bringing the ball back into the scrum after it has emerged, a non-front row player hooking the ball from the tunnel or the scrum half pretending to clear the ball from the scrum.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. Chambering should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their legs up close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of <b>their</b> <b>hips</b> downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E
