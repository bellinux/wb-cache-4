Cherson also retained the right to issue its own coins, having resumed minting under Emperor Michael III (r. 842–867), and was for a long time the only provincial mint outside Constantinople. Its autonomy is also evidenced by the fact that the imperial government paid annual subsidies (pakta) to the city leaders in the fashion of allied rulers, and in the advice of Emperor Constantine Porphyrogennetos (r. 913–959) in his De Administrando Imperio to the local strategos concerning the possibility of a revolt in the city: he was <b>to</b> <b>cease</b> <b>payment</b> of the subsidies and relocate to some other city in the theme.

To do this we are putting the greatest share of our profits back in the business. ” Minority shareholders were outraged. Two minority shareholders in particular, the Dodge brothers, brought suit seeking to stop Ford’s plans. The Dodge brothers argued that the primary purpose of a company is to maximize shareholder profits, not to help the community.

40|$|When equity default swap (EDS) {{contracts}} {{were first}} {{included in a}} rated collateralized debt obligation (CDO) deal, some critics doubted the originality of the product. In fact, EDSs are equivalent to already existing binary barrier options on equity, except the premium is not paid upfront, but over time, and conditional on the trigger event not having occurred. Therefore, as opposed to existing options, the buyer of an EDS: (1) postpones payment for protection, and (2) purchases not only protection against {{a sharp drop in}} the price of equity, but also the right <b>to</b> <b>cease</b> <b>payments</b> in case the barrier is hit. This paper derives the closed-form pricing formula for equity default swap spreads under the Black-Scholes assumptions, and then quantifies the fraction of the EDS spread actually due to the “swap ” feature of the contract for plausible parameter values. It is found that the extra spread due to the swap nature of EDSs is economically significant only for high volatility, high trigger levels, and long time-to-maturity. The impact of interest rates on the value of the “swap ” feature is almost exclusively due to the postponment of payments. ...|$|R

More formally, if a country reaches a point in which the level of utility obtained under default is higher than the level of utility it gets from paying its debt’s service, it will then be a rational economic decision to default. Nonetheless, the possibility of receiving financial aid can certainly contribute to avoid a sovereign default episode.|$|R

40|$|Rating agencies, by the {{assigned}} risk grades, {{point out the}} quality of debtors and credit instruments {{in terms of the}} probability <b>to</b> <b>cease</b> <b>payments</b> and the recovery possibilities. The existence and development of rating agencies on the capital markets is generally explained by the capacity they have to facilitate transparency and efficiency of markets, by reducing the informational asymmetry between the issuers and investors. It is acknowledged by the professional literature that rating agencies diminish the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard. This paper is another theoretical manner of approach, trying to prove that one of the main explanations of the rating agencies existence is the fact that these organizations allow the economy of the transaction costs. The first part of the article briefly describes the concepts of transaction and transaction costs. Also, this part presents a synthetic image of the role of rating agencies on the capital market. The second part makes an analysis of the transaction with rating, as a contractual transaction and, at the same time, a producer of externalities. The paper explains why the transactions with rating can be considered hybrid mechanisms of governance generating externalities upon the exchanges on the financial markets, allowing the creation of new hybrid organizational structures on these markets. Moreover an attempt has been made to list the main categories of transaction costs saved due to the rating agencies requirements. rating, rating agencies, transaction costs, financial market...|$|R

In 782, a major invasion, led by the Abbasid heir apparent, the future Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), resulted in a humiliating settlement for Byzantium, which was forced to sue for a truce in exchange for an annual payment of 160,000 gold nomismata. In 785, Empress-regent Irene of Athens resolved <b>to</b> <b>cease</b> the <b>payment</b> of the tribute, and warfare recommenced. The Arabs raided the Armeniac Theme, but in early 786 the Byzantines retaliated by sacking and razing to the ground the fortress town of Hadath in Cilicia, which the Abbasids had spent the last five years turning into a major stronghold and military base for their cross-border expeditions against Byzantium.|$|R

By 1856, real estate developers had begun to sell lots on the western edge of the park—along Missouri Avenue—and by 1858 lots on the east side—Mississippi Avenue—were being sold.

I construct a model that predicts, at the time of the initiation announcement, whether a firm is likely to pay dividends well into the future. My predictions also extend to performance; the firms that I predict to pay for a long period of time also outperform those whose payments I predict to be temporary. Thus, it appears that the relationship between dividend stickiness and long-run performance is not fully reflected in stock returns surrounding the announcements of dividen...|$|R
