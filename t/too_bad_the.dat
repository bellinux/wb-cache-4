500|$|Heather Phares of AllMusic {{described}} the boxset as [...] "beautifully packaged" [...] and practical, whereas The Austin Chronicle reviewer Melanie Haupt denoted the technical problems {{adjacent to the}} DualDisc, stating, [...] "The work and its evolution speaks for itself. (...) <b>Too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>the</b> hardware doesn't." [...] Mark Pytlik's review for Pitchfork Media contextualized Surrounded {{in a flurry of}} Björk releases. He stated it is not worth purchasing, adding that [...] "she's pretty much guaranteed to come back with another one that's bigger and better in a few years' time anyway." [...] Global Rhythms Jeff Tamarkin viewed the inclusion of [...] "the more sonically pedestrian original recordings" [...] as unnecessary, complimenting the remasters and videos.|$|E
500|$|... "Funeral" [...] was {{met with}} a wide range of reviews, from highly {{enthusiastic}} to harshly critical. Lisa Respers France of CNN said it was [...] "one of the best episodes ever", and MTV's Aly Semigran called it [...] "authentic" [...] and [...] "one of the very best" [...] of the season if not the series as a whole. Robert Canning of IGN wrote that it was [...] "a great episode that truly showcased the talents of Jane Lynch" [...] and rated it 8.5 out of 10. Rolling Stone Erica Futterman said that the episode [...] "felt like a recycled version of things we've seen previously" [...] and added that the show is [...] "not as entertaining when it's simply a showcase". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a [...] "C" [...] and characterized the funeral scene as [...] "the highlight of an uneven episode". The Atlantic Kevin Fallon wrote, [...] "Killing off Sue's sister seemed cruel, but ultimately paid off—it's <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>the</b> episode completely derailed afterward, dying its own rapid death in turn." [...] Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times had little good to say, and singled out the writers for doing [...] "such a crappy job" [...] on the penultimate episode of the season.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN rated it {{seven out}} of ten, noting that American viewers {{do not have to}} see the first series to be caught up, but added [...] "British fans might lament the absence of Richard Armitage's John Porter who was the ass-kicking hero of the {{original}} series." [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times described the series as a [...] "variation on [...] "24" [...] that offers reasonably competent action scenes, depressingly casual depictions of torture and death, and a comic-book conspiracy story line while also being an efficient nudity delivery system." [...] Brent MacKnight rated the series five out of ten, calling it a [...] "decent enough action yarn with slick production values," [...] but was critical that the series was [...] "more concerned with gratuitous nudity [...] each episode includes a lifetime's worth of breasts and butt cheeks–than creating a story with any substance, character, or emotional weight." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was more critical of the series, stating [...] "At first, [...] "Strike Back" [...] seems like a highbrow series on the order of [...] "," [...] but after a few minutes it [...] "conforms to the Skinemax nickname with a graphic sex scene," [...] with [...] "multiple exclamations of the f-word and bloodshed galore." [...] Owen summed [...] "Strike Back shows off high production values and an intense, fast-paced story reminiscent of 24 or Sleeper Cell that occasionally dips into the ridiculous [...] It's <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>the</b> show's graphic nature, especially the bloodshed, is so off-putting as to make the series unwatchable." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cycle {{magazine}} said in 1982 [...] "Three years later, {{after the}} wide proliferation of special styling, it's {{easy to forget}} what a landmark bike the Maxim was...The 650 was striking, controversial, sensational, and wildly successful in showrooms. Other companies have produced bodacious knock-offs of the 650 Maxim, imitations that suffer from excess. It's <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>the</b> Maxim was obscured when manufacturers blanketed the market with cruisers. A decade down the road, the Maxim {{may well be a}} genuine classic of the 1980s — a bright idea that stood the test of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{slightly}} positive review, {{giving it a}} C. She notes [...] "I was hoping against hope for Morgan Le Fay to show up, because outside of Guinevere, Camelot is pretty much a dudefest. But Adam Horowitz recently pointed out at a Comic Con that {{she will not be}} appearing, that they just didn’t have room for everyone, which is <b>too</b> <b>bad.</b> <b>The</b> knights are fun, but the earthy witches and sorcery of the women of Camelot (Morgan, Morgause, and Vivian) add a deeper dimension to the story. At least in between we get Snow and Charming having another real relationship talk (well, fight, but even that was refreshing), along with a simple example of trickery with a fake dagger that enables them to reveal Arthur’s menace. But it’s not a lot to pin a whole episode on, unless we all start sniffing the pink stuff." ...|$|E

60|$|My {{official}} {{friend was}} beginning 'the {{best of all}} possible--' when an inconvenient medical forefinger pointed out another passage in the evidence, from which {{it appeared that the}} lime-juice had been <b>bad</b> <b>too.</b> Not to mention that the vinegar had been <b>bad</b> <b>too,</b> <b>the</b> vegetables <b>bad</b> <b>too,</b> <b>the</b> cooking accommodation insufficient (if there had been anything worth mentioning to cook), the water supply exceedingly inadequate, and the beer sour.|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} is <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> about <b>the</b> crops not being good," [...] said Nellie, who, being {{the daughter of}} a farmer, knew exactly what such a calamity means to the average man who depends on the soil for his living.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Don Snowden awarded the album 2½ stars stating [...] "it really seems like Lester Bowie threw this group away -- <b>too</b> <b>bad,</b> because <b>the</b> {{combination}} of his sensibility, this genre, and these players {{had a lot}} of potential".|$|R
6000|$|... "It's <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>the</b> {{boys are}} going away," [...] was the answer. [...] "But I don't {{blame them for}} wanting {{to go on a}} hunt. If I were a boy I'd like to go on a hunt myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{should like}} to see them get five dozen lashes anyhow," [...] Jack said, [...] "well laid on by some of our fishermen. They would give it 'em heartily, and it would do them a world of good, and save many a life afterwards. It is <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>the</b> way those fellows go on; they don't care a bit about running down a small craft in the dark. In the first place, they know very well that they {{are not likely to be}} recognized, and so steam {{straight}} on, and leave men to drown; and in the next, if they are recognized, they are ready to swear that black is white all round, and will take their oaths you hadn't got your side-lights burning, or that you changed your course, and that they did all in their power to prevent a collision. I wish some of the people of the Board of Trade would come down the river sometimes in sailing-boats and see the way these coasters set the law at defiance, and fine them smartly. What is the use of making rules if they are never observed? Well, here we are home, and the church is just striking six, so we have hit off the time nicely." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Sir Steuart Bayley: [...] "The {{question}} before the Council is," [...] etc. There is {{a ripple of}} [...] "Ayes" [...] and [...] "Noes," [...] and the [...] "Noes" [...] have it, whatever it may be. The black-bearded gentleman springs his amendment about the voting qualifications. A large senator in a white waistcoat, and with a most genial smile, rises and proceeds to smash up the amendment. Can't see the use of it. Calls it in effect rubbish. The black dressing-gown, he who spoke first of all, speaks again, and talks of the [...] "sojourner who comes here for a little time, and then leaves the land." [...] Well {{it is for the}} black gown that the sojourner does come, or there would be no comfy places wherein to talk about the power that can be measured by wealth and the intellect [...] "which, sir, I submit, cannot be so measured." [...] The amendment is lost; and trebly and quadruply lost is the listener. In the name of sanity and to preserve the tattered shirt-tails of a torn illusion, let us escape! This is the Calcutta Municipal Bill. They have been at it for several Saturdays. Last Saturday Sir Steuart Bayley pointed out that at their present rate they would be about two years in getting it through. Now they will sit till dusk, unless Sir Steuart Bayley, who wants to see Lord Connemara off, puts up the black frock-coat to move an adjournment. It is not good to watch a Government close to. This leads to the formation of blatantly self-satisfied judgments, which may be quite as wrong as the cramping system with which we have encompassed ourselves. And in the streets outside Englishmen summarise the situation brutally, thus: [...] "The whole thing is a farce. Time is money to us. We can't stick out those everlasting speeches in the municipality. The natives choke us off, but we know that if things get <b>too</b> <b>bad</b> <b>the</b> Government will step in and interfere, and so we worry along somehow." ...|$|E
5000|$|An IGN review {{published}} {{following the}} game's release in North America read, [...] "Best {{described as an}} interactive movie about the Olympics, Virtua Athlete is as basic a game {{as you can get}} ...
