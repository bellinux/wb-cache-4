25|$|The Muslims of Jolo sacked {{the islands}} of Camotes, Leyte and Samar around 1663. The towns {{affected}} were Poro, Baibai, Sogod, Cabalian, Basey, Bangajon, Gibatan , and Capul.

He entered the Society in 1658 as an aspirant. Before taking his assignments in Bohol, Cebu, Iloilo and Cavite, Sogod and Cabalian were his first pastoral posts.
