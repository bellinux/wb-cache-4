50|$|Methods {{utilizing}} wavefront measurements or predictions can {{be considered}} an advanced approach to lens optics, where a single focal distance may not exist due to lens thickness or imperfections. Note also that for manufacturing reasons, a perfect lens has a spherical (or <b>toroidal)</b> <b>surface</b> shape though, theoretically, the ideal surface would be aspheric. Shortcomings such as these in an optical system cause what are called optical aberrations. The best-known aberrations include spherical aberration and coma. However {{there may be more}} complex sources of aberrations such as in a large telescope due to spatial variations in the index of refraction of the atmosphere. The deviation of a wavefront in an optical system from a desired perfect planar wavefront is called the wavefront aberration. Wavefront aberrations are usually described as either a sampled image or a collection of two-dimensional polynomial terms. Minimization of these aberrations is considered desirable for many applications in optical systems.|$|E

40|$|The {{vanishing}} of the divergence of {{the total}} stress tensor (magnetic plus kinetic) in a neighborhood of an equilibrium plasma containing a <b>toroidal</b> <b>surface</b> of discontinuity gives boundary and jump conditions that strongly constrain allowable continuations of the magnetic field across the surface. The boundary conditions allow the magnetic fields {{on either side of}} the discontinuity surface to be described by surface magnetic potentials, reducing the continuation problem to that of solving a Hamilton [...] Jacobi equation. The characteristics of this equation obey Hamiltonian equations of motion, and a necessary condition for the existence of a continued field across a general <b>toroidal</b> <b>surface</b> is that there exist invariant tori in the phase space of this Hamiltonian system. It is argued from the Birkhoff theorem that existence of such an invariant torus is also, in general, sufficient for continuation to be possible.

Steady {{solutions}} of the Euler equations for flow of an inviscid {{incompressible fluid}} {{may be obtained}} by considering the process of magnetic relaxation to analogous magnetostatic equilibria in a viscous perfectly conducting fluid. In particular, solutions which represent rotational disturbances propagating without change of structure in an unbounded fluid may be obtained by this method. When conditions are axisymmetric, these disturbances are vortex rings of general structure, which may include a swirl component of velocity. This situation is analysed in some detail, and it is shown that the vortex is characterised by two functions: V ($), the volume within <b>toroidal</b> <b>surfaces</b> $ = cst. and W($), the toroidal volume flux inside the torus $ = cst.

Here I provide a brief overview of different vari-ants of a very data-driven approach to modeling tonal space based on self-organizing maps (SOMs), focusing primarily on an ecologically inspired model (Leman and Car-reras 1997) that allows one to project any desired auditory stimulus to the <b>toroidal</b> <b>surface.</b> I illustrate this with examples of the tonal trajectories charted by short chord progressions...|$|E

40|$|The {{propagation}} of bushfire {{across the landscape}} is dependent {{on a variety of}} environmental factors, but the wind, in particular, has a major effect on both the speed and direction of fire propagation. As such, bushfire spread models, which underpin successful bushfire management, require accurate knowledge of the pattern of winds across the landscape. This can be problematic over complex terrain where winds exhibit considerable spatial variability due to wind-terrain interactions, and where detailed measurements of wind characteristics are comparatively rare. This thesis contributes two new wind datasets to address the previous lack of data available to develop and validate wind models over complex terrain. It also details analyses that focus on the statistical characterisation of wind as joint wind direction distributions, which represent the directional wind response to changing topography and surface roughness. A novel method for <b>toroidal</b> <b>surface</b> fitting is introduced and implemented to estimate the true continuous response from discrete observed data. This new method, which relies on a conceptually simple adaptation of planar techniques, is compared to the limited range of available <b>toroidal</b> <b>surface</b> estimation techniques and is shown to perform as well as, if not better than, these more sophisticated methods. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to highlight the sensitivity of statistical comparison tests to alternative distribution structures, and to validate bivariate and circular extensions of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. These tests are applied to directional wind response pairs, showing that vegetation regrowth has a significant but varying impact across complex terrain. Finally, this thesis demonstrates how statistical approaches can be used to complement current physics-based wind modelling methods. The resulting probabilistic representations provide more accurate predictions of wind direction variability, and are better suited to emerging ensemble-based bushfire prediction frameworks. As such, they provide a superior characterisation of uncertainty across the fire modelling process; ultimately enabling fire managers to make more informed decisions...|$|E
