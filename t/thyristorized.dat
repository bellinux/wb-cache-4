50|$|After {{dissolution}} of Yugoslavia, 461 class have remain in service with railways of Serbia, Montenegro and Republic of Macedonia. Today there are 46 locomotives operated by Serbian Railways. Most Serbian locomotives were {{passed to the}} cargo division in 2015, with 5 units retained for passenger trains on the Belgrade-Bar line. Railway transport of Montenegro operates 10 and Montecargo 8 locomotives of class 461, being only electric locomotive operated in Montenegro. This series is mainly used on Belgrade-Bar railway by both Serbian and Montenegrin railways. Six locomotives of 461 series are operated by Macedonian Railways, with two of them modernised and <b>thyristorized</b> to series 462.|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” Nowadays {{the control}} of stator voltage at a {{constant}} frequency {{is one of the}} traditional and low expense methods in order to control the speed of induction motors near its nominal speed. The torque of induction motor is a nonlinear function of the firing angle, phase angle and speed. In this paper the speed control of induction motor regarding various load torque and under different conditions will be investigated based on a fuzzy controller with inverse training. II. MODELING In most of studies, the system of <b>thyristorized</b> induction motor is considered as shown in Fig. 1 [1]...|$|E
40|$|An AC voltage {{controller}} is {{a device that}} is used to accomplish continuous variation of the rotor speed and rotational force, or torque of an electric motor and the major component of the device are two thyristors connected in an inverse-parallel manner. So, thyristors applications are now rapidly expanding in the field of industrial automation because they are found to consume very little power whenever they are employed to manipulate the flow of electric power. The performance characteristics of <b>thyristorized</b> inverse parallel controller (IPC) under a single-phase induction motor load are presented in this paper. The <b>thyristorized</b> IPC or AC {{voltage controller}} is chosen as a cheaper and easier to build controller for induction machines and many more applications such as; induction heating and dimmer. This could save installation and maintenance costs for industries where many variable speed drives are in use. The induction motor stator voltage control is achieved via phase angle control of the AC supply. Performance evaluation of the controller with the motor under different delay angles is demonstrated. Due to non-sinusoidal nature of the controller output voltage, the level of ripples and harmonic contents is studied. As a result of half-wave symmetry in the stator voltage, only odd harmonics is considered in the Fourier based analysis used to investigate the control limits of the controller. MATLAB 7. 8 software has been used to simulate the system and its results are compared with th...|$|E
40|$|Line-commutated {{converters}} are {{the logical}} choice in very high power AC to DC conversion as required in particle physics facilities. For instance, high-current <b>thyristorized</b> power supplies {{are used to}} drive the bending magnets of particle accelerators. The behaviour of such converters as far as distortion, time dynamics and precision are concerned, {{is closely related to}} the performance of the Thyristor Gate Control (TGC). In this work a compact high-performance optimum-speed TGC featuring a novel implementation of the digital ramp and threshold method is presented. Some digital simplifying strategies are introduced which allow the use of only one low-cost FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) as the digital core. The system developed is very flexible and can be easily configured to drive series or parallel connected converters...|$|E
40|$|Most of the magnets of the {{particle}} accelerators at CERN {{are driven by}} high-current power supplies which are built with line-commutated or <b>thyristorized</b> AC to DC converters. To this application, the power converters are usually included in a double feedback control loop intended to establish a high-precision trapezoidal-like current waveform in the inductive load. The precision required for the magnet current is typically 100 ppm. The dynamics and precision of the magnet current strongly depend on the loop compensation achieved. The correct tuning of the system demands an accurate assessment of the load because it {{is included in the}} forward path of the current loop. Normally, the set-up of each power converter attached to a given magnet, requires a manual adjustment of the current loop. However, in some cases non-linear current-related effects or thermal dependence of the load prevent an optimum compensation. In addition, the manual adjustment is a time-consuming task. In this work an efficient adaptive control scheme is presented which avoids manual tuning of the feedback system and compensates for load variations...|$|E
40|$|Induction Motors are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used machines in industries mainly because it is robust, inexpensive and easy to maintain. For an Induction Motor, the starting current is around ten times the rated current and this persists for a few cycles. This may be very much detrimental for the machine and hence {{there is a need for}} using starters to limit the starting current. During earlier times, mechanical starters like star delta, direct online and autotransformer starters were used. <b>Thyristorized</b> soft starters are of low cost. Their reliability is on the higher side and they are simple and occupy lesser space, and hence their use is a fruitful solution to the induction motor starting problem. The ac motor starters incorporating power semiconductors are used frequently nowadays for their controlled soft starting ability with reduced starting current. In this study, a closed loop Matlab Simulink model is developed which would reduce the current at the soft starting period. A fuzzy logic based soft start scheme for induction motor drives is used which would give optimal performance. Fuzzy logic has received higher emphasis in the field of power electronics because of its adaptive capability. The three phase stator currents are converted into two phase currents. The magnitude of current is then converted to per unit. Then it is compared with a reference value. The error is passed through a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). The FLC output is used to control the amplitude of the reference sine wave. Hence by controlling the modulation index, the applied voltage to the stator is controlled and hence the starting current is limit...|$|E
40|$|A superconductive {{energy storage}} magnet which is {{connected}} to the three phase power system could be designed, constructed, and placed in operation at Fermilab which would essentially eliminate the large repetitive power pulses now required from the power system. In addition to the power pulses, voltage flicker is also caused due to the reactive power pulsation. Specifically, a one megawatt hour superconductive energy storage magnet and a 2. 00 megawatt <b>thyristorized</b> converter can achieve nullification of these power pulses up to 400 GEV synchrotron operation. Above 400 GEV, operation should be possible up to 500 GEV with appreciable less power pulsing requirements from the system than are now considered permissible. Carried to successful completion, this project would serve to advance applied superconductivity to a highly significant degree. The effect would be of world wide importance to both high energy physics and to the electric power industry. The preliminary magnet design is a 1 MWh dipole composed of cryogenically stable composite conductors connected in parallel with aluminum shield windings. The shield windings carry impressed pulsed currents while eliminating pulsed currents from the dc superconductive windings. Without pulsed currents or pulsed magnetic fields there are no ac losses in standard helium. The major radius of the dipole is 8. 85 m; the minor radius is 0. 69 m; there are 188 turns at 80, 000 A and each turn is 4 conductors wound in parallel. The 20, 000 A TiNb-copper composite conductor is l 0 x 1. 12 cm in cross section similar to but larger than the FNAL bubble chamber conductor. The shield is 188 turns (equal number of turns is a shielding condition) of hollow aluminum conductor cooled via circulated cold helium gas at 40 K. The turns are spaced around the minor circumference according to a cosine distribution which produces zero internal field. In use the shield loss converted to room temperature power is about. 8 MW when 0. 1 MWh is used from a 1 MWh storage dipole. The 0. 1 MWh is sufficient to provide complete load leveling for 400 GEV pulses, and operation at 500 GEV with lower power transients than are presently experienced...|$|E
