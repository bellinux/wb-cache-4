Type IIb diamonds may absorb in the far red due to the substitutional boron, but otherwise show no observable visible absorption spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Edgar T.

5|$|In 1953, he {{reported}} preliminary cytological {{studies on the}} Aspleniums and suggested that A.montanum had crossed with ebony spleenwort (A.platyneuron) to yield Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi), noting that D. C. Eaton and W. N. Clute had already made tentative suggestions along <b>those</b> <b>lines.</b> He also made chromosome counts of A.×trudellii, which had been classified by some simply as a variety of A.pinnatifidum. As A.pinnatifidum {{proved to be a}} tetraploid while A.montanum was a diploid, a hybrid between them would be a triploid, and Wagner showed that this was in fact the case for A.×trudellii. His further experiments, published the following year, strongly suggested that both A.bradleyi and A.pinnatifidum were allotetraploids, the product of hybridization between A.montanum and another Asplenium to form a sterile diploid, followed by chromosome doubling that restored fertility.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opening}} {{lines of the}} poem Dryden {{describes}} King Cinyras just as Ovid did {{as a man who}} had been happier if he had not become a father. Lee suggests that this is a direct parallel to James who could have been counted as happier if he had not had his daughter, Mary, who betrayed him and usurped his monarchical position. When describing the act of incest Dryden uses a monster metaphor. <b>Those</b> <b>lines</b> are suggested as aimed at William III who invaded England from the Netherlands and whose presence Dryden describes as a curse or a punishment, according to Lee. A little further on the Convention Parliament is indicted. Lee suggests that Dryden critiques the intrusiveness of the Convention Parliament, because it acted without constituted legal authority. Finally the daughter, Mary as Myrrha, is described as an impious outcast from civilization, whose greatest sin was her disrupting the natural line of succession thereby breaking both natural as well as divine statutes which resulted in fundamental social confusion. When Myrrha craves and achieves her father's (Cinyras') bed, Lee sees a parallel to Mary's ascending James' throne: both daughters incestuously occupied the place which belonged to their fathers.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 1959, {{the library}} moved to its fifth {{location}} and first permanent home, the former Briarcliff Manor station originally on the New York City & Northern Railroad (later the New York and Putnam Railroad). The station {{had been built}} in 1906 by village founder Walter W. Law in the Tudor Revival style, {{as a replacement for}} a smaller station, which was moved to nearby Millwood. In its later operation as a station, the building was rarely used, and only four trains stopped there each day. Due to the railroad's tracks ending in the Bronx and requiring a transfer to continue on to Manhattan, many Briarcliff Manor residents would drive to Pleasantville or Scarborough, which had stations along lines ending in Manhattan, and more trains ran along <b>those</b> <b>lines.</b> The passenger railroad, then known as the Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad, discontinued service in 1958, freeing up use of the building for the library.|$|E

40|$|THE MAMMARY GLAND {{consists}} of two cellular structures, epithelium and mesenchyme. The epithelial components are embedded in a fatty stroma or mesenchyme, and when fully developed comprise a branching system of ducts terminating in clusters of alveoli which secrete lipid and milk-specific proteins, notably caseins, during lactation. Three main types of mammary epithelial cell are distinguishable: <b>those</b> <b>lining</b> the alveoli, <b>those</b> <b>lining</b> the ducts, and the myoepithelial cells which form a layer around both ducts and alveoli (Kon & Cowie, 1961). Development of these epithelial structures occurs by processes of cell multiplication and differentiation (Gros, 1967). Certain mammotrophic hormones affecting these processes in normal glands and in carcinogen-induced tumours {{have been identified in}} rodents by means of a series of endocrine gland-ablation and hormone-replacement experiments; they include prolactin, growth hormone, insulin, oestrogens, glucocorticoids and progesterone (Lyons et al. ...|$|R

5|$|The most {{pressing}} foreign policy concerns when Grant took office were resolving the Alabama claims against Great Britain and whether to recognize Cuban belligerency. The {{dispute with the}} United Kingdom stemmed from a complex of grievances centering on attacks on American shipping during the Civil War by the , a Confederate warship constructed in England. Senator Charles Sumner, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, believed the British had violated American neutrality and demanded reparations. Sumner convinced his fellow Senators to reject the Johnson administration's proposed settlement, believing that Britain should directly pay $2 billion in gold or, alternatively, cede Canada to the United States. Fish and Boutwell convinced Grant that peaceful relations with Britain were more important than acquisition of territory, and the two nations agreed to negotiate along <b>those</b> <b>lines.</b> To avoid jeopardizing negotiations, Grant refrained from recognizing Cuban rebels who were fighting for independence from Spain, {{which would have been}} inconsistent with American objections to the British granting belligerent status to Confederates. A commission in Washington produced a treaty whereby an international tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, but not fault. The Senate approved the Treaty of Washington, which also settled disputes over fishing rights and maritime boundaries, by a 50–12 vote in 1871.|$|E
5|$|To {{locate a}} second {{point on the}} lines L1, L2 and L3, Gergonne noted a {{reciprocal}} relationship between <b>those</b> <b>lines</b> and the radical axis R of the solution circles, CA and CB. To understand this reciprocal relationship, consider the two tangent lines to the circle C1 drawn at its tangent points A1 and B1 with the solution circles; the intersection of these tangent lines is the pole point of L1 in C1. Since the distances from that pole point to the tangent points A1 and B1 are equal, this pole point must also lie on the radical axis R of the solution circles, by definition (Figure9). The relationship between pole points and their polar lines is reciprocal; if the pole of L1 in C1 lies on R, the pole of R in C1 must conversely lie on L1. Thus, if we can construct R, we can find its pole P1 in C1, giving the needed second point on L1 (Figure10).|$|E

25|$|Another problem {{commonly}} {{faced by}} narrow-gauge railways {{was that they}} lack the physical space to grow: their cheap construction meant they were engineered only for their initial traffic demands. While a standard or broad gauge railway can be more easily be upgraded to handle heavier, faster traffic, many narrow-gauge railways were impractical to improve. Speeds and loads hauled could not increase, so traffic density was significantly limited. In the case of Queensland, Australia, the Queensland Rail passenger network has nearly reached its capacity due to the narrow gauge and an ever-increasing population, as such, new lines are to be built, thus negating the original cost savings. In Japan, a few narrow gauge lines have been upgraded to standard gauge mini-shinkansen to allow through service by standard gauge high-speed vehicles, but due to the alignment of <b>those</b> <b>lines</b> and minimum curve radius of <b>those</b> <b>lines,</b> the maximum speed of those through service {{is still the same}} as the original narrow-gauge rail line.|$|E
