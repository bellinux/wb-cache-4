5|$|In 1980, Microsoft {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with IBM <b>to</b> <b>bundle</b> Microsoft's operating system with IBM computers, paying Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested that Microsoft write a new operating system for their computers called OS/2. Microsoft wrote the operating system, but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.|$|E
5|$|Windows 95 was {{released}} without {{a web browser}} as Microsoft had not yet developed one. The success of the web caught them by surprise and they subsequently approached Spyglass to license their browser as Internet Explorer. Spyglass went on to later dispute {{the terms of the}} agreement, as Microsoft was to pay a royalty for every copy sold. However, Microsoft sold no copies of Internet Explorer, choosing instead <b>to</b> <b>bundle</b> it for free with the operating system.|$|E
5|$|Within {{six years}} from {{when it was}} founded, Monster had $50 million in annual {{revenues}} and 400 employees. The company's growth was primarily due to Monster training sales staff at electronics stores <b>to</b> <b>bundle</b> the cables with other electronics purchases, an effort the company spent 15 percent of its revenues on by 1998. Lee kept the company private and grew the business, despite pressure to go public.|$|E

5|$|Absent Miyamoto's direction, the {{development}} team used elements new and {{inconsistent with the}} series as Super Mario Land shrunk elements of the series to fit the portable device's small screen. Yokoi, the head of R, served as producer, and Satoru Okada served as director. They had previously developed Metroid (1986) and Kid Icarus (1986) together, and the two subsequently designed the Game Boy—Yokoi on its industrial design, and Okada on its engineering. Their Super Mario Land was planned as the portable console's showcase title until Henk Rogers brought Tetris to Nintendo of America and convinced Minoru Arakawa that the addictive computer game would help Nintendo reach the largest audience. The company subsequently chose <b>to</b> <b>bundle</b> Tetris with every Game Boy purchase.|$|E
5|$|At E3 2003, Nintendo showcased two Zelda games {{which would}} {{make use of the}} Game Boy Advance connectivity, Four Swords and Tetra's Trackers. In December of the same year, it was {{announced}} that both games would be together in a single disc, Four Swords +, along with a third, Shadow Battle. Four Swords Adventures was released in Japan with Hyrule Adventure, Shadow Battle, and Navi's Trackers as three individual games bundled together. It was later announced on June 7, 2004, however, that Hyrule Adventures and Navi's Trackers would be sold as two separate titles in the United States, while the retail status of Shadow Battle was still unknown. This decision was later changed <b>to</b> <b>bundle</b> Hyrule Adventure with Shadow Battle, and to not release Navi's Trackers in the United States.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2016, Ubisoft {{revealed}} the game {{would be released}} on 15 November of that year for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One platforms in six separate editions. In September 2016, {{it was announced that}} Watch Dogs 2 would have enhancements on PlayStation 4 Pro. In October 2016, Ubisoft announced that the Windows version was delayed to 29 November 2016 to ensure that the game was well-optimized. It was featured on the front cover of Edge in August. Two weeks from release, Ubisoft and Samsung partnered <b>to</b> <b>bundle</b> a free digital download of Watch Dogs 2 with the purchase of their solid-state disks or curved gaming monitors. Amazon Prime copies were subject to an early release, which revealed issues with the seamless multiplayer. Ubisoft vowed to repair the feature on schedule but on the day of release, the company said it was broken – citing persistent lagging and crashing. Cooperative multiplayer was enabled a week after the game's release. A free trial lasting three hours was released for PlayStation 4 on 17 January 2017; the Xbox One version was downloadable on 24 January.|$|E

If node i has <b>bundles</b> <b>to</b> {{forward to}} node j, but {{is faced with}} a short contact duration or low data rate, both of which prevent it from forwarding all <b>bundles</b> <b>to</b> node j, the question then is <b>to</b> determine which <b>bundles</b> <b>to</b> forward such that the delivery ratio is maximized and the delay is minimized.|$|R

40|$|Bundle theory reduces {{particulars}} <b>to</b> <b>bundles</b> of properties. Bundle {{theorists have}} been working to explain individuation within an ontology of repeatable properties, but the outcomes are not satisfactory. Even the trope approach toward properties is not capable of establishing individuation. This article argues that bundle theorists are wrong in searching for individuators within the bundles of properties. Rather, individuation should be established within ontologically more fundamental level of events. Events, with their spatial and temporal character, enable us <b>to</b> individuate the <b>bundles</b> of properties involved {{and this is one}} of the reasons for the superiority of <b>bundle</b> theory <b>to</b> other competitive theories of substance. Both bundle theory (BT) and substratum theory (ST) agree that particulars are ontologically complex entities. BT reduces particulars <b>to</b> <b>bundles</b> of properties. In addition to properties, ST also recognizes their bearers, substrata. 1 BT is an ontologically single category theory, whereas ST is dualistic. This gives priority <b>to</b> BT. Moreover, <b>bundle</b> theorists consider substrata rather speculative and mysterious entities. On the other hand, substratum theorists suspect the way BT treats individuation. As BT recognizes only repeatable properties, how can you form an individual entit...|$|R
40|$|Combinatorial vector bundles, or matroid bundles, are a {{combinatorial}} analog <b>to</b> real vector <b>bundles.</b> Combinatorial objects called oriented matroids {{play the}} role of real vector spaces.

25|$|When the clicks-and-bricks {{euphoria}} hit in {{the late}} 1990s, many banks began to view web-based banking as a strategic imperative. The attraction of banks to online banking are fairly obvious: diminished transaction costs, easier integration of services, interactive marketing capabilities, and other benefits that boost customer lists and profit margins. Additionally, online banking services allow institutions <b>to</b> <b>bundle</b> more services into single packages, thereby luring customers and minimizing overhead.|$|E
30|$|Figure 8 b {{shows the}} bundle average {{delivery}} delay as function of bundle TTL {{for the same}} network conditions and routing protocol. As may be seen, the RL contributes <b>to</b> decrease the <b>bundle</b> average delivery delay. When compared <b>to</b> FIFO, <b>bundles</b> arrive <b>to</b> their final destination approximately 62, 106, 192, and 284 s sooner in average. When compared <b>to</b> Random, <b>bundles</b> arrive <b>to</b> their final destination approximately 13, 76, 128, and 189 s sooner. When compared <b>to</b> RC <b>bundles</b> arrived <b>to</b> their final destination approximately 21, 13, 28, and 17 s sooner. This happens because RL combination of scheduling and dropping policies forwards first bundles with longer remaining TTLs that will have more time left to reach their destination, and drop first bundles with smaller remaining TTLs.|$|R
