The television gantry is also in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, so the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand is the one that gets shown on television least often. Television studios are located at either end of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, with the club's in-house television station, MUTV, in the East studio and other television stations, such as the BBC and Sky, in the West studio.|$|E

25|$|Snell's Law {{can be used}} {{to predict}} the {{deflection}} of light rays as they pass through linear media as long as the indexes of refraction and the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> known. For example, the propagation of light through a prism results in the light ray being deflected depending on the shape and orientation of the prism. In most materials, the index of refraction varies with the frequency of the light. Taking this into account, Snell's Law {{can be used to}} predict how a prism will disperse light into a spectrum. The discovery of this phenomenon when passing light through a prism is famously attributed to Isaac Newton.|$|E

He said that the media must never give the terrorists a tribune or help them acquire operational information, and double media standards are intolerable. He proposed a contract on anti-terror between the authorities and the media with a behavioural codex of the journalists {{and the creation of a}} special state body for informational counteraction organisation and coordination of the information activities of all state structures operating to counter terror. In his view, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> to a certain degree a catalyst for terrorism because terrorist acts of such a volume would be impossible without them; also, the press induces panic in the organs of state authority and affects the public negatively.|$|E

25|$|Erik Andersen Hylkje in Bergen, Norway who ran his own garage, Erik Andersen Lakkeringsverksted. Andersen {{has been}} active in motor sports for several years, {{particularly}} as a trainer in Bergen Trial Team. He is divorced and has two children. Andersen sometimes spelled his name as Eric Andersen, despite the fact that his legal name is Erik Andersen. He was identified on the front cover of Verdens Gang, the largest newspaper of Norway, on August 22, 2009. He was also identified by Bergens Tidende the following day. Subsequently, he has been identified by Dagbladet, Nettavisen, TV 2, Dagsavisen, Bergensavisen and Aftenposten. Norwegian media had previously refrained from using his name and picture as requested by the police, in order not to harm the investigation. However, the investigation was completed in May 2009. Legally, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> allowed to identify suspects in criminal cases. Bernt Olufsen stated that Verdens Gang chose to identify him because of the scale and seriousness of the crimes, which according to Olufsen meant the public had a right to know his identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} body {{satisfaction}} and appearance esteem {{continues to increase}} with the abundance of; billboards, magazines, and conversations, displaying “unrealistic images of beauty” (LiveLifeGetActive, 2016). Weight prejudices {{brought up in the}} media or social settings are also prevalent within society. The tendency to link physical attractive qualities with positive personal qualities has been documented since the 1970s. People assign positive personality traits and overall life outcomes to those they perceive as attractive both mentally and physically. The very thin and beautiful models within <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> therefore seen as the most successful and socially desirable people on the planet. In most societies, thinness is typically associated with happiness, success, youthfulness, and social acceptability.  This ideal is heavily portrayed throughout the mainstream media, whereby women are assumed to be perfect in every way. In addition, the idea that a person can never be too thin or too rich, makes it difficult for females to attain any sort of happiness about their personal appearance. Hence, a women’s attitude towards her body are thus a result of comparing it with those depicted in the media, along with society’s obsession with thinness.|$|E
25|$|Objectification theory {{suggests}} both {{direct and indirect}} consequences of objectification to women. Indirect consequences include self consciousness in terms that a woman is consistently checking or rearranging her clothes or appearance to ensure that she is presentable. More direct consequences are related to sexual victimization. Rape and sexual harassment are examples of this. Doob (2012) states that sexual harassment {{is one of the}} challenges faced by women in workplace. This may constitute sexual jokes or comments, most of which are degrading. Research indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> socialized and translated into mental health problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level. These include increased self-consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats (depression, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and sexual dysfunction), and increased body shame. Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including disordered eating, mental health, depression, motor performance, body image, idealized body type, stereotype formation, sexual perception and sexual typing. Body shame is a byproduct of the concept of an idealized body type adopted by most Western cultures that depicts a thin, model-type figure. Thus, women will engage in actions meant to change their body such as dieting, exercise, eating disorders, cosmetic surgery, etc. Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.|$|E

500|$|The fifth vein of {{the wing}} is the media. In the {{archetype}} pattern (A), the media forks into two main branches: a media anterior (MA), which divides into two distal branches (MA1, MA2), and a median sector, or media posterior (MP), which has four terminal branches (M1, M2, M3, M4). In most modern insects the media anterior has been lost, and the usual [...] "media" [...] is the four-branched media posterior with the common basal stem. In the Ephemerida, according to present interpretations {{of the wing}} venation, both branches of <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> retained, while in Odonata the persisting media is the primitive anterior branch. The stem of the media is often united with the radius, but when it occurs as a distinct vein its base {{is associated with the}} distal median plate (m') or is continuously sclerotized with the latter. The cubitus, the sixth vein of the wing, is primarily two branched. The primary forking of the takes place near the base of the wing, forming the two principal branches (Cu1, Cu2). The anterior branch may break up into a number of secondary branches, but commonly it forks into two distal branches. The second branch of the cubitus (Cu2) in Hymenoptera, Trichoptera, and Lepidoptera was mistaken by Comstock and Needham for the first anal. Proximally the main stem of the cubitus is associated with the distal median plate (m') of the wing base.|$|E
500|$|After O'Leary's {{revelation that}} {{producers}} had rehearsed {{what would happen}} if Cole abstained in week 5, allegations were made that the result was rigged for Waissel to stay, given that her outlandish performances and growing unpopularity with the public resulted in better ratings and sensational press for the show. Cowell denied this claim, saying he would never want to defraud viewers and said the situation had [...] "been blown out of proportion". O'Leary defended himself and the show on Twitter, saying [...] "We never know which way the judges are going to vote. Ever. The only thing I know is who's in the bottom two when I'm given the card. I don't know which judge to go to until I'm called and the judges, including , don't know the vote or who we're coming to next. It's that simple." [...] The following week, Heat magazine printed a report claiming that Cowell was aware of the public votes before the judges make their votes, and several other media reports contained rumours of the show being fixed. The X Factor bosses instructed their lawyers to file a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission against Heat, saying that the article was a lie, that very few people know the actual public voting results and conspiracy theories being printed in <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>are</b> [...] "total and utter rubbish". Heat printed an apology in their 1 January 2011 issue and accepted that Cowell was unaware of the votes cast until after the final.|$|E
