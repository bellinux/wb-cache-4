It was filmed at Universal CityWalk by {{director}} Ray Kay, who had previously directed videos for Beyoncé Knowles, Lady Gaga, Alexandra Burke, and Cheryl Cole, among others. Ludacris said that the video [...] "is like a 2010 version of Michael Jackson's [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel"." [...] Bieber said that the video [...] "will capture the song's message of trying to woo back a girl." [...] In explaining the concept of the video, Bieber said, [...] "It starts off, I really like this girl, but we didn't [...] along; we couldn't be together. Basically I want her back and [...] kind of going <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> I'm chasing her around, trying to get her, and she's kind of playing hard to get, but I'm persistent. I keep going." [...] The video premiered exclusively on Vevo on Friday, February 19, 2010. Singer and actress Jasmine Villegas portrays Bieber's love interest in the video. Bieber's friends, Young Money artists Drake and Lil Twist also appeared in the video, along with Tinashe and jerkin' crew The Rangers.|$|E
60|$|And {{there came}} a change in Isabel. It was like some change in the cycle of nature, like the onset of spring--a sharp brightness, an uneasiness. She became restless with her work; little {{encounters}} with men began to happen, encounters not quite {{in the quality of}} the earlier proposals; and then came an odd incident of which she told me, but somehow, I felt, didn't tell me completely. She told me all she was able to tell me. She had been at a dance at the Ropers', and a man, rather well known in London, had kissed her. The thing amazed her beyond measure. It was the sort of thing immediately possible between any man and any woman, that one never expects to happen until it happens. It had the surprising effect of a judge generally known to be bald suddenly whipping off his wig in court. No absolutely unexpected revelation could have quite the same quality of shock. She went <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> to me with a remarkable detachment, told me how she had felt--and the odd things it seemed to open to her.|$|E
6000|$|Thus it was, at all events, {{that the}} ultimate, though after all so speedy, {{definition}} of my gentleman's job--his coming out, all solemnly appointed and deputed, to [...] "save" [...] Chad, and his then finding {{the young man}} so disobligingly and, at first, so bewilderingly not lost that a new issue altogether, in the connexion, prodigiously faces them, which has {{to be dealt with}} in a new light--promised as many calls on ingenuity and on the higher branches of the compositional art as one could possibly desire. Again and yet again, as, from book to book, I proceed with my survey, I find no source of interest equal to this verification after the fact, as I may call it, and the more in detail the better, of the scheme of consistency [...] "gone in" [...] for. As always--since the charm never fails--the retracing of the process from point to point brings back the old illusion. The old intentions bloom again and flower--in spite of all the blossoms they were to have dropped by the way. This is the charm, as I say, of adventure TRANSPOSED--the thrilling ups and downs, the intricate ins and outs of the compositional problem, made after such a fashion admirably objective, becoming the question at issue and keeping the author's heart in his mouth. Such an element, for instance, as his intention that Mrs. Newsome, away off with her finger on the pulse of Massachusetts, should yet be no less intensely than circuitously present <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing,</b> should be no less felt as to be reckoned with than the most direct exhibition, the finest portrayal at first hand could make her, such a sign of artistic good faith, I say, once it's unmistakeably there, takes on again an actuality not too much impaired by the comparative dimness of the particular success. Cherished intention too inevitably acts and operates, in the book, about fifty times as little as I had fondly dreamt it might; but that scarce spoils for me the pleasure of recognising the fifty ways in which I had sought to provide for it. The mere charm of seeing such an idea constituent, in its degree; the fineness of the measures taken--a real extension, if successful, of the very terms and possibilities of representation and figuration--such things alone were, after this fashion, inspiring, such things alone were a gage of the probable success of that dissimulated calculation with which the whole effort was to square. But oh the cares begotten, none the less, of that same [...] "judicious" [...] sacrifice to a particular form of interest! One's work should have composition, because composition alone is positive beauty; but all the while--apart from one's inevitable consciousness too of the dire paucity of readers ever recognising or ever missing positive beauty--how, as to the cheap and easy, at every turn, how, as to immediacy and facility, and even as to the commoner vivacity, positive beauty might have to be sweated for and paid for! Once achieved and installed it may always be trusted to make the poor seeker feel he would have blushed to the roots of his hair for failing of it; yet, how, as its virtue can be essentially but the virtue of the whole, the wayside traps set in the interest of muddlement and pleading but the cause of the moment, of the particular bit in itself, have to be kicked out of the path! All the sophistications in life, for example, might have appeared to muster on behalf of the menace--the menace to a bright variety--involved in Strether's having all the subjective [...] "say," [...] as it were, to himself.|$|E

60|$|The tents of {{the brigade}} with which I was staying had been pitched not without {{an eye to}} appearances. They were placed in streets as it were, each street having its name, and between them screens had been erected of fir poles and fir branches, so as to keep off the wind. The outside {{boundaries}} of the nearest regiment were ornamented with arches, crosses, and columns, constructed in the same way; so that the quarters {{of the men were}} reached, as it were, <b>through</b> gateways. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> was pretty enough; and while the ground was hard the camp was picturesque, and a visit to it was not unpleasant. But unfortunately the ground was in its nature soft and deep, composed of red clay; and as the frost went and the wet weather came, mud became omnipotent and destroyed all prettiness. And I found that the cold weather, let it be ever so cold, was not severe upon the men. It was wet which they feared and had cause to fear, both for themselves and for their horses. As to the horses, but few of them were protected by any shelter or covering whatsoever. Through both frost and wet they remained out, tied to the wheel of a wagon or to some temporary rack at which they were fed. In England we should imagine that any horse so treated must perish; but here the animal seemed to stand it. Many of them were miserable enough in appearance, but nevertheless they did the work required of them. I have observed that horses throughout the States are treated in a hardier manner than is usually the case with us.|$|R
5000|$|The {{match was}} played in hot, dry and blustery {{conditions}} {{in front of}} 116,956 spectators, the fourth-largest crowd in VFL/AFL history. Richmond rover Kevin Bartlett, a renowned finals performer, was prominent early, gathering kicks at will. The first key incident in the match occurred at the 4-minute mark of the quarter. Carlton captain-coach John Nicholls, who had masterminded Richmond's demise in the previous year's Grand Final, was coming out to mark a long kick from Alex Jesaulenko when he was sensationally felled with a high shirtfront by Richmond defender Laurie Fowler, who was running back with the flight of the ball. Fans and players were stunned {{at the sight of}} one of football's most imposing figures laying groggy on the ground and unable to rise. Teammate David McKay reflected thus on the incident: To see someone who was a colossus knocked out like that really stung. He was such an enormous presence on the ground as a leader that we thought, [...] "Shit, what's going to happen now?" ... You could talk to any player from that day and they'd tell you we were stunned. I'm not saying that was the reason Richmond won on the day, but we were starting to think twice about what the hell was happening out there. The impact of that incident still resonates decades later, and has been replayed on television many times since. As Fowler recalled of that incident a few years later:I was keyed up at the time and all I remember is that I had my eyes on the ball. If Nick had run <b>through</b> me <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> would have been forgotten. Nicholls lay motionless for at least three minutes, whilst being attended to by trainers. He was awarded a 15-yard penalty, and scored a goal from the free kick, but suffered double vision and had no impact {{for the remainder of the}} match.|$|R

Now that radio formats are not as influential as they once were, it's easier to release an album that crosses all formats with a message that runs <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing,</b> regardless of the type of song or sound. Some early listeners have said that this album is positive and spiritual. I like to think it focuses on the human condition. Like many of my recordings, this one draws on earlier material here and there. I used to do that a lot back in the day. Some songs, like 'Ordinary People,' need to wait for the right time. I think now is the right time for that song and it lives well with the new songs I have written in the past few months. I had a blast making this music." ...|$|E
