5|$|A second {{full-size}} {{replica of}} Endeavour is berthed on the River Tees in Stockton-on-Tees. While this reflects the external dimensions of Cook's vessel, this replica was constructed with a steel {{rather than a}} <b>timber</b> <b>frame,</b> has one less internal deck than the original, and is not designed {{to be put to}} sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{main part}} of the {{detached}} building is two storeys high along with an attic and cellar. The building was based on a <b>timber</b> <b>frame</b> structure that partially survives although refaced in brick and affected by later extensions. It is mostly rendered and painted white or cream, with doors and window frames painted red or brown.|$|E
5|$|In 1430 the 1280 Sheffield parish church {{building}} was pulled down and replaced. Parts {{of this new}} church still stand today {{and it is now}} Sheffield city centre's oldest surviving building, forming the core of Sheffield Cathedral. Other notable surviving buildings from this period include the Old Queen's Head pub in Pond Hill, which dates from around 1480, with its <b>timber</b> <b>frame</b> still intact, and Bishops' House and Broom Hall, both built around 1500.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays, <b>timber</b> <b>framing</b> is {{primarily}} {{found in the}} provinces of Limburg, Liège, and Luxemburg. In urban areas, the ground floor was formerly built in stone and the upper floors in <b>timber</b> <b>framing.</b> Also, as <b>timber</b> <b>framing</b> {{was seen as a}} cheaper way of building, often the visible structures of noble houses were in stone and bricks, and the invisible or lateral walls in <b>timber</b> <b>framing.</b> The open-air museums of Bokrijk and Saint-Hubert (Fourneau Saint-Michel) show many examples of Belgian <b>timber</b> <b>framing.</b> Many post-and-beam houses can be found in cities and villages, but, unlike France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, there are few fully <b>timber</b> <b>framed</b> cityscapes.|$|R
50|$|Most Cheshire {{buildings}} are in sandstone, brick or are <b>timber</b> <b>framed.</b> Limestone {{is used for}} some buildings in {{the east of the}} county. Compared with other counties, <b>timber</b> <b>framing</b> is important. Cheshire has a higher proportion of <b>timber</b> <b>framed</b> houses than most other English counties.|$|R
50|$|Some {{windows to}} the coach house complex are now missing, those extant include a {{combination}} of double hung <b>timber</b> <b>framed</b> windows to the boarding house and <b>timber</b> <b>framed</b> fixed and casement windows to the kitchen. Windows to the northern, western and eastern elevations of the boarding house are protected from the weather by <b>timber</b> <b>framed</b> awnings sheeted with corrugated iron.|$|R
5|$|The {{roof was}} {{originally}} thatched {{but now is}} tiled, and is supported by cruck bracing to the <b>timber</b> <b>frame</b> of six principal trusses. The design of the roof {{is similar to that}} in the other tithe barns of Glastonbury Abbey at Pilton, Manor Farm, Doulting and Glastonbury itself, which is now part of the Somerset Rural Life Museum. The carriage porch where wagons would have been unloaded is covered by the sloping roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} a <b>timber</b> <b>frame</b> house that was {{originally}} constructed {{on the west side}} of Pine Street, but its original form is not known for sure due the extent of its expansion and remodeling. The NRHP nomination states that it could have been a -story gabled roof cottage with a cross-gable in the center, a style popular during the mid-century in Pawtucket. This original structure retains little of its form except for the Gothic hood moulds on the second floor end windows and the Gothic bargeboards. A two-story hipped roof addition was constructed in two phases, one completed before 1877 and the other between 1895 and 1902. Though the NRHP also states that the original house was enlarged in the late 1860s or 1870s without specification to the work done at the time. The additions include a bay window on the facade and openwork on the porch sides. The later alterations to the building worked to compliment the distinctive bargeboards of the cottage with the work on the eaves and window heads of the addition.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{contains}} {{a total of}} 58 Grade II listed buildings, including a Grade II* listed barn, and the Church of the Holy Cross, a Grade I listed building. The church dates from the late 12th century with early 13th and 15th century additions, {{as well as a}} substantial restoration in 1863. The building itself consists of stone walls, a tiled roof, and a stone slated porch. The oldest part is the chancel, which dates from the 12th century with 15th century extensions. The north chapel was altered in 1331, and in its churchyard is the grave of famed Second World War Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (Viscount Montgomery of Alamein). Other listed buildings include Barnfield House – three houses which were once separated all dating from 1550 with 20th century restorations. The house itself has a <b>timber</b> <b>frame</b> with a tiled roof, including a late medieval hall. Mill Court, another Grade II listed building, is a large house dating from the early 19th century with a low pitched roof and yellow brickwork, and became a listed building on 15 August 1985.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} has timber floors {{supported by}} <b>timber</b> <b>framing</b> and linked by a timber staircase, which runs around the exterior {{walls of the}} tower. The interior is plastered and has <b>timber</b> <b>framed</b> doors and windows with sandstone sills.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} elevation is <b>timber</b> <b>framed</b> and enclosed {{with glass}} windows and French doors, and houses service facilities. The southern elevation, extended during the 1990s, is <b>timber</b> <b>framed</b> with large windows with breezeway, French doors and a corrugated iron roof.|$|R
50|$|Membership in the Guild {{does not}} {{necessarily}} reflect competency but an interest in learning and/or teaching. Membership {{is not required to}} practice <b>timber</b> <b>framing.</b> Most members build new <b>timber</b> <b>frames,</b> but many members restore, rehabilitate, preserve and/or study historic <b>timber</b> <b>framed</b> buildings. The philosophies vary widely with some members being innovative and designing buildings of the future, some use computer-controlled machinery to cut frames, some work only with traditional hand-powered tools. Some members use metal connectors rather than traditional wooden joinery.|$|R

50|$|The leaky homes {{crisis is}} an ongoing {{construction}} and legal crisis in New Zealand concerning a number of <b>timber</b> <b>framed</b> buildings constructed from 1994 to 2004 that suffered from weather-tightness problems. The problem was primarily related to the decay of <b>timber</b> <b>framing</b> which, in extreme cases, made buildings structurally unsound. Some buildings became unhealthy to live in due to moulds and spores developing within the damp <b>timber</b> <b>framing.</b> The repairs and replacement costs {{that may have been}} avoided were estimated in 2009 to be approximately $11.3 billion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Timber</b> <b>framing</b> is {{a general}} term for {{building}} with wooden posts and beams. The term post is the namesake of other general names for <b>timber</b> <b>framing</b> such as post-and-beam, post-and-girt construction and more specific types of <b>timber</b> <b>framing</b> such as Post and lintel, post-frame, post in ground, and ridge-post construction. In roof construction such as king post, queen post, crown post framing. A round post is often called a pole or mast depending on its diameter thus pole building framing, or a mast church.|$|R
25|$|In {{the churchyard}} is a stone sundial dated 1765 with a copper dial and gnomon. This is listed GradeII, {{as is the}} lych gate. This is dated 1887 and {{consists}} of a <b>timber</b> <b>frame</b> with a slate roof.|$|E
25|$|The {{lighthouse}} is {{a typical}} for Queensland, made of a <b>timber</b> <b>frame</b> clad with galvanized iron plates. It is topped by a Chance Brothers lantern room, and painted white with a red dome. A modern ML-300 lantern replaced the original lens.|$|E

25|$|Whilldin-Miller House {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places on February 12, 2003. The {{original}} <b>timber</b> <b>frame</b> two-story house remaining in the rear was built by Joseph Whilldin about 1715, while the front portion of the house was built in 1860, {{making it one of the}} oldest remaining houses on Cape Island.|$|E
25|$|The 17th century saw the {{transition}} from <b>timber</b> <b>frame</b> to brick and stone construction. An early and prominent example of this in Birmingham is Aston Hall, which was completed in 1635 for Sir Thomas Holte. It was designed by John Thorpe and features the Jacobean style, which was popular amongst large buildings of this type during the 17th century.|$|E
50|$|The western gable is {{extended}} with a one-storey barn, also in <b>timber</b> <b>framing</b> but with dressed fillings and cross-shaped ventilation holes towards the street.

40|$|Structural <b>timber</b> studwork <b>framing</b> {{is widely}} used in the {{construction}} of domestic buildings in the UK. Hemp-lime is a novel low carbon renewable construction material that is increasingly being used in the UK for insulating <b>timber</b> <b>framed</b> buildings. When combined, <b>timber</b> studwork <b>framing</b> and hemp-lime provide a highly insulating, low carbon, energy efficient building system. By encasing the timber studs in hemp-lime there is potential for the hemp-lime to indirectly enhance the structural performance of the <b>timber</b> <b>framing.</b> This paper presents results from structural testing undertaken on <b>timber</b> studwork <b>frames</b> both with and without hemp-lime with compressive, in plane racking and out of plane bending loads applied. The results show that hemp-lime significantly increased the strength and stiffness of the <b>timber</b> studwork <b>frames</b> under compressive and in-plane racking loads while under out of plane bending the <b>timber</b> studwork <b>framing</b> provides post cracking resistance and integrity to the hemp-lime...|$|R
25|$|Foley Row, 159–169 Franklin Street. This row of six {{attached}} Greek Revival gabled <b>timber</b> <b>frame</b> houses, each three bays {{wide with}} brick foundations, simple wooden lintels and clapboard siding, dates to 1851.
