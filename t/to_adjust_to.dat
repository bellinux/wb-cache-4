5|$|By the mid 1950s, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of economists had ceased debating Keynesianism and accepted the synthesis view; however, room for disagreement remained.

Another group of Keynesians focused on disequilibrium economics and tried to reconcile the concept of equilibrium with the absence of market clearing.|$|E

5|$|Apart from {{changes in}} the legal {{specifications}} of the shades of the national colors (see the section below), the basic design of the Polish flag, including the 5:8 ratio, has remained unchanged to this day. The flag with coat of arms was only modified <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> the {{changes in the}} coat of arms itself. Major modifications included a change in the stylization of the eagle from Classicist to Baroque in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle's head during the Communist rule from 1944 to 1990. In that period, Poland {{was one of the few}} socialist states in the Eastern Bloc (apart from the Flag of Cuba) not to adorn communist symbolism on its flag.|$|E

5|$|Darabont's {{departure}} as showrunner in July 2011 {{during the}} second season came as surprise to many, as it came shortly after the season's premiere {{and a few days}} after that year's Comic-Con, where Darabont helped to promote the show. It was speculated that he was unable <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> the schedule of running a television series. However, The Hollywood Reporter reported that AMC had fired him. There had been reported difficulties in the production of the second season, including disputes over planned budget cuts and executive meddling, and it was known that Darabont and AMC had several discussions relating to these factors. However, neither Darabont, AMC, nor the cast nor crew of The Walking Dead spoke about the reasons for his firing.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{participated in}} the Rangers' {{training}} camp that preceded the 2013–14 season, during which he impressed New York's head coach Alain Vigneault, and head European scout Anders Hedberg. Although {{it was his first}} North American professional training camp, Fast made the Rangers roster, partially because the team needed a right-handed shot to replace the injured captain Ryan Callahan. Fast made his NHL debut on October 3 against the Phoenix Coyotes, taking one shot on goal in 10:13 of ice time. Fast played in eight of the Rangers' first 10 games of the season, playing on the fourth line and recording no points and a -5 plus-minus, before returning to the AHL to make room for Carl Hagelin's return from a shoulder injury. Observers said Fast needed <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> the smaller North American ice surface, and did not get sufficient minutes to do so quickly enough to remain in the NHL.|$|E
