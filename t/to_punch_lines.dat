50|$|A joke {{contains}} a single {{story with a}} single <b>punch</b> <b>line</b> at the end. In the analysis of longer humorous texts, an expanded model is needed to map the narratological structure. With this in mind, the General Theory of Verbal Humor (GTVH) was expanded to include longer humorous texts together with jokes, using the GTVH narrative structure to categorize them. A new term “jab line” was introduced to designate humor within {{the body of a}} text, as opposed to the “punch line” which is always placed at the end. The jab line is functionally identical <b>to</b> the <b>punch</b> <b>line</b> except it can be positioned anywhere within the text, not just at the end. “Jab and <b>punch</b> <b>lines</b> are semantically indistinguishable (…), but they differ at a narratological level.” Additionally, “jab lines are humorous elements fully integrated in the narrative in which they appear (i.e. they do not disrupt the flow of the narrative, because they either are indispensable {{to the development of the}} “plot” or of the text, or they are not antagonistic to it)”.|$|R

40|$|Humancentered {{computing}} {{is impossible}} without humor. In order {{for it to}} have humor, humor must be formalized and made computable, which requires a theory of humor suitable for computation. For {{a quarter of a}} century, the humor community has thought there was a reliable formal linguistic theory which allowed for reasonable consensus on joke analyses and their reproducibility by human experts. With the development and availability of semantic computing, however, it has become clear that the theory is not quite adequate. Yet, there must be a theory suitable for computational use as well as for developing a computational system capable of understanding the joke mechanism. This mechanism will enable the computer <b>to</b> provide a <b>punch</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> a human generated setup and conversely, to react competently to a human generated <b>punch</b> <b>line</b> that follows a setup that is generated by either participant. Can this mechanism exist without deep understanding of psychology, sociology, linguistics, and any other field that may be applicable? This talk will provide some answers that, hopefully, generate even more questions about the nature of (computational) humor...|$|R

50|$|Menchell began {{most of his}} comedic standup in the Borscht Belt, what is {{now known}} as the Catskills, a {{destination}} of mostly New York City Jews from the 1920s to the 1970s. The Catskills acted as a sanctuary for Jewish people who had the option to either become Americanized or embrace and preserve their Jewishness. Jewish-American humor grew in the Catskills, where any Jewish comedian worth a laugh got his or her start, in which Menchell became very familiar with. The retreat was formerly branded as Borscht Belt due to the performers representing their comedy often with self-deprecating with rapid-fire style. Borscht Belt provided various forms of entertainment from burlesque to nightclub to broadway. Along with Menchell, comedians such as Buddy Hackett, Sid Caesar, and Jerry Lewis got their start in Borscht Belt. Up in the Catskills, Menchell delivered the song “Love is Great” in which he ridicules himself for being married while channeling the talents of the late musician, Ben Bernie. The Catskills gave comedians such as Menchell grounds to perform and master their craft. The comedians delivered Yiddish humor to a customized Jewish crowd that would always accept and react kindly <b>to</b> the <b>punch</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
50|$|In both case studies, {{patients}} {{showed an}} altered sense of humor, mostly {{in regard to}} producing and appreciating humor. The right hemisphere is involved with processing speed and problem solving, which {{plays a role in}} humor processing. These patients have difficulty fully interpreting a joke's content, but can recognize the importance of the form of a joke. Patients with witzelsucht often find non sequiturs, slapstick humor, and puns funniest since these forms of humor do not require integration of content across sentences. In other words, the end of the joke is not dependent on the first part; one does not need to make a logical connection to understand humor. Patients show no change in understanding simple logic, and understand the importance of surprise in humor (hence why they choose slapstick humor instead of the “correct” punch line); however, once they have registered this surprise, they cannot connect the <b>punch</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the body of the joke to fully appreciate the true humor behind the joke. Successful jokes require a juxtaposition of the sound and the meaning of words used <b>to</b> understand the <b>punch</b> <b>line.</b> However, patients with witzelsucht have difficulty connecting the two, resulting in an inability to appreciate humor.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said [...] "More like This Is Whiny", {{giving the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four. [...] "This Is 40 has its share of clever, zingy material, proving that writer-director Judd Apatow has lost none of his ability <b>to</b> land a <b>punch</b> <b>line</b> with the right, {{unexpected}} turn of phrase. 'My boobs are just ... gone,' bemoans Debbie, played by Leslie Mann, comparing hers with those of her employee, played by Megan Fox. Then comes the second line, building smartly on the setup: 'They didn't even say goodbye.' Mann is wonderful, a uniquely skillful comic and dramatic actor—wide-eyed yet merrily devastating when the venom's called for. Rudd can get away with murder on sheer charm. But it's easy, and sort of lazy, to establish jokes and entire scenes built upon mocking somebody's dialect, or the older daughter's obsession with Lost." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1959, Arquette {{accepted}} Jack Paar's {{invitation to}} appear on Paar's NBC Tonight Show. Arquette created [...] "Charley Weaver, the wild old man from Mount Idy". He would bring along, and read, a letter from his [...] "Mamma" [...] back home. This characterization proved so popular that Arquette almost never again appeared in public as himself, but nearly always as Charley Weaver, complete with his squashed hat, little round glasses, rumpled shirt, broad tie, baggy pants, and suspenders. Arquette could often convulse Paar and the audience into helpless laughter by way of his timing and use of double entendres in describing the misadventures of his fictional family and townspeople. As Paar noted, in his foreword to Arquette's first Charley Weaver book:"Sometimes his jokes are old, and I live in the constant fear that the audience will beat him <b>to</b> the <b>punch</b> <b>line,</b> but they never have. And I suspect that if they ever do, he will rewrite the ending on the spot. I {{would not like to}} say that all his jokes are old, although some have been found carved in stone. What I want to say is that in a free-for-all ad lib session, Charley Weaver has and will beat the fastest gun alive." ...|$|R

In February 2008, criminal charges were first pressed against Khalid Sheik and his alleged co-conspirators in the Military Commission under the administration of president George W Bush. The trial began in June 2008. Five months later the accused indicated that they would plead guilty. In January 2009, president Barack Obama was elected with a promise to close down the Military Commission at Guantánamo Bay and to proceed with criminal trials under civil law. The new US attorney-general, Eric Holder, announced in November 2009, that the trials would be transferred from the military jurisdiction to the US federal district court. All charges were withdrawn in the Military Commission in January 2010 and the US Federal Court took over.

40|$|Much of what {{we think}} we know about the {{performance}} of humor relies on our intuitions about prosody (e. g., "it's all about timing"); however, this has never been empirically tested. Thus, the central question addressed in this article is whether speakers mark <b>punch</b> <b>lines</b> in jokes prosodically and, if so, how. To answer this question, this article unites both the recently emerged research agenda grounding spoken discourse analysis in the precision and verifiability of acoustic analysis and a research agenda within the field of discourse and humor focused on the "performance" of humorous narratives. This article presents an analysis of a relatively simple form: the joke or short humorous narrative. The starting point of this analysis is the folk theory of joke-telling. Through instrumental measurement of pitch, volume, and speech rate, this study shows that, contrary to the folk theory of joke-delivery, <b>punch</b> <b>lines</b> are not delivered significantly louder than the preceding text, but rather at a significantly lower pitch and slower speech rate than the text preceding the <b>punch</b> <b>line.</b> In addition, <b>punch</b> <b>lines</b> are often, but not necessarily, signaled by a laughing voice or a smiling voice and are not preceded by significant pauses. This article concludes that the folk theory of joke-delivery is largely refuted. This study further investigates whether the saliency of <b>punch</b> <b>lines,</b> which would predict higher volume and pitch, is less significant than their final position in the narrative, which, being associated with final position in a paratone, or spoken paragraph, predicts that they will demonstrate lower volume and pitch values. The conclusion is that final positioning trumps the saliency of the <b>punch</b> <b>lines</b> and accounts for the significantly lower pitch and lack of significantly higher volume in <b>punch</b> <b>lines.</b> (Contains 7 tables, 1 figure, and 8 footnotes. ...|$|R
