40|$|Plowing is an art, {{and good}} plowing is {{the pride of}} every farmer. A good job of plowing is {{apparent}} even to the casual observer. A well-adjusted plow will do better work, have lighter draft, give less wear on plow parts, and will make the tractor easier to operate than a poorly set plow. Most plows are received from the factory “knocked down,” and must be set up and adjusted before being used. Variations in plowing conditions may make frequent plow adjustments necessary. Most modern tractor plows have all adjustments necessary to set the plow properly. When properly set, a plow should {{do a good job}} under usual plowing conditions. If a poor plowing job is done with a <b>tractor</b> <b>plow,</b> it is usually traceable to improper adjustment or extremely unfavorable plowing conditions. In most cases, failure to do first-class plowing results from careless adjustments or lack of knowledge as to how to set the plow.

40|$|Topic: futuristic tractor In my work I {{focused on}} the design of heavy <b>tractor</b> <b>plow</b> in the future between 15 - 20 years. The main aim was to provide a {{solution}} that would undertake the issue of adaptation to different working conditions in which the tractor is moving. Adaptivnost was therefore my main goal. Specifically, I focused on balancing the tractor with respect to the driver (cab should ideally be in the middle between the wheels and as low as possible to reduce fluctuations cab drivers are very annoying and negatively affects driving performance on the tractor). This position is ideal for traveling, but not to work in small spaces and manipulate the front or rear aggregate when the requirements for the best visibility from the cab. Already in my sketches the main idea is evident when the tractor acts as a "compact housing", which change their length and position of the cab as required. For longer rides, such as dragging the machine back on the field, to extend the chassis cab and go down to the lowest position, thus creating an imaginary triangle (between the cabin and wheels), the lower base of the triangle is the longest and therefore the focus is what the lowest. Conversely for handling in a small space tractor chassis to "withdraw" - the smallest turning radius, while the cab driver to go and see better under the wheels, even on the front unit. As for power, and under current trends, it is considered that in the future will be the most efficient diesel-electric propulsion. Compared to existing engines will be smaller Diesel engine running at speed and deliver the ideal energy for the alternator, which converts it into electricity. energy for electric motors that are in each round. It has the advantage as an independent power to each wheel, improving acceleration, etc. As in the past, present and future, and my suggestion is having to {{deal with the fact that}} there always will be the engine, its chilling, and various other elements having a size and you can not change too much. With this fact I have worked from the beginning and to seek solutions that would be consistent with my intent. Finally, I chose the principle that the cabin extends hydraulically angle about 45 'forward and change the length distribution of wheel movement is going through the rear chassis rails. Visually, that is very closely linked to functional aspects, it is a clean and easily readable morphology. The whole tractor is distinct lines, which meanders from the front grille, obtahuje cab to her pulled out of the alternator. The aim was to achieve a compact and dynamic shape of the bonnet. The front lights are designed so that their size and location of the suit while riding on public roads, but also to the need for oversizing greater exposure while working in the field. This helps to light in the cab roof and wings, which enable even the correct estimate of the size and contour of the tractor for oncoming cars. For the same reason, get out of shape fenders and turn signals, which can thus be seen from all angles. The tanks are fitted on the sides of the cab chassis with a total 280 l frame cabin has a triangular profile that corresponds with the previously mentioned strong lines on the hood and headlights on the wings. It is designed to be not only comfortable but also getting a driver and still underrated sufficient space for the driver's legs stretch during long rides...|$|E
