We will compare various theories of clash placement (e. g Kager 2001; Gordon 2002; Alber 2005).

However, many questions about the mechanisms that Zn uses in plants still remain, such as the Zn efflux system, Zn homeostasis inside the cell, and transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. Further studies will enable us to clarify the mechanism of Zn transport and to manipulate the distribution of Zn to produce crops that can <b>tolerate</b> <b>stress</b> due to Zn deficiency, as well as enhance the Zn content of food crop seeds.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{this study}} {{confirms}} for B. braunii, {{what has been}} known for bacteria: B. braunii performs changes in lipid profile and unsaturation of membrane lipids in contact with solvents as a strategy to maintain membrane fluidity, <b>tolerate</b> <b>stress</b> and keep its growth. Additionally, as predicted by log P_O-W, n-decanol was identified as the most aggressive solvent as second-phase; limonene had an intermediate effect, whereas n-decane seems to be able to maintain high growth rates even at high concentrations, being the most suitable solvent to extract valuable lipophilic compounds like hydrocarbons in a two-phase culture, under conditions used in this study.|$|R
50|$|Psychological {{abuse is}} often not {{recognized}} by survivors of domestic violence as abuse. A study of college students by Goldsmith and Freyd report that many who have experienced emotional abuse do not characterize the mistreatment as abusive. Additionally, Goldsmith and Freyd show that these people also tend to exhibit higher than average rates of alexithymia (difficulty identifying and processing their own emotions). This {{is often the case}} when referring to victims of abuse within intimate relationships, as non-recognition of the actions as abuse may be a coping or defense mechanism in order to either seek to master, minimize or <b>tolerate</b> <b>stress</b> or conflict.|$|R

The number of reported cases is nearly {{twice as high as}} the next most common problem (GDV). Addison's disease is characterized by insufficient production of glucocorticoid and/or mineralocortoid in the adrenal cortex (near the kidneys). Addison's is often undiagnosed because early symptoms are vague and easily mistaken for other conditions. Standard Poodles with unexplained lethargy, frequent gastric disturbances, or an inability to <b>tolerate</b> <b>stress</b> should be tested for it.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which forms the outer-leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, acts as a permeability barrier. The lipid A moiety of LPS anchors it to the outer membrane bilayer. The MsbB enzyme myristoylates the lipid A precursor and loss of this enzyme, in Salmonella, is correlated with reduced virulence and severe growth defects that can both be compensated with extragenic suppressor mutations.

25|$|B-72 is a {{thermoplastic}} resin {{that was created}} by Rohm and Haas {{for use as a}} surface coating and as a vehicle for Flexographic ink. However B-72 is now being used more as an adhesive specifically for ceramic and glass.

30|$|A {{comprehensive}} understanding of coping {{may be difficult}} if we look only at the classic coping responses to acute stressful events. Moreover, research on adults {{has shown that the}} daily hassles are associated with physical and psychological dysfunction equally or even higher than the major life events (e.g., Compas, Wagner, Slavin, and Vannatta, 1986). It is conceivable that the reliance on only one class of events reduces the probability of obtaining significant relationships between coping efforts and both positive and negative outcomes. Therefore, in the present study, we proposed to examine coping strategies implemented by Chilean adults as responses to different stressful conditions. Additionally, studies published to date confirm that coping is a key variable in the process of reducing, minimizing, or <b>tolerating</b> <b>stress</b> (e.g., Meng and D’Arcy, 2016).|$|R
40|$|In {{south-western}} Western Australia, {{the incidence}} of potassium (K) deficiency in wheat has increased steadily, with two-thirds of the arable lands prone to potassium depletion through continued removal in hay or grain and straw.

Adequate K supply is required for obtaining high crop yield and quality and enhancing the efficiency of other nutrients {{and the ability of}} plants to <b>tolerate</b> <b>stresses</b> from soil moisture, salinity, temperature, disease and pests.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{typology}} of quantity-insensitive languages that <b>tolerate</b> <b>stress</b> clashes. Two descriptive generalizations {{emerge from this}} typology: 1) clashes are preferentially realised away from the edge, and 2) clashes with primary stress are avoided (Kager 2001). I demonstrate that this result cannot be captured in directional theories of stress, such as those employing gradient alignment (e. g. Gordon 2002; Alber 2005) or serial models (Prince 1983), because, in such approaches, the directionality of stress assignment is independent of preferences for clash realization. As a result, the distribution of clashes in quantity-insensitive languages provides an argument for a non-directional approach to stress (Kager 2001; McCarthy 2003; Buckley 2009). I propose {{a modified version of}} this approach, which avoids some pathological predictions made by the Kager (2001) system. A factorial typology is calculated using this constraint set and shown to be appropriately restrictive. ...|$|R

50|$|Beardie owners {{should be}} aware of the {{frequency}} of Addison's disease (insufficient production of glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids in the adrenal cortex) in this breed. It occurs in at least 2%-3.4% of Beardies in the USA/Canada survey, and is the cause of death in at least 1% of Beardies in the UK survey. Although these numbers seem low compared with those of other health issues, the percentages are much higher than for the general dog population (0.1%) and Addison's is responsible for a disproportionate number of deaths among young dogs. Addison's is often undiagnosed, since early symptoms are vague and easily mistaken for other conditions. Bearded Collies with unexplained lethargy, frequent gastric disturbances, or an inability to <b>tolerate</b> <b>stress</b> should be tested for Addison's. Addison's can cause fatal sodium/potassium imbalances but, if caught early and treated with lifelong medication, most dogs can live a relatively normal life.|$|R

In contrast, decreasing tae amount of space per man does not lead to such increases in levels of stress.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of the unsaturation of membrane lipids {{to the ability of}} the photosynthetic machinery to <b>tolerate</b> temperature <b>stress</b> was studied in a transgenic cyanobacterium. Anacystis nidulans R 2 -SPc was transformed with the desA gene, which encodes the Delta 12 -desaturase that desaturates the fatty acids of membrane lipids in Synechocystis PCC 6803. The transformant acquired the ability to introduce a second double bond into palmitoleic and oleic acids. The transformation enhanced the tolerance of the photosynthetic machinery to chilling stress but it had no detectable effect on the ability to <b>tolerate</b> heat <b>stress.</b> The transformation itself did not have any effect on photosynthetic activity. These results imply that an increase in the unsaturation of membrane lipids enhances the tolerance of the photosynthetic machinery toward chilling stress but not toward heat stress and that such an increase does not affect photosynthesis within the range of physiological temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{engineering}} of grown systems poses {{fundamentally different}} system integration challenges than ordinary engineering of static designs.

40|$|Cells {{respond to}} stress by {{altering}} gene expression, and these adjustments facilitate stress tolerance. Although transcriptional changes are integral to most stress responses, {{little is known}} about the mechanisms that permit the transcription apparatus itself to <b>tolerate</b> <b>stress.</b> Here we report that a major role of the RNA polymerase II subunit RPB 4 is to permit appropriate transcriptional responses during stress. Yeast cells lacking RPB 4 have essentially wild-type growth rates at moderate temperatures (18 to 22 degrees C), but their growth rates are substantially reduced at temperatures outside this range. When subjected to a heat shock, cells lacking RPB 4 rapidly lose the ability to transcribe genes and experience a dramatic loss in viability. When cells lacking RPB 4 are subjected to the nutrient stress that accompanies entry into stationary phase, they also exhibit a substantial decline in mRNA synthesis and in viability relative to wild-type cells. Interestingly, the portion of RNA polymerase II molecules that contain RPB 4 is small in log phase but increases substantially as cells enter stationary phase. We propose that the association of RPB 4 with the other RNA polymerase II subunits increases the tolerance of the enzyme to stress...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of iodine {{disinfection}} on the bacterial flora and hatching rate of grouper egg at two different stages of development were investigated. The eggs (at cleavage and eyed stages) were soaked for 10 min in sterile seawater (control) and at different free iodine concentrations- 2. 5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 ppm. Total bacterial and presumptive Vibrio count, {{as well as the}} hatching rate of the treated eggs were determined. Results showed that Vibrios are eliminated by iodine disinfection (2. 5 - 20 ppm) but not by rinsing with sterile seawater. The total bacterial load and hatching rate of eggs decreased as the iodine concentration increased. Iodine concentrations of 15 and 20 ppm were effective in significantly reducing the total bacterial load of grouper egg at both the cleavage and eyed stages. However, at these concentrations the hatching rates were also significantly lower. Results also showed that grouper, Epinephelus coioides, eggs <b>tolerate</b> <b>stress</b> better at the eyed stage than at the cleavage stage.

40|$|The current water {{shortage}} {{is a major}} concern in regard to our global climate change crisis. A decrease in the availability of water will have direct effects on the development of plants. Some crops, such as Oryza sativa, or commonly known as rice, requires an abundant amount of water for adequate growth. With the {{water shortage}} crisis, it will become extremely difficult to harvest such crops to meet the world’s food demand. However, many plants have evolved mechanisms for overcoming and <b>tolerating</b> <b>stresses</b> such as drought. My research focuses on studying the proteins involved with these mechanisms. The WRKY superfamily is a family of transcription factors that up or down-regulate pathways in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. We propose and hypothesize that OsWRKY 70 plays a role in the abiotic stress of drought in rice. To identify the physiological role of this gene, we studied the phenotype of OsWRKY 70 knockout mutants using an insertional transposon in comparison to its wildtype counterparts. This project aims to study the proteins involved with drought resistance in rice, which will pave the way for the production of genetically engineered crops that will be better at conserving water...|$|R
40|$|While {{phytoremediation}} {{has been}} considered as an in situ bioprocess to remediate environmental contaminants, the application of functional endophytic bacteria within plants remains a potential strategy that could enhance the plants’ efficiency in phytoremediation. In this study, 219 endophytes were isolated from plants that are predominantly located in a constructed wetland, including reed (Phragmites australis) and water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica). Twenty-five strains of the isolated endophytes utilize aromatic compounds as sole carbon source; Achromobacter xylosoxidans strain F 3 B was chosen for the in planta studies using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that those endophytic isolates of A. xylosoxidans formed a cluster within its species, and a specific real-time PCR detection method was developed for confirming {{the stability of the}} isolates in plants. In the presence of either catechol or phenol, inoculation of A. thaliana with F 3 B could extend into the root lengths and fresh weights to promote pollutants removal rates.

30|$|Empirical {{evidence}} {{based on}} different measurement techniques, namely, using per capita human capital investment and per capita health expenditure and anthropometric indicators {{do not show}} the same result. The per capita expenditure estimations show that resources allocation in a household is biased against girls. On the other hand, the empirical works using anthropometric indicators confirm the contrary. Many of them find that girls have more nutrition than boys. We find inconsistent evidence in this aspect. Our results indicate that boys and girls have equal nutrition. Our conclusion to this contradiction is deduced from the three possible scenarios we have explained above. The nutrition equality is {{due to differences in}} stress tolerance and physical exercises between boys and girls. Even though resource allocation is biased against girls, girls’ bodily development enables them to <b>tolerate</b> <b>stress</b> such that their nutrition is equal to boys’ during food shortage. Another scenario might be that, in this age group, boys exercise more than girls (Timmons et al. 2012). Therefore, boys’ physical exercise reduces boys’ body weight (i.e., it negatively affects the anthropometric indicators of a boy), compared to girls’ body weight which in turn makes boys’ have equal nutrition as girls even though boys get more resources than girls.|$|R
40|$|Performance and {{response}} to defoliation of Sanguisorba officinalis (Rosaceae) seedlings from mown and successional habitats Martin Musche, Josef Settele, and Walter Durka Abstract: In agricultural habitats, selection may favour plants that show a pronounced ability to <b>tolerate</b> <b>stress</b> induced by specific management methods. However, genetic erosion associated with habitat fragmentation may diminish this ability. To assess the role of mowing as a selection pressure {{and the impact of}} fragmentation processes on the ability to tolerate foliage loss, we grew 215 plants of the perennial herb Sanguisorba officinalis L. originating from 16 differently sized pop-ulations, located in mown meadows and successional fallows, in a common environment, and measured their performance {{and response}} to defoliation. Plants from meadows and fallows neither differed in performance characters nor in their abil-ity to compensate for foliage loss. However, independently from the habitat of origin, populations slightly differed in per-formance. This variation was not due to differences in population size, plant density, or level of genetic variation, indicating its independence from genetic erosion, which may go along with habitat fragmentation. Rather, these differences between populations appear to be the outcome of unknown selection pressures or random genetic drift. Plants from succes-sional fallows retain their potential to cope with mowing, presumably due to the low generation turnover of the perennia...|$|R
