50|$|The IBM 046 <b>Tape-to-Card</b> Punch and the IBM 047 <b>Tape-to-Card</b> Printing Punch (which {{was almost}} identical, {{but with the}} {{addition}} of a printing mechanism) read data from punched paper tape and punched that data into cards. The IBM 063 Card-Controlled Tape Punch read punched cards, punching that data into paper tape.|$|E
50|$|Built-in {{checking}} features {{are contained in}} the Card-to-Tape Converter, the <b>Tape-to-Card</b> Converter and the High Speed Printer.|$|E
50|$|The 70/15 {{was often}} used as a {{satellite}} processor for larger systems or used as an intelligent terminal for remote job entry. Typical applications of a satellite processor would include card-to-tape conversion, card/tape-to-printer report generation, <b>tape-to-card</b> punching, input pre-processing and verification, or tab-shop tasks like file sorting, merge, and data selection.|$|E
50|$|A typical UNIVAC I {{installation}} {{had several}} ancillary devices. There were, typically: a printer that read a magnetic tape and printed output on continuous-form paper; a card-to-tape converter, that read punched cards and recorded their images on magnetic tape; and a <b>tape-to-card</b> converter, that read a magnetic tape and produced punched cards. There was no UNIVAC provided operating system. Operators loaded on a UNISERVO a program tape {{which could be}} loaded automatically by processor logic. The appropriate source and output data tapes would be mounted and the program started. Results tapes {{then went to the}} offline printer or typically for data processing into short term storage to be updated with the next set of data produced on the offline card to tape unit. The mercury delay line memory tank temperature was very closely controlled as the speed of sound in mercury varies with temperature. In the event of a power failure, many hours could elapse before the temperature stabilized.|$|E
40|$|Transcript, 147 pp. Audio file {{available}} at [URL] provides information about relations of Engineering Research Associates with the Navy, and with Remington Rand management after their acquisition of ERA. He also describes ERA projects in detail. Specific topics include: early research on {{magnetic drum storage}} systems, reports to the National Bureau of Standards, the Atlas I project and the commercial by-product (the 1101), the Atlas II project and the commercial by-product (the 1103), the 1102 built for Arnold Engineering Development Center, the 1104 built for Westinghouse/BOMARC, the Remington Rand <b>Tape-to-Card</b> Converter, the File Computer, ERA non-computer projects, ERA's design contract with IBM {{and its relation to}} the IBM 650, UNIVAC II, and patents and their defensive use in litigation...|$|E
