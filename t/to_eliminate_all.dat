5|$|It must {{be taken}} into account that Soviet T-26 was one the most modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>all</b> those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug does not need <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>all</b> prions, but simply needs {{to slow down the}} rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} {{casualties}} on 1 February 1741 in Pati, Chinese insurgents spread through central Java, joining {{forces with the}} Javanese while staging sham battles to convince the Dutch that the Javanese were supporting them. As the deception became increasingly obvious and the Chinese drew closer to Semarang, Visscher became mentally unstable. After capturing Rembang, Tanjung, and Jepara, the joint Chinese and Javanese army besieged Semarang in June 1741. In response, Visscher issued an order <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>all</b> Chinese in Java. Prince Cakraningrat IV of Madura offered his alliance, and worked from Madura westward, killing any Chinese he and his troops could find and quashing the rebellion in eastern Java.|$|E

5|$|This {{string of}} Muslim {{victories}} curtailed Persian efforts to recapture lower Mesopotamia {{and left the}} Persian capital Ctesiphon unguarded and vulnerable to Muslim attack. Before assaulting the Persian capital, Khalid decided <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>all</b> Persian forces {{from the south and}} west, and thus marched against the border city of Firaz, where he defeated a combined force of Sassanid Persians, Byzantine Romans and Christian Arabs and captured the city's fortress during the Battle of Firaz in December 633. This was the last battle in his conquest of lower Mesopotamia. While Khalid {{was on his way to}} attack Qadissiyah, a key fort on the way to Ctesiphon, he received a letter from Abu Bakr and was sent to the Byzantine front in Syria to assume the command of Muslim armies with the intent of conquering Roman Syria.|$|E

5|$|Hitler was {{appointed}} Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933. The Nazi Party then began <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>all</b> political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the powers and {{offices of the}} Chancellery and Presidency. A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole Führer (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became above all laws. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In {{the midst of the}} Great Depression, the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy. Extensive public works were undertaken, including the construction of Autobahnen (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.|$|E
5|$|In Angry Birds, {{the player}} {{controls}} {{a flock of}} multi-colored birds that are attempting to retrieve their eggs, which have been stolen {{by a group of}} hungry green pigs. In each stage of the gameplay, enemy pigs are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood, glass, and stone resembling children's toy building blocks. The objective of the game is <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>all</b> the pigs on the level. Using a slingshot, players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures, causing the blocks to collapse and squash the pigs. The player must set the angle and force of the bird's travel by pulling back on the slingshot (using intuitive touch-controls in the mobile versions). The launch process is quick and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a player simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual slingshot will be released. In various stages of the game, additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks are incorporated into the structures, and power-ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack hard-to-reach pigs.|$|E
5|$|Odin Sphere is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) side-scrolling action role-playing game where the player takes control of five different characters across six playable scenarios. Areas within levels are circular stages allowing movement {{left or right}} with exits leading to other areas; the main goal in each area is <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>all</b> enemies and proceed to the next area. Combat—which uses a beat em up-style battle system—takes place within these areas, and revolves around the player character {{using a combination of}} physical attacks and Psypher skills, skills tied to each character's magical weapon. Combination attacks are triggered by attacking enemies continuously. Jumping can be used to reach airborne enemies within stages. At the end of each battle, grades are awarded based on the battle time, damage taken from enemies, and the amount of damage dealt. The amount of in-game currency the player receives as a reward after each battle depends on the battle grade.|$|E

5|$|Outside of {{the main}} game, players can play an {{additional}} mode called Flick Rush, which can be played alone or with another player via wireless multiplayer. In this mode, players battle {{with a team of}} three Spirits and pit them against each other. Players fight against their opponent by flicking up cards from the touchscreen. Each card has a number value determining its attack strength, with multiple cards combining to increase the overall value. The player whose attack value is greater than their opponent's gets to attack with their Spirit. A slowly replenishing meter determines how many cards the player can send out at a time, and each Spirit has a limited amount of cards that can be replenished by swapping them out with another Spirit. The first player <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>all</b> of their opponent's Spirits wins the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} combat {{aircraft}} {{had been a}} problem for ONUC. The UN had been delaying the commencement of the operation until sufficient air strength had been amassed to conduct a single attack that could destroy the Katangese Air Force. They feared that a limited attack would fail <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>all</b> Katangese aircraft and stretch their own forces thin, thereby allowing Katanga to disperse its air forces among hidden airfields and launch retaliatory attacks on Kamina Air Base. India had withdrawn its Canberra bombers in October to guard against China, and Ethiopia repatriated its force of Sabres after one was lost in an accident. However, new air surveillance radar equipment was deployed in Kamina and Élisabethville. The ONUC Air Division was bolstered in November by the delivery of two Saab 29 Tunnan (J-29) reconnaissance-variant jets from Sweden, greatly enhancing the force's intelligence capabilities. This was followed shortly thereafter by the arrival of several J-29 combat aircraft and a 380-strong anti-aircraft unit from Norway. In all, the UN would field 10 combat J-29s in the operation.|$|E
5|$|Mulan is {{initially}} misguided by Mushu who encourages {{her to go}} to war and in how to behave like a man. However, under command of Li Shang, she and her new friends at the camp, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, become skilled warriors. Mushu, desiring to see Mulan succeed, creates a fake order from Li Shang's father, General Li, ordering Li Shang to follow them into the mountains. They arrive at a burnt-out village and discover that General Li and his forces have been wiped out by the Huns. As they solemnly leave the mountains, they are ambushed by the Huns when Mushu accidentally fired a cannon causing their position to be given away, but a second firing of a cannon by Mulan buries most of the enemy forces in an avalanche. Mulan is slashed by Shan Yu in his rage at her wiping out his army during the battle, and she is forced to reveal her deception when she receives medical attention. Instead of executing Mulan as the law states, Li Shang spares her life for saving his life from the avalanche by leaving her on the mountain {{as the rest of the}} army departs for the Imperial City to report the news of the Huns' demise. However, the avalanche failed <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>all</b> the enemies, as Mulan catches sight of a small number of surviving Huns, including Shan Yu, making their way to the City, intent on capturing the Emperor.|$|E
