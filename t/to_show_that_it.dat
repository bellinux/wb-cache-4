5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E

5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} frontier with Mercia {{ran across}} England, from the Humber in the east, following the River Ouse and the River Don, to the Mersey in the west. Some archaeological evidence, the Roman Rig dyke, near modern Sheffield, appears <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a defended border, with large earthworks {{set back from}} the frontier. The Nico Ditch, {{to the south of}} modern Manchester, has been cited in this context, though it has also been argued that it was simply a boundary marker without fortifications. In the far north, the evidence is less clear, and it appears that authority lay with sub-kings, perhaps including native British rulers. The family of Ecgfrith's general Berht may have been one such dynasty of under-kings.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century Western {{scholars}} {{became aware}} of the manuscript {{as a consequence of the}} correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library, successively Paulus Bombasius, and Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. In 1521, Bombasius was consulted by Erasmus as to whether the Codex Vaticanus contained the Comma Johanneum, and Bombasius supplied a transcript of 1 John 4:1–3 and 1 John 5:7–11 <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> did not. Sepúlveda in 1533 cross-checked all places where Erasmus's New Testament (the Textus Receptus) differed from the Vulgate, and supplied Erasmus with 365 readings where the Codex Vaticanus supported the latter, although the list of these 365 readings has been lost. Consequently, the Codex Vaticanus acquired the reputation of being an old Greek manuscript that agreed with the Vulgate rather than with the Textus Receptus. Not until much later would scholars realise it conformed to a text that differed from both the Vulgate and the Textus Receptus – a text that could also be found in other known early Greek manuscripts, such as the Codex Regius (L), housed in the French Royal Library (now Bibliothèque nationale de France).|$|E
5|$|This fern was {{at first}} {{identified}} by André Michaux, in 1803, as black spleenwort (Asplenium adiantum-nigrum). Carl Ludwig Willdenow recognized and {{described it as a}} separate species, which he named Asplenium montanum, in 1810. In 1901, John A. Shafer attempted to transfer it to the genus Athyrium as Athyrium montanum, but this name is illegitimate as a later homonym of Athyrium montanum (Lam.) Röhl. ex Spreng. The species was segregated from Asplenium as Chamaefilix montana by Oliver Atkins Farwell in 1931. The change was not widely accepted and current authorities do not recognize this segregate genus. In 1974, Timothy Reeves described an unusual population of A.montanum from the Shawangunk Mountains. Having used chromatography <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not a hybrid, he interpreted it as a new form, Asplenium montanum forma shawangunkense. In this form, as contrasted with the usual forma montanum, the leaf blade is yellow-green, the fronds continue highly dissected to the apex and do not come to a pointed tip, the fronds are shorter and more highly dissected than usual, and all fronds are sterile.|$|E

5|$|Variation and Evolution in Plants was {{the first}} book to provide a wide-ranging {{explanation}} of how evolutionary mechanisms operated in plants at the genetic level. It brought concepts related to plant evolution into line with animal evolution as it emerged from Dobzhansky's 1937 Genetics and the Origin of Species and provided the conceptual framework to organize a disparate set of disciplines into a new field: plant evolutionary biology. In the book Stebbins argued that evolution needed to be studied as a dynamic problem and that evolution must be considered on three levels: first, that of individual variation within an interbreeding population; second, that of the distribution and frequency of this variation; and third, that of the separation and divergence of populations {{as the result of}} the building up of isolating mechanisms leading to the formation of species. He used the work of biosystematists Clausen, Keck, Hiesey, and Turesson <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was possible to distinguish between genotypic and phenotypic variationthat is, genetically identical plants could have different phenotypes in different environments.

40|$|Abstract: According to the {{standard}} reception, Kierkegaard thinks of ethics as a possible stage in human life. In this paper, I {{do not want to}} contest this interpretation, but I will argue <b>that</b> <b>it</b> often overlooks how the concept of ethics plays another vital role in Kierkegaard’s thinking, namely that of establishing a necessary connection between ethics and certain forms of philosophy. To avoid the unfruitful thinking of ‘the speculation’, the philosopher must accept that her vantage point is given, not in pure objectivity, but in {{the fact that she is}} this particular human being; that is, the ethical dimension of her life. In this way, Kierkegaard claims that any philosophy concerning human existence must also include ethical considerations. This is a view also held by Ludwig Wittgenstein, but a comparison of the two philosophers <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> even if Kierkegaard finds such fruitful philosophy possible, he also strives <b>to</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has a limited scope. 1.
