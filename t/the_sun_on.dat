5|$|In 1772, the French {{scientist}} Antoine Lavoisier used a lens {{to concentrate}} {{the rays of}} <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>on</b> a diamond {{in an atmosphere of}} oxygen, and showed that the only product of the combustion was carbon dioxide, proving that diamond is composed of carbon. Later in 1797, the English chemist Smithson Tennant repeated and expanded that experiment. By demonstrating that burning diamond and graphite releases the same amount of gas, he established the chemical equivalence of these substances.|$|E

5|$|Sleeping Dogs {{is set in}} a {{contemporary}} Hong Kong, which is split into four districts named after regions of the city.

5|$|The Moon's orbit intersects {{with the}} {{ecliptic}} {{at the two}} nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as eclipse seasons, and {{there will always be}} at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>on</b> both occasions in two partial eclipses. This means that, in any given year, there will always be at least two solar eclipses, and there can be as many as five.|$|E
5|$|To the band's consternation, {{they were}} forced to cancel their {{appearance}} at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, informing the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion.

5|$|As {{a member}} of the tree frog family, the green and golden bell frog spends much time basking in <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>on</b> vegetation, rocks, and reeds, usually near water, or hopping around between such places. Unlike most frog species, it is often active during the day. When handled, this species secretes a slimy acrid mucus, which {{consists}} of 17 aurein peptides. Thirteen of these show broad-spectrum antibiotic and anticancer activity. The secretion makes the frog slippery and hard to grip, and is poisonous to some other species of frogs, so it is a useful defensive tool for green and golden bell frogs. Males often fight one another if they come within 1 m of each other, frequently leading to injuries.|$|E
5|$|Sleeping Dogs is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective. The player controls Wei Shen, a Chinese-American police officer who goes undercover and infiltrates <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>On</b> Yee Triad organization. The first missions of the game are a linear tutorial for controlling the character. After these missions, the player is allowed to explore the game's world and take part in side missions and other activities. Shen navigates the world by running, jumping, climbing over obstacles, swimming, and driving cars, boats and motorcycles. The heads-up display (HUD) interface features a mini-map that indicates targets, key locations (safe houses and contact points) and Shen's current position. The mini-map incorporates two meters: one shows Shen's health and the other his face. When the face meter fills, upgrades are unlocked such as health regeneration, improved combat abilities and reduced equipment costs. The HUD also displays the weapon carried and its ammunition count.|$|E
5|$|The {{announcement}} of the review {{appeared to have been}} triggered by a News International campaign, by way of one of its British tabloids, <b>The</b> <b>Sun.</b> <b>On</b> 11 May 2011, as it was serializing Kate McCann's book, Madeleine, The Suns front page hosted an open letter from the McCanns in which they asked Prime Minister David Cameron to set up a new inquiry; 20,000 people signed the newspaper's petition that day. On the same day, according to her testimony to the Leveson Inquiry, Theresa May spoke by telephone, at her instigation, to Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News International, and Dominic Mohan, editor of The Sun. The next day she wrote to the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Paul Stephenson, to say that the Portuguese police had agreed to cooperate with a British inquiry. Within 24 hours, Cameron made the announcement about Operation Grange, to be financed by a Home Office contingency fund.|$|E

5|$|The first story-driven game expansion, Nightmare in North Point, was {{released}} in October 2012. Its theme is based on Chinese horror and folklore, and features Chinese vampires known as the jiangshi. In the expansion's plot, Shen's girlfriend is abducted by the ghost of Smiley Cat, a former gangster killed by Uncle Po, who has risen up from the underworld as a ghost to take his vengeance on <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>On</b> Yee. Shen fights Smiley Cat's army of jiangshi, Yaoguai and possessed gangsters, {{as well as the}} ghosts of Dogeyes, Johnny Ratface and Ponytail, who reveals that Wei can defeat Smiley Cat by burning the last remnant of his original body. After incinerating his little finger, Cat returns to the underworld and Shen's girlfriend is freed.|$|E
5|$|From September 1610, Galileo {{observed}} that Venus exhibited {{a full set}} of phases {{similar to that of the}} Moon. The heliocentric model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the Sun would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, in Ptolemy's geocentric model it was impossible for any of the planets' orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the Sun. Traditionally, the orbit of Venus was placed entirely on the near side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases. It was, however, also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases. After Galileo's telescopic observations of the crescent, gibbous and full phases of Venus, therefore, this Ptolemaic model became untenable. Thus in the early 17th century, as a result of his discovery, the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo-heliocentric planetary models, such as the Tychonic, Capellan and Extended Capellan models, each either with or without a daily rotating Earth. These all had the virtue of explaining the phases of Venus without the vice of the 'refutation' of full heliocentrism's prediction of stellar parallax. Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus was thus arguably his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two-stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo-heliocentrism.|$|E
5|$|The core {{purpose of}} a stela was to glorify the king. Many Maya stelae depict only {{the king of the}} city, and {{describe}} his actions with hieroglyphic script. Even when the individual depicted is not the king himself, the text or scene usually relates the subject to the king. Openly declaring the importance and power of the king to the community, the stela portrayed his wealth, prestige and ancestry, and depicted him wielding the symbols of military and divine power. Stelae were raised to commemorate important events, especially {{at the end of a}} k'atun 20-year cycle of the Maya calendar, or to mark a quarter or a half k'atun. The stela did not just mark off a period of time; it has been argued that it physically embodied that period of time. The hieroglyphic texts on the stelae describe how some of the calendrical ceremonies required the king to perform ritual dance and bloodletting. At Tikal, the twin pyramid groups were built to celebrate the k'atun ending and reflected Maya cosmology. These groups possessed pyramids on the east and west sides that represented the birth and death of <b>the</b> <b>sun.</b> <b>On</b> the south side, a nine-doored building was situated in order to represent the underworld. On the north side was a walled enclosure that represented the celestial region; it was left open to the sky. It was in this celestial enclosure that a stela-altar pair was placed, the altar being a fitting throne for the divine king. Calakmul practised a tradition that was unusual in the Maya area, that of raising twin stelae depicting both the king and his wife.|$|E
