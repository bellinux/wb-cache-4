5|$|<b>Thermoplastics,</b> by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some <b>thermoplastics</b> may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline <b>thermoplastics</b> have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for <b>thermoplastics).</b> Examples of <b>thermoplastics</b> include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|E
5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or <b>thermoplastics,</b> by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal. In addition to melting the base metal, a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material. Pressure may also be {{used in conjunction with}} heat, or by itself, to produce a weld. Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>thermoplastics</b> {{can also}} be welded using {{chemical}} solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E

50|$|A {{heat sealer}} is a machine used to seal products, packaging, and other <b>thermoplastic</b> {{materials}} using heat. This {{can be with}} uniform <b>thermoplastic</b> monolayers or with materials having several layers, at least one being <b>thermoplastic.</b> Heat sealing can join two similar materials together or can join dissimilar materials, one of which has a <b>thermoplastic</b> layer.|$|R
5|$|When <b>thermoplastics</b> are moulded, {{typically}} pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for <b>thermoplastics</b> relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E

25|$|<b>Thermoplastics</b> are {{difficult}} to machine because they have poor thermal conductivity. This creates heat that builds up in the cutting zone, which degrades the tool life and locally melts the plastic. Once the plastic melts, it just flows around the cutting edge instead of being removed by it. Machinability can be improved by using high lubricity coolant and keeping the cutting area free of chip build up.|$|E

25|$|Although not {{a type of}} {{familiar}} silica-based glass, the substance, like many <b>thermoplastics,</b> is often technically classified {{as a type of}} glass (in that it is a non-crystalline vitreous substance) hence its occasional historic designation as acrylic glass.

25|$|Unlike most <b>thermoplastics,</b> {{polycarbonate}} can undergo large plastic deformations without cracking or breaking.
