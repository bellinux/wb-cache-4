2500|$|Modernism {{in music}} is a {{philosophical}} and aesthetic stance underlying the period of change and development in musical language that occurred from 1890 to 1930, a period of diverse reactions in challenging and reinterpreting older categories of music, innovations that lead to new ways of organizing and approaching harmonic, melodic, sonic, and rhythmic aspects of music, and changes in aesthetic worldviews in close relation to the larger identifiable period of modernism in the arts of the time. <b>The</b> <b>operative</b> <b>word</b> most associated with it is [...] "innovation".

2500|$|At the Old Trafford Roses Match in 1926, {{a record}} 78,617 spectators paid {{to watch the}} match peter out into a high scoring draw, with centuries from Lancashire's Harry Makepeace (126), Ernest Tyldesley (139) and 92 from Frank Watson being {{answered}} by Yorkshire legends Percy Holmes (143) and Herbert Sutcliffe (89) who put on 199 {{as if to make}} amends for events 2 years previously. Leonard Green, Lancashire's captain, was batting when the score stood at 499. Neville Cardus relates the story that Green said to himself [...] "It's not likely that Lancashire ever again will score 500 against Yorkshire, so I'm going to get this single run if it kills me." [...] He pushed a ball from Wilfred Rhodes to the off-side and ran 'like the wind'. The ball was hurled back in anger by Yorkshire legend Emmott Robinson, striking Rhodes on the wrist while Green dived to make his ground. Picking himself up he heard Rhodes muttering to himself:"There's somebody runnin' up and down this wicket. Ah don't know who it is, but there's some-body runnin' up and down this wicket."

40|$|The works {{referred}} to above indicate the usefulness of viewing an N-particle system from a higher-dimensional perspective. In doing so, one should attempt {{to strike a balance}} between conceptual clarity and computational efficiency, which mitigates against considering calculations in 3 n-dimensional space except for rather small values of n. It appears that such a procedure may be profitably employed if a system of N particles were to be considered as consisting of a collection of units or sets, (I{sub k}), each containing n{sub k} particles so that {Sigma}{sub k} n{sub k} = N. The resulting problem associated with these sets of particles that interact with one another is obviously formally identical to the original one. However, it possesses the formal advantage of allowing, in principle, the systematic approach to an exact solution by treating the entire system as a single unit. <b>The</b> <b>operative</b> <b>words</b> here are in principle, as practical applications do not seem to be possible but for the smallest number of particles in a unit, say n = 2 or n = 3. However, in such an implementation, the interparticle correlation is treated directly and explicitly within a unit, resulting in a more accurate treatment of the system the larger the number of particle in a unit...|$|R

Field operatives must make at least one guess per turn, risking a wrong guess and its consequences. They may also end their turn voluntarily at any point thereafter, since incorrect guesses have additional, worse consequences than simply ending the turn.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{dictated}} <b>operative</b> note is {{an important}} and {{integral part of the}} patient record. Despite their importance little material regarding <b>the</b> quality of <b>operative</b> notes have been published. Do they accurately reflect the events that occure during an operative procedure? We wanted to examine this by reviewing the video recordings of cholecystectomies performed in a local hospital in Norway. We examined 193 consecutive elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies that had been videotaped. Perioperative events were classified and registered into different categories. <b>The</b> corresponding <b>operative</b> note was scrutinized and events registered into the same categories. <b>The</b> videotapes and <b>operative</b> notes were examined retrospectively. Ten different surgeons had dictated <b>the</b> <b>operative</b> notes. A total of 225 and 204 events were recorded from the videotapes and <b>the</b> <b>operative</b> notes respectively. In 63 cases no events were recorded, neither on videotape or in <b>the</b> corresponding <b>operative</b> note. In 27 cases the number and type of events exactly matched. This means that in 90 out of 193 cases (47 %) there was concurrence between <b>the</b> video and <b>operative</b> note. There was considerable variation in the way surgeons dictated their notes. There were also differences between the different categories of events. Bleedings were reported more often in <b>the</b> <b>operative</b> note (88) compared to the videotapes (63). This was {{due to the fact that}} some bleedings were considered to be part of the procedure upon examining the videotapes and were not recorded as an event. Events with serious complications like injuries to the bile ducts and small intestine were well documented. Liver lacerations were left out in <b>the</b> <b>operative</b> report in two third of the cases, and perforation of the gallbladder and ductus cysticus were reported 52 times in <b>the</b> <b>operative</b> notes, but 61 on the videotapes. Leakage of bile was left out 12 times compared to the videos 47 cases. <b>The</b> <b>operative</b> notes we have examined included the main events, but there is room for improvement on certain details. Laparoscopic procedures are well suited for video documentation and therefore suitable for assessment of the surgical content of <b>the</b> <b>operative</b> note...|$|R
