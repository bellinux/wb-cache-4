25|$|That night, {{the family}} stays {{at a hotel}} where they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a plan and Jules shows Sandspur to his girlfriend, Cindy. Based {{on the story of}} the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Nick thinks about the {{possibility}} of asking the merfolk to lure the giants to the sea, since they seem to be hypnotized by a nixie's singing. The kids sneak out to the beach, where they find that the mermaids hate land-dwellers and kidnap Jules, promising to let him go and sing the giants to the sea if the kids bring them a fish that has never been in their sea. They steal a tropical fish from Cindy's father's aquarium and race back to the beach. The mermaids are amazed that they completed the task and return Jules. Keeping their promise but intending to trick the humans, the mermaids sing for only a little while and to no effect before disappearing. However, Nick manages to tape their song in a tape recorder, which they intend to use to lure the giants themselves.|$|E
500|$|BioShock 2 was {{announced}} in 2008, with its development being led by 2K Marin. Levine stated that Irrational (then 2K Boston) {{was not involved in}} the game's sequel because they wanted to [...] "swing for the fences" [...] and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> something [...] "very, very different", which was later revealed as BioShock Infinite. BioShock 3 was also announced, with its release assumed to likely coincide with the BioShock film. BioShock 2 takes place about ten years following the events of the first game. The player assumes the role of Subject Delta, a precursor of the Big Daddies who must search the fallen city of Rapture for his former Little Sister, Eleanor. BioShock 2 was released for Windows PC, Mac, Xbox 360, and the PlayStation 3 worldwide on February 9, 2010.|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} the band {{reportedly}} spent afternoons getting stoned and watching Three Stooges reruns. One day, they had a post-Stooges meeting to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a name. Kramer said {{when he was in}} school he would write the word aerosmith all over his notebooks. The name had popped into his head after listening to Harry Nilsson's album Aerial Ballet, which featured jacket art of a circus performer jumping out of a biplane. Initially, Kramer's bandmates were unimpressed; they all thought {{he was referring to the}} Sinclair Lewis novel they were required to read in high school English class. [...] "No, not Arrowsmith," [...] Kramer explained. [...] "A-E-R-O...Aerosmith." [...] The band settled upon this name after also considering [...] "the Hookers" [...] and [...] "Spike Jones." ...|$|E

500|$|Arthur's costume was {{the easiest}} to create, as the color scheme {{mirrored}} his comic book counterpart, and was constructed to give a [...] "wetsuit look". The costume was also designed to be more form-fitting, to complement Ritchson's physique. Victor and Arthur's tops were also hoodie variations. When designing Dinah Lance's Black Canary costume, {{certain aspects of the}} comic book character were kept, while others changed entirely. For instance, the character retains her classic fishnet stockings, but the external, black mask the character wears is swapped for a painted mask. Cranstoun researched the various versions of Black Canary's costume, looking through the 1940s and 50s, to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the right version for the show. Cranstoun explained that she primarily came across two versions. One version reminded the designer of a Playboy Bunny, with a [...] "curvy, corseted, strapless thing that was not at all action-friendly". The other was more reminiscent of Lara Croft and Tank Girl, which is the route Cranstoun took. What Cranstoun created was a [...] "zipped, sleeveless body suit with a boot that was really flat and practical". The designer also kept the yellow accents the comic version had, as well as the long gloves. The filming crew did test shots with various masks for the character, including a leather mask reminiscent of the comic book character's look, before going with the painted variation.|$|E
500|$|Lonsdale's {{employer}} and landlord received {{phone calls from}} Scientology representatives who claimed {{that he was a}} religious bigot and dangerous. Lonsdale was subpoenaed by the Church of Scientology for a deposition in the fall of 2006, and the Church claimed that he belonged to an anti-Scientology group which had previously been barred from protesting in certain areas in downtown Clearwater, the Lisa McPherson Trust. Luke Lirot, the lawyer who defended Lonsdale in the matter, told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "I found him to be quite affable and truly a very intelligent man ... I certainly hope that a very thorough investigation is conducted." [...] In his deposition, Lonsdale stated he was unemployed and began to educate himself about Scientology while working on a photography project on homeless people in Clearwater. After reading more about Scientology, he decided to shed light on the organization and irritate Scientologists. Of the claims Scientology made that Lonsdale was affiliated with the Lisa McPherson Trust, Lirot commented: [...] "It was obvious to everybody {{he had nothing to do}} with the trust, and the trust had been disbanded and dissolved many years prior ... They just wanted to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a way to preclude him from exercising his right to picket in downtown Clearwater, and they were unsuccessful in doing that." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "b-boys" [...] and [...] "b-girls" [...] {{were the}} dancers to Herc's breaks, who were {{described}} as [...] "breaking". Herc has noted that [...] "breaking" [...] was also street slang of the time meaning [...] "getting excited", [...] "acting energetically," [...] or [...] "causing a disturbance". Herc coined the terms [...] "b-boy", [...] "b-girl," [...] and [...] "breaking" [...] which {{became part of the}} lexicon of what would be eventually called hip hop culture. Early Kool Herc b-boy and later DJ innovator Grandmixer DXT describes the early evolution as follows: [...] " ... verybody would form a circle and the B-boys would go into the center. At first the dance was simple: touch your toes, hop, kick out your leg. Then some guy went down, spun around on all fours. Everybody said wow and went home to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> something better."In the early 1980s, the media began to call this style [...] "breakdance," [...] which in 1991 the New York Times wrote was [...] "an art as demanding and inventive as mainstream dance forms like ballet and jazz." [...] Since this emerging culture was still without a name, participants often identified as [...] "b-boys," [...] a usage that included and went beyond the specific connection to dance, a usage that would persist in hip hop culture.|$|E

The forged metal figurines were created by blacksmith Kelly Gilliam. According to Ament, the band had trouble coming up with a name for the album. After the artwork had been finalized and the tracks were sequenced, the band spent weeks <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a title. Vedder suggested Riot Act, and the band members went with it as they were tired with <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a title. McCready stated that the title has no real significance. He said, [...] "I guess we were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a title that reflected some of the music on the record, which we thought was urgent-sounding and kind of loud...It just seemed to fit." [...] Ament implied that the title has to do with [...] "getting your act together." ...|$|R

Emma (Jennifer Morrison) {{suggests}} they leave town, but the ice wall is blocking every way out and when David tries to cut it down, new ice structures emerge to block his effort. However, a crack appears in the ice, which reveals Anna's necklace, and Elsa retrieves it.

Elsa (Georgina Haig) takes her sister's necklace and attempts to find Anna using a locator spell, but it leads her and Emma to a solid wall in the tunnels under the library. Emma convinces Elsa that it is too risky to blast through. After making it back to the library, at the constant urging of Regina, and eventually Mary Margaret, Emma explains to Elsa that she needs to think about saving more lives than just Anna's. Elsa finally hands over the bag containing the necklace, but when Mother Superior opens it, it is revealed that Elsa has swapped out the necklace for rocks and has gone to find Anna on her own.|$|E
