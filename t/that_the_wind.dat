5|$|On 26January 2010, nearly 14years later, the World Meteorological Organization {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> gust was {{the highest}} recorded worldwide. This gust surpassed the previous non-tornadic wind speed of 372km/h (231mph) on Mount Washington in the United States in April 1934. The long delay was {{partly due to the}} anemometer not being owned by the BoM, and as a result the agency did not enact a follow-up investigation. Despite the high winds, the anemometer and a nearby building were not damaged due to the winds occurring over a very short time.|$|E

Additional {{data from a}} variety of sources—in particular Continental Airlines pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees. This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the Washougal River.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{damage was}} done on the lakes. Major shipwrecks occurred on all but Lake Ontario, with most happening on southern and western Lake Huron. Lake masters recounted that waves reached at least 35feet (11m) in height. Being shorter in length than waves ordinarily formed by gales, they occurred in rapid succession, with three waves frequently striking in succession. Masters also stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> often blew in directions opposite to the waves below. This {{was the result of}} the storm's cyclonic motion, a phenomenon rarely seen on the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E

30|$|These nondetections notwithstanding, {{there is}} {{indirect}} {{evidence to support}} <b>the</b> hypothesis <b>that</b> waves do form on Titan’s lakes and seas. Wall et al.

[17] explored possible explanations for why no waves have been seen, suggesting a seasonal effect, i.e. <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> above Titan’s lakes and seas were too low {{at the time of}} the observations to initiate wave formation. Calculations suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> threshold <b>wind</b> speed for wave formation under Titan conditions might be between 0.4 m/s and 0.8 m/s [12],[17]. General Circulation Models (GCMs) generally predict <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> near Titan’s north pole should have been rather quiescent until late northern spring, consistent with the low-wind explanation for Titan’s lack of waves thus far [17],[18].|$|R

A few weeks after the accident, as suspicion started to fall on the possibility of ice in the fuel, United Airlines undertook a review of their procedures for testing and draining the fuel used in their aircraft, while American Airlines considered switching to a different type of jet fuel for polar flights.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{surviving}} myths in which Zephyrus features most prominently is that of Hyacinth. Hyacinth was a very handsome and athletic Spartan prince.

Later, catching Apollo and Hyacinth throwing a discus, Zephyrus blew a gust of wind at them, striking Hyacinth in the head with the falling discus. When Hyacinth died, Apollo created the hyacinth flower from his blood. Apollo was furious, but Eros protected Zephyrus, as the act was committed in the name of love, on the condition <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> god served Eros forever.|$|E
25|$|One must {{be careful}} when {{measuring}} temperature {{to ensure that the}} measuring instrument (thermometer, thermocouple, etc.) is really the same temperature as the material that is being measured. Under some conditions heat from the measuring instrument can cause a temperature gradient, so the measured temperature is different from the actual temperature of the system. In such a case the measured temperature will vary not only with the temperature of the system, but also with the heat transfer properties of the system. An extreme case of this effect gives rise to the wind chill factor, where the weather feels colder under windy conditions than calm conditions even though the temperature is the same. What is happening is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> increases the rate of heat transfer from the body, resulting in a larger reduction in body temperature for the same ambient temperature.|$|E

One ear of corn was white, the male corn belonging to First Man. The other ear was yellow, the female corn belonging to First Woman. The gods placed one buckskin {{on the ground}} facing west, and on it they placed the two ears of corn with their tips pointing east. Under the white ear they put the feather of a white eagle. Under the yellow ear they put the feather of a yellow eagle. They told the people to stand at a distance so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> could enter.|$|E
25|$|Aware {{that the}} people on Clorinde would swamp his boat if he drew {{alongside}} the frigate, possibly drowning all concerned, Willoughby instead commandeered a punt {{and used it to}} come aboard the frigate. Once on board, Willoughby persuaded La Poype to surrender the ship without the formalities observed outside the harbour, raising the Union Flag. The Haitians were consequently unable to fire on a ship in possession of their ally, Willoughby going ashore to meet with Dessalines, who promised assistance. Willoughby returned with a number of boats crewed by Haitians and was joined by several British boats in anticipation of removing the crew and passengers from the stricken ship. On his return however, Willoughby discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> had fallen significantly, allowing him to use the boats instead to haul Clorinde off the rocks and into deeper water. Her hull was still intact, and by the evening Clorinde had joined the rest of the British squadron off the mouth of the harbour.|$|E
25|$|The {{environment}} of Kazakhstan has been badly damaged by human activity. Most {{of the water}} in Kazakhstan is polluted by industrial effluents, pesticide and fertilizer residue, and, in some places, radioactive elements. The most visible damage has been to the Aral Sea, which as recently as the 1970s was larger than any of the Great Lakes of North America save Lake Superior. The sea began to shrink rapidly when sharply increased irrigation and other demands on the only significant tributaries, the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya (the latter reaching the Aral from neighboring Uzbekistan), all but eliminated inflow. During the Soviet Era, Kazakhstan received water from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan provided oil and gas for these two nations in return. However, {{after the collapse of the}} USSR this system had collapsed and no plan to replace this system has been put in place. According to research conducted by the International Crisis Group, there is little political will to solve this problem despite Central Asia's need for mutual resource-sharing. By 1993 the Aral Sea had lost an estimated 60% of its volume, in the process breaking into three unconnected segments. Increasing salinity and reduced habitat have killed the Aral Sea's fish, hence destroying its once-active fishing industry, and the receding shoreline has left the former port of Aral'sk more than seventy kilometers from the water's edge. The depletion of this large body of water has increased temperature variations in the region, which in turn have affected agriculture. A much greater agricultural impact, however, has come from the salt- and pesticide-laden soil <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> is known to carry as far away as the Himalaya Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. Deposition of this heavily saline soil on nearby fields effectively sterilizes them. Evidence suggests that salts, pesticides, and residues of chemical fertilizers are also adversely affecting human life around the former Aral Sea; infant mortality in the region approaches 10% compared with the 1991 national rate of 2.7%.|$|E
