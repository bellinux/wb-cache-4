5|$|For {{most of the}} Cold War, the AFL {{saw little}} action, apart from a {{reinforced}} company group which was sent to ONUC in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the 1960s. This changed {{with the advent of}} the First Liberian Civil War in 1989. The AFL became entangled in the conflict, which lasted from 1989 to 1996–97, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> Liberian Civil War, which lasted from 1999 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|Ham-Kam {{remained}} {{at lower levels}} in the league system until the 1960s, when it was promoted to the Second Division (<b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> tier) after the 1967 season. Ham-Kam was promoted to the First Division (then the top tier) ahead of the 1970 season. They have since played in the top league in the periods 1970–74, 1976–77, 1979, 1981–84, 1986–87, 1992–95, 2004–06 and 2008. The club's eight relegation from the top league is a Norwegian record. After the 2009 season, the club was further relegated to the Second Division, but returned to the First Division (now the second tier) in 2011. For a Ham-Kam match, the record attendance is 11,500, which dates from the 27 May 1976 league match against Lillestrøm.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 floods {{swept through}} the Columbia watershed, {{destroying}} Vanport, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> largest city in Oregon, and impacting cities {{as far north as}} Trail, British Columbia. The flooding prompted the United States Congress to pass the Flood Control Act of 1950, authorizing the federal development of additional dams and other flood control mechanisms. By that time local communities had become wary of federal hydroelectric projects, and sought local control of new developments; a public utility district in Grant County, Washington, ultimately began construction of the dam at Priest Rapids.|$|E

5|$|Rovers were {{admitted}} to the Football League in 1920 and have played there ever since, apart from spending the 2014–15 season in the Conference Premier. They previously came close to losing their league status in 1939, when they were re-elected after finishing bottom of Division Three (South), and in 2002 when the team finished one league position away from relegation to the Football Conference. Their highest finishing positions were in 1956 and 1959, on both occasions ending the season in 6th place in Division Two, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> tier of English football. Rovers were Football League Trophy finalists in 1990 and 2007.|$|E

5|$|Southern Rhodesia was <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> largest gold {{producer}} in the world, after South Africa. The colony's gold output had expanded greatly during the 1930s, and it remained the territory's {{main source of}} income during the war, though many extracting operations were diverted towards strategic minerals, most prominently chrome and asbestos. Southern Rhodesia {{became one of the}} two main sources of chrome for the Allies (South Africa was the other) and the world's third largest producer of asbestos after Canada and the Soviet Union. By {{the end of the war}} the mines at Shabani and Mashaba were turning out 1.5million tonnes of asbestos a year, in addition to 600,000 tonnes of chrome. Gold output reached peak levels in 1941–42 and thereafter subsided. Southern Rhodesia also exported tungsten, mica and tin, and provided coal for the copper mines of Northern Rhodesia and the Congo. The Southern Rhodesian government encouraged private enterprise to form secondary industries to exploit the colony's natural resources and increase production, but also set up some state industries in an attempt to spark growth. The establishment of the RATG prompted a minor economic boom, and also caused the primary direct demand placed on Southern Rhodesia's black population during the early stages of the war—a programme of conscripted labour to build the aerodromes.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{putative}} artifact goes back almost a century. The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown {{a photo of a}} rubbing of one of the bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an. Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the bones to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study. These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and Wu Yuhong to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at No Mercy was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship. In this match, a chain was hung on a pole above the ring, {{and when it was}} {{retrieved}} it {{could be used as a}} legal weapon. The match was between WWE Champion Brock Lesnar, who defended against The Undertaker. This title match would mark the third pay per view between Lesnar and The Undertaker for the championship. The first being September 2002 at Unforgiven where Lesnar and Undertaker fought to a double disqualification <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> event being the following month at No Mercy where Lesnar successfully defended the WWE title over the Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match. The buildup to the match began on the August 28 episode of SmackDown, when the Undertaker defeated Lesnar and The Big Show in a Triple Threat match, earning a title shot against then WWE Champion Kurt Angle. The following week on the September 4 episode of SmackDown, Angle defended the championship against the Undertaker, however, the match ended in a no contest after Lesnar interfered and attacked them both with a steel folding chair; Angle retained the championship as a result of Lesnar's interference. Two weeks later on SmackDown, Angle defended the title against Lesnar in a match in which the wrestler with the most scoring conditions by a set period of time would win the title in what is called an Iron Man match. Lesnar scored five falls, while Angle scored four in the encounter, thus, Lesnar won the match and became the new WWE Champion. The following week on SmackDown, legitimate WWE Chairman Vince McMahon held a ceremony to introduce the new WWE Champion Lesnar, but was interrupted by the Undertaker and SmackDown General Manager Stephanie McMahon, who announced that Lesnar would face the Undertaker at No Mercy for the WWE Championship. On the October 9 episode of SmackDown, Lesnar defended the title against Paul London. The match was interrupted by the Undertaker, who had a meeting with Stephanie earlier that night. He announced that his match with Lesnar at No Mercy would be a Biker Chain Match rather than a standard match.|$|E
