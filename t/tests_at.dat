The impact killed the B-1's pilot, Rockwell test pilot Doug Benefield, and seriously injured two other crew members.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{his many}} other posts {{included}} being the Defence Scientific Adviser {{and chairman of the}} Defence Research and Development Policy Committee from 1948 to 1968. He was present at the British Operation Hurricane nuclear test in the Monte Bello Islands off the coast of Western Australia in October 1952, and then for Operation Totem <b>tests</b> <b>at</b> Emu Field in South Australia in October 1953. When the British government established the Maralinga Test Range in 1953, the Australian government created the Maralinga Safety Committee, which became the became the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee, with Martin as its chairman. As such he was responsible for safety of the Operation Mosaic <b>tests</b> <b>at</b> Monte Bello in May and June 1956, and Operation Buffalo <b>tests</b> <b>at</b> Maralinga in September and October 1956, after which he handed over the chairmanship to Ernest Titterton. An advocate for the peaceful use atomic energy, Martin {{became a member of the}} Industrial Atomic Energy Policy Committee in 1949, and a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in 1953. In 1958 he was an Australian delegate to the United Nations conference on Atoms for Peace in Vienna. That year, he was appointed a member of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, and was its deputy chairman when he retired in 1968.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{versions}} of this <b>test,</b> valgus <b>at</b> 0 degrees and valgus at 30 degrees. When performing the <b>test</b> <b>at</b> 30 degrees, the MCL is the primary stabilizer; the joint capusle is also <b>tested.</b> When <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> 0 degrees, the MCL, medial joint capsule, and anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments are stressed.|$|R
30|$|The SEM fractographs of filler-added joint <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> RT and 550  °C {{is shown}} in Fig.  8 e, f, respectively, which reveals a similar {{behaviour}} with much lesser reduction in the cross-sectional area of the specimen <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> 550  °C than at RT. The fracture in the filler-added joints was located at the PM, which {{is evident from the}} absence of dendritic structure in the high magnification fractographs shown in Fig.  8 g, h. The specimen <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> 550  °C reveals coarse and fewer dimples than the specimen <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> RT (refer to Fig.  8 g). Flat featureless regions which are much prominent in specimen <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> 550  °C evidence the reduction in elongation of the joint at high temperatures. The Nb-rich precipitates (marked by arrow) associated with the voids in the fracture surface of RT specimen act as the crack initiation site.|$|R

5|$|The British {{government}} formally {{requested a}} permanent test facility on 30 October 1953. Due to concerns about nuclear {{fallout from the}} previous <b>tests</b> <b>at</b> Emu Field and the site's inadequate infrastructure and water supply, the recently surveyed Maralinga site was selected for this purpose. The new site was announced in May 1955. It was developed as a joint, co-funded facility between the British and Australian governments.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{fuel capacity}} of the Ju 87D was raised to 800L (of which 780L were usable) by adding additional wing tanks while retaining the option to carry two 300L drop tanks. <b>Tests</b> <b>at</b> Rechlin-Lärz Airfield revealed it made possible a flight duration of 2 hours and 15 minutes. With an extra two 300L (80US gal) fuel tanks, it could achieve four hours flight time.|$|E
5|$|The {{near-miss}} and collision incidents presented further safety issues. Both {{were caused}} by failure of the same piece of equipment, the TORU manual docking system, which was undergoing <b>tests</b> <b>at</b> the time. The tests were called in order to gauge the performance of long-distance docking in order to enable the cash-strapped Russians to remove the expensive Kurs automatic docking system from the Progress ships.|$|E
30|$|If {{the first}} {{specimen}} <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> 50 or 100  % {{was considered a}} failure, the following two specimens always failed. Therefore the three final specimens were not tested and the whole group {{was considered to be}} a failure and not included in the statistical model. If the first specimen did not fail, none of the following specimens failed. The groups that failed a mechanical <b>test</b> <b>at</b> 50  % for the first three models were not <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> 100  %. The groups that failed a mechanical <b>test</b> <b>at</b> 100  % for the first three models were considered to be failures and {{were not included in the}} statistical analysis.|$|R

5|$|Two more Fat Man {{bombs were}} detonated during the Operation Crossroads nuclear <b>tests</b> <b>at</b> Bikini Atoll in 1946. Some 120 Fat Man units were {{produced}} between 1947 and 1949, {{when it was}} superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. The Fat Man was retired in 1950.|$|E
5|$|When {{the team}} for the three <b>Tests</b> <b>at</b> home to Sri Lanka was announced, Karthik was dropped in place of Dhoni. In ten Tests since his debut, Karthik had managed only 245 runs {{at an average of}} 18.84 with only one half-century and one other score beyond 25. In contrast, Dhoni's had been a {{prolific}} run-scorer in ODIs, and had won the man of the series award against Sri Lanka and scored 183 not out in one match.|$|E
50|$|Following the Italian Grand Prix on 10 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} <b>testing</b> sessions <b>at</b> various circuits across Europe between 11-15 September.

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Birmingham, Titterton worked in a research position under Mark Oliphant, who recruited him to work on radar for the British Admiralty during {{the first part of}} the Second World War. In 1943, he joined the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, where he helped develop the first atomic bombs. He eventually became one of the laboratory's group leaders. He participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear <b>tests</b> <b>at</b> the Bikini Atoll in 1946, where he performed the countdown for both tests. With the passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, known as the McMahon Act, all British government employees had to leave. He was the last member of the British Mission to do so, in April 1947.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Schreiber {{remained}} at Los Alamos, {{where he became}} a group leader in the Weapon (W) Division. His first assignment was to ready bombs for the Operation Crossroads nuclear <b>tests</b> <b>at</b> Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. During the preparations, he witnessed the accident in which Louis Slotin was exposed to a fatal dose of neutron radiation when a screwdriver Slotin was using during a criticality experiment {{with one of the}} plutonium pits for Operation Crossroads slipped and the core went critical. Slotin would die from radiation poisoning nine days later but his quick reaction saved the lives of Schreiber and the others in the room (see also: demon core). Schreiber became an exponent of remote handling of dangerous substances, and designed remote-control machines to perform such experiments with all personnel at a quarter-mile distance.|$|E
5|$|As {{the program}} (and PAVN air defences) evolved, {{so did the}} relay aircraft. The EC-121Rs and their crews proved too {{vulnerable}} and were partly replaced in 1969 and 1970 by QU-22Bs (modified Beech A-36 Bonanzas) which were to be remotely piloted, and which had undergone primary mission equipment and PME flight <b>tests</b> <b>at</b> Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in 1968. The aircraft suffered from mechanical difficulties, however, and were never flown during an operational mission without a pilot. They were replaced by C-130B models in December 1971.|$|E

Ferrari were also <b>testing</b> <b>at</b> Monza while BAR had a private session at Circuit Paul Ricard to test the new components to be used here and that includes a new engine, gearbox and aero package. Minardi also conducted a 2-day <b>test</b> <b>at</b> Vairano.|$|R
25|$|After ten {{previous}} {{tours of}} Britain, the 1963–64 Kangaroo tour saw Australia's first ever Ashes victory on British soil. The Arthur Summons coached Kangaroos {{won the first}} <b>test</b> <b>at</b> Wembley Stadium before rampaging to a famous 50–12 win in the second <b>test</b> <b>at</b> Station Road in Swinton. Although they would lose the third <b>test</b> <b>at</b> Headingley, legendary winger Ken Irvine became the first Australian player to score a try in each test of an Ashes series. The Kangaroos have not lost a series in Britain since.|$|R
5|$|Australia {{made three}} changes. Having taken only seven wickets {{in the first}} four <b>Tests</b> <b>at</b> an average of 61.00, off spinner Ian Johnson was {{replaced}} by leg spinner Doug Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured medium pacer Ernie Toshack was replaced by the opening batsman Sid Barnes, who had missed the Fourth Test with a rib injury. This meant Australia were playing with one extra batsman and one less frontline bowler. The final change was the return of first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon from injury and the omission of his deputy Ron Saggers.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were now}} 02 down {{and needed to}} win three Tests in a row to retain the Ashes. The {{pressure}} on McCabe increased when last-minute injuries meant {{that he had to}} open the bowling. McCabe made 63 and 22 and took a wicket as Australia won their first match in the series. He then top-scored with 88 in Australia's first innings of 288 and made 55 in the second as Australia won by 148 runs in the Fourth Test in Adelaide to level the series. In the deciding Test at the MCG, McCabe scored 112, one of three centuries as Australia amassed 604, a record score in Ashes Tests in Australia. This laid the platform for the innings victory that retained the Ashes. McCabe aggregated 491 runs in five <b>Tests</b> <b>at</b> 54.55, with a century and five fifties in a consistent display.|$|E
5|$|Bacher {{and fellow}} {{commissioner}} Sumner Pike {{began with an}} inspection of Los Alamos and the Hanford Site, and conducted an inventory of the fissionable material at Los Alamos with Norris Bradbury, who had succeeded Oppenheimer as its director. He found that only nine atomic bombs had been built in 1946; only four would be in 1947, primarily due to production problems with the reactors at Hanford. These problems {{were on their way}} to resolution when Bacher observed the Operation Sandstone nuclear <b>tests</b> <b>at</b> Enewetak Atoll in 1948 as the Atomic Energy Commission's representative. Bacher's original two-year term would have expired on January 1, 1949, but President Harry Truman convinced him to stay on. Bacher resigned in May 1949, and this time the President was unable to dissuade him.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, {{new rules}} banned all <b>testing</b> <b>at</b> active Sprint Cup tracks except at {{selected}} NASCAR-approved open tests during the season, thereby making <b>testing</b> <b>at</b> Rockingham crucial.

We found that mice that developed and were <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> low altitudes had a higher aerobic capacity (both aerobic performance and basal metabolic rate) than those that developed, or were acclimated as adults, at high altitudes. In addition, we found that mice that developed at high altitude did not have a higher aerobic capacity than those that developed at low altitude and were acclimated to high altitude as adults. Both groups <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> high altitudes had higher hematocrits (% red blood cells) and hemoglobin than mice <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> low altitudes. Surprisingly, mice acclimated to low altitudes and given an instantaneous exposure to hypoxia did not suffer a depression in aerobic performance...|$|R
