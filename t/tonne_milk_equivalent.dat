40|$|The {{activities}} {{associated with}} raw milk production on dairy farms require an effective evaluation of their environmental impact. The present study evaluates the global environmental impacts associated with milk production on dairy farms in Portugal and identifies {{the processes that}} have the greatest environmental impact by using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The main factors involved in milk production were included, namely: the dairy farm, maize silage, ryegrass silage, straw, concentrates, diesel and electricity. The {{results suggest that the}} major source of air and water emissions in the life cycle of milk is the production of concentrates. The activities carried out on dairy farms were the major source of nitrous oxides (from fuel combustion), ammonia, and methane (from manure management and enteric fermentation). Nevertheless, dairy farm activities, which include manure management, enteric fermentation and diesel consumption, make the greatest contributions to the categories of impact considered, {{with the exception of the}} abiotic depletion category, contributing to over 70 % of the total global warming potential (1021. 3 Â kg CO 2 eq. per <b>tonne</b> of <b>milk),</b> 84 % of the total photochemical oxidation potential (0. 2 Â kgÂ C 2 H 4 Â eq.

Taking all dairy products together, an average consumption of 18 kg liquid <b>milk</b> <b>equivalent</b> (LME) person per year was estimated. Rich households consumed an average of 22 kg LME/person per year and spent 1. 8 percent of their monthly income on dairy products.

Locally produced fresh milk, factory reconstituted milk and directly imported readily usable milk were among the most frequently consumed dairy products. Financial difficulty was cited as the most important reason for the low level and irregularity of consumption of dairy products by the poor households. Consumers considered convenience in terms of proximity, favorable terms of purchase and product quality when acquiring dairy products.

40|$|Organic {{agriculture}} {{addresses the}} public demand to diminish environmental pollution of agricultural production. Until now, however, only few studies tried {{to determine the}} integrated environmental impact of conventional versus organic production using life cycle assessment (LCA). The aim {{of this article was}} to review prospects and constraints of LCA as a tool to assess the integrated environmental impact of conventional and organic animal production. This aim was illustrated using results from LCAs in the literature and from a pilot study comparing conventional and organic milk production. This review shows that LCAs of different case studies currently cannot be compared directly. Such a comparison requires further international standardisation of the LCA method. A within-case-study comparison of LCAs of conventional and organic production, however, appeared suitable to gain knowledge and to track down main differences in potential environmental impact. Acidification potential of milk production, for example, is for 78 ¿ 97 % due to volatilisation of ammonia, which is not reduced necessarily by changing from conventional to organic milk production. Eutrophication potential per <b>tonne</b> of <b>milk</b> or per ha of farmland was lower for organic than for conventional milk production due to lower fertiliser application rates. Global warming potential of milk production is for 48 ¿ 65 % due to emission of methane. Organic milk production inherently increases methane emission and, therefore, can reduce global warming potential only by reducing emission of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide considerably. Organic milk production reduces pesticide use, whereas it increases land use per <b>tonne</b> of <b>milk.</b> Conclusions regarding potential environmental impact of organic versus conventional milk production, however, are based largely on comparison of experimental farms. To show differences in potential environmental impact among various production systems, however, LCAs should be performed at a large number of practical farms for each production system of interest. Application of LCA on practical farms, however, requires in-depth research to understand underlying processes, and to predict, or measure, variation in emissions realised in practice...|$|R

However, where intensification of the industry is occurring at different rates and different localities within New Zealand, using indicators which are based on national averages {{may not be the most}} accurate way of assessing the environmental impacts associated with dairy production. Further to this, where there is increasing scrutiny in export markets of the environmental impacts of dairy production processes, there is also an increasing reliance on information systems by consumers to assess these environmental impacts when purchasing dairy products. Macro level indicators may no longer be credible where there is increasingly disparity in the production processes of the New Zealand dairy industry. This research used Life Cycle Analysis to estimate the energy requirements and associated carbon dioxide emissions for dairy production under three different management regimes at the farm scale. The three farm management scenarios were defined to represent the intensification and expansion which has occurred within the industry over the past decade. Scenario One represented a production system which was typical of dairy farming in the Canterbury region. The second Scenario was modelled on production under a management regime which used conventional dairy farming practices and was located in the Mackenzie Country. Scenario Three was also located in the Mackenzie Country but used a farm management regime which was supported by housing the milking herd in a “herd home” for the majority of the year. Although the current format of industry knowledge precluded quantifying all the crucial variable and linkages within the specific farm management regimes, the conclusions drawn from the analysis were that the total quantity of primary energy required to produce one <b>tonne</b> of <b>milk</b> solids is increasing as the production processes intensify within the New Zealand dairy industry; and subsequently, developing credible indicators of energy use at the farm scale would enable the dairy industry to participate in the eco-labelling information systems in export markets...|$|R
50|$|Evaporated milk is {{sometimes}} used in its reduced form; however, to reconstitute evaporated <b>milk</b> to be <b>equivalent</b> to normal <b>milk,</b> mix 1 part by volume of evaporated milk with 1 1/4 parts of water. Where evaporated milk is required but not available, {{it can be}} replaced by simmering 2 1/4 parts of fresh milk down to 1 part. A comparable result is obtained by simmering down 2 parts of almond milk.|$|R
