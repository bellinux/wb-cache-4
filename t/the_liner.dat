50|$|The winter {{model is}} {{composed}} of: jacket, jacket liner, trousers, their insulated lining and suspenders. <b>The</b> <b>liners</b> are buttoned into their respective garments, {{and the outer}} garment can be worn without <b>the</b> <b>liners.</b> <b>The</b> jacket <b>liner</b> bears <b>the</b> fur collar of the jacket, usually in fish fur but occasionally in real fur (on officer's uniforms). The jacket and trousers are lined with a pile-type material that helps insulate by trapping warm air, whereas <b>the</b> <b>liners</b> are made of a quilted material similar to the Telogreika uniform.|$|R

Test conditions included pressures of 6 atm., gas velocity of 42 m/s, and gas temperatures near 1450 C. The temperatures of both the cooled and combustion flow sides of <b>the</b> <b>liners</b> were measured using optical and contact measurement techniques. Minor weight loss was observed, but <b>the</b> <b>liners</b> remained structural sound, although damage was noted in some fasteners...|$|R

40|$|The {{calculated}} acoustic {{response of}} a nearly ideal (locally reacting and linear) duct liner {{has been compared}} with its measured performance. <b>The</b> ceramic honeycomb <b>liner</b> structure was such that the local reaction assumption was well satisfied over the frequency range of interest (0. 5 - 3. 0 kHz). In addition, the high repeatability of the measured impedance values over a large SPL range verified the assumption of linearity. A finite element algorithm was used to compute <b>the</b> duct <b>liner</b> transmission properties in terms of <b>the</b> <b>liner's</b> normal incidence impedance and the duct termination impedance using a plane wave source. Very good agreement between theory and experiment was observed in general, but required accurate normal impedance values in the high attenuation frequency bands of <b>the</b> <b>liner's</b> response...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{interface}} pressure between {{the residual limb}} and prosthetic socket has {{a significant effect on}} an amputee's satisfaction and comfort. Liners provide a comfortable interface by adding a soft cushion between the residual limb and the socket. The Dermo and the Seal-In X 5 liner are two new interface systems and, due to their relative infancy, very little are known about their effect on patient satisfaction. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the {{interface pressure}} with these two liners and their effect on patient satisfaction. Methods: Nine unilateral transtibial amputees participated in the study. Two prostheses were fabricated for each amputee, one with <b>the</b> Seal-In <b>liner</b> and one with <b>the</b> Dermo <b>liner.</b> Interface pressure was measured at the anterior, posterior, medial and lateral regions during walking on the level ground. Each subject filled in a Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) regarding the satisfaction with <b>the</b> two <b>liners.</b> Findings <b>The</b> mean peak pressures with <b>the</b> Seal-In <b>liner</b> was 34. 0 higher at the anterior, 24. 0 higher at the posterior and 7. 0 higher at the medial regions of the socket (P = 0. 008, P = 0. 046, P = 0. 025) than it was with <b>the</b> Dermo <b>Liner.</b> There were no significant differences in the mean peak pressures between <b>the</b> two <b>liners</b> at <b>the</b> lateral regions. In addition, significant difference was found between <b>the</b> two <b>liners</b> both for satisfaction and problems (P < 0. 05). Interpretation There was less interface pressure between the socket and the residual limb with <b>the</b> Dermo <b>liner.</b> <b>The</b> results indicated that <b>the</b> Dermo <b>liner</b> provides more comfort in the socket than <b>the</b> Seal-In <b>liner...</b>|$|R
