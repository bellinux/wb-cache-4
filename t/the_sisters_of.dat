5|$|The Holy Dexter {{was kept}} for centuries in the Szentjobb Abbey, except during the Mongol {{invasion}} of 1241 and 1242, {{when it was}} transferred to Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia). The relic was then taken to Székesfehérvár around 1420. Following the Ottoman occupation of the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary in the mid-16thcentury, it was guarded in many places, including Bosnia, Ragusa and Vienna. It was returned to Hungary in 1771, when Queen Maria Theresa donated it to the cloister of <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> <b>of</b> Loreto in Buda.

5|$|Throughout its 66 {{years of}} operating, the orphanage took in {{approximately}} 2,500 individuals. Approximately four per cent of all boys who stayed there were orphans, whereas the remainder had living parents; {{most of them}} either came from poor or troubled families who were unable to afford to look after them. The orphanage also took in child migrants. Only boys from the ages of 5 to 16 were taken care there. However, <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> <b>of</b> Mercy sometimes took in families in need or individuals who were 3 years old or younger. One of <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> <b>of</b> Mercy's aims was to keep brothers together if possible, {{and if they had}} sisters, they would be housed at the St. Joseph's Orphanage. Although the building could only house up to 100 boys, the capacity rose to between 140 and 250 boys during the Second World War, far above the suitable capacity of the building.|$|E

50|$|In Dragons of Deltora, {{the three}} companions once again must save Deltora, {{this time from}} <b>the</b> Four <b>Sisters,</b> evil creations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shadow Lord. These four Sisters sing their songs of death across Deltora, {{poisoning}} the land and gradually causing Deltora's crops to wither, resulting in famine across the land. With {{only a part of}} a torn map, left by Doran the Dragonlover, they set out to find these Sisters and destroy them. Each Sister must be destroyed {{with the aid of a}} dragon. When each <b>Sister</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Sister's</b> guardian are destroyed another fragment of the map is found. Eventually they discover that <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> are hidden in the four most eastern, northern, western and southern corners <b>of</b> Deltora. <b>The</b> <b>Sister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East is hidden in Dragon's Nest. <b>The</b> <b>Sister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North is hidden at Shadowgate and <b>the</b> <b>Sister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West is on the Isle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead. <b>The</b> <b>Sister</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South is hidden in the city of Del, which happens to be the hometown of Lief.

5|$|Consequently, when <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> <b>of</b> Death {{arrived in}} Mega-City One, they found Kraken there instead of Dredd. Finding Kraken to be {{vulnerable}} to manipulation by their psychic powers, as he was still torn by latent subconscious loyalty to his late master Judd, {{they were able to}} use him as their agent to free Judge Death from captivity and begin their conquest of the city. Had Dredd not resigned, they might not have found their task so easy. Dredd eventually returned to the city and defeated them.|$|E
5|$|Elementary {{schooling}} at {{the orphanage}} featured better equipped classrooms {{than the original}} building. A few years after operations moved in 1911, the school offered a two-year business program.

In the 1950s Petru Hall was built as an annex {{on the east side of}} the dormitory building.|$|E
5|$|God of War II {{was first}} {{released}} in North America on March 13, 2007, for the PlayStation 2. Angered at his fellow gods, Kratos runs amok {{across the city}} of Rhodes. Zeus intervenes and betrays Kratos, who is saved by the Titan Gaia. She tells him he must now find <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> <b>of</b> Fate, who can change his fate and prevent his death {{at the hands of}} Zeus. Kratos is ultimately successful and as he is about to kill the god, Athena sacrifices herself to save Zeus and preserve Olympus, and tells Kratos that he is the son of Zeus. Kratos then joins forces with Gaia and the Titans to attack Olympus.|$|E

5|$|Kratos {{then joined}} the Spartan army in Rhodes, intent on destruction. Zeus, however, {{weakened}} Kratos and tricked him into abandoning his godly powers into the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus {{used to kill}} Kratos. Although he overcame all obstacles, Kratos was stunned at Zeus's betrayal and swore revenge as he died. Kratos fell into the Underworld, but was rescued by the Titan Gaia. Banished to Tartarus with the other surviving Titans after the First Great War, Gaia and her brethren seek the death of Zeus. Kratos, fueled by anger at his betrayal, agreed to aid the Titans and was instructed to find <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> <b>of</b> Fate, {{who are capable of}} returning him to the moment of Zeus' treachery. Kratos became determined and utterly ruthless—in the pursuit of his goal he wounded a Titan, killed several Greek heroes without hesitation, and deliberately sacrificed two scholars. All three of <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> <b>of</b> Fate were killed when they opposed Kratos, who was prepared to kill Zeus in a final confrontation. Zeus was only saved when Athena intervened and sacrificed herself for him; only then does Kratos show remorse. He learned from a dying Athena that Zeus is, in fact, his father, a fact Zeus kept secret because he wished to avoid a repetition of what he did to his own father, Cronos. Kratos rejected any notion of a relationship and vowed to kill Zeus and destroy Olympus. Encouraged by Gaia, Kratos used the power of the Fates to retrieve the Titans before their defeat in the Great War, and with their assistance, stormed Mount Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Mansour {{assumed the}} {{directorship}} on December 29, 1982, pending Michigan legislative confirmation in the position. Archbishop Szoka hardened his resolve, on February 23, 1983, directed the Detroit Province of <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> <b>of</b> Mercy {{to determine whether}} Mansour was {{in violation of the}} teachings of the Church. He told the Detroit Sisters leadership that Mansour no longer had his permission to serve the state, and he ordered them to inform her that she was to resign the state appointment.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, nativists {{returned}} in greater numbers. During the rally, {{it began to}} rain, and the meeting was moved into a nearby market. The inflammatory remarks continued inside the market, where fighting broke out between the local Irish Catholics and the nativists. Fighting spilled outside the market, where nativists were shot at by people {{in the windows of}} nearby buildings. One or two nativists were reportedly killed. George Shiffler, an 18 year old leather worker, was the first nativist killed in the riots of 1844. A mob of nativists attacked the Seminary of <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> <b>of</b> Charity and several Catholic homes before the riot ended. Numerous people were injured, and two more nativists were killed.|$|E
