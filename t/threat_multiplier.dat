40|$|Along {{with the}} {{increasing}} growth of computer networks, security <b>threats</b> <b>multiplies</b> and accordingly improving and enhancing the network security devices and methods become a necessity. Firewalls as {{the first line of}} defense have irrefutable importance in securing a network; therefore improvement in this technology ensures higher level of security in computer networks. Any improvement or novel ideas are not achieved unless a deep analysis of the existing methods and current needs takes place. In this paper the vulnerabilities of firewalls according to their natures and also various types of firewalls are classified in order to create a better perspective for future research. Also some of the current approaches to mitigate these vulnerabilities are mentioned and firewall fingerprinting as a technique which makes attackers able to obtain more precise information about firewalls ` vulnerabilities in order to exploit them is presented...|$|R

5000|$|Climate {{change has}} been {{identified}} as a <b>threat</b> <b>multiplier,</b> which can exacerbate existing threats. A 2013 meta-analysis of 60 previous peer-reviewed studies, and 45 data sets concluded that, [...] "climate change intensifies natural resource stresses in a way that can increase the likelihood of livelihood devastation, state fragility, human displacement, and mass death." [...] The 2014 report, by the CNA Military Advisory Board, [...] "National Security and the Accelerating Risks of Climate Change" [...] re-examined the impact of climate change on U.S. national security. The report concluded that climate change is a growing security threat.|$|E
5000|$|Climate {{change has}} the {{potential}} to exacerbate existing tensions or create new ones — serving as a <b>threat</b> <b>multiplier.</b> It can be a catalyst for violent conflict and a threat to international security. A meta-analysis of over 50 quantitative studies that examine the link between climate and conflict found that [...] "for each 1 standard deviation (1σ) change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall, median estimates indicate that the frequency of interpersonal violence rises 4% and the frequency of intergroup conflict rises 14%". The IPCC has suggested that the disruption of environmental migration may serve to exacerbate conflicts, though they are less confident of the role of increased resource scarcity. Of course, climate change does not always lead to violence, and conflicts are often caused by multiple interconnected factors.|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} two-stage network flow {{approach is}} {{proposed for the}} determination of optimal scenarios for integrated traffic routing and signal timing in the evacuation of real-sized urban networks with several threat zones, where the threat levels may be nonuniform across zones. The objective is to minimize total exposure to the <b>threat</b> (severity <b>multiplied</b> by duration) for all evacuees during the evacuation. In the problem formulation, traffic flow dynamics {{are based on the}} well-known point queue model in a time-expanded network representation. The proposed solution approach is adapted from a general relaxation-based decomposition method in a network flow formulation. The decomposition method is developed on the basis of insights into the optimal flow of traffic at intersections in the solution of the evacuation routing problem. As for efficiency, the computation time associated with the decomposition method for solving the integrated optimal routing and signal control problem is equivalent to the time required for solving the same optimal routing problem (without optimizing the intersection control plan) because the computation time required for determining the optimal signal control is negligible. The proposed solution method proves to be optimal. The method is implemented and applied to a real-sized evacuation scenario in the transportation network of Tucson, Arizona. The method is stress-tested with some inflated demand scenarios, and computation aspects are reported...|$|R

5000|$|In March 2013, PSA {{released}} a statement highlighting the [...] "staggering" [...] cost of inaction, signed by 38 lawmakers, Cabinet secretaries, military and intelligence officials and national security experts. In the following weeks, the organization brought George P. Shultz, Ronald Reagan's Secretary of State, to Capitol Hill to hold a briefing on climate change and how it affects American national security {{and its role in}} the world. In total, PSA has released three bipartisan policy statements highlighting the importance of preventing climate change. One draws {{attention to the fact that}} the while the military and intelligence forces can monitor and protect us from terrorism, cannot protect us from rising seas, more violent storms, record droughts, spreading diseases and other long-term consequences of carbon pollution. The most recent policy statement was signed by 48 Republican and Democrat senior politicians, military commanders, security advisers and diplomats—including Chuck Hagel, William Cohen and Madeleine Albright—and states that climate change is a <b>threat</b> <b>multiplier,</b> as stated by the Department of Defense.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{two related}} topics: 1) the circular link between food insecurity and conflict, with {{particular emphasis on}} the Sahel, and 2) the potential role of food security interventions in {{reducing the risk of}} violent conflicts. While we eschew mono-causal explanations of conflict, acute food insecurity can be a factor in popular mobilization and a risk multiplier. Moreover, violent conflict itself is a major driver of acute food insecurity. If food insecurity is a <b>threat</b> <b>multiplier</b> for conflict, improving food security can reduce tensions and contribute to more stable environments. If these interventions are done right, the vicious cycle of food insecurity and conflict can be transformed into a virtuous cycle of food security and stability that provides peace dividends, reduces conflict drivers, enhances social cohesion, rebuilds social trust, and builds the legitimacy and capacity of governments...|$|E
40|$|The aim of thesis "The antimissile {{base in the}} Czech Republic" is to {{introduce}} the decision making process concerning a radar base, which would be located in Brdy, Czech Republic. Interpretation of this process was based on media monitoring and collected data from public opinion surveys through theoretical concept of risk society by Ulrich Beck. The whole discussion about the military base is emotional and therefore confusing. The base {{should serve as a}} protection from the risk of a rocket aggression, nevertheless, on the other hand it is viewed as a source for another threats eg. public are defining base like possible target from unknown potential enemy i. a. like source of harmful X-rate too etc. Because this manufactured risks are product o f human activity, there is a huge potential to assess the level of risk that is being produced, or that is about to be produced.

30|$|Though most {{instances}} of cyberterrorism occur through Internet use, {{it is important}} to recognize that the lesser utilized mechanisms of the telephone also play a role in conducting denial-of-service attacks (i.e., D.O.S. attacks), which render computer networks inaccessible, inoperable, or ineffectual, thus easing the transmission and distribution of propaganda by the attacker (Howard 2009). One such example of a D.O.S. attack would be a victim who is injured attempting to get help by dialing 911, only to be met with continuous dropped phone calls or just a dead line (Brown 2006). In causing attacks, a cyberterrorist has access to any given nation vulnerable to attacks of a grand scale. What this means is that irreparable damage can be caused due to a nation’s heavy reliance on critical infrastructure that is rooted in computer networks (Lewis 2002). Using a universal weapon as seemingly harmless as the computer, cyberterrorists have at their fingertips a medium that allows them to cause great damage with minor consequence (Gorge 2007). Files can be stolen and corrupted, computer viruses can be spread, and these are all due to the easy access provided by the Internet. In some cases, a <b>multiplied</b> <b>threat</b> exists when the attacker is a former employee, familiar with the computer network, and wishing to cause harm (Misra 2003). The destruction of websites, knowingly crashing selected networks, causing denial of service in crisis situations, spreading malicious computer viruses, causing physical destruction and tampering with financial interactions, all while inducing panic and causing psychological harm to targets, are all utilized methods commonly known as information warfare (Paul 2008).|$|R
40|$|Eight global crises – human economy, climate change, {{exponential}} {{human population}} growth, ecological overshoot, biotic impoverishment and {{the reduction of}} biodiversity, renewable resource depletion, energy allocation, and environmental refugees – affect each other and affect and {{are affected by the}} biosphere. Some, perhaps all, are close to tipping points that, if tipped, will result in irreversible change. And yet, no sense of urgency is apparent. If any one of the eight interactive crises passes a tipping point, it will probably act as a <b>threat</b> <b>multiplier</b> for the remaining crises. Both politicians and the average citizen believe that priorities can be established for these interactive crises, but such an option is not viable for a highly interactive system. Polls indicate that most people place economic growth as the highest priority for human society, even though the highest status should be given to the master biospheric life support system to which all other systems are subordinate...|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{evidence}} {{demonstrates that}} the effects of climate change upon the oceans will lead to biological, chemical and physical changes with dire environmental and geopolitical repercussions. The impacts of climate change upon the oceans, namely their warming, sea level rise, ocean acidification and resultant marine biodiversity loss have been consistently highlighted in various scientific reports. Experts, scholars and academic networks from various disciplines have raised awareness on the multifaceted and complex relationship between oceans, marine living resources and climate change. In political fora, climate change {{is often referred to as}} a <b>threat</b> <b>multiplier.</b> Earth scientists describe how the climate and oceans relationship accentuates the complexities of the natural world providing a classic example of how planetary boundaries, such as global warming, ocean acidification and marine biodiversity loss, interact to exacerbate the negative impacts caused by human behaviour. Outcomes from conferences and even applicable treaties acknowledge that a cross sectoral and an integrated, ecosystem approach is key to achieve sound governance of these natural resources. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} climate change in society and within the {{government}} has not received the necessary attention to drive forward with the appropriate policies that combat climate change and its impacts. This thesis examines the intersection of climate science and violent uprisings via a case study of Egypt. I frame the issue through a security lens by connecting the effects {{of climate change}} on the physical land of Egypt to the political and social problems brought to light during the Arab Spring. I argue that the causal connection between climate change and violent uprisings is made through an examination of human security {{and the ways in which}} it was threatened by climate change. In the case of Egypt, climate change is responsible for the rising sea level of the Mediterranean Sea that weakened the agricultural capacity of the land. In turn, I argue that the state of Egypt was unable to properly address demands for food, directly threatening the level of human security of the state. The paper outlines the fact that while there were a number of economic, social, and political issues already present within Egypt, climate change served as a <b>threat</b> <b>multiplier</b> pushing Egyptians over the edge...|$|E
30|$|Another report, among others, {{that looked}} into {{the threat of the}} climate change on {{national}} security is the panel of retired army generals assembled by the United States Center for Naval Analysis (CAN). The panel was asked to study the issue of climate change with regard to the national security of the United States itself. The report of the panel was released in 2007, and in it, climate change was defined as having the capacity to act as a `threat multiplier´f. That is, according to the report, climate change risks can exacerbate ongoing challenges and make untenable situations worse. Political stability could easily unravel if climate change risks are not addressed in timely manner. The said findings of the Panel received wider acceptance within the US policy making circles and in the international community as well. For instance, the current Secretary General of the UN Ban Ki-Moon agreed with the assessment of the Panel of the retired Generals while addressing the Security Council in 2007. In his speech he said that the concept of <b>threat</b> <b>multiplier</b> was “especially true in vulnerable regions that face multiple stresses at the same time- pre-existing conflict, poverty and unequal access to resources, weak institutions, food insecurity, and the incidence of diseases such as HIV/AIDSg”.|$|E
40|$|The {{discourse}} {{of climate change}} has become important {{in the field of}} political science, {{as well as in the}} policy-making community. Climate change has become a political phenomenon that has and will greatly impact political stability regionally and globally. Using the ecological security theory as a framework, I explored the relationship between climate change and political stability in developing countries. This study utilizes both qualitative and quantitative analyses to investigate the relationship between climate change and its effects on political volatility in developing countries. Using regression models, the author examined all non-OECD countries (140 countries) and their relationship to political instability. The results indicate that the rise in food prices, climatic events (droughts, famines and extreme temperatures) and floods increased the probability of protests, riots and revolutions in developing countries. Utilizing qualitative methods, the countries that are developed for case studies are Egypt and Oman. Using the ecological security theory as a basis, the results suggest that climate change, in fact, acts as a <b>threat</b> <b>multiplier,</b> which increase the likelihood of political instability. Global warming impacts variables like food, water, oil, rapid population growth, health, and diseases in the Middle East and North Africa. In conclusion, I suggests several policy implications the international community should implement to mitigate the impact of climate change...|$|E
