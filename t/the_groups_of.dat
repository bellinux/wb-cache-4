5|$|A {{group is}} a {{mathematical}} structure consisting {{of a set of}} objects together with a binary operation, that is, an operation combining any two objects to a third, subject to certain requirements. A group in which the objects are matrices and the group operation is matrix multiplication is called a matrix group. Since in a group every element has to be invertible, the most general matrix groups are <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> all invertible matrices of a given size, called the general linear groups.|$|E

It follows that each coset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Appell sequences contains exactly one sequence of binomial type. Two Sheffer sequences {{are in the same}} such coset if and only if the operator Q described above [...] - [...] called the [...] "delta operator" [...] of that sequence [...] - [...] is the same linear operator in both cases. (Generally, a delta operator is a shift-equivariant linear operator on polynomials that reduces degree by one. The term is due to F. Hildebrandt.) ...|$|R

5|$|Nhu summoned 7 of the 10 generals to Gia Long Palace on August 20 for consultations. They {{presented}} their request for martial law and discussed how to disband <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> monks {{and their supporters}} from the temples in Saigon. Nhu sent the generals to see Diem. The president listened {{to the group of}} seven, led by General Trần Văn Đôn. The group also included Army Chief General Trần Thiện Khiêm and General Nguyễn Khánh, commander of the II Corps in the Central Highlands. Khiêm and Khánh were two of the officers who were responsible for helping to put down the attempted coup against Diệm in 1960. Also present was Đôn's brother-in-law, General Đỗ Cao Trí, commander of I Corps, which oversaw the northernmost region around Huế, and General Lê Văn Kim, head of the military academy. Trí and Kim were favorites of the Diệm regime. General Tôn Thất Đính, a brash paratrooper, who was also South Vietnam's youngest-ever general, commanded the III Corps surrounding Saigon. General Huỳnh Văn Cao was the commander of the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta and {{the only one of the}} septet who would prove not to have been involved in the later plotting against Diệm. Đính and Cao controlled the two corps regions closest to Saigon and therefore the two areas most crucial in the success or failure of a coup. Cao had used the Seventh Division of his IV Corps to storm the capital in 1960 to save Diệm.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} {{opens with}} an extensive orchestral sinfonia marked Concerto in the autograph score. Lasting 22 bars, this ritornello establishes the prevailing anguished {{mood of the}} first section. It is heard twice again, but only as the accompanying backdrop for the separate musical material of the chorus, a setting of the first phrase of the Old Testament text. The open motifs are also heard again in the fragmentary accompaniment of the central choral fugato episode between the two reprises of the ritornello. The different motifs in the ritornello thus also serve the purpose of accompanying specific parts of the text. The first predominant motif consist of detached repeated quaver chords, passed antiphonally between the three instrumental groups of recorders, oboes and strings. These are accompanied by similarly detached crotchets, scored as quavers with rests, in the walking bass of the continuo. After thirteen bars there follows a four bar passage of melifluous semiquaver passages in thirds for the recorders with imitative responses from the oboes; the upper strings take up the detached crotchets and the continuo <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> detached repeated quavers. In the four succeeding bars the quaver figure in the continuo line {{is replaced by a}} new motif of rising semiquaver scales, with the detached quavers and crotchets passing into the upper strings and the woodwind playing sustained chords. In the concluding two bars of the sinfonia the semiquaver scale motif passes into the recorders in thirds and is taken up by the other instruments for the sustained final cadence.|$|E

5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers {{the root of}} the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. <b>The</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E
