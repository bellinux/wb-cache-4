Eardwulf was married by the time he became king, <b>though</b> <b>his</b> wife's name is not recorded. It is possible he later wed an illegitimate daughter of Charlemagne. In 798, early in his reign, Eardwulf fought a battle at Billington Moor against a nobleman named Wada, who had been one of those who killed King Æthelred. Wada was defeated and driven into exile. In 801, Eardwulf led an army against Coenwulf of Mercia, perhaps because of Coenwulf's support for other claimants to the Northumbrian throne.|$|E

As the horses continued to gallop toward a stationary wagon waiting at a railway crossing, Albert jumped for his life from the carriage. One of the horses was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken, <b>though</b> <b>his</b> only physical injuries were cuts and bruises. He told his brother and eldest daughter that he sensed his time had come.|$|E

5|$|Alec Coxon took match {{figures of}} 4/113 for Yorkshire against Australia, taking four middle-order wickets, and scored 21 and 16 not {{out in the}} middle-order. He came into the team as an all-rounder, even <b>though</b> <b>his</b> {{performances}} {{during the rest of}} the English season had been mediocre; he had a batting average of 20.25 for the summer and took only ten wickets in seven matches prior to the county fixture against Australia. Bowes saw him as an attacking bowler compatible with Robins's strategic thinking.|$|E
5|$|Although Bede {{is mainly}} studied as a {{historian}} now, in his time his works on grammar, chronology, and biblical studies were as important as his historical and hagiographical works. The non-historical works contributed greatly to the Carolingian renaissance. He has been credited with writing a penitential, <b>though</b> <b>his</b> authorship of this work {{is still very much}} disputed.|$|E
5|$|Andrew and Frederick II, Duke of Austria, {{signed a}} peace treaty in late 1233. Andrew, who had been widowed, married the 23-year-old Beatrice D'Este on 14 May 1234, even <b>though</b> <b>his</b> sons were sharply opposed to his third marriage. John, Bishop of Bosnia, put Hungary under a new interdict {{in the first half}} of 1234, because Andrew had not {{dismissed}} his non-Christian officials despite his oath of Bereg. Andrew and Archbishop Robert of Esztergom protested against the bishop's act at the Holy See.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden {{supporters}} {{sought to}} make him the National Republican nominee for governor in the election of 1828. <b>Though</b> <b>his</b> nomination was all but certain, Crittenden declined the opportunity, fearing that his association with Clay, who was losing popularity in the state, would cost his party the election. Instead, he threw his support behind Thomas Metcalfe, {{who went on to}} carry a very close election over Democrat William T. Barry. Crittenden instead sought another term in the Kentucky House, but was again denied the seat.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} rounds, Garcia {{steadily}} pulled ahead, outboxing Judah throughout. Judah was {{in serious trouble}} in rounds 5 and 6, then finally {{went down in the}} 8th. From there, things took a surprising turn. Never known for his resolve or ability to turn the fight around late, Judah responded to the knockdown by coming on strong down the stretch. Judah took the last 3 rounds, <b>though</b> <b>his</b> deficit from earlier in the fight meant it wasn't enough and Garcia defeated Judah by unanimous decision (115-112, 114-112, 116-111).|$|E

5|$|Edward Stephen Massey Poyntz (27 October 1883 – 26 December 1934) was an English {{first-class}} cricketer, {{who played}} for Somerset {{in the early twentieth}} century. An amateur, Poyntz was an aggressive right-handed batsman. He generally played as part of the middle order, and <b>though</b> <b>his</b> batting was not exceptional, he was highly praised for his fielding ability. He captained Somerset in the two years prior to the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Even <b>though</b> <b>his</b> {{military}} career begun {{almost as an}} afterthought, or by accident, Zamoyski is also remembered {{as one of the}} most accomplished Polish military commanders. In his tactics, he favored sieges, flanking maneuvers, conserving his forces, and the new Western art of fortification and artillery. The war with Muscovy shown him to be a skilled commander in sieges, and latter events would prove him to be an equally able leader in the open field.|$|E
5|$|Following Operation Kraai in 1948, {{in which}} Dutch forces conquered the republican capital at Yogyakarta and {{captured}} {{much of the}} Sukarno government, Soeman was made commander of the guerrilla forces in Riau. Aside from continuing the fight, he was tasked with finding new fighters to support the republican cause. In this mission, he was aided in part by his extensive networks as a long-term schoolteacher, and many of Soeman's fighters were former students of his. <b>Though</b> <b>his</b> troops were underarmed, Soeman led them into combat against Dutch-allied indigene troops several times.|$|E

It took nearly twenty years for the second {{official}} occurrence in NBA history. Andrei Kirilenko, on January 3, 2006, recorded a five-by-six against the Lakers. <b>Though</b> <b>his</b> numbers were not quite as impressive as Olajuwon's, Kirilenko performed the feat in regulation.|$|E
