The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the occurrence of enterococci in conditions of farmhouse production and antibiotic resistance of 49 strains isolated from skin of teats and 50 strains isolated from <b>teat</b> <b>cups</b> of milking machine. The samples for enumeration and isolation of enterococci were cultured on selective diagnostic Slanetz-Bartley agar. The isolates were phenotypically identified at the species level with EN-COCCUS test. Susceptibilities of isolated enterococci to antibiotic (vancomycin 30 μg/disc, ampicillin 10 μg/disc, erythromycin 15 μg/disc, gentamicin 120 μg/disc, teicoplanin 30 μg/disc and tetracycline 30 μg/disc) were tested using the disc diffusion method.   The counts of enterococci from teats reached the average value 2. 77 log 10 cfu. ml - 1 and from <b>teat</b> <b>cups</b> of milking machine average value 2. 85  log 10 cfu. ml - 1.

Bacteria of Pseudomonas spp. genus were isolated from 85 and 82 sampling points in dairy farms with manual and mechanical milking system, respectively. A significant difference (p= 0. 02) on Pseudomonas spp. isolation was observed among samples of surface of cows’ teats before and after pre-dipping, but no significant difference (p> 0. 05) was observed among milking systems or seasons. The possibility of the same Pseudomonas spp. patterns are distributed in different farms and seasons using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) technique was demonstrated. Milkers’ hands, surface of cows’ <b>teats,</b> <b>teat</b> <b>cups</b> and cooling tanks were associated with raw milk contamination with Pseudomonas spp. on farms with manual and mechanical milking system, showing that regardless of the type of milking system and season, proper hygiene procedures of equipment, utensils and workers’ hands are essential to avoid contamination of the milk and, therefore, improve milk quality...|$|R
40|$|Motor {{activity}} of 158 Polish Holstein-Friesian cows was evaluated 5 times (before and during milking in a DeLaval 2 * 10 milking parlour) {{for both the}} morning and evening milking, on a 5 -point scale, according to the method of Budzyńska et al. (2007). The statistical analysis used multiple logistic regression and classification trees (Enterprise Miner 7. 1 software which comes in with SAS package). In the evaluation of motor activity, cows that {{were among the first}} ten to enter the milking parlour were more often given a score of 3 points before (11. 5 %) and during milking (23. 5 %) compared to the other cows. Cows’ activity tended to decrease (both before and during milking) with advancing lactation. The cows’ reduced activity was accompanied by shorter <b>teat</b> <b>cup</b> attachment times and lower milk yields. The criteria calculated for the quality of models based on classification tree technique as well as logistic regression showed that similar variables were responsible for the re{{activity of}} cows before milking (<b>teat</b> <b>cup</b> attachment time, day of lactation, number of lactation, side of the milking parlour) and during milking (day of lactation, side of the milking parlour, morning or evening milking, milk yield, number of lactation).

40|$|Milk {{harvesting}} {{practices in}} New Zealand have changed substantially {{over time in}} response to increasing herd sizes and demand for more efficient systems. Observations on 10 farms, representing a range of herd sizes and milking facilities, indicated that of the time required for milking 17 % was spent on preparation (fetching cows and setting the parlor up), 61 % on milking (attaching and removing <b>teat</b> <b>cups,</b> maintaining cow flow, attending to udder health and equipment) and 22 % of the time on post milking clean-up activities (including shutting cows away). Cows milked per hour ranged from 93 to 217 (calculated using all labor hours and excluding preparation and post-milking clean-up). Time per cow per milking ranged from 16 to 38 s. Automating the cups on task within the current batch milking systems is often suggested {{as a means of}} dramatically improving milking efficiency.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to assess the interrelation between teat anatomy and machine milking in dairy buffaloes raised in Switzerland. A 3 -min pre-stimulation induced milk ejection before cluster attachment in most cases and caused an optimal milk removal during machine milking. In an additional experiment, longitudinal cross-section ultrasound was obtained before and after a 3 -min pre-stimulation. Teat wall thickness, teat diameter, cisternal diameter and teat canal length were evaluated. It was observed that 3 -min pre-stimulation dramatically reduced teat canal length whereas all the other anatomical parameters remained unchanged. The vacuum needed to open the teat canal was also measured before and after a 3 -min pre-stimulation by using a special <b>teat</b> <b>cup</b> with only the mouthpiece of the liner remaining {{on the top of the}} <b>teat</b> <b>cup</b> (no liner, no pulsation). Without pre-stimulation but after wetting the teat canal by stripping one squirt of milk out of the teat, no milk could be withdrawn with a vacuum up to 39 kPa. However, after pre-stimulation, milk flow occurred in all buffaloes at a vacuum between 16 and 38 kPa. In the last experiment, the teat tissue was examined in slaughtered buffaloes and compared with teat tissue of cows. No difference was noted in histological sections and teat canal length was similar in cows and buffaloes. Proximal to the teat canal, the teat did not pass into an open cistern but the lumen was collapsed. In conclusion, buffaloes need to be well pre-stimulated because the tissue above the teat canal provides additional teat closure before milk ejection. Therefore, milk can only be obtained after pre-stimulatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{equipment}} {{described in}} this paper is being used in an introductory research program at the Department Of Agricultural Engineering, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). A measuring method had to be developed since there was nothing directly available that satisfied our needs. New and better techniques were gradually developed as the research program progressed. An improved equipment design was normally used directly after it had been tested in the laboratory. Two principally dissimilar measurement techniques were used, a Doppler device and a orifice measuring device. The Doppler device is described in sections 5. 1, 5. 2 and 5. 3. Three different versions were developed. Firstly a Doppler device directly attached to the cow’s teat, Secondly a contact-free Doppler device and thirdly a shunted contact-free Doppler device. In sections 5. 4, 5. 5, 5. 6, 5. 7 and 5. 8 the various versions of the orifice measurement system are described. Three different experimental <b>teat</b> <b>cups</b> are listed in this paper. One {{was used in the}} non contact-free measuring system, i. e. the Doppler device was directly attached to the teat. The other two <b>teat</b> <b>cups</b> made it possible to apply a contact-free measuring method. The two latter cups were basically equivalent to one another. A regulation system needed when using contact-free milk flow rate measuring techniques is described in Section 5. 2. 3. Other equipment not strictly used for measuring milk flow rate has also been developed. These are devices not actually used for milk flow rate measurements but are of the utmost importance for accurate measurements. The description and explanation of the different measuring techniques is preceded by a short review of literature dealing with the physiology of the cow’s teat.

40|$|Objective This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the microbiological and cellular milk profile for the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in female buffaloes and to assess risk factors for predisposition of the disease. Methods Analyses were carried out by standard plate count (SPC), identification of species and antibiotic resistance, somatic cell count (SCC), electrical electrical conductivity of milk (ECM), and lactoferrin content in milk. <b>Teat</b> <b>cups</b> were swabbed to evaluate risk factors, observing hyperkeratosis, milking vacuum pressure and cleanliness of the site. Hence, 30 female buffaloes were randomly selected (15 from a group in early lactation and 15 in late lactation). Results The most common bacteria in the microbiological examination were Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp. and Corynebacterium sp. In the antibiotic sensitivity test, 10 (58. 82 %) of the 17 antibiotics tested were sensitive to all isolates, and resistant bacteria were Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus haemolyticus, and Escherichia coli. It was observed that positive samples in the microbiological examination showed total bacterial count between 9. 10 × 103 to 6. 94 × 106 colony forming units/mL, SCC between 42, 000 to 4, 320, 000 cells/mL and ECM ranging from 1. 85 to 7. 40 mS/cm. It was {{also found that the}} <b>teat</b> <b>cups</b> had high microbial counts indicating poor hygiene, and even faults in the cleanliness of the animals’ waiting room were observed. It is concluded that values of SCC above 537, 000 cells/mL and ECM above 3. 0 mS/mL are indications of mammary gland infection for this herd; however, the association of these values with a microbiological analysis is necessary to more accurately evaluate the health status of mammary glands with subclinical mastitis. Conclusion Through phenotypic characterization of bacteria involved in the samples, the genera Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Corynebacterimum bovis were the most prevalent in this study.

40|$|This is {{a master}} thesis written under joint {{supervision}} from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (Ås, Norway) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (Uppsala, Sweden). It examines the possibility that number of <b>teat</b> <b>cup</b> kick-offs and milking interval, recorded by an automatic milking system, {{could be used to}} make conclusions about a cow's temperament. The increasing popularity of automatic milking systems beginning in Northern Europe and spreading {{to other parts of the}} world requires a re-evaluation of breeding goals for dairy cattle. Workability traits, including temperament, become more important because cows must make their own way to the milking unit and stand quietly while being milked. Fetching of cows, which increases labour requirement, should be minimalized. Besides the apparent benefits of a decrease in labour and an increase in flexibility for farmers, AMS also can record substantial amounts of data on cows. This data, when handled correctly, has the potential to be used in genetic evaluations to obtain estimates of breeding values and heritability. Records from 1674 Swedish Holstein cows from 17 commercial AMS herds were used to estimate heritabilities and variance components for 2 different <b>teat</b> <b>cup</b> kick-offs traits and milking interval. Because these traits are hypothesised to be related to temperament, genetic correlations with temperament scores were estimated. Heritability for the kick-off traits were 0. 06 to 0. 31 and milking interval was estimated at 0. 17. Heritability for temperament score was estimated at 0. 14 using scores on 1833 cows from 15 of the 17 herds. Genetic correlations between AMS data and temperament scores were moderate and significant for the two kick-off traits, r= - 0. 38 and - 0. 50 indicating that a higher temperament score (a more calm cow) could indicate less kick-offs. Results suggest that data from AMS could provide an objective method to measure temperament in dairy cows. European Masters in Animal Breeding and Genetic...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to investigate the suitability {{of a combination of}} a short manual teat stimulation with a short latency period before <b>teat</b> <b>cup</b> attachment to induce and maintain oxytocin release and milk ejection without interruption. In Experiment 1, seven dairy cows in mid lactation were manually pre-stimulated for 15, 30 or 45 s, followed by either 30 s or 45 s of latency period. It was shown that all treatments induced a similar release of oxytocin without interruption until the end of milking. In particular, the latency period of up to 45 s did not cause a transient decrease of oxytocin concentration. In Experiment 2, milking characteristics were recorded in seven cows each in early, mid, and late lactation, respectively. Because the course of milk ejection depends mainly on the degree of udder filling, individual milkings were classified based on the actual degree of udder filling which differs between lactational stages but also between morning and evening milkings. All animals underwent twelve different udder preparation treatments, i. e. 15, 30, or 45 s of pre-stimulation followed by latency periods of 0, 30, 45, or 60 s. Milking characteristics were recorded. Total milk yield, main milking time and average milk flow rate did not differ between treatments if the degree of udder filling at the start of milking was > 40 % of the maximum storage capacity. However, if the udder filling was < 40 %, main milking time was decreased with the duration of a latency period up to 45 s, independent of duration of pre-stimulation. Average milk flow at an udder filling of < 40 % was highest after a pre-stimulation of 45 s followed by a latency period of another 45 s. In contrast, average milk flow reached its lowest values at a pre-stimulation of 15 s without additional latency period. However, average milk flow after a 15 -s pre-stimulation increased with increasing latency period.

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the use of tactile stimulation in dairy heifers and its effects on behavior and milk production after calving. Ten primiparous Holstein heifers were used. Half the group received training with tactile stimulation of all body regions, while the other group did not receive stimulation (control group). The training period was divided into three phases: early, days 1 to 6 of training; intermediate: days 7 to 12, and final, days 13 to 23. During training, movement and displacement scores were obtained over a period of 5 minutes. Physiological parameters were also recorded [respiratory rate (FR) and minimum eye temperature (ETmin) measured with a thermal imaging camera]. After calving, the heifers were submitted to first milking when the evaluations were started for the first 10 days of milking (20 consecutive milkings). The behavior of the animals was evaluated by attributing a reactivity score of 1 (desirable behaviors) or 2 (undesirable behaviors) : entry into the pen, teat disinfection, milking one or two jets of milk for mastitis testing, attachment of <b>teat</b> <b>cups,</b> and removal of milk, as well as the amount of milk produced. Mean ETmin and FR decreased over the training period. A significant difference was observed for displacement score (P= 0. 019), with a reduction in displacement from the early to the final period (from 60. 0 % to 25. 7 %). During the attachment of <b>teat</b> <b>cups,</b> stimulated heifers were less reactive (P= 0. 002), characterized by a lower frequency of undesirable behaviors (12. 0 %), than unstimulated heifers (30. 2 %).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to gather and {{evaluate}} the evidence about the behaviour of dairy cows during the milking by a robot (including physiological reactions running after the milking). The following parameters were observed: number of milking per 24 hours, the time from onset to the robot and the <b>teat</b> <b>cup</b> deployment, the time between milking, the total time of milking, milk yield with each milking, average and total milk yield per day. The results were measured separately in heifers and in cows on the second and subsequent lactations. In the same time, there was also observed the behaviour of cows after leaving the milking robot - feed and water intake, physical activity and the rest for the time of 30 minutes after the milking. Simultaneously, there was also observed the effect of milking technology {{for the health of}} the cows, focused on diseases of the mammary gland. There were three ethologic observations which always lasted 24 hours. In addition to the observed data, there were evaluated the data records obtained from the milking machine (e. g. milk yield per one milking, the interval between single milkings, etc.). There were observed an average of 60 pieces of cows. Throughout the watching the cows in the barn behaved calmly and contentedly. They came to the milking machine spontaneously, only a few cases had to be herded for milking by the caregiver. However, they were all the heifers which did not have the sufficient experience with the milking. The counting of <b>teat</b> <b>cup</b> deployment attempts had to be abandoned because of the close proximity of the observer at the milking robot. In this case, the cows were not quiet {{and did not want to}} go in the robot spontaneously. The mammary gland disease was diagnosed at an average of 6. 9 pieces of milked cows per one month.

The mechanisation of dairying is significant because it alters human perception of the dairy animal. When a farmer or farm employee milks a cow they attach a milking machine (a pump connected though tubes to <b>teat</b> <b>cups)</b> to a cow’s teats. The human and cow are now connected in a relationship mediated and defined through technology. The milk is not seen for what it is – the food intended for the cow’s calf - rather farmers regard milk as a commodity to be ‘harvested’. (Driessen & Heutinek, 2015). The milk flows in a unilateral direction from the cow to the human through the mediation of a machine, distancing the farmer even further from the absent calf that would ordinarily be with the cow suckling. The machine replaces the calf, draining the cow of her milk that her body continues to produce for the absent offspring.|$|R

40|$|Prevention {{of damage}} to the teat and {{mastitis}} requires determination of the teat load caused by a collapsing liner. The {{aim of this study}} was to test a pressure-indicating film designed to measure the pressure between a collapsing liner and artificial teats. The Ultra Super Low and the Extreme Low pressure-indicating films were tested on two types of artificial teat. The experiments were performed with a conventional milking cluster equipped with round silicone liners. For each teat and film type, 30 repetitions were performed. Each repetition was performed with a new piece of film. Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to detect differences between the pressure values for the different teats. The area of regions where pressure-indication color developed was calculated to determine the most suitable film type. Both film types measured the pressure applied to both artificial teats by the <b>teat</b> <b>cup</b> liner. Thus, the pressure-indicating films can be used to measure the pressure between a collapsing liner and an artificial teat. Based on the results of the present investigation, a pressure-indicating film with the measurement ranges of both film types combined would be an optimal tool to measure the overall pressure between an artificial teat and a collapsing liner...|$|R

40|$|Buffalo {{farming in}} Italy is {{traditionally}} oriented towards mozzarella cheese production {{and over the}} last decade it has been rapidly increased. As a result, intensive techniques and mechanisation of farm activities have been introduced. Those sudden changes in rearing techniques have aroused a general concern about buffaloes welfare and its possible consequences on products quality. Human-animal interactions are recognized {{to have an impact on}} productivity, behaviour and welfare, particularly in dairy farms, where the milking process involves a close interaction with a human handler. Focusing on the first month of lactation, this preliminary study aimed at evidencing buffalo behavioural responses to machine milking. Relationship between behaviour and oxytocin administrations, often performed to allow milk let down, has been also investigated. The experiment included 8 multiparous and 6 primiparous buffaloes, calving in the same period. Starting from the first entrance in the milking parlour, the animals were followed two days/ week during the morning milking for the first 5 weeks of lactation. Behaviour observation was performed following a “focal animal sampling” (continuous recording) technique. Proportional frequencies of the following behaviours were calculated: kicking, stepping, defecating, urinating, vocalizing, pulling the <b>teat</b> <b>cup</b> off the <b>teats.</b> The exogenous oxytocin administration at milking was recorded. Pearson Chi-Square test was used to verify the presence of differences between primiparous and multiparous cows’ behaviour at milking. Cochran’s Q test was used to assess the variability of behaviour over time and a binomial regression was performed in order to verify the correlations between animal behaviours and the need to administer oxytocin. Considering lactation number, every behavioural pattern in primiparous cows, except for stepping, resulted to be more frequently performed (36. 67 % vs 24. 36 % for kicking; 5 % vs 2. 56 % for defecating; 11. 67 % vs 5. 13 % for pulling the <b>teat</b> <b>cup</b> off the <b>teats).</b> The behaviour of urinating (48. 33 % vs 11. 54 %) proved to have a significantly higher mean frequency of occurrence compared to the multiparous one (P< 0. 001). The frequency of oxytocin administration showed a high variability over time (P< 0. 001), soon decreasing, while the selected behaviours proved to be more stable in time, except for kicking and urinating (P< 0. 05). Some correlations between animal behaviour at milking and oxytocin administration were found; particularly kicking, stepping and urinating appeared to be significantly related to the requirement of exogenous molecule (P< 0. 001). The occurrence of behaviours considered as indicators of acute stress and their correlation with oxytocin administration are a clear proof of the machine milking impact on buffaloes welfare and productivity...|$|R
50|$|In {{the shell}} game, {{three or more}} {{identical}} containers (which may be <b>cups,</b> <b>shells,</b> bottle caps, or anything else) are placed face-down on a surface. A small ball is placed beneath one of these containers so that it cannot be seen, and they are then shuffled by the operator in plain view. One or more players are invited to bet on which container holds the ball - typically, the operator offers to double the player's stake if they guess right. Where {{the game is played}} honestly, the operator can win if he shuffles the containers in a way which the player cannot follow.|$|R

50|$|As herd sizes {{increased}} a {{door was}} {{set into the}} front of each bail {{so that when the}} milking was done for any cow the milker could, after undoing the leg-rope and with a remote link, open the door and allow her to exit to the pasture. The door was closed, the next cow walked into the bail and was secured. When milking machines were introduced bails were set in pairs so that a cow was being milked in one paired bail while the other could be prepared for milking. When one was finished the machine's cups are swapped to the other cow. This is the same as for Swingover Milking Parlours as described below except that the cups are loaded on the udder from the side. As herd numbers increased it was easier to double-up the cup-sets and milk both cows simultaneously than {{to increase the number of}} bails. About 50 cows an hour can be milked in a shed with 8 bails by one person. Using the same <b>teat</b> <b>cups</b> for successive cows has the danger of transmitting infection, mastitis, from one cow to another. Some farmers have devised their own ways to disinfect the clusters between cows.|$|R
