5|$|The Thraliana was a diary kept by Hester Thrale and {{is part of}} {{the genre}} known as table talk. Although <b>the</b> <b>work</b> began as Thrale's diary focused on her {{experience}} with her family, it slowly changed focus to emphasise various anecdotes and stories about the life of Samuel Johnson. <b>The</b> <b>work</b> was used as a basis for Thrale's Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson, but the Thraliana remained unpublished until 1942. The anecdotes contained within <b>the</b> <b>work</b> were popular with Thrale's contemporaries but seen as vulgar. Among 20th century readers, <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was popular, and many literary critics believe that <b>the</b> <b>work</b> is a valuable contribution to the genre and for providing information about Johnson's and her own life.|$|E

Existentialism, a school of thought founded upon <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Søren Kierkegaard, focuses on Human predicament and how people deal with the situation of being alive. Existential-phenomenology represents a major branch of continental philosophy (they are not contradictory), rooted in <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Husserl but expressed in its fullest forms in <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.
