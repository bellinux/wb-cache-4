40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) {{contribute}} to {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>dissemination</b> by capturing and transporting infectious virus from the mucosa to draining lymph nodes, and transferring these virus particles to CD 4 + T cells with high efficiency. Toll-like receptor (TLR) -induced maturation of DCs enhances their ability to mediate trans-infection of T cells {{and their ability to}} migrate from the site of infection. Because TLR-induced maturation can be inhibited by nuclear receptor (NR) signaling, we hypothesized that ligand-activated NRs could repress DC-mediated HIV- 1 <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>dissemination.</b> Here, we show that ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARc) and liver X receptor (LXR) prevented proinflammatory cytokine production by DCs and inhibited DC migration in response to the chemokine CCL 21 by preventing the TLR-induced upregulation of CCR 7. Importantly, PPARc and LXR signaling inhibited both immature and mature DC-mediated trans-infection by preventing the capture of HIV- 1 by DCs independent of the viral envelope glycoprotein. PPARc and LXR signaling induced cholesterol efflux from DCs and led to a decrease in DC-associated cholesterol, which has previously been shown to be required for DC capture of HIV- 1. Finally, both cholesterol repletion and the targeted knockdown of the cholesterol transport protein ATP-binding cassette A 1 (ABCA 1) restored the ability of NR ligand treated cells to capture HIV- 1 and transfer it to T cells.

40|$|The natural history, microevolution, and {{patterns}} of interindividual <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> global <b>dissemination</b> of the JP 2 clone of Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans were studied by population genetic analysis. The JP 2 clone is strongly associated with aggressive periodontitis in adolescents of African descent and differs from other clones of the species by several genetic peculiarities, including a 530 -bp deletion in the promoter region of the leukotoxin gene operon, which results in increased leukotoxic activity. Multilocus sequence analysis of 82 A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, 66 of which were JP 2 clone strains collected {{over a period of}} more than 20 years, confirmed that there is a clonal population structure with evolutionary lineages corresponding to serotypes. Although genetically highly conserved, as shown by alignment of sequences of eight housekeeping genes, strains belonging to the JP 2 clone had a number of point mutations, particularly in the pseudogenes hbpA and tbpA. Characteristic mutations allowed isolates from individuals from the Mediterranean area and from West Africa, including the Cape Verde Islands, to be distinguished. The patterns of mutations indicate that the JP 2 clone initially emerged as a distinct genotype in the Mediterranean part of Africa approximately 2, 400 years ago and subsequently spread to West Africa, from which it was transferred to the American continents during the transatlantic slave trade. The sustained exclusive colonization of individuals of African descent despite geographical separation for centuries suggests that the JP 2 clone has a distinct host tropism. The colonization of family members by JP 2 clone strains with unique point mutations provides strong evidence that there is intrafamilial <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> suggests that <b>dissemination</b> of the JP 2 clone is restricted to close contacts...|$|R

Potential association of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) {{in patients with}} prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome has attracted broad interests in this topic. Although recent {{studies have indicated that}} XMRV is unlikely a human pathogen, further understanding of XMRV xenoinfection would allow in vivo modeling of the initial steps of gammaretroviral interspecies <b>transmission,</b> evolution <b>and</b> <b>dissemination</b> in a new host population. In this study, we monitored the long-term consequences of XMRV infection and its possible vertical transmission in a permissive foreign host, wild-derived Mus pahari mice. One year post-infection, XMRV-infected mice showed no notable pathological changes, while proviral DNA was detected in three out of eight mice. XMRV-infected mice remained seropositive throughout the study although the levels of gp 70 Env- and p 30 capsid-specific antibodies gradually decreased. When vertical XMRV transmission was assessed, no viremia, humoral immune responses nor endogenization were observed in nine offspring from infected mothers, yet one offspring was found PCR-positive for XMRV-specific sequences. Amplified viral sequences from the offspring showed several mutations, including one amino acid deletion in the receptor binding domain of Env SU.

This paper recommends a stigmergic framework for social epistemology to account for the supposed tension between individual action, wants and beliefs and the social corpora.

Multimedia transmission provides an accurate {{overview of the}} emergency event {{in the form of}} an image, an audio or a video.

To avoid interference with the safety messages already in place, we propose to allocate separate multihop time slots for the multimedia messages, and devise a signaling mechanism that ensures a reliable delivery of these multimedia messages.
