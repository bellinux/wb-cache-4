Unlike previous results obtained with small-size (1 cm(2)) streamer tubes, stable operation is achieved when gas mixtures with an ethane fraction greater than 70 % are used. The use of ethane replacing isobutane allows one to avoid problems due to the low vapour pressure of this gas.

40|$|AbstractThe {{project is}} an {{assembly}} of two Polyester/PVC-pneumatic structures {{located at the}} east coast of Lake Ontario in Toronto/Canada. High wind loads due to the exposed location were expected. The larger of the two structures is 15 m high and 60 m long. The pneumatic nature of the design was key for winning the public competition, because it allowed erection of a spatial enclosure of this size only within the given timeframe of one week prior {{to the beginning of the}} Pan American Games.

25|$|Maintenance of {{adequate}} tire inflation {{is the most}} frequent and troublesome concern for cyclists and many means and methods are employed to preserve pneumatic integrity. Thicker tires, thicker tubes, tire liners (of a number of rather impenetrable devices installed between the tire and tube), liquid sealing compounds squeezed into the <b>tube,</b> and automotive-style <b>patch</b> kits are all used to reliably contain the typical tire pressures of 40 to 60 {{pounds per square inch}} that are required for bicycle operation. Thin, light bicycle tires are particularly vulnerable to penetration and subsequent deflation caused by goat's heads and other burs, colloquially known as stickers. Inflation of bicycle tires to pressures higher than typical for automotive use requires special pumps. The complexity of bicycle tire maintenance and repair may cause many to not consider the bicycle for transport or leisure.|$|R

It was found that there was no late hypertension in group 1 while hypertension persisted in 7 % of group 2 and in 28 % of group 3. Fifty per cent of the patients with persistent hypertension were above the age of 20 years at the time of operation and had resection with replacement by a tube graft.

50|$|As {{observed}} by Springer Healthcare, The main {{advantage of the}} Omnipod System is the freedom it grants its users. Contrary to previous pump technology, it contains no external tubing. Insulin is pumped directly from the reservoir into the imbedded cannula, removing {{the need for a}} connecting <b>tube.</b> Having a <b>patch</b> style pump eliminates many worries that most pump wearers have to think about. The all-in-one style of the Omnipod allows the user to wear their pump at all times, even without clothing. They don’t have to worry about clipping it onto their belt or pants, so it can be worn at all times. Also, this means that any form of physical activity can also be performed while still wearing the pump; It is even waterproof up to 25 feet. Since the pump user doesn’t have to disconnect their pump for common activities, they will consistently receive insulin and have better control over their blood sugars.|$|R

This plant has been in operation for more than 14 years. This paper covers the results of two case studies regarding the desal effect tube failures in the plant. Case- I The Aluminum Brass tubes of the first and second rows of the tube bundle of the 2 nd effect chamber were found leaking. In all 31 numbers of tubes had failed and the R&D Center received two failed tubes for investigation. The outer surface of the <b>tubes</b> contained <b>patches</b> of visually thick scales and pits. Both the tube surfaces contained small and big size (approx. 15 mm dia) holes. Substantial thinning of the metal near the edges of the holes was noticed. The results of the investigation pointed out that tubes had failed mainly due to erosion-corrosion. The erosion- corrosion occurred when gases, vapors or liquid impinge on metal surface at higher velocities. Non uniform spray distribution of seawater on the tubes was found responsible for the observed localized perforation of the tubes. It was recommended that during plant maintenance, thorough cleaning of seawater distribution trays including holes and nozzles should be carried out in order to ensure uniform spray pattern on the tubes during operation. Case- II The investigation on the failure of Aluminum Brass tubes of reheat type desal unit D- 03 and D- 04 was carried out at R&D Center.

40|$|I {{studied the}} ecology of the {{sawtooth}} grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), and used O. surinamensis in conjunction with a computer simulation to understand the regulation of small populations. Many populations of organisms deplete their food resource and inevitably encounter negative population feedbacks. Eight short-term experiments differentiated the effects of food deterioration and crowding of stages on dispersal, mortality and reproduction. Metapopulations were created by connecting vials with rubber <b>tubes.</b> The <b>patches</b> of each metapopulation were arranged in rings and food was replenished at two-week intervals. The population dynamical effects of subdivision, degradation and overall system size were manipulated in five experiments. Time-series of stage-specific abundances were compared in repeated measures ANOVA. An individual-based simulation was used to explore mechanisms of population dynamics through parameter calibration and model fitting. The experiments quantified rates of birth and death in response to both the amount of food and area. Mixed stage populations of O. surinamensis respond to food deterioration by increasing in immature mortality, sharply reducing oviposition, and increasing adult dispersal. Fragmentation experiments defined the relationship between habitat size and amount of food on population dynamics. For beetle abundance in my experiments, changing the habitat size had twice the effect of changes in the amount of food. Abundance responded more rapidly to changes in habitat area than to changes in amount of food. The results of the experiments were used to calibrate and test models that forecast population abundance. I selected from among candidate models based on minimum mean square error. The selected model indicates that periodic replenishment of food causes flushes of reproduction followed by food depletion, cannibalism and inhibited oviposition. I employed the experimental model system to test metapopulation theory, and I developed the simulation to show the mechanisms that regulate the dynamics of O. surinamensis populations. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{behavioral}} mechanisms underlying aggregation of foragers on local resource patches, {{it is necessary to}} manipulate the location, quality and quantity of food patches. This requires careful control over the conditions in the foraging arena, which may be a challenging task in the case of aquatic resourceconsumer systems, like that of freshwater zooplankton feeding on suspended algal cells. We present an experimental tool designed to aid behavioral ecologists in exploring the consequences of resource characteristics for zooplankton aggregation behavior and movement decisions under conditions where the boundaries and characteristics (quantity and quality) of food patches can be standardized.

40|$|Optimal {{foraging}} models tend {{to assume}} that animals have perfect information. However, the world is constantly changing, {{and so it is}} likely that animals benefit from gathering better knowledge much of the time. Therefore, animals should exploit what they know to be the most profitable foraging options, but also invest some optimal level of effort in sampling. Sampling is when an animal investigates alternative foraging options in order to find out which is the best one to utilize at the current time. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if the Siberian jays (Perisoreus infaustus) used sampling and public information to exploit the best combination of different foraging patches of variable profitability. This was done using an experimental feeding platform containing a number of different randomly arranged patches each consisting of four closely spaced colour-coded tubes (i. e. one-shot feeders), each containing the same of one of five different sizes of food items (sausage pieces). Overall, the jays exploited significantly more <b>tubes</b> in <b>patches</b> that contained large sausage items than would be expected at random. This foraging success better than chance was achieved using a long-term approximation of the win-stay lose-shift strategy i. e. the birds used information provided by a tube to either come back to the same patch again if a large item was obtained (success), or shift to sample a new patch if a small item was obtained (no success). Hence, if a tube with large item was opened, the birds were more likely to return to this patch again. However, they did not always return immediately since no significant influence of the previous success was found, suggesting a longer-term strategy involving more than one patch at a time. In addition, the birds opened significantly more tubes containing large items than chance when visiting new patches that other birds had already visited, suggesting some use of public as well as private information. It therefore seems that Siberian jays try to maximize their food intake over the whole trial period and not just per visit. They do this by deviating from a simple win-stay lose-shift strategy, keeping the profitability of more than just two patches in mind at any one time and by exploiting the public information provided by the sampling behaviour of other birds...|$|R

Patients and methods: This was a retrospective case-controlled observational study of 64  eyes from 64 patients. Thirty-two eyes of 32 patients with tube erosion requiring surgical revision were compared with 32 matched control eyes of 32 patients. Univariate and multivariate risk factor analyses were performed. Results: Mean age was significantly younger in the tube exposure group compared with the control group (48. 2 ± 28. 1  years versus 67. 3 ± 18. 0  years, respectively; P= 0. 003). The proportion of diabetic patients (12. 5 %) in the tube exposure group was significantly less (P= 0. 041) compared with the control group (37. 5 %). Comparisons of the type and position of the drainage implant were not significantly different between the two groups. The average time to tube exposure was 17. 2 ± 18. 0  months after implantation of the drainage device. In both univariate and multivariate analyses, younger age (P= 0. 005 and P= 0. 027) and inflammation prior to tube exposure (P≤ 0. 001 and P= 0. 004) were significant risk factors. Diabetes was a significant risk factor only in the univariate analysis (P= 0. 027).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} specific {{new applications}} of Z-Fibre ® pinning and focuses the attention onto the failure modes of locally reinforced (z-pinned) structures. Design {{implications of the}} use of localised reinforcement on structures, rather than laboratory coupons, are considered. Z-pinning reinforcement is applied to cylindrical crash <b>tubes</b> and I-section <b>patch</b> joints manufactured from woven carbon / epoxy pre-pregs. Z-pinning is shown to improve the Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) of the crash tubes by up to 76 %, the exact amount depending on the tube geometry. For the I-section patch joints, an initial increase in ultimate load carrying capability due to z-pin use is observed and, as the quantity of z- pins increases, a change in failure mode is induced. Z-pinning is also shown to enhance the damage tolerance of these. The ability to predict major changes to the structural response due to use of z-pins, and design for them accordingly, is {{the next step in the}} understanding of the technology. The design element of this study is contained in the development of a new Finite Element model using cohesive interface elements. The provision of mode II input data for this model comes from End Loaded Split (ELS) testing of the woven laminates and continued development of the Z-shear test. A new analysis for quantifying the crack sliding displacement, based on the ELS test, is developed. Z-shear testing has shown that the z-pin ‘mode II’ fracture energy is strongly affected by the amount of mode I opening of the shear surfaces. Here, new data are obtained for a fully constrained, pure mode II case. Using this modelling tool, changes in failure mode due to z-pin use can be predicted. Verification is provided by a new simulation of the I-section patch joint geometry...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{an inverse}} source {{reconstruction}} method with great potential in radome diagnostics is presented. A radome is a cover that encloses an antenna {{in order to}} protect it from environmental influences. Radome diagnostics are acquired in the design process, the delivery control, and in performance verification of repaired and newly developed radomes. A measured near or far field may indicate deviations, e. g., beam deflection, but the origins of the flaws are not uncovered. In this thesis, radome diagnostics is performed by imaging the tangential electromagnetic fields on radome surfaces, disclosing the radome influence on the electromagnetic fields as well as the positions and influences of defects. The source reconstruction is based on a surface integral representation together with the extinction theorem. The extinction theorem and its associated surface integral equation ensure that the reconstructed tangential electromagnetic fields have their sources within the radome. The presence of axial symmetry in the measurement set-up enables usage of the fast Fourier transform to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, the problem is solved by an in-house body of revolution method of moments (MoM) code utilizing a singular value decomposition (SVD) for regularization. The reconstruction is performed on a fictitious surface in free space, located precisely outside the physical surface of the radome, i. e., no a priori information of the material of the radome is requested. Moreover, both synthetic and measured data are used to verify the method. In Papers I-III, the measurement set-up is a reflector antenna covered by a monolithic radome, and the near field is measured on a cylindrical surface. The height of the radome corresponds to 29 - 43 wavelengths in the frequency interval 8. 0 - 12. 0 GHz. The amplitude and phase of the tangential electromagnetic fields are reconstructed on the radome surface and the influence of the radome is investigated. Moreover, the alteration of the phase due to the transmission of the radome, the insertion phase delay (IPD), is imaged. Defects in the form of square copper patches, with an edge length corresponding to 1. 6 - 2. 4 wavelengths in the considered frequency interval, are attached to the radome wall. These might {{serve as a model for}} e. g., a lightning conductor or a Pitot <b>tube.</b> The attached <b>patches</b> alter the near field, and by applying source reconstruction, the disturbances of the patches are focused and detectable. In Paper IV, the field is measured on a spherical sector in the far-field region at 10. 0 GHz. Two set-ups with dielectric defects attached to the radome surface, are investigated. The aim is to investigate if variations in the electrical thickness of the radome wall can be detected. It is concluded that it is possible to discover dielectric patches of various edge sizes (0. 5 - 2. 0 wavelengths), and with the smallest thickness corresponding to a phase shift of a couple of degrees. In Paper V, a frequency selective (FSS) radome corresponding to a height of 51 wavelengths at the frequency 9. 35 GHz is investigated. The electrical performance of an FSS radome depends on the periodic structure of the elements in the radome frame. The periodic structure of the investigated radome is disrupted by horizontal defects (vertical displacements of elements) and vertical defects (a column of missing elements). The far-field data is measured on a spherical sector, and the far-field data reveals that the radome changes the radiation properties. The tangential electromagnetic fields on the radome surface are reconstructed for several antenna illuminations to image the cause of these alterations. Furthermore, it is shown that the different components of the electromagnetic fields are affected differently by the defects, implying that both co- and cross-components of the electric and magnetic fields need to be considered. Moreover, the Poynting's vector is employed to visualize how the defects block the field from the antenna...|$|R
