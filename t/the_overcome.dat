40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify what "the {{overcoming}} of suffering" at which the fundamental Buddhism aims is. <b>The</b> <b>overcoming</b> of suffering is the state that becomes possible in "Nirvana(nibbāna) ". What is this? According to a predominant opinion of today's Buddhism study, it is a state of the mind of man from whom desire and evil passion disappear. Therefore, Buddhism reasons that these should be eliminated in order to realize <b>the</b> <b>overcoming</b> of suffering and thus the state of Nirvana. However, Sakyamuni considers the Nirvana to be a certain root truth that is called "Holy Truth (ariyasacca) ". It is a transcendent place that has no phenomenon at all. Nevertheless, it is not excluded from all phenomena but is in all phenomena. How should we arrive at such a Nirvana for <b>the</b> <b>overcoming</b> of suffering? Sakyamuni explains "concentration(samādhi) " as "the road that arrives at the Nirvana". Concentration on a certain phenomenon realizes its truth. And this truth is the Nirvana. Also, to realize the Nirvana by concentration to a phenomenon is to arrive at the Nirvana as to <b>overcome</b> suffering. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>overcoming</b> of suffering is the realizing of the Nirvana as the arriving at the Nirvana, and this happens in a concentration on a phenomenon. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>overcoming</b> of suffering is, as for our more concrete way of living, the devoting ourselves to our given life and the living in it sincerely. This rather exceeds our life and suffering...|$|R
