40|$|This thesis aims {{to discuss}} the process of {{concluding}} contracts resulting from public tender, and its comparison with the draft law on procurement procedures approved by the Czech government. The thesis describes the current legislation on concluding contracts resulting from public tender and its subsequent amendments in three separate chapters. The first chapter briefly defines the basic terminology of the public procurement procedure, which is crucial for {{the whole process of}} concluding public procurement contracts. The second chapter deals with selected aspects of conclusion of public procurement contracts in open procedure. These aspects are commencing of tender procedure, boundness of the submission of <b>tender,</b> <b>security,</b> opening of envelopes with submissions, and the selection of the best submission and obligations of public authorities after conclusion of public procurement contract. Chapter three is the most detailed part of the thesis, which deals with changes in public procurement contracts. Chapter three first describes the development of the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and then is followed by changes in the subject of public procurement contracts and changes in the contracting parties of public procurement contracts.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{formulate}} and develop the theoretical and methodological foundations for {{the functioning of the}} electronic public procurement system in the logistic environment and develop an approach to determining the level of enterprise readiness for participation in electronic public procurement based on the logistic management of information, financial, information and financial flows, document flows, flows of goods, flows of work and services. The classification of groups of temporary, quantitative, qualitative, cost, technical and technological indicators as well as indicators of the level of readiness of the electronic public procurement system at the macro- and microlevels is proposed. It is recommended to consider the readiness to participate in electronic public procurement and the effectiveness of fulfilling obligations to the customer after the completion of the tender process to be the key indicators for the enterprise. There developed an approach to determining the level of enterprise readiness for participation in electronic public procurement {{on the basis of a}} set of criteria related to management of information logistics systems, financial logistics, information and financial logistics, document management, commodity logistics, logistics services and works. Prospects for further research in this direction are development of an approach to financial and economic analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness of the <b>tender</b> <b>security</b> mechanism in the system of electronic public procurement in Ukraine and countries of the European Union...|$|E

These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system, but were {{not subject to the}} same regulatory controls. Further, these entities were vulnerable because they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets. This meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging, selling their long-term assets at depressed prices.

40|$|Renewable fuels are in {{biodegradable}} {{nature and}} they <b>tender</b> good energy <b>security</b> and foreign exchange savings. In addition they address environmental concerns and socio-economic issues. The present work presents the experimental investigations {{carried out on}} the utilization of such renewable fuel combinations for diesel engine applications. For this a single-cylinder four-stroke water cooled direct injection (DI) compression ignition (CI) engine provided with CMFIS (Conventional Mechanical Fuel Injection System) was rightfully converted to operate with CRDi injection systems enabling high pressure injection of Rubber seed oil methyl ester (RuOME) in the dual fuel mode with induction of varied gas flow rates of hydrogen and hydrogen enriched CNG (HCNG) gas combinations. Experimental investigations showed a considerable improvement in dual fuel engine performance with acceptable brake thermal efficiency and reduced emissions of smoke, hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and slightly increased nitric oxide (NOx) emission levels for increased hydrogen and HCNG flow rates. Further CRDi facilitated dual fuel engine showed improved engine performance compared to CMFIS as the former enabled high pressure (900 bar) injection of the RuOME and closer to TDC (Top Dead Centre) as well. Combustion parameters such as ignition delay, combustion duration, pressure-crank angle and heat release rates were analyzed and compared with baseline data generated. Combustion analysis showed that the rapid rate of burning of hydrogen and HCNG along with air mixtures increased due to presence of hydrogen in total and in partial combination with CNG which further resulted into higher cylinder pressures and energy release rates. However, sustained research that can provide feasible engine technology operating on such fuels in dual fuel operation can {{pave the way for}} continued fossil fuel usage...|$|R
