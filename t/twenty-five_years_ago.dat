In January 2006 in Las Vegas, Nevada, Doll Reader Magazine sponsored the IDEX Reborn Competition at the First International IDEX Reborn Convention. Doll Reader Magazine started publishing over <b>twenty-five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> It is now published nine times a year, keeps collectors informed on trends of modern-day doll collecting, and continues to sponsor the IDEX trade shows that feature reborn competitions and conventions. In the summer of 2008, ABC News followed a reborn convention in Illinois. ABC News was also in St. Louis, Missouri to attend the first annual Tiny Treasures Show held in 2008. The show features exhibitors, collectors, retailers, manufacturers, workshops, and contests for reborners. Reborn dolls {{can be found at}} doll fairs as well.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{wind and}} wave, tidal power is an {{inherently}} predictable source. However {{the technology is}} in its infancy and numerous devices are in the prototype stages. Today {{it is known that}} a tall tubular tower with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine, but <b>twenty-five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> there were a wide variety of different systems being tested. This is the current situation with regard to tidal power. Some systems capture energy from the tides in a vertical direction. The tide comes in and raises the water level in a basin. As the tide lowers the water in the basin is discharged through a turbine. Tidal stream power captures energy from the flow of tides, usually using underwater plant resembling a small wind turbine. An example is Marine Current Turbines SeaGen 1.2MW device at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, which is the largest tidal stream turbine in the world. To date the only two installed tidal power plants of notable size are the Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea and the Rance Tidal Power Station in Brittany, France, rated at 254 MW and 240 MW respectively. There are also many small scale projects throughout the world.|$|E

While total consumption has increased, the western economies are less reliant on oil than they were <b>twenty-five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> due both to substantial growth in productivity and the growth of sectors of the economy with little oil dependence such as finance and banking, retail, etc. The decline of heavy industry and manufacturing in most developed countries has reduced the amount of oil per unit GDP; however, since these items are imported anyway, there is less change in the oil dependence of industrialized countries than the direct consumption statistics indicate.|$|E

During these twenty-five years the fishermen of each State have naturally tried to take all they could get, and the two legislatures {{have never been able to}} agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree for the protection of the fisheries. At the moment the fishing on the Oregon side is practically closed, while there is no limit on the Washington side of any kind, and no one can tell what the courts will decide as to the very statutes under which this action and non-action result. Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle between the associated, or gill-net, fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river.|$|E

Despite this personal knowledge, Wallace relied on the American Psychiatric Association's categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness rather than his own experience in creating the episode. As recently as 1995, Wallace told an interviewer that he believed homosexuals could change their orientation if they really wanted to.|$|E

But the mother and the heir consented to give a joint promise to Dr. Robarts. Now, as the present incumbent was over seventy, and as the living was worth £900 a year, there could be no doubt as to the eligibility of the clerical profession. And I must further say, that the dowager and the doctor were justified in their choice by the life and principles of the young man--as far as any father can be justified in choosing such a profession for his son, and as far as any lay impropriator can be justified in making such a promise. Had Lady Lufton had a second son, that second son would probably have had the living, and no one would have thought it wrong;--certainly not if that second son had been such a one as Mark Robarts.|$|R

40|$|Man's {{effort to}} {{understand}} what we are made of {{is one of the}} greatest adventure stories of the human race. It dates to the beginning of recorded history. Science first flourished <b>twenty-five</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> with the quest of the early Greek philosophers for an underlying unity to the rich diversity observed in the world around them. They realized that the search for an under-standing of Nature at a fundamental level in terms of basic processes and con-stituents necessarily carried them beyond the sensory world of appearance. In his essay on Lucretius, George Santayana described the emergence of this idea I that "all we observe about us, and ourselves also, may be but passing forms of a permanent substance " as one of mankind's greatest thoughts, We now recognize it as the original search, in its most primitive form, for nature's conservation laws and elementary particles. However the early Greek metaphysicists predated by two millenia the modern scientific method with its insistence on experimental observation. In their inquiry they relied purely on rational analysis freed from the discipline of direct observational content. Not surprisingly, there-fore, they went off in widely differing directions in their studies- Leucippus and Democritus to the concept of indivisible atoms; Anaxagoras to the original bootstrap model of infinitely divisible seeds within seeds, each as complex as the whole; and Anaximander, Pythagoras, and Plato to more abstract mathematical I concepts of numbers and symmetries. On occasion since then scientists have arrogantly alleged that the end of this search for nature's basic building blocks is in sight. However such delusions have been short lived, especially in modern times, crumbling midst the debris emerging from increasingly powerful atom smashers.

In addition to the plethora of fictional characters who populate Jane's narrative, Jane and others make many references to historical events and figures over the close-to-a hundred years Miss Jane can recall.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (l. [80 - 82]). <b>Twenty-five</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> in The Laws, Plato described {{two types}} of doctor-patient relationships. In one type, which he called slave medicine, slave physicians took care of slave patients. The slave physician "never gives him any account of his complaints, nor asks him for any; he gives him some empirical injunction {{with an air of}} finished knowledge in the brusque fashion of a dictator and then is off in hot haste to the next ailing slave …” In contrast, is the "medicine befitting free men," in which the citizen physician "treats their disease by going into things thoroughly from the beginning in as scientific way and takes the patient and his family into confidence. Thus, he learns something from the sufferers [...] He does not give prescriptions until he has won the patient's support, and when he has done so, he steadily aims at producing complete restoration to health by persuading the sufferer into compliance. " In Lebanon at this time, we may be revisiting history and heading toward the widespread practice of slave medicine. The best caution against this is to maintain the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship. When physicians talk to their patients and, perhaps more important, when physicians listen and hear what their patients are trying to say, when physicians are caring, compassionate, and sensitive to their patients' needs, physicians are helping them - helping them not only to feel better, but do better. Not surprisingly, physician will find that he will feel better too. The good physician knows his patients through and through, and his knowledge is bought dearly. Time, sympathy, and understanding must be lavishly dispensed, but the reward {{is to be found in}} the personal bond that forms the greatest satisfaction with medical services delivered and ensures the optimal quality of medical services. 1 bound copy: vi, 82 leaves; ill., tables available at RNL...|$|R
