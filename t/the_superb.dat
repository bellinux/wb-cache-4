5|$|In his 1982 monograph, Schodde {{proposed}} a southern origin {{for the common}} ancestor of <b>the</b> <b>superb</b> and splendid fairywrens. At {{some time in the}} past it was split into southwestern (splendid) and southeastern (superb) enclaves. As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. In the east, <b>the</b> <b>superb</b> fairywren spread into Tasmania during a glacial period when the sea level was low and the island was connected {{with the rest of the}} continent via a land bridge. What gave rise to subspecies cyaneus became isolated as the sea levels rose. The Bass Strait forms were isolated from Tasmania but more recently and so their subspecific status was not maintained. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of <b>the</b> <b>superb</b> and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the white-shouldered, white-winged and red-backed fairywrens.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>superb</b> fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus), {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>superb</b> blue-wren or colloquially as the blue wren, is a {{passerine}} bird of the family Maluridae, common and familiar across southeastern Australia. The species is sedentary and territorial, also exhibiting {{a high degree of}} sexual dimorphism; the male in breeding plumage has a striking bright blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle, and tail, with a black mask and black or dark blue throat. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour; this gave the early impression that males were polygamous, as all dull-coloured birds were taken for females. Six subspecies groups are recognized: three larger and darker forms from Tasmania, Flinders and King Island respectively, and three smaller and paler forms from mainland Australia and Kangaroo Island.|$|E
5|$|In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde {{proposed}} a southern origin {{for the common}} ancestor of <b>the</b> <b>superb</b> and splendid fairywrens. At {{some time in the}} past it was split into southwestern (splendid) and southeastern (superb) enclaves. As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. These split into at least three enclaves which subsequently evolved in isolation in the following drier glacial periods until the current more favourable climate saw them expand once again and interbreed where they overlap. This suggests the original split was only very recent as the forms had insufficient time to speciate. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of <b>the</b> <b>superb</b> and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the white-shouldered, white-winged and red-backed fairywrens.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairy-wrens, <b>the</b> <b>superb</b> fairy-wren {{is notable}} for several {{peculiar}} behavioural characteristics; {{the birds are}} socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display.|$|E

5|$|Like other fairywrens, <b>the</b> <b>superb</b> fairywren is {{unrelated}} to the true wren.

More recently, DNA analysis has shown the Maluridae family to be related to the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), and the Pardalotidae (pardalotes, scrubwrens, thornbills, gerygones and allies) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.|$|E

5|$|Maitland showed Napoleon {{the great}} cabin, {{which he had}} placed at his disposal, {{and gave him a}} tour of his ship. At 10:30 a.m. <b>the</b> <b>Superb</b> {{anchored}} in the roadstead and Maitland went to make his report. Hotham approved of his arrangements, and agreed that Napoleon should be transported to England aboard the Bellerophon. He came aboard himself to meet the former Emperor, and a grand dinner was held in the great cabin, attended by Napoleon's retinue and British officers. The following day Napoleon visited Hotham on <b>the</b> <b>Superb,</b> and after his return, Maitland began the voyage to England in company with HMS Myrmidon. A routine was soon developed, with Napoleon usually taking a walk on deck around 5 p.m., followed by a formal dinner at 6 p.m. The sailors and officers removed their hats and kept their distance when Napoleon came on deck, only talking with him if he invited them to. The routine was broken slightly early in the morning of 23 July, when Napoleon appeared at dawn, as Bellerophon came in sight of Ushant, the last piece of French land visible {{for the remainder of the}} journey. He climbed up to the poop deck, attended by a midshipman, and spent the morning watching the coastline slowly recede from view. He was joined by members of his retinue, though he did not speak to any of them.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>superb</b> fairywren is a {{cooperative}} breeding species, with pairs {{or groups of}} 3–5 birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. The group consists of a social pair {{with one or more}} male or female helper birds that were hatched in the territory, though they may not necessarily be the offspring of the main pair. These birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young. Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover as well as engaging in mutual preening.|$|E
5|$|Like all fairywrens, <b>the</b> <b>superb</b> fairywren is {{an active}} and restless feeder, {{particularly}} on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. Movement {{is a series of}} jaunty hops and bounces, with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright, and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts. During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.|$|E
5|$|Seydlitz was {{generally}} admired for <b>the</b> <b>superb</b> coup d'œil {{that allowed him}} to utilize the cavalry to its full potential. His 19th century biographer, K. A. Varnhagen von Ense, related that Seydlitz lived above all for the service, and promoted the training of his hussars before all else. According to Anton König, who wrote in 17801790, Seydlitz performed best at taverns and excelled in practical jokes: one would gather that Seydlitz was a drunkard, a rake, and a savage, but another of his biographers, Bernhard von Poten, cited conflicting descriptions offered by Seydlitz's contemporaries, particularly Warnery, as more accurate. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to support König's assertion, at least of Seydlitz's excesses: Seydlitz was no doubt dependent upon his tobacco and had been since his teenage years, although he smoked a pipe rather than using snuff, as many officers did; he was indeed reckless, as his career testified; he enjoyed the company of women; and Seydlitz indeed suffered from recurring illness.|$|E

5|$|The male becomes broody {{after his}} mate starts laying, and {{may begin to}} {{incubate}} the eggs before the clutch is complete. From this time on, he does not eat, drink, or defecate, and stands only to turn the eggs, which he does about ten times a day. He develops a brood patch, a bare area of wrinkled skin which is in intimate contact with the eggs. Over {{the course of the}} eight-week incubation period, he will lose a third of his weight and will survive on stored body fat and on any morning dew that he can reach from the nest. As with many other Australian birds, such as <b>the</b> <b>superb</b> fairywren, infidelity is the norm for emus, despite the initial pair bond: once the male starts brooding, the female usually wanders off, and may mate with other males and lay in multiple nests; thus, as many as half the chicks in a brood may not be fathered by the incubating male, or even by either parent, as emus also exhibit brood parasitism.|$|E
5|$|The {{variegated}} fairywren {{was officially}} described by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, {{and was at}} first considered a colour variant of <b>the</b> <b>superb</b> fairywren. The scientific name commemorates the British collector Aylmer Bourke Lambert. It is one of 12 species of the genus Malurus, commonly known as fairywrens, found in Australia and lowland New Guinea. Within the genus it belongs {{to a group of}} four very similar species known collectively as the chestnut-shouldered fairywrens. The other three species are localised residents in restricted regions of Australia: the lovely fairywren (M. amabilis) of Cape York, the red-winged fairywren (M. elegans) of the southwest corner of Western Australia, and the blue-breasted fairywren (M. pulcherrimus) of southern Western Australia and the Eyre Peninsula. A 2011 analysis by Amy Driskell and colleagues of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found that the lovely fairywren was nested within the variegated fairywren complex, and was the sister taxon of the purple-backed subspecies assimilis.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{that of the}} pied currawong, {{the grey}} currawong's call does not sound like its name. It {{is best known for}} making a sound {{variously}} transcribed as p'rink, clink, cling, ker-link or tullock, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that it was like the kling of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the screech of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races versicolor and melanoptera are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of <b>the</b> <b>superb</b> lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.|$|E
