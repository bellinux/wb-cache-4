25|$|Many Mississippian {{ceramics}} {{are decorated}} by incising or engraving. Implements such as sticks, reeds, or bone fragments, were dragged through wet clay to incise it, {{or they were}} scratched into {{the surface of the}} dried but as yet unfired pieces to engrave. Sharpened reeds or fingernails were also used <b>to</b> <b>punch</b> small <b>marks.</b> Ornate designs and motifs are common decorative elements, which archaeologists use to track the spread of influences from one culture onto another culture. Many of the designs have symbolic meanings, usually associated with aspects of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex.|$|R

50|$|They are {{referred}} to as punch-marked coins or eldings. Similar coins have been unearthed throughout the island. Large numbers of such coins have been found in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka too but a study on regional varieties is yet <b>to</b> be done.These <b>punch</b> <b>marked</b> coins are usually in silver and have assorted combinations of symbols punched on them, Usually the reverse of the coin is blank. Stylistically these coins are similar to coins used in the Indian sub-continent during this period. A recent publication on these coins attempts to identify symbols peculiar to Sri Lanka. Some of the more popular symbols are Sun, Moon, elephant, bull, nandipada, fish and peacock. The diversity of symbols suggests that these coins have been issued by regional rulers or traders and not by a central monarchy.|$|R

50|$|In 1861 Sambourne was apprenticed to John Penn & Son, marine {{engineers}} of Greenwich. Initially {{he worked}} under the founder’s son, John Penn Jr but {{was moved to}} the drawing office when his employer discovered his aptitude for draft drawing. In his spare time Sambourne continued to draw caricatures and study the great graphic artists such as William Hogarth and Albrecht Dürer. One version Sambourne recounts into the events leading to his introduction <b>to</b> the <b>Punch's</b> editor <b>Mark</b> Lemon is that his friend and fellow employee at Penn’s, Alfred German Reed, showed one of his sketches to his father the theatrical impresario Thomas German Reed. At his son’s urging Thomas passed the drawing on to Mark Lemon. Lemon was sufficiently impressed by the sketch that he encouraged Sambourne to take art lessons and consult the engraver Joseph Swain about drawing on wood. Pleased with the results Lemon published a drawing by Sambourne in the 27 April 1867 issue of Punch. This was an initial letter 'T' showing the politician John Bright striking a quintain.|$|R

50|$|Coins: Silver <b>punch</b> <b>marked</b> coins are datable to {{a period}} between the 4th century BC and the 1st-2nd century AD. Some uninscribed copper cast coins have been found.

40|$|Scientific {{analyses}} of objects from Sösdala I are presented. <b>Punch</b> <b>marks</b> on 57 gilt silver mounts were examined under microscope, revealing {{a high quality}} of craftsmanship. In all, 27 different punched motifs have been described. By comparative studies, objects with <b>punch</b> <b>marks</b> made by the same tools have been identified. By interlinking the objects, three different sets of tools have been identified, plausibly representing three different craftsmen/workshops. One pendant is a loner of lower quality and probably a replacement. Trial <b>marks</b> are <b>punched</b> {{on the back of}} some objects and on others motifs are sketched. Analyses of a sample of 12 silver mounts revealed that the alloy consisted of 85 - 95 % silver. Some alloy variations support the grouping based on punch analysis. One object with niello inlays was mapped with SEM/EDS. The niello was shown to consist of pure silver sulphide according to Roman tradition, indicating the manufacturing date to {{before the end of the}} 5 th century AD...|$|R
50|$|The Mauryan coins were <b>punch</b> <b>marked</b> {{with the}} royal {{standard}} to ascertain their authenticity. The Arthashastra, written by Kautilya, mentions minting of coins but {{also indicates that}} the violation of the Imperial Maurya standards by private enterprises {{may have been an}} offence. Kautilya also seemed to advocate a theory of bimetallism for coinage, which involved the use of two metals, copper and silver, under one government.|$|R
