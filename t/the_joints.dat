5|$|Like {{those of}} most other non-avian theropods, Acrocanthosaurus forelimbs did not {{make contact with the}} ground and were not used for locomotion; instead they served a predatory function. The {{discovery}} of a complete forelimb (NCSM 14345) allowed the first analysis of the function and range of motion of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus. The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine how far <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> could move without dislocating. In many of <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> the bones did not fit together exactly, indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> as is seen in many living archosaurs. Among other findings, the study suggested that, in a resting position, the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backwards slightly, the elbow bent, and the claws facing medially (inwards).|$|E

5|$|Four months later, in May 2005, {{a second}} spike {{had to be}} cut off by firefighters after it was {{discovered}} hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result, some of <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> were re-welded, with equipment {{put in place to}} prevent excessive movement. This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 70% of the spikes' weights.|$|E

5|$|In {{applying}} a technique during training, {{it is the}} responsibility of tori to prevent injury to uke by employing a speed and force of application that is commensurate with their partner's proficiency in ukemi. Injuries (especially those to <b>the</b> <b>joints),</b> when they do occur in aikido, are often the result of tori misjudging the ability of uke to receive the throw or pin.|$|E
5|$|In rare cases, beagles {{may develop}} immune {{mediated}} polygenic arthritis (where {{the immune system}} attacks <b>the</b> <b>joints)</b> even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.|$|E
5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body. The terminology used describes this motion according to its direction relative to the anatomical position of <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> Anatomists use a unified set of terms to describe most of the movements, although other, more specialized terms are necessary for describing {{the uniqueness of the}} movements such as those of the hands, feet, and eyes.|$|E

5|$|The fruit bodies contain unique {{chemical}} compounds that {{are derived from}} phenylpropanoids. The compounds, named squarrosidine and pinillidine, inhibit the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase catalyzes the crystallization of uric acid in <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> a main cause of gouty arthritis, and inhibitors of this enzyme are being used clinically to reduce this side effect. The natural function of these compounds may be to quench reactive oxygen species produced by plants as a defensive response to fungal infection.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the strengthening technique for interior reinforced concrete beam-column joint based on <b>joint</b> expansion concept. <b>The</b> beam-column <b>joint</b> is expanded two-dimensionally by cast-in-situ concrete around {{the corners of}} <b>the</b> <b>joint.</b> Experiment has been conducted on interior beam-column specimens with expanded joint zone. Experimental results demonstrate a good performance of this method to upgrade <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> shear strength, energy dissipation and ductility. It {{has been found that}} by increasing <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> size, <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> shear failure can be prevented. <b>The</b> <b>joint</b> expansion is shown to reduce <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> shear stress. This method is effective to change failure mode from brittle joint shear failure to flexural failure in beams...|$|R
30|$|Joint seal damage: This {{results from}} joint deterioration, {{enabling}} {{a significant amount}} of water to infiltrate into <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> from <b>the</b> surface, weed growth at <b>the</b> <b>joint,</b> or intrusion of particles into <b>the</b> <b>joint.</b> It may lead to development of closely spaced transverse cracks or large numbers of interconnected cracks near <b>the</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|R
5|$|The tegula (Greek solenes) was a plain flat tile, or a flat tile with raised edges, {{which was}} laid flat upon the roof, while the imbrex (Greek kalupter) was a semi-cylindrical roofing tile, like a half-pipe, laid over <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> between the tegulae.

5|$|BuroHappold's early {{projects}} {{ranged from}} designing giant fabric umbrellas for Pink Floyd concerts to the Munich Aviary and the Mannheim Multihalle, both with Frei Otto, an architect who repeatedly worked with Buro Happold on projects which pioneered lightweight structures. The Mannheim Multihalle was a timber gridshell of 50 by 50mm lathes of hemlock of irregular form, {{depending on the}} elasticity of spring washers at <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> for its flexible form. It {{was one of the}} first major uses of structural gridshells.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the century, {{the many}} repairs {{undertaken}} since the memorial's construction had left a patchwork of materials and colours, and a disconcerting pattern of damage from water intrusion at <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> In May 2001, the Government of Canada announced the Canadian Battlefield Memorials Restoration Project, a major C$30million restoration project to restore Canada's memorial sites in France and Belgium, in order to maintain and present them in a respectful and dignified manner. In 2005, the Vimy memorial closed for major restoration work. Veterans Affairs Canada directed the restoration of the memorial in cooperation with other Canadian departments, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, consultants and specialists in military history.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) {{occurs when}} gas, {{which has been}} breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the body tissues, forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system, paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers. The table below classifies the effects by affected organ and bubble location.|$|E
5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E
5|$|Ingestion of {{metallic}} lead, such {{as small}} lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels {{and can be}} fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. Ceramic glaze often contains lead, and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. People who eat animals hunted with lead bullets {{may be at risk}} for lead exposure. Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but bullets lodged in <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.|$|E

5|$|The {{dimensions}} of a Book of the Dead could vary widely; the longest is 40m long while some are {{as short as}} 1m. They are composed of sheets of papyrus joined together, the individual papyri varying in width from 15cm to 45cm. The scribes working on Book of the Dead papyri took more care over their work than those working on more mundane texts; care was taken to frame the text within margins, and to avoid writing on <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> between sheets. The words peret em heru, or 'coming forth by day' sometimes appear on the reverse of the outer margin, perhaps acting as a label.|$|E
5|$|The {{spandrel}} {{plates were}} welded to the columns {{to create the}} modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop. The modular pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors. Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them {{to work together in}} resisting lateral loads. <b>The</b> <b>joints</b> between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E
