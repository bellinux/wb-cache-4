[...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Shaunna Murphy was confused as to why Ashley and Sean received a happy ending, wondering that because of the accepted mythology of the curse, [...] "aren't people supposed to have happy endings in Fairy Tale, and miserable lives over in Storybrooke?" [...] The episode also made Murphy appreciate the [...] "bold and bright" [...] Snow White, when compared to Cinderella's naive agreement with Rumpelstiltskin. TV Fanatic writer Christine Orlando was not shocked by the affair, but was surprised that [...] "Emma fell into Mr. Gold's clutches so easily."

[...] She said it didn't offer [...] "major sensations" [...] and found it similar to Christina Aguilera’s [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] (2010). Greenblatt was also disappointed with the song's rhyming in the lines, [...] "I'm not here to sell ya' / Or <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go to hell". Sonya Sorich of Ledger-Enquirer said that while she anticipated some negative reception, [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was also a prime candidate for a guilty pleasure dance track." [...] Heather Phares of Allmusic referred to [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] as [...] "stomping" [...] and selected {{it as one of}} the album's best. Fraser McAlpine of BBC said that though the song has strong sexual undercurrents, Cyrus maintained classy throughout the track [...] [...] "If Miley's gonna weather the Ensexification Moment it'll be because she's doing it during a period of extrema GaGa, when videos are less about acreage of flesh and more about feathers and Victorian scientists. Oh, and because she's got the songs and the voice, that always helps", McAlpine concluded.|$|E

2500|$|Command {{hallucinations}} {{are sometimes}} used {{in defense of}} a crime, often homicides. In essence, it is a voice that one hears and it tells the listener what to do.

[...] Whether it is a command for something simple or something that is a threat, it is still considered a [...] "command hallucination." [...] Some helpful questions that can assist one in figuring out if he/she may be suffering from this include: [...] "What are the voices <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do?", [...] "When did your voices first start <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do things?", [...] "Do you recognize {{the person who is}} <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> harm yourself (or others)?", [...] "Do you think you can resist doing what the voices are <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do?" ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{clash between}} order and chaos, {{and the people}} caught in between, plays an {{important}} role in Babylon 5. The conflict between two unimaginably powerful older races, the Vorlons and the Shadows, is represented as a battle between two competing ideologies, each seeking to turn the humans and the other younger races to their beliefs. The Vorlons represent an authoritarian philosophy: you will do what we <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to,</b> because we <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do it. The Vorlon question, [...] "Who are you?" [...] focuses on identity as a catalyst for shaping personal goals; the intention is not to solicit a correct answer, but to [...] "tear down the artifices we construct around ourselves until we're left facing ourselves, not our roles." [...] The Shadows represent another authoritarian philosophy cloaked in a disguise of evolution through fire (as shown in the episode in which Sheridan goes to Z'ha'dum and when he refuses to cooperate, Justin tells him: [...] "But we do what we're told... and so will you!"), of sowing the seeds of conflict in order to engender progress. The question the Shadows ask is [...] "What do you want?" [...] In contrast to the Vorlons, they place personal desire and ambition first, using it to shape identity, encouraging conflict between groups who choose to serve their own glory or profit. The representation of order and chaos was informed by the Babylonian myth that the universe was born in the conflict between both. The climax of this conflict comes with the younger races' exposing of the Vorlons' and the Shadows' [...] "true faces" [...] and the rejection of both philosophies, heralding the dawn of a new age without their interference.|$|E

When {{asked in}} 2011 {{where she would}} like her storyline to go, Tylo said: [...] "I think we should see Thorne and Taylor get strong and stand up to these people who mowed them down." [...] In March 2012, Tylo said that Taylor is finally {{learning}} to pursue what she wants instead of always putting others first. She said, [...] "In psychology, they <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be true to yourself. Maybe she is finally doing that, even though in her moral compass she knows {{that it is better}} to put other people first. She has been going after what she wants instead. It is a very good growing place for Taylor to go back to reality and realize that she is not perfect and that she needs to try not looking so perfect so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Verdi had {{received}} a synopsis of the opera from Cammarano, the subject of which was not his. [...] But, as Budden notes, Verdi adopted a somewhat passive attitude, impressed as he was at being {{able to work with}} this librettist. In a letter of 23 February 1845, Verdi had expressed his optimism that [...] "Voltaire's tragedy will become an excellent melodrama," [...] with the added hope that if the librettist would [...] "put some passion into your libretto" [...] and that he, Verdi, would write music to match. In their early correspondence, it appears that Cammarano had already sent some sample verses because Verdi's 23 February letter also contained his enthusiasm for receiving more: [...] "I beg you to send me promptly some more verses. It's not necessary for me to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> keep it short. You know the theatre better than I do." [...] It is quite clear that Verdi's characteristic requirement for brevity appeared this early on in his career.|$|E

2500|$|The {{remodeling}} bills came to $8 million, {{which the}} Helmsleys were loath to pay. A group of contractors sued the Helmsleys for non-payment; the Helmsleys eventually paid {{off most of}} the debt owed to the contractors. In 1985, during those proceedings, the contractors revealed that most of their work was being illegally billed to the Helmsleys' hotels as business expenses. The contractors sent a stack of the falsified invoices to the New York Post {{to prove that the}} Helmsleys were trying to avoid tax liabilities. The resulting Post story led to a federal criminal investigation. Also, Jeremiah McCarthy, the Helmsleys' executive engineer, alleged that Leona repeatedly demanded that he sign invoices to bill personal expenses to the Helmsley company and, when McCarthy declined to do so, Helmsley exploded with tyrannical outbursts, shouting, [...] "You're not my fucking partner! You'll sign what I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> sign." [...] In 1988, then United States Attorney Rudy Giuliani indicted the Helmsleys and two of their associates on several tax-related charges, as well as extortion.|$|E
2500|$|Haile Selassie visited Jamaica on 21 April 1966, and {{approximately}} {{one hundred thousand}} Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on Palisadoes Airport in Kingston, having heard that the man whom they considered to be their messiah was coming to visit them. Spliffs and chalices were openly smoked, causing [...] "a haze of ganja smoke" [...] to drift through the air. Haile Selassie arrived at the airport {{but was unable to}} come down the mobile steps of the airplane, as the crowd rushed the tarmac. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally, Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras Mortimer Planno, a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the emperor's descent. Planno re-emerged and announced to the crowd: [...] "The Emperor has instructed me to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be calm. Step back and let the Emperor land". This day is widely held by scholars to be a major turning point for the movement, and it is still commemorated by Rastafari as Grounation Day, the anniversary of which is celebrated as the second holiest holiday after 2 November, the emperor's Coronation Day.|$|E

But we're dealing with serious issues here; we need solutions, which I offer almost every night. I don't want ad hominem attacks. Take The New York Times columnist Frank Rich and Jon Stewart; I criticize Obama, so both of them seize on the urban legend that I recommended Bear Stearns the week before it collapsed, when I simply told an e-mailer that the deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe. 'Your money is safe in Bear Stearns,'" [...] Cramer repeated, referring to his own quote during a March 11, 2008 segment of Mad Money. Moreover, Cramer outlined, [...] "But through a clever sound bite, Stewart, and subsequently Rich—neither of whom have bothered {{to listen to the}} context of the pulled quote—pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, I would tell you that the common stock might be worthless, but I would never <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> pull your money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency.

2500|$|Evans played Shakespeare's Cleopatra for {{the last}} time in 1946–47, in her late fifties. Her {{performance}} divided the critics: opinions varied from [...] "an agonising disaster" [...] to [...] "a joy to watch". Kenneth Tynan said, [...] "Lady Bracknell has been involved in a low Alexandrian scandal". Evans had never been classically good looking, but she was a great enough actress to [...] "convey beauty without being conventionally beautiful". What troubled many, including Agate and Gielgud, about her Cleopatra and other tragic heroines was not her appearance but a sense that tragedy came less naturally to her than comedy. Some of the great Shakespearian tragic roles she constantly refused to play, notably Lady Macbeth. She told Gielgud, [...] "I could never impersonate a woman who had such a peculiar notion of hospitality", which he took to mean that she could not contemplate the character's [...] "explicit admission of evil". Evans once remarked, [...] "I don't think there is anything extraordinary about me except this passion for the truth", a passion revered by Gielgud and others, but one that prevented her from attempting a character whose essence she could not understand. She said to Shaw that she had been asked to play Volumnia in Coriolanus, but [...] "isn't she a bloodthirsty old harridan? I could never play her." [...] This did not mean that she had to like the characters she played, but she had to understand them. When she first read through the role of Lady Bracknell with Gielgud she commented, [...] "I know those sort of women. They ring the bell and <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> put a lump of coal on the fire." ...|$|E
