40|$|Based on {{detailed}} steady-state {{system and}} component modeling, {{we developed a}} rooftop unit system design, which is able to achieve IEER (Integrated Energy Efficiency Ratio) higher than 20. We modeled fin- 2 ̆ 6 -tube and microchannel heat exchangers using segment-to-segment approach, and use ARI 10 -coefficient compressor map to simulate compressor performance. The system modeling {{is based on a}} component-based modeling approach, which facilitates flexible simulation of complicated system configurations. Starting with a baseline system having IEER of 16. 6, we extensively investigated numerous technical options, i. e. varying compressor sizes, heat exchanger fin densities, fin- 2 ̆ 6 -tube or micro-channel heat exchanger, suction line heat exchanger, desiccant wheel, <b>tandem</b> <b>compressor,</b> variable-speed compressor, and condenser evaporative pre-cooling; and developed an innovative system configuration combining a tandem compression system with a variable-speed compression system. The combined system can achieve high IEER as well as process the outdoor ventilation air over an extensive range. We successfully evaluated the design concept for a 20 -ton (70. 4 kW) unit as well as a 10 -ton (35. 2 kW) unit. All the selected components are readily accessible on the market, and we validated the performance predictions against existing Rooftop Unit (RTU) products at the rating condition. This paper illustrates a potentially cost-effective high IEER RTU design...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of modern axial compressors has already reached a high level. Therefore an {{enlargement of the}} design space by means of new or advanced aerodynamic methods is {{necessary in order to}} achieve further enhancements of performance and efficiency. The tandem arrangement of profiles in a transonic compressor blade row is such a method. For an efficient industrial application the knowledge of the fundamental design principles is needed. This paper presents the recent research work on transonic <b>compressor</b> <b>tandem</b> profiles at DLR Institute of Propulsion Technology. It deals with the fundamental description of the operation principles of a modern transonic <b>compressor</b> <b>tandem</b> cascade.

40|$|The flow {{characteristics}} of several <b>tandem</b> bladed <b>compressor</b> stators were analytically evaluated over {{a range of}} inlet incidence angles. The ratios of rear-segment to front-segment chord and camber were varied. Results were also compared to the analytical performance of a reference solid blade section. All tandem blade sections exhibited lower calculated losses than the solid stator. But no one geometric configuration exhibited clearly superior characteristics. The front segment accepts the major effect of overall incidence angle change. Rear- to front-segment camber ratios of 4 and greater appeared to be limited by boundary-layer separation from the pressure surface of the rear segment...|$|R
40|$|An {{adaptive}} controller {{for single}} and uneven <b>tandem</b> scroll <b>compressor,</b> packaged air-cooled water chillers is described. The designed controller allows to substantially increase the energy {{performance of the}} system, {{as well as to}} achieve excellent regulation performances in process applications. The controller parameters are adapted on the basis of estimates of the plant thermal load, that are computed by using a Kalman filter. An ad hoc approach is used to define a relay control logic, which is based on a numerical optimization procedure. To support controller design, a detailed simulation environment is developed and validated on an experimental facility. Performance of the algorithm is described with both simulation and experimental data. At low part load ratio values the proposed algorithm grants a 0. 6 e 0. 7 K improvement in the regulation performance in terms of supply water temperature standard deviation and mean supply water temperature deviation. The unit energy efficiency improvement with respect to supply water temperature control varies from 7. 3 % to 3. 0 % while the experimental seasonal energy efficiency rating improvement is 9. 1 %...|$|R
40|$|Air {{conditioning}} and refrigeration systems {{are designed to}} meet the load at some particular design conditions. At off-design conditions, the compressor is either cycled or a variable speed drive enables the compressor to run at a speed that matches the load. However, cycling can incur efficiency losses as large as 10 - 20 % of total compressor power. Similarly, the variable speed compressors suffer from an efficiency penalty {{as a result of the}} losses in the inverter drive (4 - 6 %). Part 1 of this report focuses on the use of <b>tandem</b> <b>compressors,</b> that is, a combination of two or more compressors running in parallel with each other, to more closely match the load at different conditions. Simulation models were run for various operating conditions and the results from the tandem simulations were compared with the single speed and the variable speed compressor results, showing a significant COP over the single speed case and a smaller improvement over the variable speed case. Temperature data from Pittsburgh and Dallas was then incorporated, and the optimum compressor sizing and operating strategies were compared. Results again showed a COP gain of 7. 5 % and 6. 2 % for the two cities, respectively, over the case of a single-speed compressor, and 2. 2 % and 2. 0 % compared to a variable-speed compressor. Part 2 focuses on vapor injection in case of scroll compressors used in air-{{conditioning and}} refrigeration applications. Vapor injection alters the normal refrigeration cycle by adding an injection port to the scroll compressor. After partial expansion upstream of the evaporator, refrigerant vapor is injected into the compressor. It saves compressor energy because that fraction of the flow needs only partial compression, and saves compressor volume because less vapor enters the suction port and the refrigerating effect increases due to the lower inlet quality. Simulation models were run for different operating conditions and it was discovered that for systems sized to meet the same design load, the VI systems had a higher COP of around 8 - 10 %, for air-conditioning applications. Similarly for the refrigeration case, the VI system registered a COP increase of as much 16 %. VI systems also helped in reducing the compressor displacement by around 25 % in the air-conditioning and 30 % in the refrigeration case respectively.

The rarity and intactness {{of the surviving}} plant surpasses any other mining place recorded in Queensland. The rare plant includes a Harkness compressor (possibly the only Harkness product surviving in Australia), a Horwood compressor (the only known intact item) and a very early and rare 1878 Marshall portable steam engine in good condition.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{description}} of the fundamental operation principles of a modern high e�cient subsonic <b>compressor</b> <b>tandem</b> cascade. Design recommendations are developed by considering these principles and based on an optimization database with more than 1900 tandem geometries. Therefore, one essential part of the investigation presented is the definition of a highly loaded outlet guide vane application and the design of subsonic tandem cascades by means of an advanced optimization procedure. As boundary conditions for the optimization an inlet Mach number of 0. 5 as well as three operating points are defined in order to ensure a maximum working range of 15 deg. Furthermore, three objective functions are used, which are focused on the minimization of the losses at the three operating points and the enhancement of the cascade performance in terms of pressure rise. Afterwards, the optimization database was analyzed in detail with respect to the correlation between the aerodynamic performance parameters and the geometrical parameters of the subsonic tandem cascade. This analysis shows, that there is only a small range of optimal subsonic tandem geometries {{for a wide range of}} performance requirements...|$|R
40|$|A new air-source {{heat pump}} {{technology}} optimized for cold climates {{was designed and}} fabricated by the authors in close cooperation with three industrial partners. The constructed unit will undergo a field demonstration in a military barrack to identify heat pumps as cost effective systems that have less primary energy consumption when compared to traditional cold climate heating methods. A simulation model developed in EES predicted the designed heat pump performance at different ambient conditions. The EES results were incorporated with a TRNSYS model to couple the military barrack building load with the available heat pump capacity using weather data. The TRNSYS model enables {{the assessment of the}} field demonstration performance during the heating season. The heat pump design is based on two-stage compression with economizing. Commercially available components were selected for all parts of the heat pump. A variable-speed scroll compressor is used as the high-stage compressor matched with a <b>tandem</b> fixed-speed scroll <b>compressor</b> used as the low-stage compressor. The configuration has a predicted capacity of 18. 34 kW (62, 580 BTU/h) at the design ambient temperature of - 20 oC (4 oF) based on the EES simulation results. The building has a heating load of less than 18 kW for more than 95 % of the heating season that lasts 8 months out of the year. The heat pump design therefore is predicted to satisfy the building heating load for the entire heating season. The heating season COP based on TRNSYS hourly simulation results is 3. 67 with a yearly heating capacity of 30, 970 kWh (105, 674 kBTU) and 8, 438. 37 kWh (28, 793 kBTU). The CCHP simulations predict over 30 % savings in primary energy and CO 2 emissions with a 25 % cost savings for annual heating energy use compared to an 85 % AFUE natural gas furnace...|$|R
