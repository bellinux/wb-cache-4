5|$|The Hume-Campbells had no children, and {{the house}} {{eventually}} passed to the Warrender family in 1894, who, as <b>the</b> <b>grandchildren</b> of Sir Hugh from his first marriage, were the next of kin. Brother and sister Hugh and Eleanor Warrender shared the house and were friends with Jenny Churchill, {{the mother of the}} future British prime minister Winston Churchill. He stayed at the house for his honeymoon in the early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|The {{adults in}} the {{community}} are considered semi-speakers as they have a passive understanding of Wagiman and generally only know a few basic words. Their children, <b>the</b> <b>grandchildren</b> of the elders, understand very little Wagiman and speak none. Apart from Mayali, Kriol, a creole language based on the vocabulary of English, is the lingua franca of the area. All members of the Wagiman ethnic group, {{as well as all}} other ethnic groups represented in the area, are native speakers of a moderate grade of Kriol.|$|E
50|$|In law, ayel, {{also known}} as ayle, aiel, or de avo, is a writ where a grandfather, being seized on his demesne {{on the day of}} his death, a {{stranger}} enters the same day, and dispossesses the rightful heir, <b>the</b> <b>grandchild.</b> <b>The</b> writ allowed <b>the</b> <b>grandchild</b> to oust <b>the</b> stranger.|$|R

5|$|Goofus and Gallant {{was created}} by Garry Cleveland Myers and was first {{featured}} in the magazine Children's Activities in 1940. According to family legend, <b>the</b> <b>grandchildren</b> of Myers and his wife Caroline, Kent Brown and Garry Cleveland Myers III, inspired the characters Goofus and Gallant respectively. At first, the comic's characters were depicted as elves. In 1946, when the Myerses founded Highlights for Children, they brought Goofus and Gallant {{with them to the}} new magazine. By the 1950s, the strip's art style changed and Goofus and Gallant turned from elves to human boys. Throughout Goofus and Gallants history, numerous artists have drawn for the strip, including Marion Hull Hammel, who illustrated the strip for 32 years beginning in the early 1950s.|$|E
25|$|In 1769 <b>the</b> <b>grandchildren</b> of Samson Wertheimer {{secured the}} {{donation}} of 150,000 florins, and Wolf's heirs added thereto 40,000 florins, in compensation for unpaid interest. These two foundations at Vienna and Jerusalem still keep alive {{the name of}} Wertheimer.|$|E

25|$|Soon after {{descriptions}} of concentration camp syndrome (also known as survivor syndrome) appeared, clinicians observed in 1966 that {{large numbers of}} children of Holocaust survivors were seeking treatment in clinics in Canada. <b>The</b> <b>grandchildren</b> of Holocaust survivors were overrepresented by 300% among the referrals to a child psychiatry clinic in comparison with their representation in the general population.|$|E

25|$|Lowell {{was born}} on December 13, 1856, in Boston, Massachusetts, the second son of Augustus Lowell and Katherine Bigelow Lowell. A member of the Brahmin Lowell family, his {{siblings}} included the poet Amy Lowell, the astronomer Percival Lowell, and Elizabeth Lowell Putnam, an early activist for prenatal care. They were the great-grandchildren of John Lowell and, on their mother's side, <b>the</b> <b>grandchildren</b> of Abbott Lawrence.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1648, some ministers {{proposed}} what {{would later become}} known as the Half-Way Covenant. This would allow <b>the</b> <b>grandchildren</b> of church members to be baptized as long as their parents accepted their congregation's covenant and lived Christian lives. Richard Mather and Thomas Shepard were early supporters of the change. In 1657, a meeting of ministers at Boston formally endorsed the Half-Way Covenant. In 1662, a synod of lay and clerical representatives also endorsed the Half-Way Covenant.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that during his rule, Banda accumulated at least US$320million in personal assets, thought to be invested in everything from agriculture to mining interests in South Africa. The most controversial {{part of this is}} the suspicion that his two grandchildren, who currently reside in the US and South Africa, are the heirs to the Banda fortune. One of <b>the</b> <b>grandchildren</b> graduated from law school and left for the US, while the other remains in South Africa.|$|E

25|$|In the Överkalix study, {{paternal}} (but not maternal) grandsons of Swedish men {{who were}} exposed during preadolescence to famine in the 19th century {{were less likely to}} die of cardiovascular disease. If food was plentiful, then diabetes mortality in <b>the</b> <b>grandchildren</b> increased, suggesting that this was a transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. The opposite effect was observed for females—the paternal (but not maternal) granddaughters of women who experienced famine while in the womb (and therefore while their eggs were being formed) lived shorter lives on average.|$|E
25|$|Central to {{the theory}} is that Akhenaten was being driven to produce a male heir which results in {{attempts}} to father his own grandchildren. If <b>the</b> <b>grandchildren</b> are not his or are indeed fictitious, with no progression through his daughters to arrive at Neferneferuaten-tasherit, his choice of her as coregent at least remains a mystery, if not less likely. Without grandchildren, there is less to support the older age estimates. Her age alone need not disqualify her since is the same age at which Tutankhaten ascended the throne, but a 10-year-old girl seems unlikely to many.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} also looks at DES {{in the third}} generation. These are <b>the</b> <b>grandchildren</b> of women who were given DES during pregnancy and whose mother or father was therefore exposed to DES in utero. Studies of the third generation are important because DES might be associated with epigenetic changes, which involve changes to the way genes behave (not involving the DNA itself) that may be heritable {{from one generation to}} another. If epigenetic changes occur and are heritable, studies of the DES-exposed third generation have implications for the influence of environmental endocrine disruptors on human health and evolution.|$|E

25|$|Dynasty trust (also {{known as}} a generation-skipping trust): A type of trust in which assets are passed down to the grantor's grand{{children}}, not the grantor's children. The children of the grantor never take title to the assets. This allows the grantor to avoid the estate taxes that would apply if the assets were transferred {{to his or her}} children first. Generation-skipping trusts can still be used to provide financial benefits to a grantor's children, however, because any income generated by the trust's assets can be made accessible to the grantor's children while still leaving the assets in trust for <b>the</b> <b>grandchildren.</b>|$|E
25|$|Anioma social {{structure}} {{is dominated by}} the use of lineages which are based loosely on the concept of uno, eboh', and idumu, which are major blood lineages; while ogbe and obodo are open and much more political. Uno is a small family unit comprising husband, wife, and children. The next lineage was Eboh, which includes the primary or nuclear family, the daughter or son in law, and the grandparents and <b>the</b> <b>grandchildren.</b> The Ogbe is a large structure which allowed non-blood relatives; it comprises the Idumu and some outsiders and it is best classified as a quarter in terms of demographics. The maximal concept is one that looks like a small town; this is the Obodo.|$|E
25|$|Qing forces {{captured}} <b>the</b> <b>grandchildren</b> {{and sons}} of Yaqub Beg after his death. Aisan Ahung was among his grandson, while the sons who were captured were K'ati Kuli, Yima Kuli, and Maiti Kuli. Yakuub Beg's 4 wives, 2 granddaughters, 2 grandsons and 4 sons fell into Qing hands. 5 year old Aisan Ahung, six year old K'ati Kuli, 10 year old Yima Kuli, and 14 year old Maiti Kuli {{were sent to}} Lanzhou jail. A disinterment of the graves and incineration of Ishana Beg's and his father Yaqub's Beg's corpses {{took place at the}} orders of the Qing. China crushed an attempted revolt by Hakim Khan Tufl. Beijing received Yaqub Beg's cremated remains.|$|E
