5|$|During {{and after}} the debates over church government, the Assembly framed other {{documents}} which did not cause open rifts. <b>The</b> <b>Directory</b> for Public Worship, which was to replace the Book of Common Prayer, was swiftly written in 1644 and passed by Parliament on 3January 1645. <b>The</b> <b>Directory,</b> accepted by the Scots as well, took a middle course between the presbyterians and congregationalists. The presbyterians {{for the most part}} preferred a fixed liturgy while congregationalists favoured extemporaneous prayer. <b>The</b> <b>Directory</b> consisted of an order for services with sample prayers. The Assembly also recommended a psalter, translated by Francis Rous for use in worship.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Peninsula was not {{the only}} region from which Napoleon took art. Under <b>the</b> <b>Directory</b> {{government}} of the 1790s, Napoleon (then a General) led an expedition to Egypt. The campaign was an expansionist {{effort on the part of}} the government, but <b>the</b> <b>Directory</b> had another goal to make Paris the center of art, science, and culture. <b>The</b> <b>Directory</b> wanted France to assume responsibility for liberating the works of art they deemed in danger in order to protect and nationalize the heritage and culture of their subjects. As a result, there were teams of artists and scientists who accompanied the armies into battle equipped with lists of paintings, sculptures, and other pieces of patrimony that would be collected, crated, and shipped back to France.|$|E

5|$|Toward this end, in {{the early}} November 1798, Jourdan arrived in Hüningen, near the Swiss city of Basel, to take command of the Army of Observation, {{so-called}} because its function was to observe {{the security of the}} French border on the Rhine. Once there, Jourdan assessed the quality and disposition of the forces and identified needed supplies and manpower. He found the army woefully inadequate for its assignment. The Army, and its flanking armies, the Army of Helvetia (Switzerland) and the Army of Mayence, were equally short of manpower, supplies, ammunition, and training. Jourdan documented assiduously these shortages, pointing out in lengthy correspondence to <b>the</b> <b>Directory</b> the consequences of an under-manned and under-supplied army; his petitions seemed to have little effect on <b>the</b> <b>Directory,</b> which sent neither significant additional manpower nor supplies.|$|E

5|$|After Sercey {{returned}} to Île de France his squadron broke up. Four ships were {{sent back to}} France in 1797 and 1798 as Île de France could no longer supply repairs, manpower or provisions in support of Sercey. This dispersal of the squadron was encouraged by the Colonial Assembly of Île de France and Governor Malartic neither of whom were well-disposed to <b>the</b> <b>Directory</b> then ruling France. With his remaining crews becoming rebellious, Sercey sent Forte and Prudente on a commerce raiding operation during the autumn of 1798, during which they achieved some success in the Bay of Bengal. By the time this force {{returned to}} Île de France Sercey had sailed to Batavia, leaving instructions for Forte and Prudente to follow him. Malartic countermanded this order, seizing Prudente and selling the frigate to a privateer concern and ordering Forte to operate independently in the Bay of Bengal {{in the autumn of}} 1798. Sercey was furious, but could do nothing to alter Malartic's arrangements.|$|E
5|$|After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), many Poles {{believed}} that revolutionary France, whose public opinion was very {{sympathetic to the}} ideals of the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, would come to Poland's aid. France's enemies included Poland's partitioners, Prussia, Austria and Imperial Russia. Paris was the seat of two Polish organizations laying the claim to be the Polish government-in-exile, the Deputation (Deputacja) of Franciszek Ksawery Dmochowski and the Agency (Agencja) of Józef Wybicki. Many Polish soldiers, officers and volunteers therefore emigrated, especially to Italy and to France. Eventually, the Agency was successful in convincing the French government (<b>the</b> <b>Directory)</b> to organize a Polish military unit. As the French Constitution did not allow for the employment of foreign troops on French soil, the French decided to use the Poles to bolster their allies in Italy, the Cisalpine Republic.|$|E

In an effort to disguise his force's intentions, he first anchored in Camaret Bay and issued orders for his ships to pass through the Raz de Sein. The Raz was a dangerous narrow channel littered with rocks and sandbanks and subject to heavy surf during bad weather, but would also obscure the size, strength and direction of the French fleet from the British squadron offshore, which French scouts claimed consisted of 30 ships.|$|E
