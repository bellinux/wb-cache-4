5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. <b>The</b> <b>tires</b> posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. <b>The</b> <b>tires</b> then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass does move slightly to the left when the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, and the bike leans to the left in response. The action, in space, would have <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> move right, but this is prevented by friction between <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} left. This is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E
5|$|The 20-year-old newlywed {{was last}} seen at the Sawgrass Mills Mall where she worked at a {{sporting}} goods store. When she did not return home her husband went to the mall and found her car, a 1985 Ford Tempo, with <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> slashed. It is believed that Chandler, after scoping out the victim {{over a couple of}} days, slashed <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> and showed up {{in the guise of a}} good samaritan and offered to help. Three hours after she was reported missing, her body was found under a residential mailbox, in a local neighborhood, by two men returning from a fishing trip.|$|E
50|$|Higher volume {{producers}} typically utilize specialized {{tire and}} wheel mounting and inflation equipment which is partially or fully automated. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> size, machines {{may be a}} single station or multistation. In these machines, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is inflated using high volume, high pressure compressed air that flows into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> around <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> bead rather than through the valve stem. When <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> has achieved <b>the</b> desired inflation pressure, the machine's inflation head moves away from <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and <b>the</b> inflation process is completed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> earth-rammed <b>tires</b> of an Earthship are {{assembled}} by teams of two people. One person shovels dirt {{and places it}} into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> one scoop at a time. The other person, who stands on <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> uses a sledgehammer to pack the dirt in while moving {{in a circle around}} <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to keep <b>the</b> dirt even and to avoid warping <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
50|$|RFV {{can best}} be {{explained}} by example. Assume a perfectly uniform tire mounted on a perfectly round wheel loaded with a constant force against a perfectly round test wheel. As the wheel turns, it turns <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> carcass undergoes repeated deformation and recovery as it enters and exits the contact area. If we measure the radial force between <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and <b>the</b> wheel we will see zero change as <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> turns. If we now test a typical production tire we will see the radial force vary as <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> turns. This variation will be induced by two primary mechanisms, variation in the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and variation in the elastomeric properties of <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{rear wheel}} is {{prevented}} from precessing {{as the front}} wheel does by friction of <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> on the ground, and so continues to lean {{as though it were}} not spinning at all. Hence gyroscopic forces do not provide any resistance to tipping.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Meijaard, et al., {{published}} the canonical linearized equations of motion, in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A, along with verification by two different methods. These equations assumed <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> to roll without slip, {{that is to}} say, to go where they point, and the rider to be rigidly attached to the rear frame of the bicycle.|$|E
5|$|The XB-70's {{maiden flight}} was on 21 September 1964. In {{the first flight}} test, between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine had {{to be shut down}} shortly after take-off, and an {{undercarriage}} malfunction warning meant that the flight was flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, the rear wheels of the port side main gear locked, <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{puncturing}} of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> a flat can {{be caused}} by:failure of or damage to the valve stem;rubbing of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> against <b>the</b> road, ripping <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> or separation of tire and rim by collision with another object; excessive wear of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> tread allowing explosive tire failure or allowing road debris to tear through it.|$|R
50|$|A {{beadlock}} or bead lock is {{a mechanical}} device that secures the bead of a <b>tire</b> to <b>the</b> {{wheel of a}} vehicle. Tires and wheels are designed so that, when <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is inflated, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> pressure pushes <b>the</b> bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> against <b>the</b> inside of the wheel rim so that <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> stays on <b>the</b> wheel and the two rotate together. In situations where tire pressure is insufficient to hold the bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> in place, a beadlock is needed.|$|R
5000|$|An {{internal}} beadlock is {{very much}} like an inner tube within <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> that pushes <b>the</b> bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> tight against <b>the</b> wheel. The internal beadlock is inflated via its own valve stem. The side of the beadlock closest to the tread, the [...] "case", has a layer of thick fabric, generally polyester, which keeps the beadlock from inflating too far up into <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> This forces <b>the</b> sides into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> which compresses <b>the</b> bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> against <b>the</b> wheel.|$|R
5|$|The finite {{width of}} <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> alters the actual lean {{angle of the}} rear frame from the ideal lean angle {{described}} above. The actual lean angle between the frame and the vertical must increase with tire width and decrease with center of mass height. Bikes with fat tires and low center of mass must lean more than bikes with skinnier tires or higher centers of mass to negotiate the same turn at the same speed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the center of}} mass height is behind or below the line, such as on most tandem {{bicycles}} or long-wheel-base recumbent bicycles, as well as cars, it is less likely that the front wheel can generate enough braking force to flip the bike. This means they can decelerate up to nearly the limit of adhesion of <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under even the best conditions. Bicycling Science author David Gordon Wilson points out that this puts upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a rear-end collision if they tailgate cars.|$|E
5|$|Pearson began 1979 {{by winning}} the pole {{position}} at year's first race at Riverside; he finished in second place. 1979 was Pearson's final season racing for the Wood Brothers, with his last race happening at Darlington. After a miscommunication, he left the pits without waiting for the pit crew to place lug nuts on the car and <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> fell off the car {{when he reached the}} end of pit lane. Pearson quit the team after the race. Pearson had won 43 races between 1972 and 79 while driving for the Wood Brothers. Later during the season, Rod Osterlund's rookie driver, Dale Earnhardt, suffered a shoulder injury. Osterlund hired Pearson to replace Earnhardt during four races; he collected the pole position at Michigan and won the 1979 Southern 500. For the season, Pearson had competed in nine races and finished 32nd in points. Fans voted him as NASCAR's Most Popular Driver.|$|E
40|$|The cover {{photograph}} shows {{a finite}} element model of <b>the</b> rear <b>tire</b> and <b>the</b> rear multi-link suspension of the Mitsubishi GALANT. <b>The</b> <b>tire,</b> <b>the</b> wheel, the air in <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> <b>the</b> suspension arms, the bushing, the shock absorber and the brake system are modeled. <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> characteristics are modeled {{taking into account the}} loading applied by the vehicle weight. And by modeling the air in <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> cavity-resonance noise is able to simulate. Finite element model also enables to verify easily the effect of structure modification...|$|R
50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of patching a tire is {{that due to}} the process requiring one to remove <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> from <b>the</b> wheel, <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> must be balanced again when it is put back on <b>the</b> wheel. <b>Tire</b> sealant also creates an imbalance in <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> but since it is a temporary repair, it is considered less of an issue. However, the issue of disposal of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> sealant, <b>the</b> hazards to the technician, {{as well as the}} required cleaning of both the inside of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> as well as the wheel could all be considered disadvantages of tire sealant.|$|R
50|$|Tires can leak air for {{a variety}} of reasons. These include, but are not limited to: damage to the wheel itself, a damaged valve stem, a {{puncture}} in <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> (which can be hard to find if the puncturing object didn't embed itself in <b>the</b> <b>tire)</b> and improper installation of <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> which could involve the bead of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> being cut when installed with excessive force.|$|R
5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>tires</b> were {{increased}} in 1910 from 36 by 3.5 front and 36 by 4 rear in 1909, to 36 by 4 front and 36 by 4.5 rear.|$|E
50|$|The bicycle pump {{compresses}} air. When {{the cylinder}} is compressed, air is pushed down the tube of the pump {{and then into}} <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> via <b>the</b> valve, which is forced open by {{the pressure of the}} air. When the handle is pulled up again, the valve shuts off automatically so that the air cannot escape from <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and new air is forced back into the cylinder so the process can be repeated. Some pumps have a gauge that shows the pressure of air that is forced into <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is at <b>the</b> correct pressure, the pump valve can be removed from <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> and <b>the</b> cap can be replaced on <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> valve.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tire</b> {{is first}} centered, and the bead areas are {{lubricated}} to assure a smooth fitment to the measurement rims. <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> is indexed into the test station {{and placed on}} the lower chuck. The upper chuck lowers {{to make contact with}} the upper bead. <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> is inflated to the set point pressure. The load wheel advances to contact <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and apply <b>the</b> set loading force. The spindle drive accelerates <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to <b>the</b> test speed. Once speed, force, and pressure are stable, load cells measure the force exerted on the load wheel by <b>the</b> <b>tire.</b> <b>The</b> force signal is processed in analog circuitry, and then analyzed to extract <b>the</b> measurement parameters. <b>Tires</b> are marked according to various standards that may include RFV high point angle, side of positive conicity, and conicity magnitude.|$|R
50|$|As <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> {{is running}} from the police, it comes across {{a group of people}} burning a large pile of <b>tires.</b> <b>The</b> film then jumps to three days later showing the results of a killing spree. The cops find <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> {{watching}} an auto racing program in a house, having killed the occupants. Chad rigs a mannequin (resembling <b>the</b> woman <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is interested in) with dynamite, intending for <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to blow <b>the</b> mannequin's head up, thereby detonating the dynamite and destroying itself. However, when <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> destroys <b>the</b> mannequin's head, the dynamite does not explode. Enraged, Chad shoots and kills <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> with a shotgun, after which he gives <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to <b>the</b> man in the wheelchair. A tricycle emerges from the house and kills the man in the wheelchair. The tricycle begins rolling down <b>the</b> road; other <b>tires</b> begin rolling behind it and they eventually roll to Hollywood, where the film concludes.|$|R
25|$|During the caution, Mark Martin {{ducked into}} the pits to change all four tires, because he was afraid he ran over debris from the incident, as well as flat-spotting <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> when he locked up the brakes and slid {{sideways}} to avoid it.|$|E
25|$|AMC also {{introduced}} the Super Stock AMX. To maximize quarter-mile performance, the 390 engine {{was equipped with}} twin Holley carburetors and 12.3:1 compression-ratio cylinder heads, plus aftermarket Doug’s headers and exhaust system, and <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> were drag slicks. Hurst Performance carried out several additional modifications.|$|E
25|$|Many early {{implementations}} for automobiles {{located the}} brakes on the inboard side of the driveshaft, near the differential, while most brakes today are located inside the wheels. An inboard location reduces the unsprung weight and eliminates a source of heat transfer to <b>the</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|E

30|$|As {{the running}} wheel uses rubber <b>tires,</b> <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> parts of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> are {{subjected}} to uneven pressure during the crossing of the finger-band, resulting in {{a change in the}} amount of deformation and a vertical vibration of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> [7, 8].|$|R
5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on the front wheel, and its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip angle of <b>the</b> <b>tire,</b> <b>the</b> angle between the actual path of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> and <b>the</b> direction it is pointing, and the camber angle of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> (<b>the</b> angle that <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> leans from <b>the</b> vertical). The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|R
25|$|On June 14, 1979, {{the number}} 5 and 6 tires on an Air France Concorde blew out during takeoff. Shrapnel thrown from <b>the</b> <b>tires</b> and rims damaged number 2 engine, {{punctured}} three fuel tanks, severed several hydraulic lines and electrical wires, {{in addition to}} tearing a large hole {{on the top of}} the wing, over the wheel well area.|$|E
25|$|In the 1972 Talladega 500, Hylton won under {{interesting}} circumstances, when Goodyear supplied {{teams with}} a special tire for super speedways. However the tire shredded after a while, and because Hylton's team could not afford the new tires they ran with the old ones. Hylton and Ramo Stott, another low tier driver who also could not afford <b>the</b> <b>tires,</b> skated around the other cars, and Hylton won it by less than a second.|$|E
25|$|While {{most parts}} of the Komodo are made locally in Indonesia such as the frame, body and design, Pindad has {{publicly}} stated that they used imported components such as Hino for machinery parts and Michelin for <b>the</b> <b>tires.</b> Its diesel engines were imported directly from Renault. The Komodo's monocoque steel body was made locally by Krakatau Steel. The Indonesian Army's Research and Development Department or Dislitbang TNI AD has officially certified the Komodo as a road worthy vehicle after Pindad conducted static and dynamic tests.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tire</b> is fitted by heating to a {{controlled}} temperature, avoiding overheating. This causes <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> to expand. <b>The</b> wheel centre, usually already {{mounted on the}} axle, is lowered into <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> which is flange side up. <b>The</b> <b>tire</b> cools, and <b>the</b> retaining ring (a shaped steel bar rolled into a hoop) is fitted into the groove. Hydraulically operated rolls swage the groove down on to the retaining ring.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tire</b> bead is <b>the</b> part of <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> that {{contacts}} <b>the</b> rim {{on the wheel}}. The bead {{is typically}} reinforced with steel wire and compounded of high strength, low flexibility rubber. The bead seats tightly against the two rims on the wheel {{to ensure that a}} tubeless tire holds air without leakage. The bead fit is tight to ensure <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> does not shift circumferentially as the wheel rotates. The width of the rim in relationship to <b>the</b> <b>tire</b> is a factor in the handling characteristics of an automobile, because the rim supports <b>the</b> <b>tire's</b> profile.|$|R
