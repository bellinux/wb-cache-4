25|$|Election to the United States House of Representatives came in 1888 {{when he won}} {{the race}} to {{represent}} Wisconsin's 9th congressional district. His service in the Congress was largely undistinguished but the friends he made there were influential to his future career. Chief among his new friends was William McKinley who was assigned to <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to McCord. Attempts by McCord to win reelection in 1890 and 1892 were unsuccessful. During this time period, McCord experienced a serious financial set back that resulted in him declaring bankruptcy.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the chief}} villain, Hugo Drax, {{was to be}} played by British actor James Mason, but once the {{decision}} was made that the film would be an Anglo-French co-production under the 1965–79 film treaty, French actor Michael Lonsdale was cast as Drax and Corinne Cléry was chosen for the part of Corinne Dufour, to comply with qualifying criteria of the agreement. Stewart Granger [...] and Louis Jourdan was considered also for the role of Drax. [...] Jourdan later portrayed prince Kamal Khan, chief villain of Octopussy. American actress Lois Chiles had originally been offered the role of Anya Amasova in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), but had turned down the part when she decided to take temporary retirement. Chiles was cast as Holly Goodhead by chance, when she was given <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to Lewis Gilbert on a flight and he believed she would be ideal for the role as the CIA scientist.|$|E
500|$|In June 1941, LeHand {{collapsed}} at a White House {{dinner party}} {{and two weeks}} later suffered a major stroke that left her partially paralyzed with little speech function. Goodwin says a factor that {{may have led to}} her illness was stress stemming from fears that the exiled Princess Märtha of Sweden, a Washington-area resident during World War II, had replaced her as FDR's favorite companion, occupying <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to him that had long been LeHand's in automobile rides. Kathryn Smith cites the stress of the world crisis that spring, as Britain stood alone against the Nazis, and the ill health of FDR, who had expected her to be at his bedside for weeks on end. [...] She had also become critical of FDR's leadership {{for the first time that}} spring, sharing her disappointment with Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes, a close friend. FDR paid LeHand's medical bills and later made provisions for her in his will, stating that half the income of his estate would go to Eleanor and half to [...] "my friend Marguerite A. LeHand...for medical attention, care and treatment during her lifetime." [...] He also sent her to Warm Springs, where he hoped she could recover with the help of the physical therapy staff there. She was very unhappy in Warm Springs and may have tried to kill herself by eating chicken bones during the 1941 Christmas season. In early 1942, she spent some weeks in her old room at the White House, but quickly deteriorated due to her frustrations at not being able to help. After an incident in which she set the bed on fire—probably while smoking—it was agreed that LeHand would return to her sister's home in Somerville, Massachusetts, and she departed from Washington on May 15, 1942.|$|E

2500|$|Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave it 3 stars out of5, and {{commented that}} the [...] "irreverently funny" [...] film had [...] "a vibe so casual you half expect star Seth Rogen to amble off screen and put his feet up on <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to you," [...] and praising {{director}} Gondry's [...] "sense of humor and acute visual skill" [...] even while calling the movie [...] "cheerfully unfocused". Rogen proclaimed the film was a [...] "nightmare", chalking it up to studio executives paying {{little attention to the}} most expensive portions of the film and its inflated budget.|$|E
2500|$|Liz is {{generally}} portrayed {{as something of}} a [...] "geek". So, while she is an apparently skilled writer, she seems to have very few social skills (in [...] "Rosemary's Baby", Jack describes her as [...] "socially retarded"). For example, while she was trying to pick up men at a karaoke bar, a man asked her if <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to her was taken, leading her to ask him why she should have to move her coat just so he could sit there. Liz is often shown to be generally insecure and holds a strong concern for how she is perceived by others. Liz is sometimes dismissive of others, a personality flaw that can be connected to her lack of social skills. Assessing Liz's personality up to near the end of season 3, Jonah Weinerslav described her as [...] "an eternal 13-year-old tomboy—scared of sex, obsessed with Star Wars and meatball subs" [...] and as [...] "cling to a fantasy of presexual, junk-food-munching adolescence".|$|E

60|$|Dinner {{was soon}} announced, and I had the honour of leading in Miss B., who looked back rather angrily, I thought, at Captain Fizgig, because that gentleman had offered {{his arm to}} Mrs. Brough.

60|$|He {{sat down}} at the end of the big table in the centre of the room, and asked us to sit round. Father, of course, as Head of the Family, took the seat at his right hand.

60|$|He {{had secured}} <b>the</b> corner <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> <b>the</b> conductor, where {{his long legs}} made it {{difficult}} for anyone to get in, and at all who passed him he looked resentfully, as if they had no business to be using up his air.|$|R
25|$|On June 9, 1991, a {{severely}} intoxicated (BAC 0.30%) 32-year-old Toledo, Ohio woman fell 60 {{feet from the}} ride and died. An investigation discovered a design flaw in the restraints that allowed limp patrons to slide to <b>the</b> unoccupied <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to their own.|$|R
60|$|We {{had been}} there perhaps half an hour when I saw a sudden change in his demeanor, which was almost at once {{reflected}} in the serious expression that had stolen into Mr. Parker's benign countenance. An old gentleman, white-haired, with rubicund face and a jovial air, had taken <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> to them. He had the appearance of having come from the country and of having spent a happy day in town. Even from where I sat I could see protruding from his breast-pocket a brown leather pocketbook.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Merrill took <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> {{to her and}} {{continued}} to talk, scattering his pleasantries equally among the three, patting her arm when her own turn came. She liked Mr. Merrill very much; he seemed to her (as, indeed, he was) honest and kind-hearted. Cynthia was not lacking in a proper appreciation of herself--that may have been discovered. But she was puzzled to know why this gentleman should {{make it a point}} to pay such particular attention to a young country girl. Other railroad presidents whom she could name had not done so. She was thinking of these things, rather than listening to Mr. Merrill's conversation, when the sound of Mr. Worthington's name startled her.|$|E
60|$|Then it came {{more clearly}} into sight, and he forgot his anger in his amazement. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> <b>next</b> {{the driver was}} {{occupied}} by a man leaning far back, whose face was like {{the face of the}} dead. Behind was a solitary passenger. She was leaning over, as though trying to speak to her companion. Her hair streamed wild in the wind, and on her face was a look of blank and fearful terror. Duncombe half moved forward. She saw him, and touched the driver's arm. His hand seemed to fly {{to the side of the}} car, and his right foot was jammed down. With grinding of brakes and the screaming of locked wheels, the car was brought to a standstill within a few feet of him. He sprang eagerly forward. She was already upon her feet in the road.|$|E
