2500|$|Polyurethane {{catalysts}} can {{be classified}} into two broad categories, basic and acidic amine. Tertiary amine catalysts function by enhancing the nucleophilicity of the diol component. Alkyl tin carboxylates, oxides and mercaptides oxides function as mild Lewis acids in accelerating the formation of polyurethane. [...] As bases, traditional amine catalysts include <b>triethylenediamine</b> (TEDA, also called DABCO, 1,4-diazabicyclooctane), dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCHA), and dimethylethanolamine (DMEA). [...] A typical Lewis acidic catalyst is dibutyltin dilaurate. [...] The process is highly sensitive {{to the nature of}} the catalyst and is also known to be autocatalytic.|$|E

A transition at 208. 6 [deg]K involving an entropy increment of 3. 87 e. u. {{is associated with}} a slight modification of the crystalline arrangement and the molecular freedom in adamantane.

40|$|With these premises, {{this work}} aimed to prepare ACs from almond tree pruning by {{physical}} activation processes with steam and carbon dioxide, under different temperature conditions. Selected samples were impregnated with <b>triethylenediamine</b> (TEDA, 5 %wt.) by sublimation. The ACs characterization {{was made by}} N 2 adsorption at 77 K (AUTOSORB- 1, Quantachrome), mercury porosimetry (AUTOPORE 4900 IV, Micromeritics), helium stereopycnometry (Quantachrome), FT-IR spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer model Paragon 1000 PC) and pzc determination. The fluoxetine adsorption was studied under neutral pH at 25 ºC. Stock solutions of fluoxetine HCl (0. 5 and 1 gL- 1) were prepared in deionized water with variable amounts of ACs (0. 010 and 0. 200 g), maintaining the contact during 420 min. The determination of fluoxetine HCl was done by ultraviolet absorption at 274 nm (Perkin Elmer Lambda 850 Uv–Vis spectrophotometer) ...|$|E
40|$|Alumino{{silicate}} and silicate porous solids {{have been}} evaluated as supports for <b>triethylenediamine</b> (TEDA) for the adsorption and decomposition of cyanogen chloride. A series of silica-gel supports {{has been used to}} study the effect of varying pore size. A series of faujasitic zeolites has been used to examine the effect of the cation exchange capacity of the support and the type of exchangeable cation. Results show that the activity of adsorbed TEDA towards cyanogen chloride appears to increase with increasing support pore diameter, and TEDA seems to be activated by basic adsorption sites on the support. Cesium-exchanged zeolite supports are particularly active. In general, zeolite supports appear to confer significantly higher activity to TEDA than traditional activated carbon supports. A series of mesoporous MCM- 41 and AlMCM- 41 supports has also been studied, but the activities of adsorbed TEDA are lower than expected. Significantly, the specific surface area of the inorganic supports {{does not seem to be}} a primary factor in controlling adsorbed TEDA activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of fluoxetine onto activated carbons (ACs) prepared from {{almond tree}} pruning by steam and CO 2 activation under different temperature conditions (650 – 9508 C), was studied. In both series increasing the temperature caused {{an increase in}} the BET apparent surface area, yielding ACs with SBET up to 870 and 710 m 2 g 1 after steam and CO 2 activation, respectively. Also, a slight widening of the porosity was found in both cases. In order to modify the functionality of the ACs, two of them were impregnated with <b>triethylenediamine</b> (TEDA) prior to the adsorption process, which caused a decrease in the AC apparent surface mainly due to micropore blockage. The fluoxetine adsorption isotherms at 258 C showed maximum adsorption capacities between 110 and 224 mgg 1. The adsorption isotherms were analyzed using Langmuir and Freundlich models. Although the impregnation reduced the pore volume, it did not cause a decrease in the fluoxetine maximum adsorption capacity, but a modification in the adsorption mechanism was observed...|$|E
40|$|Removal of {{chlorine}} gas (Cl₂) from air is of critical requirement {{in order to}} address point-source emissions possibly during a terrorist attack or an industrial accident resulting in Cl₂ contamination of the atmosphere. In this work, copper (Cu) exchanged zeolite Y (CuY) was functionalised with <b>triethylenediamine</b> (TEDA) and the capacity to remove Cl₂ was evaluated. The materials were characterised by nitrogen (N₂) adsorption-desorption studies, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The materials' ability to remove Cl 2 was investigated via a dynamic breakthrough test. Copper exchanged zeolite displayed a low adsorption of Cl₂ in spite of its large surface area. However, Cl₂ removal greatly improved following functionalisation with TEDA. XPS analysis revealed that Cl₂ was removed via a catalytic hydrolysis reaction where adsorbed water vapour transformed Cl₂ into Cl⁻ which could be further trapped in the zeolite structural framework. Moisture could increase the Cl₂ removal capacity, but the competition for adsorption between water and chlorine molecules was also observed. The spent adsorbent after exposure to Cl₂ could be easily recycled with an excessive water vapour treatment. The reusability was also investigated and the adsorbent could be used for more than five times. This material can potentially be used in air filters. It may provide an efficient way for decontaminating Cl₂ during a terrorist attack or an industrial accident...|$|E

The crystal structures of the compounds are based on UO 7 units linked by methylenediphosphonate molecules to form two-dimensional anionic sheets in Ubip 2 and UDAB, and one-dimensional anionic chains in Uethyl and Uphen, which are charge balanced by protonated amine molecules. Interaction of the amine molecules with phosphonate oxygens and water molecules results in extensive hydrogen bonding in the interlayer. These amine molecules serve both as structure-directing agents and charge-balancing cations for the anionic uranium phosphonate sheets and chains {{in the formation of the}} different coordination geometries and topologies of each structure. Reported herein are the syntheses, structural and spectroscopic characterization of the synthesized compounds...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{relative}} stabilities of alane (AlH 3) complexes with electron donors is essential for identifying hydrogen storage materials for vehicular applications that can be regenerated by off-board methods; however, almost no thermodynamic data are available to make this assessment. To fill this gap, we employed the G 4 (MP 2) method to determine heats of formation, entropies, and Gibbs free energies of formation for thirty-eight alane complexes with NH 3 -nRn (R = Me, Et; n = 0 - 3), pyridine, pyrazine, <b>triethylenediamine</b> (TEDA), quinuclidine, OH 2 -nRn (R = Me, Et; n = 0 - 2), dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Monomer, bis, and selected dimer complex geometries were considered. Using these data, we computed the thermodynamics of the key formation and dehydrogenation reactions that would occur during hydrogen delivery and alane regeneration, from which trends in complex stability were identified. These predictions were tested by synthesizing six amine-alane complexes involving trimethylamine, triethylamine, dimethylethylamine, TEDA, quinuclidine, and hexamine, and obtaining upper limits of delta G for their formation from metallic aluminum. Combining these computational and experimental results, we establish a criterion for complex stability relevant to hydrogen storage {{that can be used}} to assess potential ligands prior to attempting synthesis of the alane complex. Based on this, we conclude that only a subset of the tertiary amine complexes considered and none of the ether complexes can be successfully formed by direct reaction with aluminum and regenerated in an alane-based hydrogen storage system.

40|$|Molecular diffusion, adsorption, and {{reaction}} on high surface area Al 2 O 3 were studied by using transmission infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption techniques. It was demonstrated that <b>triethylenediamine</b> (TEDA) binds to Al-OH Br©ªnsted acid sites via hydrogen bonding {{as well as}} to Al 3 + Lewis acid sites on a partially dehydroxylated ¥ã-Al 2 O 3 powder at 300 K. The adsorption of a series of CWAs (Chemical Warfare Agents) such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, and cyanogen chloride on the TEDA-functionalized Al 2 O 3 surface was studied to determine the role of TEDA on the enhancement of the adsorption properties of ¥ã-Al 2 O 3 adsorbent by a combination of FTIR and density functional theory studies. No direct binding of the gases to the exposed amine group of a TEDA molecule pre-adsorbed on ¥ã-Al 2 O 3 is found. Instead the TEDA molecule effectively competes with the gases for binding sites on the ¥ã-Al 2 O 3 surface and only site blocking effects by TEDA are observed. A new method was developed to study the diffusion properties of molecules into compressed powdered samples using transmission IR spectroscopy. The diffusion of 2 -CEES (2 -chloroethylethyl sulfide) molecules from a condensed film which formed at lower temperature into the interior of two different particle size Al 2 O 3 powders was monitored and compared by using the isolated Al-OH species as spectroscopic sensors of the arrival of diffusing 2 -CEES molecules. The diffusion of the 2 -CEES molecule into the subnano-Al 2 O 3 powder particles is more rapid than in the multinano-Al 2 O 3 particles. A surface diffusion mechanism was used to model the diffusion process giving good agreement with the experimental results. The infrared spectroscopic technique for surface diffusion studies was applied to monitor the transport of CO to the Pt cores of Pt@CoO yolk-shell nanoparticles by probing the development of characteristic IR modes of the adsorbed CO species on the Pt yolk. It was found that the transport of CO occurs by an activated surface diffusion process through the ~ 5 nm thick shell of CoO, surrounding ~ 2 nm diameter Pt cores. In addition the infrared spectrum of the CO molecule diffusing through the CoO shells is detected by high sensitivity measurements...|$|E
