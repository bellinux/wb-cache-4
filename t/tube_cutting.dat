40|$|We {{consider}} a new mechanism for damping the oscillations of a mature neutron star. The new dissipation channel arises if superfluid vortices {{are forced to}} cut through superconducting flux tubes. This mechanism is interesting because the oscillation modes need to exceed a critical amplitude in order for it to operate. Once it acts, the effect is very strong (and non-linear) leading to efficient damping. The upshot {{of this is that}} modes are unlikely to ever evolve far beyond the critical amplitude. We consider the effect of this new dissipation channel on the r modes, which may be driven unstable by the emission of gravitational waves. Our estimates show that the flux <b>tube</b> <b>cutting</b> leads to a saturation threshold for the instability that can be smaller than that of other proposed mechanisms. This suggests that the idea may be of direct astrophysical relevance...|$|E

Further, based on the tearing caused by single-blade shear on the top of steel tube, the shape and angle of the vertical blade are studied, and the structure of the vertical blade nose is optimized, which improves the shearing quality of the blade.

40|$|Dismantling {{chemical}} or nuclear plants is often hazardous and several studies are in progress to reduce mobile robots capable of cutting {{to reduce the}} volume of contaminated metallic components. In particular <b>cutting</b> <b>tubes</b> from these plants usually requires that the tubes be sealed {{in order to prevent}} dangerous liquids or gases from diffusing into the environment. We refer to tube diameters of around 2 inches and thicknesses of around 0. 16 inches. It is not always sufficient to press the edges of the <b>tube</b> segment before <b>cutting.</b> Moreover powerful presses capable of performing fully reliable mechanical sealing of the tubes can be complex to install on mobile robots. A further problem is linked to the strong mechanical reaction on the robot when conventional cutting tools are used. Laser for cutting has already been considered as a potential solution to the problem due to the absence of mechanical forces on the workpiece. This paper deals with the experimental investigation of a more complete solution : the same laser beam can be used to seal, by welding, the edges of the <b>tube</b> before <b>cutting</b> and after partial compression of the tube using presses of limited forces which are thus easier to install on the robot. This is possible {{due to the fact that}} a gap between the metal sheets is left when performing laser lap welding without any degradation of the sealing quality. This solution foresees a single tool for two operations and a reduced load on the robot and is all the more feasible given that powerful laser beams can be sent to the robot which handles them by means of light and flexible mirror systems or optical fibres. For optical power transmission applications these fibres have up to now only been available for the wavelength of solid-state lasers. We performed experimental comparisons between carbon dioxide and solid-state lasers for performing the above mentioned tasks. Economic and reliability evaluations of the two solution were made based on the experimental results and on the state of the art of high power industrial lasers. It should be noted that recent improvements in commercially available high power solid state lasers and in the optical fibres used for beam transport, render the technological applications considered in this paper increasingly feasible...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} methods for purification and modification of Single Wall and Multi Wall Carbon Nanotubes. Covalent and noncovalent approaches to functionalization were studied. The dispersibility, structure and electronic properties of modified tubes were characterized by Raman, UV-vis-NIR and XPS. Fluorescence, NMR and TEM were further employed to characterize the interaction between nanotubes and non-covalent modifiers. The effects of five different purification methods on the dispersibility, and degree of carboxylic acid functionality of SWCNTs, along {{with the level of}} defects on the tube side walls, and the resulting electronic properties of SWCNTs have been investigated. It was found that all oxidation treatments successfully removed metallic oxides and amorphous carbon impurities, while different oxidation treatments introduced different levels of oxidized sites on the SWCNTs. Heat treatment after oxidation eliminated some of the carboxylic groups introduced by oxidation. SWCNTs covalently functionalized by aromatic diazonium salts containing nitro, carboxylate and fluoro groups on the aromatic ring were prepared. Heating of these tubes in vacuum at 350 _C for 5 h partially reversed the effects of functionalization. However, due to the low degree of functionalization achieved in the preliminary studies, the dispersibility/solubility of functionalized tubes did not greatly improve. The interaction in stable suspensions of CNTs with positively or negatively charged pyrene derivatives via noncovalent functionalization, was extensively studied. 1 -pyrene methylamine hydrochloride gave most stable dispersions. 1 H and 2 H NMR spectroscopy of MWCNTs/ 1 -pyrene methylamine hydrochloride dispersion in DMF-d 7 showed that the broadened signals are associated with weakly or unbound pyrene, while strongly bound pyrene is not observable in solution-state NMR. The strong pyrene attachment on MWCNTs by &# 960;-&# 960; stacking can be reversed by dialysis and/or extensive washing. Biological molecules such as polypeptides and amino acids also dispersed MWCNTs into solvents by noncovalent modification. It is found that polytryptophan demonstrated the greatest ability to disperse MWCNTs. Digestion with chymotrypsin enabled polytryptophan binding to be reversed. A combination of <b>tube</b> <b>cutting</b> and non-covalent functionalization by pyrenes or peptides enables tubes to be suspended/dissolved in solvents such as DMF and ethanol, and significantly allows tubes to be manipulated for practical device applications...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{the application of}} a genetic algorithm as a methodology to choose and improve the motion law governing the movement of a redundant robot. The subject of this research is an innovative system developed to introduce the laser ray technology in the on-line <b>tube</b> <b>cutting.</b> This technique allows a quality improvement in the pipe-cutting sector, thanks to the various goals. Firstly we underline the improvement of the working environment due to the elimination of cutting noise taking off the tool changing and the steel shaving creation. Secondarily there is a drastic reduction of the cutting cycle time and an improvement of the productivity accomplished by the use of brushless drives and linear motors. In the robot design, particular attention was dedicated to the masses distributions allowing a good natural machine dynamics. The ability of the robot to avoid the cutting object, the demand to maintain the laser torch orthogonal to the cutting surfaces, as well the necessity to impose a velocity behaviour as constant as possible during the cutting operation, suggested the introduction of a redundant degree of freedom. This aspect gives a lot of opportunities in the choose of movements because there are thousands motion profiles for the joints whichever satisfying the conditions imposed to the end-effector path. In this context, we have proposed the idea to combine the procedure to solve the inverse kinematics problem with the contemporaneous optimization of the trajectory. Literature offers a series of algorithms to solve wellknown inverse kinematics problem of redundant robot. These are based on the inversion of the matrix representing the link between the end-effector co-ordinates and the joints. The presence of redundancy makes this matrix rectangular and requires the use of the pseudo-inverse matrix to solve the problem in several points of the trajectory. The introduction of some weights, one for each joint co-ordinate, allows to obtain a different distribution of the joint movements computing the pseudo-inverse matrix. If we change these weights in a continuous way in time domain, we can supervise the dynamic behaviors of the machine. The new idea we propose here is the use of an adapted multi-objective genetic algorithm to define a several of particular motion laws reducing vibrations and realizing “special harmonies” in the robot motion. The procedure, that will be completely discussed in the full paper, is actually working on a laser pipe cutting machine.
