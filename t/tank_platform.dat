50|$|Like many monuments built {{during that}} period, the Sarkhej Roza fused both Muslim and Hindu {{principles}} of architecture. While the ringed domes, {{the profusion of}} pillars and brackets follow the Islamic genre, much of the ornamentation and motifs have Hindu designs. Most of the buildings do not have arches and depend on pierced stone trellises for stability. In its architecture, Sarkhej Roza {{is an example of}} the early Islamic architectural culture of the region, which fused Islamic stylistic influences from Persia with indigenous Hindu and Jain features to form a composite “Indo-Saracenic” architectural style. The mosque, with its courtyard, creates a religious milieu; the royal connection is made through the tombs and palaces; the great <b>tank,</b> <b>platforms</b> and pavilions were used by the common man.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Armata" [...] Universal Combat Platform (Армата) is a Russian {{prototype}} of an advanced next generation heavy military tracked vehicle platform. The Armata platform {{is the basis}} of the T-14 (a main battle tank, MBT), the T-15 (a heavy infantry fighting vehicle), a combat engineering vehicle, an armoured recovery vehicle, a heavy armoured personnel carrier, a tank support combat vehicle and several types of self-propelled artillery, including the 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV under the same codename based on the same chassis.

5000|$|A new GDI anti-air unit {{called the}} Slingshot is {{available}} to all three GDI factions; it is a fast hover vehicle resembling the Hover MLRS from the Second Tiberium War, capable of great damage to any aircraft but is defenseless against ground targets. GDI also has a new aircraft, the Hammerhead, at its disposal; it is equipped with an anti-infantry machine gun and is capable of garrisoning a GDI infantry squad who can fire upon targets from inside the Hammerhead. GDI has also developed their sonic technology onto a <b>tank</b> <b>platform,</b> producing the Shatterer - a lightly armoured hover vehicle with a weapon similar to the Sonic Emitter - however, this vehicle is unavailable to the Steel Talons.Several new upgrades are available to GDI. AP Ammo increases the attack power of Riflemen Squads, Watchtowers, Hammerheads, APCs and the Steel Talon Wolverine. Tungsten AA Ammunition increases the attack power of AA batteries and the Slingshot. Hardpoints can be purchased to increase the ammo capacity of Orcas and Firehawks. Lastly, the Railgun upgrade for Predator and Mammoth Tanks is now also applied to GDI Guardian Cannons. GDI's new epic unit is the Mammoth Armed Reclamation Vehicle or MARV. This is a combined machinery of an ultra-heavy tank armed with tri-barreled sonic cannon and a Tiberium processor at which when moving over the Tiberium fields, the MARV process these crystals {{and turn them into}} cash. All GDI factions can build the MARV, and garrison it with up to four infantry units, boosting the MARV's own firepower.|$|E

50|$|The heavy tank {{company was}} taken over by the Red Army in February 1941. The tanks were in a very poor {{condition}} and hardly able to move by their own power. As the Red Army did not have <b>tank</b> transport <b>platforms</b> for the railway, the tanks were left behind in a warehouse near Tallinn, which was soon after forgotten. The tanks were relocated again in August the same year when they were used to cover the Soviet retreat from Tallinn. Mark Vs were dug into the soil along the Pirita River coastal line in order to create stationary gun platforms for the defence line. There are no records however of the usage or success of this plan, yet it is certain that it was tried out.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. TWIP steels {{are high}} Mn (17 - 35 %) {{austenitic}} steels having {{strength and ductility}} concurrently. This makes them suitable for applications that need high strength and ductility like gas <b>tanks</b> and oil <b>platforms.</b> To these applications corrosion resistance of these steel is also of paramount importance {{and needs to be}} noticed. This was achieved by two usual methods of weight loss and potentiodynamic polarization of the samples, after that they casted and hot rolled in experimental scale. The observed corrosion pits are related to the chemical composition. It is connected with the high dissolution rate of Mn and Fe atoms in NaCl solution. Fractographic analyses of samples revealed corrosion products on their surface in a form of pits with diversified size...|$|R
5000|$|The Kurganets-25 is {{designed}} to be lighter than the T-15 [...] "heavy IFV" [...] based on the Armata Universal Combat <b>Platform</b> <b>tank</b> chassis. There are two versions of the vehicle: a heavily armed infantry fighting vehicle carrying 6-7 troops; and a lightly armed APC carrying eight troops. Other variants proposed for the Kurganets include an armored ambulance, an 82 mm Vasilek mortar carrier, anti-tank vehicle, armored recovery vehicle, a reconnaissance vehicle, a command vehicle, and an armored engineering vehicle. The vehicle represents a departure from traditional Russian low profile designs, having a higher floor more suited for mounted combat rather than troop carrying, which also provides better IED and mine protection. While the T-15 is expected to be deployed with T-14 tanks in armored formations, Kurganets-25 platforms will equip mechanized units.|$|R

The public square will be a ventilation area for the West Side Yards, as well as a storm water runoff site. Storm water that runs off into the square will be reused.

40|$|Abstract. The {{anticipated}} {{dynamics of}} the future battlefield will require greatly increased mobility, information flow, information assimilation, and responsiveness from a tactical operation center (TOC) and <b>platforms</b> (<b>tanks,</b> armored personnel carriers, etc.). This paper illustrates the potential synergy between these seemingly disparate developments, particularly related to battlefield visualization, multi-resolution analysis, software agents, and physical agents. Battlefield visualization programs are currently focussed on representing the physical environment. This greatly contributes to situation awareness at the TOC and platform levels. As intelligent agents, both software and physical agents, are developed, battlefield visualization must be enhanced to include the state, behavior, and results {{of the actions of}} these agents. Multi-resolution data and analysis will enhance visualization, software agent and physical agent performance. There are significant challenges to the integration of these technologies and to creating an effective human/multi-agent interaction...|$|R
50|$|The game {{is played}} from a third-person perspective. The player must {{navigate}} three-dimensional environments while controlling various World War I-style military vehicles, such as armoured cars, mobile anti-aircraft <b>platforms,</b> <b>tanks,</b> cannons, motorbikes, and observation balloons. Each vehicle has its own unique mounted weapon (with {{the exception of the}} oil tanker, which can only self-destruct). These must be used to combat the Martian invaders, who pilot the fighting-machines, handling-machines, flying-machines and embankment-machines of the novel, in addition to various other advanced vehicles, many of which were created specifically for the PlayStation and PC games. The black smoke and red weed also appear as obstacles within the game. At any moment, the player can bring up the sidebar - a rudimentary map of the level, showing all human and Martian units currently in the area. From here the player can instantly switch to any human vehicle or turret currently in their control.|$|R
