5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than <b>to</b> <b>older</b> people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E

Wilhelm broke with tradition when he began throwing the pitch as a teenager and threw it nearly every pitch. The New York Times linked his knuckleball with that of modern pitcher R.A. Dickey, as Wilhelm taught pitcher Charlie Hough the knuckleball in 1971, and Hough taught it to Dickey while coaching with the Texas Rangers.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, Provost {{declined}} to renew his contract. Producers decided {{to broaden the}} show's demographics to appeal <b>to</b> <b>older</b> viewers, and, to that end, dropped {{the boy and his}} dog theme for a plot featuring a Forest Service Ranger. Robert Bray, a former Marine and Gary Cooper look-alike was cast as Corey Stuart. During Bray's first year, the show transitioned to color filming and spectacular scenic locations across America were exploited as settings for the show. Eventually, Bray's alcoholism forced him from the show, and Jack De Mave and Jed Allan were hired to replace him.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} blocks of JF-17 {{is powered by}} a single Russian RD-93 {{turbofan}} engine, which is a variant of the RD-33 engine used on the MiG-29 fighter. The engine gives more thrust and significantly lower specific fuel consumption than turbojet engines fitted <b>to</b> <b>older</b> combat aircraft being replaced by the JF-17. The advantages of using a single engine are a reduction in maintenance time and cost when compared to twin-engined fighters. A thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.99 can be achieved with full internal fuel tanks and no external payload. The engine's air supply is provided by two bifurcated air inlets (see airframe section).|$|E

5|$|Between the December {{meeting and}} second {{gathering}} in March 2011, {{prior to the}} ARG's launch, there was no direct verbal communication between Valve or the developers. Instead, the independent developers spent time, using a shared wiki provided by Valve, to plan out and coordinate the game. They also had to develop the new content for their games, which in most cases was work in addition to existing projects that they were presently undertaking. Others {{had to go back}} <b>to</b> <b>older</b> programming code and re-acquaint themselves with it before undertaking the new additions for the ARG. Valve's Jeep Barnett helped to coordinate the large effort. The second visit to Valve in March 2011 was to affirm the plans for the launch of the ARG.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{praised the}} manga for its {{creativity}} and {{described it as}} a quintessential shōjo manga, as well as a critical work for manga in general. The manga series was awarded the Seiun Award for Best Manga in 2001. The anime television series was praised for transcending its target audience of young children and being enjoyable <b>to</b> <b>older</b> viewers. The artwork in the anime was also a focus of attention, described as above average for a late-1990s TV series, and Sakura's magic-casting scenes were complimented for being nearly unique because of the regular costume changes. The anime television series won the Animage Grand Prix award for Best Anime in 1999. The American edit of Cardcaptors, however, was heavily panned by critics for cutting out character backgrounds essential to understanding the plot.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior <b>to</b> <b>older</b> children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E

5|$|The Black Cauldron was {{intended}} to expand the appeal of Disney animated films <b>to</b> <b>older</b> audiences and to showcase the talents of {{the new generation of}} Disney animators from CalArts. Besides Keane, Musker, and Clements, this new group of artists included other promising animators such as Andreas Deja, Mike Gabriel, John Lasseter, and Tim Burton. Lasseter was fired from Disney in 1983 for pushing the studio to explore computer animation production, but {{went on to become the}} creative head of Pixar, a pioneering computer animation studio that would begin a close association with Disney in the late 1980s. Similarly, Burton was fired in 1984 after producing a live-action short shelved by the studio, Frankenweenie, then went on to become a high-profile producer and director of live-action and stop-motion features for Disney and other studios. Some of Burton's high-profile projects for Disney would include the stop-motion The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), a live-action adaptation of Alice in Wonderland (2010), and a stop-motion feature remake of Frankenweenie (2012).|$|E
5|$|The Cyrus Cylinder bears {{striking}} similarities <b>to</b> <b>older</b> Mesopotamian royal inscriptions. Two notable {{examples are}} the Cylinder of Marduk-apla-iddina II, who seized the Babylonian throne in 722/1 BC, and {{the annals of}} Sargon II of Assyria, who conquered Babylon twelve years later. As a conqueror, Marduk-apla-iddina faced {{many of the same}} problems of legitimacy that Cyrus did when he conquered Babylon. He declares himself to have been chosen personally by Marduk, who ensured his victory. When he took power, he performed the sacred rites and restored the sacred shrines. He states that he found a royal inscription placed in the temple foundations by an earlier Babylonian king, which he left undisturbed and honored. All of these claims also appear in Cyrus's Cylinder. Twelve years later, the Assyrian king Sargon II defeated and exiled Marduk-apla-iddina, taking up the kingship of Babylonia. Sargon's annals describe how he took on the duties of a Babylonian sovereign, honouring the gods, maintaining their temples and respecting and upholding the privileges of the urban elite. Again, Cyrus's Cylinder makes exactly the same points. Nabonidus, Cyrus's deposed predecessor as king of Babylon, commissioned foundation texts on clay cylinders – such as the Cylinder of Nabonidus, also in the British Museum – that follows the same basic formula.|$|E
5|$|It is archaeologically {{difficult}} to distinguish Diocletian's fortifications from those of his successors and predecessors. The Devil's Dyke, for example, the Danubian earthworks traditionally attributed to Diocletian, cannot even be securely dated to a particular century. The most {{that can be said}} about built structures under Diocletian's reign is that he rebuilt and strengthened forts at the Upper Rhine frontier (where he followed the works built under Probus along the Lake Constance-Basel and the Rhine–Iller–Danube line), on the Danube- where a new line of forts {{on the far side of}} the river, the Ripa Sarmatica, was added <b>to</b> <b>older,</b> rehabilitated fortresses – in Egypt, and on the frontier with Persia. Beyond that, much discussion is speculative, and reliant on the broad generalizations of written sources. Diocletian and the tetrarchs had no consistent plan for frontier advancement, and records of raids and forts built across the frontier are likely to indicate only temporary claims. The Strata Diocletiana, built after the Persian Wars, which ran from the Euphrates North of Palmyra and South towards northeast Arabia in the general vicinity of Bostra, is the classic Diocletianic frontier system, consisting of an outer road followed by tightly spaced forts – defensible hard-points manned by small garrisons – followed by further fortifications in the rear. In an attempt to resolve the difficulty and slowness of transmitting orders to the frontier, the new capitals of the tetrarchic era were all much closer to the empire's frontiers than Rome had been: Trier sat on the Rhine, Sirmium and Serdica were close to the Danube, Thessaloniki was on the route leading eastward, and Nicomedia and Antioch were important points in dealings with Persia.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{following}} problem: is returning to wrong conjectures necessary to achieve full power of algorithmic learning? Returning to wrong conjectures complements the paradigm of U-shaped learning [3, 7, 9, 23, 27] when a learner returns <b>to</b> <b>old</b> correct conjectures. We explore our problem for classical models of learning in the limit: TxtEx-learning – when a learner stabilizes on a correct conjecture, and TxtBc-learning – when a learner stabilizes on a sequence of grammars representing the target concept. In both cases, we show that, surprisingly, returning to wrong conjectures is necessary to achieve full learning power. In contrast inverted U’s (i. e. return <b>to</b> <b>old</b> wrong conjecture with a correct conjecture in-between) and return <b>to</b> <b>old</b> “overinclusive ” conjectures containing non-elements of the target language are dispensable strategies. We also consider our problem {{in the context of}} so-called vacillatory learning when a learner stabilizes to a finite number of correct grammars. In this case we show that returning <b>to</b> <b>old</b> wrong conjectures, using an inverted-U-shaped strategy, returning <b>to</b> <b>old</b> overinclusive and returning <b>to</b> <b>old</b> overgeneralizing conjectures are all necessary for full learning power. We also show that, surprisingly, learners consistent with the input seen so far can be made decisive [3, 24] – {{they do not have to}} return <b>to</b> any <b>old</b> conjectures – wrong or right...|$|R
