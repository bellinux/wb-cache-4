Despite not touring and receiving virtually no press or label interest in Canada and the USA, Annihilator {{has become one}} of the biggest selling Canadian Metal band of all-time, yet the majority of their sales have been generated from Asia and Europe. Most of Annihilator's discography is hard to find in the band's home country of Canada. Waters has been quoted as saying: [...] "I live a few blocks from the Ottawa Citizen newspaper. One day, a few years ago (2005) I contacted the Entertainment editor by email and introduced myself, gave him links <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>web</b> <b>site</b> and info, and asked if he might spare a few minutes to talk with me about the band, as I live a few minutes walking from his office. He told me to mail him a CD and he would consider reviewing it. He didn't. It actually made me a bit sad, as I have been waving the flag for Canadian metal and Canadian music for over 21 years abroad and also have sold more than any other metal band from this fine land. Yet I could not even get a review or interview with our nation's capital newspaper, when local artists with no deal and no CD releases, were actually getting full page or front page stories. The last thing I needed was coverage in Ottawa but I thought, out of principle, I should try. Shot down in flames! Ha!" ...|$|E

Users never interact directly with the production machine; DryDock updates the production server on their behalf. This allows administrators to operate their production web server in a more secure and regimented network environment than normally feasible. DryDock audits documents, tracks revisions, and notifies users of changes via email. Managers can approve files for publication at their leisure without the risk of inappropriate content ever being publicly visible.

You sometimes hear people saying that senior house officers (SHOs) in emergency depart-ments are not what they used to be. We studied data collected over a five year period (1996 – 2001) on the number of patients seen by all SHOs who completed a six month post in our A&E department. The 118 SHOs (62 male and 56 female) worked a full shift rota averaging 52 hours per week. The influence of the sex of the doctor and their future career plan on the num-ber of patients they saw was also assessed. The number of patients seen by each SHO in six months ranged from 1069 to 2659 (mean 1774, SD 346). On average the SHOs working between August 1996 and January 1999 saw 154 more patients than those working between February 1999 and July 2001 (p= 0. 015; unpaired t test). Male SHOs saw on average 217. 5 patients (range 1121 to 2659) more than female SHOs (range 1069 to 2644) (p= 0. 001; unpaired t test).

However, structural wood in {{residential and commercial}} buildings can also be readily used as a food source. Termites are thus considered the most economically important wood-destroying organism in the United States. Subterranean termites cause more damage to homes than all other natural disasters combined. In the U. S., economic loss to property owners due to subterranean termite activity amounts to greater than three billion dollars annually. This includes the cost of control measures {{and the cost of}} repairing structural damage. Proper identification {{is the first step in}} the process of managing a termite infestation. parts of the body, are used by the termite to detect smells. The termite has chewing mouthparts as found in grasshoppers and ants. The middle region, or thorax, is divided into three sections with each section bearing a pair of legs. Sexually mature males and females (reproductives or alates) also bear two pairs of wings located on the last two segments of the thorax. The wings are long and narrow, extending at least one-half their length beyond the end of the abdomen. The wings are lost after swarming. Workers and soldiers do not have wings. The abdomen makes up the posterior portion of the termite and consists of a series of similar segments occurring immediately behind the thorax. Identifying Characteristics Subterranean termites have the basic characteristics common to all Misidentifying termites as another insect can cause improper management and monetary loss.

Before completing the study, all participants were shown all the displays and detailed patient information about the treatment of sore throat and were asked to decide again. We calculated a relative importance score (RIS) by subtracting the VAS scores for the undesirable consequences of antibiotics from the VAS score for the benefit of symptom relief. We used logistic regression to determine the association between participants' RIS and their choice. 1, 760 participants completed the study. There were statistically significant differences in the likelihood of choosing to go to the doctor in relation to different values (RIS). Of the four presentations, the bar graph of duration of symptoms resulted in decisions that were most consistent with the more fully informed second decision. Most participants also preferred this presentation (38 %) and found it easiest to understand (37 %). Participants shown the other three presentations were more likely to decide to go to the doctor based on their first decision than everyone based on the second decision. Participants preferred the graph using faces the least (14. 4 %). CONCLUSIONS: For decisions about going to the doctor to get antibiotics for sore throat, treatment effects presented by a bar graph showing the duration of symptoms helped people make decisions more consistent with their values than treatment effects presented as graphical displays of proportions of people with sore throat following treatment.

40|$|This {{was most}} {{definitely}} a good learning experience. What I {{thought was a}} paper presentation {{turned out to be}} workshop, so we had to tweak at the last minute and create "workshop" activities to engage the group! Fortunately, I am "seasoned" in workshopping so we managed ok. Jennifer handled the paper and the Powerpoint for me while I spoke. We adjusted the PPT presentation several times. The final version is attached. Our group was very enthusiastic; in fact, an over-abundance of questions from one New York attendee put us over-time, but they were good questions. A director of an interdisciplinary program from North Carolina spoke to me about including our PLAR process in a book he is just constructing; I expect to write a piece for that in the near future. This man (professor of English) had already linked his organization <b>to</b> <b>our</b> PLAR <b>web</b> <b>site</b> and was happy to meet us and listen to what we had to say. It was also suggested to me by some of the leaders in the American field that I should attend the Thomas Edison college PLAR gathering each May as that is where the "big stuff" goes on. All in all, our audience was glad to hear what we had to say. That, plus our participation in other sessions and my participation in the pre-conference workshop, made the outing very worthwhile. We brought home many ideas for the continued development of our PLAR process and made many contacts. Overall, many American institutions are far ahead of Canadians in their use of PLAR. Some are still struggling and look to us as a good example of a comprehensive system. I am grateful for the support from the APDF for the opportunity to attend this important national gathering (over 400 delegates, only 8 Canadians). In this presentation, we will examine the notion of transformation as it is experienced, or thought to be experienced, during the PLAR process. This discussion brings to the fore one of the tensions in PLAR practice that considers whether individuals are supposed to ćhange and growás they work through the reflective PLAR practice. Many PLAR practitioners, usually those outside the purview of formal educational institutions, stress the transformative, personal benefits to preparing a PLAR portfolio. Within the university, we focus on a high-stakes type of assessment portfolio that needs to see tangible results. Does this process permit an individualś transformation? Is transformation an unintended outcome? Should we ensure that it {{is a part of the}} processś intended incomes?
