25|$|He was baptised as Theobald Wolfe Tone {{in honour of}} his godfather, Theobald Wolfe of Blackhall, County Kildare, a {{first cousin}} of Arthur Wolfe, 1st Viscount Kilwarden.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the leniency shown to the largely upper class leadership, {{the full weight of}} military repression was inflicted upon the common people throughout the years 1797-98 with untold thousands suffering imprisonment, torture, transportation and death. Fitzgibbon was inclined to show no mercy to unrepentant rebels and in October 1798 he expressed his disgust upon the capture of Wolfe Tone that he had been granted a trial and his belief <b>that</b> <b>Tone</b> should have been hanged as soon as he set foot on land.|$|E

25|$|A {{possible}} participant to this year's Melodi Grand Prix may be Hanne Krogh, {{who previously}} represented Norway in the 1971, 1985 and 1991 contests (the last two appearances {{as part of}} Bobbysocks and Just 4 Fun respectively), after she announced in 2007 that she might compete in MGP in 2009. Although NRK has neither confirmed nor denied anything about artists competing, Norwegian broadcaster TV 2 revealed <b>that</b> <b>Tone</b> Damli Aaberge and Maria Arredondo would apparently compete in Melodi Grand Prix 2009. Aaberge will compete in MGP 2009, performing in the second semi-final, however Krogh and Arredondo will not be competing.|$|E
25|$|Local legends by the Chagga {{people tell}} {{how a man}} named Tone once {{provoked}} a god, Ruwa, to bring famine upon the land. The people became angry at Tone, forcing him to flee. Nobody wanted to protect him but a solitary dweller who had stones that turned miraculously into cattle. The dweller bid <b>that</b> <b>Tone</b> never open the stable of the cattle. When Tone did not heed the warning and the cattle escaped, Tone followed them, but the fleeing cattle threw up hills to run on, including Mawenzi and Kibo. Tone finally collapsed on Kibo, ending the pursuit.|$|E
25|$|His godfather, {{a cousin}} of Arthur Wolfe, Lord Kilwarden, who {{according}} to local gossip was Tone's father, warned Tone to leave Ireland in 1795. Then when Tone was arrested and brought to Dublin in 1798, and facing certain execution, it was Kilwarden (a senior judge) who granted two orders for Habeas Corpus for his release. This was a remarkable act, given that the rebellion had just occurred with great loss of life, and one that could never be enlarged upon as Kilwarden was killed {{at the beginning of}} Emmet's revolt in 1803. The suggestion is that the Wolfes knew <b>that</b> <b>Tone</b> was a cousin. As a pillar of the Protestant Ascendancy and notorious at the time for his prosecution of United Irishman William Orr, Kilwarden had no apparent motive for trying to assist Tone in 1795 and 1798. Portraits of Wolfe around 1800 arguably show a resemblance to Wolfe Tone.|$|E

[...] In 1887, Giuseppe Verdi became the first notable composer in the Western tradition to write an unmistakable chromatic cluster: the storm music with which Otello opens includes an organ cluster (C, C, D) that also has the longest notated duration of any scored musical texture known. Still, it was not before the second {{decade of the twentieth}} century <b>that</b> <b>tone</b> clusters assumed a recognized place in Western classical music practice.|$|E

On the album itself, her vocal style moves away from outright honky-tonk but retains her twang, garnering comparisons to musicians such as Cline, Lynn, Hazel Dickens, Tanya Tucker, and Dolly Parton.

2500|$|Several of {{the leading}} United Irishmen, {{including}} Archibald Hamilton Rowan, fled the country; the papers of the United Irishmen were seized, {{and for a time}} the organisation was broken up. Tone, who had not attended meetings of the society since May 1793, remained in Ireland until after the trial of Jackson and his suicide in April 1795. Having friends among the government party, including members of the Beresford family, he succeeded in making terms with the government, and emigrated to the United States, where he arrived in May 1795. Before leaving, he and his family travelled to Belfast, and it was at the summit of Cavehill <b>that</b> <b>Tone</b> made the Cavehill Compact with fellow United Irishmen Russel and Henry Joy McCracken, promising [...] "never to desist in our efforts until we subvert the authority of England over our country and asserted our independence".|$|E

2500|$|In January 1945 BuShips revised its paint {{formulations}} due to {{a shortage}} of blue pigment, and the realization <b>that</b> <b>tone</b> was {{far more important than}} hue in camouflage effect, eliminating the blue-purple shades which had characterized nearly all Navy ship colors whether called [...] "blue" [...] or [...] "gray." [...] The new paints were neutral grays, Navy Gray replacing Navy Blue (but confusingly receiving the designation [...] "5-N" [...] while Navy Blue became [...] "5-NB"), and Deck Gray replacing Deck Blue. Ocean Gray and Haze Gray retained their names but lost their bluish cast. However, the new paints (which were shipped pre-mixed, not as tinting paste) were generally only available in stateside yards, while ships repainted at forward bases continued to use the older bluish colors. Moreover, for Measure 22 (but not 12 or 21), Navy Blue was still prescribed until existing stocks were exhausted.|$|E
2500|$|Campbell {{described}} Blair {{as having}} {{in his poetry}} [...] "a masculine and pronounced character even in his gloom and homeliness that keeps it most distinctly apart from either dullness or vulgarity". [...] Johnstone similarly stated that the poem [...] "everywhere exhibits a manly and vigorous spirit; and {{if some of the}} detached sketches want the grace of colouring and the smoothness of beauty, the truth of their anatomy is unimpeachable, and the moral expression dignified and masculine". [...] However, Johnstone was not wholly positive in his criticism, observing that in the close of the poem there is [...] "short-coming, if not absolute failure", and that the final triumph of Resurrection over the powers of Death and Hell were [...] "felt to be wanting". [...] Rather than [...] "the rapturous exultation of the true poet", the close is [...] "in <b>that</b> <b>tone</b> of sober confidence which might have found place in any eloquent sermon".|$|E
2500|$|Fitzwilliam {{accepted}} the Lord Lieutenancy on 10 August. The Duke of Portland wrote to Fitzwilliam {{four days later}} to say he had told Ponsonby, an Irish Whig, of the appointment.

He said he could only do this if Grattan and the Ponsonbys assisted him. On 8 October Fitzwilliam wrote to the Duke of Portland to inform him of rumours in Ireland that Lord Westmorland was to continue as Lord Lieutenant and that if he was not announced soon as Lord Lieutenant he would resign from the government. The Duke of Portland replied that Pitt [...] "harped" [...] on needing to find Lord Westmorland another office and {{that he did not want}} the Irish Chancellor Lord FitzGibbon removed, as some Whigs were calling for. Fitzwilliam in turn responded that he would accept the office unless given a free hand in both men and measures; he would not [...] "step into Lord Westmorland's old shoes—that I put on the old trappings, and submit to the old chains" [...] and declared he would resign.|$|E
