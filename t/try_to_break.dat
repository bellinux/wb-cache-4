5|$|After the Polish {{units were}} {{defeated}} by the Russians at Šiauliai, Gen. Chłapowski decided {{to cross the border}} into Prussia and become interned there. Plater vocally criticized that decision, refused to follow orders and instead decided to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through to Warsaw and continue the struggle. However, soon after separating from the main force, accompanied by only two others, including her cousin (or uncle, sources vary), Cezary Plater, she became seriously ill. She never recovered, and she died in a manor of the Abłamowicz family in Justinavas on 23 December 1831. She was buried in the small village of Kapčiamiestis near Lazdijai. After the defeat of the uprising, her estate was confiscated by the Russian authorities.|$|E
5|$|Alan and Alice {{arrive at}} a cabin on {{an island in the}} middle of Cauldron Lake. As they unpack, Alan finds that Alice {{arranged}} this trip to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> his writer's block, scheduling him to see a Bright Falls psychologist named Dr. Hartman and leaving a typewriter in the cabin for him. Alan is infuriated and takes a short walk, but runs back when Alice cries for help. He returns to the cabin just as Alice is being dragged into the lake's waters by a mysterious force. Alan dives into the water after her, blacking out as he submerges.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Sterett had the American colors raised, {{he had his}} men {{open fire}} upon the Tripolitans at close range with muskets. In response, Tripoli {{returned}} fire with an ineffective broadside. The Americans returned fire with their own broadsides, which led Rous to break off the engagement and attempt to flee. Neither able to fight off the American vessel nor outrun her, the Tripolitans attempted to grapple Enterprise and board her. Once within musket range, Enterprise marines opened fire on the Tripoli, foiling its boarding attempt, and forced Tripoli to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> away once more. Enterprise continued the engagement, firing more broadsides into the Tripolitan and blasting a hole in her hull.|$|E

5|$|Violet Clay (1978) and A Mother and Two Daughters (1982) {{are each}} about an {{unmarried}} protagonist's career in a creative profession. In A Mother and Two Daughters {{the main character}} resists the temptation {{to get married and}} chooses instead to focus on her work. A Mother and Two Daughters and A Southern Family (1987) each depend heavily on a southern setting and employ themes traditionally associated with social problems in the South. Some of their themes include racial discrimination, social-economic class and the cultural differences between generations. Many characters struggle to reduce the gap between the rich and poor or <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> free from a dominant cultural tradition, with mixed success.|$|E
5|$|After {{securing}} {{the area around}} Arleux {{at the end of}} April, the British determined to launch another attack east from Monchy to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through the Boiry Riegel and reach the Wotanstellung, a major German defensive fortification. This was scheduled to coincide with the Australian attack at Bullecourt to present the Germans with a two–pronged assault. British commanders hoped that success in this venture would force the Germans to retreat further to the east. With this objective in mind, the British launched another attack near the Scarpe on 3 May. However, neither prong was able to make any significant advances and the attack was called off the following day after incurring heavy casualties. Although this battle was a failure, the British learned important lessons about the need for close liaison between tanks, infantry and artillery, which they would use in the Battle of Cambrai, 1917.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Coca-Cola wanted Selena {{to become one}} of their spokespeople in Texas. The jingle used in her first two {{commercials}} for the company were composed by A.B. and Chris Pérez—the latter of whom had joined Selena y Los Dinos several months earlier as the band's new guitarist. Pérez began having romantic feelings for Selena, despite having a girlfriend in San Antonio. After a trip down to Mexico with the band, Pérez thought it would be best for them both to distance himself from her, but he found that impossible and chose to try to build a relationship with her. They expressed their feelings for each other at a Pizza Hut restaurant, and shortly afterwards became a couple. Pérez and Selena hid their relationship, fearing Quintanilla, Jr. would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> it up.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 5 April, the Viet Cong's 5th Division launched another major ground assault on Lộc Ninh from the west to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through the defenses of the southern compound. American AC-130 and AH-1 Cobra gunships stopped the Viet Cong formations in their tracks, as supporting North Vietnamese tanks were either destroyed or forced to pull back. Despite having suffered many casualties {{as a result of}} U.S. air strikes, the Viet Cong continued their assaults well into the evening. In order to deal with the onslaught, Smith continued to direct the AC-130 Spectres against targets around Lộc Ninh. Vinh, on the other hand, was either planning to surrender or desert when he ordered two of his soldiers to open the gates of the command compound at around 10 pm. Throughout the night, the North Vietnamese 69th Artillery Command continued bombarding South Vietnamese positions around Lộc Ninh, as the Viet Cong massed for another assault.|$|E
5|$|That night, a {{force of}} around 300 Japanese who had been falling back since they had run into the 61st Infantry Battalion on Stephen's Ridge, {{encountered}} positions manned by the 2/12th and 9th Infantry Battalions around the Gama River. In a surprise attack, the Australians inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese. After the battle the Australians estimated that up to 90 had been killed. Following this the Japanese began to employ infiltration techniques {{in an attempt to}} pass through the numerous listening posts that had been set up {{along the side of the}} track which formed the front of one side of the 2/12th's position. Elsewhere, at the mission, starting at around 8:00pm, they carried out harassment operations in an effort to distract the Australians and assist their comrades to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through the Australian positions from the Gama River. This lasted throughout the night.|$|E
5|$|Chnodomar's {{men were}} of much less even quality than Julian's. His best warriors were the {{professional}} retinues of the regales (royal class, called ring-givers by the Germans), organized in warbands. They were well equipped with armour and swords, as behove their masters' status. The {{majority of his}} men, however, were temporary levies, lightly equipped and often inexperienced, like most contemporary Germanic forces relying on light equipment and speed. On the Alamanni side, {{there is little evidence}} of formation manoeuvres. The professional retainers of the regales may have had some capacity for this, especially as Germanic armies were by now very familiar with the Roman way of war. Ammianus' account mentions a globus (mass) of the best warriors coming together {{in the thick of the}} battle and breaking through the Roman line. In addition, several would likely have served in the Roman army in the past. But the majority of Chnodomar's men consisted of temporary levies, whose equipment and experience would have been limited. According to Ammianus, they had to rely on a concentrated frontal charge to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through by weight of numbers, and proved no match for the Romans in the final phase of the battle, a prolonged struggle of attrition at close-quarters.|$|E
