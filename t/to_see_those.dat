We need to have a light system, sound system and presentation that will be competitive with those groups.|$|E

500|$|Poole was {{inspired}} to make the film after he went with some friends to see a film called Highway Hustler. After watching the film, he said to a friend, [...] "This is the worst, ugliest movie I've ever seen! Somebody oughta {{be able to do}} something better than this." [...] Poole was convinced that he was that somebody; [...] "I wanted [...] a film that gay people could look at and say, 'I don't mind being gay - it's beautiful <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> people do what they're doing.'" [...] Having enlisted the help of his lover, Peter Fisk, and another man, Poole first shot a ten-minute segment entitled Bayside.|$|E
500|$|Besides {{a direct}} {{reference}} to the titular mythological character, Matthew VanWinkle, in the chapter [...] "Tennyson's 'Tithonus' and the Exhaustion of Survival in The X-Files", of the book The X-Files and Literature: Unweaving the Story, Unraveling the Lie to Find the Truth, argues that the episode bears {{a striking resemblance to}} Alfred, Lord Tennyson's dramatic monologue [...] "Tithonus". In the poem, one line reads [...] "Alas! For this gray shadow, once a man." [...] VanWinkle argues that in The X-Files episode, this line is paralleled by Alfred Fellig's tendency <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> about to die in a monochromatic vision. Furthermore, both the poem and the episode stress that death is not appealing because it is simply [...] "a means to an end". Rather, it is to be sought because it [...] "is the event that most fully unites us with other humans." ...|$|E

500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time. She added [...] "One of the upsides of this job {{is that in a}} week you might be doing {{absolute}} slapstick comedy, you might be doing high drama/tragedy and in between maybe some nice subtle interesting stuff as well, the character keeps changing and evolving depending on who she is interacting with". Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to be the kind character. It was good <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> dents in her armour I think".|$|E
500|$|After being {{released}} from St Luke's, Smart {{was taken to a}} private madhouse. Elizabeth LeNoir, Smart's daughter, was brought to see her father and stated that he was [...] "committed by Mr Newbery to the care of a Mr Potter who kept a private house at Bethnal Green". She described her experience as being held in a [...] "small neat parlour". However, Mr Potter's private madhouse was not [...] "homely", and Smart's treatments were far worse, as he describes: [...] "For they work on me with their harping-irons, which is a barbarous instrument, because I am more unguarded than others" [...] (Jubilate Agno B 129). Smart was left alone for four years, except for his cat Jeoffry and the occasional gawker who would come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> deemed mad. Piozzi described Smart's general situation: [...] "He was both a wit and a scholar, and visited as such while under confinement for MADNESS." [...] It is very possible that he felt [...] "homeless" [...] during his confinement and surely felt that he was in a [...] "limbo... between public and private space" [...] from being watched by outsiders.|$|E
500|$|Visual {{effects were}} done by Rocket Science VFX and Mr. X Inc. Paul Jones {{served as the}} special effects creator, who {{previously}} designed the Nemesis character in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. The production team planned to use extras to portray 300 zombies at once, but time restraints prevented that. Around 150 zombies were eventually used and Mr. X Inc's visual effects supervisor, Dennis Berardi, added more in post-production. For Alice's clones they shot motion control photography for multiple passes of Jovovich. For the wide shots they took digital photo doubles. Visual effects production manager Eric Robertson described {{the look of the}} film, [...] "interesting contrasts, pure whites, which is a staggering look. It's so clean and tight along with some real darkness too that may evoke a bit of a feel of Silent Hill. So we've got the extremes, but it's definitely a unique look for this incarnation and it's been fun <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> looks." [...] A burned cityscape with ash and smoke in the sky was created to depict a postapocalyptic Los Angeles, in which most of the film is set. Bolt described this approach as, [...] "In a world that has gone to hell in a handbasket, there's no control and no fire service, so clearly, what's going to happen to LA is it's going to get burned." ...|$|E

500|$|Reception of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics has been generally positive. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club praised the episode, gave a A- and commented that it is [...] "good to see The Simpsons try an ambitious episode, and great <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> ambitions largely fulfilled." [...] He added that episodes that [...] "give Bart extra depth ('Bart Sells His Soul' especially) are among my favorite Simpsons half-hours," [...] and noted that this episode features [...] "a side of Bart that we rarely see: someone living outside the moment. Imagining himself on his deathbed and thinking of how his whole life outside of the cruise was wasted {{is the sort of}} device typically reserved for the Simpson women, particularly Lisa." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that in the episode there [...] "are elements that will be familiar – it's another episode where a Simpson family vacation verges on disaster – but the main emotional storyline involving Bart is one The Simpsons hasn't touched on before, as a fantastic luxury cruise makes him uneasy {{about the state of the}} rest of his life." [...] Sepinwall concluded that he is [...] "always a fan of single-story Simpsons episodes, as well as ones built around an emotional issue facing a member of the family, and this has both – in addition to being funny and sweet and clever in its depiction of the Best Cruise Ever." ...|$|E

In a poll conducted by Billboard magazine, the performance was ranked as the seventh best {{in the history of}} MTV Video Music Awards. A critic wrote in the magazine: [...] "The world gave a collective 'whoa' when Beyonce unleashed her 'Single Ladies' video, but <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> dance moves come to life at the 2009 VMAs was beyond eye-popping." [...] Erika Ramirez of the same publication placed the performance at number two on her list of Beyoncé's five biggest TV performances. [...] "Single Ladies" [...] was included on the set lists of Beyoncé's I Am... Yours concerts and her I Am... World Tour. The song was subsequently included on Beyoncé's live albums [...] (2009) and I Am... World Tour (2010).

Ben Ratliff of The New York Times mentioned [...] "Single Ladies" [...] in the [...] "almost continuous high point" [...] of the concert. Rebecca Thomas of MTV News wrote that Beyoncé's dancing during [...] "Single Ladies" [...] reflected the female empowerment theme of the song.

[...] On the differences between the MCU and original versions of the characters, Van Lente noted that when Joe Simon and Jack Kirby originally created Captain America, they [...] "didn't have 20/20 hindsight to see how things would fit together with the Marvel characters to follow. With the MCU, we're able to make those connections and heighten all of the characters' weight." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Napoleon's Last Campaign, Petre {{posits that}} the Emperor Napoleon {{abandoned}} the guiding principles {{of his previous}} success, which lay in his relentless pursuit of his opponent's main army. In the Saxon Campaign, Napoleon lost sight of his primary objectives, becoming mired in secondary achievements. Petre noted also the vast increase in sheer numbers, {{on both sides of}} the contest, and predicted that in terms of numbers, [...] "we must wait for the wars of tomorrow <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> numbers exceeded."
