The solar trackers specifically are more complex structures because they involve mechanical devices, a supporting slender structure, and photovoltaic modules mounted and positioned on top of the supporting structure. Solar trackers are mounted on mobile supports or racks, in order to enable the rotation and tilt of the PV which thus maintains their optimum exposure to the incident sunlight. Solar trackers support structures should be designed for wind resistance during the operation and at stow position for its life span and this became a concern considering the new tendency of installing the solar trackers on the rooftop of low-rise or medium-rise buildings.

The supporting structure of <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> <b>tracker</b> was instrumented with 16 strain gauges and the strains developed in the metal truss members were measured during the months February 2015 and March 2015.
