Frequently, confidence and self-esteem are excessively enlarged, and grand, extravagant ideas are expressed. Behavior <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> character and risky, foolish or inappropriate may result from a loss of normal social restraint.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the same}} legend, on their journey the Zoroastrians had carried ash from a sacred fire (according to a latter-day {{embellishment}} of the story, they had carried a fire itself), which a priest {{is said to have}} then used for the bed of the Sanjan fire when it was consecrated. A related legend recounts that this fire was consecrated as Atash Bahram fires traditionally are, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 16 fires, including that of a funeral pyre, a shepherd's hearth, a goldsmith's hearth, a potter's kiln and from a fire caused by lightning.|$|E
25|$|A false consequent, in contrast, is a {{conclusion}} {{known to be}} false, fictional, imaginary, or insufficient. In a conditional statement, a fictional conclusion {{is known as a}} non sequitur, which literally means out of sequence. A conclusion <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sequence is not contingent on any premises that precede it, and it does not follow from them, so such a sequence is not conditional. A conditional sequence is a connected series of statements. A false consequent cannot follow from true premises in a connected sequence. But, on the other hand, a false consequent can follow from a false antecedent.|$|E

25|$|Self-verification motives operate for {{different}} {{dimensions of the}} self-concept and in many different situations. Men and women are equally inclined to display this tendency, {{and it does not}} matter whether the self-views refer to characteristics that are relatively immutable (e.g., intelligence) or changeable (e.g., diligence), or whether the self-views happen to be highly specific (e.g., athletic) or global (e.g., low self-esteem, worthlessness). Furthermore, when people chose negative partners over positive ones, it is not merely in an effort to avoid interacting with positive evaluators (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a concern that they might disappoint such positive evaluators). Rather, people chose self-verifying, negative partners even when the alternative is participating in a different experiment. Finally, recent work has shown that people work to verify self-views associated with group memberships. For example, women seek evaluations that confirm their belief that they possess qualities associated with being a woman.|$|E
25|$|Primates {{are well}} known for using tools for hunting or {{gathering}} food and water, cover for rain, and self-defence. Chimpanzees have been the object of study, most famously by Jane Goodall, since these animals are more-often kept in captivity than other primates and {{are closely related to}} humans. Tool-use in other primates are lesser-known as many of them are mainly observed in the wild. Many famous researchers, such as Charles Darwin in his book The Descent of Man, mentioned tool-use in monkeys (such as baboons). Both wild and captive elephants are known to create tools using their trunk and feet, mainly for swatting flies, scratching, plugging water-holes (so the water doesn't evaporate), and reaching food <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> reach. A group of dolphins in Shark Bay use sponges to protect their beak while foraging. Sea otters will dislodge food from rocks (such as abalone) and break open shellfish. Carnivores (of the order Carnivora) can use tools to trap prey or break open the shells of prey, as well as for scratching.|$|E

500|$|In ancient Taoist texts, wu-wei is {{associated}} with water through its yielding nature. Taoist philosophy, {{in accordance with the}} I Ching, proposes that the universe works harmoniously according to its own ways. When someone exerts their will against the world in a manner <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> rhythm with the cycles of change, they may disrupt that harmony and unintended consequences may more likely result rather than the willed outcome. Taoism does not identify one's will as the root problem. Rather, it asserts that one must place their will in harmony with the natural universe. Thus, a potentially harmful interference may be avoided, and in this way, goals can be achieved effortlessly. [...] "By wu-wei, the sage seeks to come into harmony with the great Tao, which itself accomplishes by nonaction." ...|$|E
500|$|Early {{editors of}} Shakespeare's works, {{beginning}} with Nicholas Rowe (1709) and Lewis Theobald (1733), combined {{material from the}} two earliest sources of Hamlet available at the time, Q2 and F1. Each text contains material that the other lacks, with many minor differences in wording: scarcely 200 lines are identical in the two. Editors have combined them {{in an effort to}} create one [...] "inclusive" [...] text that reflects an imagined [...] "ideal" [...] of Shakespeare's original. Theobald's version became standard for a long time, and his [...] "full text" [...] approach continues to influence editorial practice to the present day. Some contemporary scholarship, however, discounts this approach, instead considering [...] "an authentic Hamlet an unrealisable ideal. ... there are texts of this play but no text". The 2006 publication by Arden Shakespeare of different Hamlet texts in different volumes is perhaps evidence of this shifting focus and emphasis. Other editors have continued to argue the need for well-edited editions taking material from all versions of the play. Colin Burrow has argued that [...] "most of us should read a text that is made up by conflating all three versions ... it's about as likely that Shakespeare wrote: [...] "To be or not to be, ay, there's the point" [...] , as that he wrote the works of Francis Bacon. I suspect most people just won't want to read a three-text play ... a version of the play <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> touch with the needs of a wider public." ...|$|E
