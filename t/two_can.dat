5|$|Antrodia serialiformis {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to A.serialis, but the latter has larger spores (6.3–8 by 2.2–3.3µm). The <b>two</b> <b>can</b> be distinguished in the field by their substrate preferences: while A.serialis usually fruits on coniferous wood, A.serialiformis grows strictly on old decorticated oak trunks.|$|E

5|$|Pluteus aurantiorugosus is {{very similar}} to P.nevadensis in {{external}} appearance, and the <b>two</b> <b>can</b> only be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics or DNA sequence. In contrast to the latter species, the former has oblong spores, and cystidia that are shorter and less slender. P.aurantiorugosus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but rare.|$|E

5|$|In 1961 Sellers {{made his}} directorial debut with Mr. Topaze, {{in which he}} also starred. The film {{was based on the}} Marcel Pagnol play Topaze. Sellers portrayed an ex-schoolmaster in a small French town who turns to a life of crime to obtain wealth. The film and Sellers's directorial {{abilities}} received an unenthusiastic response from the public and critics alike, and Sellers rarely referred to it again. The same year he starred in the Sidney Gilliat-directed Only <b>Two</b> <b>Can</b> Play, a film based on the novel That Uncertain Feeling by Kingsley Amis. He was nominated for the Best British Actor award at the 16th British Academy Film Awards for his role as John Lewis, a frustrated Welsh librarian whose affections swing between the glamorous Liz (Mai Zetterling), and his long-suffering wife Jean (Virginia Maskell).|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, {{it is not easy to}} assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the <b>two</b> <b>can</b> thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus volemus {{is closely}} related to L.corrugis, and {{generally}} similar in appearance. L.corrugis usually has more surface wrinkles, darker gills, weaker or absent scent, and less orange colouration; however, intermediate colour forms can be found. The <b>two</b> <b>can</b> be distinguished more definitively by microscopic characteristics: L.corrugis has larger spores—typically 10.4–12.8 by 9.6–11.8µm—with a coarser surface reticulum, and larger pleurocystidia. The species Lactifluus austrovolemus {{is closely related}}, but has more crowded gills, while L.lamprocystidiatus can only be reliably distinguished from L.volemus by microscopic characteristics: the reticulations on its spores are taller and more acute, and the meshes formed by the intersections of the reticulations are smaller. Both L.austrovolemus and L.lamprocystidiatus are known only from Papua New Guinea. Lactifluus hygrophoroides also resembles L.volemus, but differs in having widely spaced gills, and spores that lack surface reticulations.|$|E

5|$|Nearly {{every action}} (or lack thereof) affects how the player is judged by their followers: the player {{may be seen}} as a good god, an evil one, or {{in-between}} the two. The land, interface (including the hand), and music change according to that alignment. A good god's temple is brightly coloured, while an evil god's is designed to look intimidating. It is not necessary to consistently perform acts of either alignment and a mixture of the <b>two</b> <b>can</b> be used to stay neutral. The player has two advisors, one good and the other evil, who try to persuade the player to do things their according to their alignment.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 2009, the Hall of Fame {{announced}} new by-law additions {{which will}} be implemented on January 1, 2010. Starting in 2010, male and female players are considered for induction separately and a maximum of two women can be inducted as players per year. The by-law also clarifies that a builder {{does not need to}} have been a coach, manager or executive to be inducted. Although they remain separate categories, the builders and on-ice officials are considered on the same ballot and a combined maximum of <b>two</b> <b>can</b> be inducted each year. The Board of Directors will now meet at least once every five years to consider potential changes to the limits.|$|E

5|$|Some {{populations of}} cattle egrets are migratory, others are dispersive, and {{distinguishing}} between the <b>two</b> <b>can</b> {{be difficult for}} this species. In many areas populations can be both sedentary and migratory. In the northern hemisphere, migration is from cooler climes to warmer areas, but cattle egrets nesting in Australia migrate to cooler Tasmania and New Zealand {{in the winter and}} return in the spring. Migration in western Africa is in response to rainfall, and in South America migrating birds travel south of their breeding range in the non-breeding season. Populations in southern India appear to show local migrations in response to the monsoons. They move north from Kerala after September. During winter, many birds have been seen flying at night with flocks of Indian pond herons (Ardeola grayii) on the south-eastern coast of India and a winter influx has also been noted in Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|The Thanhouser {{production}} is {{an adaptation of}} {{only part of the}} novel. The film departs significantly from the original plot, such as in the omission of the double-wedding scene. It begins with Dr Charles Primrose, the vicar of Wakefield, attending a picnic with his landlord Squire Thornhill. The vicar does not like Squire Thornhill, who is reputed to be a degenerate young man, but he has no reservations once he sees Thornhill's interest in his daughter, Olivia. The next scene shows Squire Thornhill convincing Olivia to elope with him, so the <b>two</b> <b>can</b> be married. But Squire Thornhill has no intention of marrying her, and commissions a farmer to arrange a fake wedding ceremony. The farmer accepts, but shakes his fist in anger at the squire after he has departed.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of the D line means it has been detected in many other astronomical environments. In stars, it is seen in any whose surfaces are cool enough for sodium to exist in atomic form (rather than ionised). This corresponds to stars of roughly F-type and cooler. Many other stars {{appear to have a}} sodium absorption line, but this is actually caused by gas in the foreground interstellar medium. The <b>two</b> <b>can</b> be distinguished via high-resolution spectroscopy, because interstellar lines are much narrower than those broadened by stellar rotation.|$|E

5|$|At the wedding, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{arrives with}} her husband Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), where Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) surprises them with a baby, his son Drake, that he had with a former girlfriend who then {{abandoned}} them both. Jim tells Dwight that under Schrute tradition, he {{is not allowed to}} be best man as he is younger than him. Jim surprises him with the arrival of Michael Scott (Steve Carell). The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man. At the reception, Michael shows Pam pictures of his kids with Holly Flax, and Pam notes that he is paying for two phones just to hold all the images. Ryan deliberately gives Drake an allergic reaction so that Ravi, a pediatrician, can attend and Ryan can steal Kelly away. Kevin tells Ravi that Ryan wanted him to keep Drake so that Ryan can have Kelly and the <b>two</b> <b>can</b> start a new life together. Ravi then gives Kevin the baby to give to Child Services before leaving, but Nellie, who has still been wanting a child, takes Drake instead.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) gets a {{surprise}} {{phone call from}} her ex-boyfriend, Floyd DeBarber (Jason Sudeikis), who says he will be coming to New York and wants {{to have dinner with}} her. She begins to hope that the <b>two</b> <b>can</b> get back together, however, while watching The Today Show she discovers that he is getting married to a woman named Kaitlin (Kristin McGee). Her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), warns her not to attempt revenge; nevertheless, Liz invites Floyd to a seafood restaurant where she had food poisoning on three separate occasions. He does not get food poisoning, but instead, Floyd, a recovering alcoholic, gets drunk off of the whiskey-based fish sauce. The two get into an argument, and after Floyd insults her, Liz leaves the restaurant. The next day, Floyd appears on The Today Show, but still drunk from the night before, refuses to leave the 30 Rock building. Liz apologizes to both Floyd and Kaitlin for getting him drunk. They accept the apology, and Kaitlin asks Liz to be a participant in their wedding, to which she agrees.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Depression <b>Two</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced back}} to a disorganized {{tropical}} wave that was first noted by the NHC on June 24 as it moved off the western coast of Africa, and into the Atlantic Ocean. Moving towards the west, the wave showed no signs of organization until July3 as it entered the western Caribbean Sea. During the 24hours that followed, it continued to coalesce, and the NHC subsequently increased the disturbance's chance of developing into a tropical cyclone. A defined surface circulation did not form {{as a result of the}} wave's movement over the Yucatan Peninsula, and the system lost organization. The system remained disorganized as it traversed the peninsula and eventually emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on July7. Situated over water once more, the wave was able to gradually develop as it moved in a northwesterly direction. Following a reconnaissance mission, the NHC noted in their Tropical Weather Outlook that there was a high chance of the system developing into a tropical cyclone within the next 48hours.|$|E

5|$|Today, many {{wildebeest}} {{populations are}} experiencing rapid declines. Overland migration as a biological process requires large connected landscapes, which are {{increasingly difficult to}} maintain, particularly over the long term, when human demands on the landscape compete. The most acute threat comes from migration barriers, such as fences and roads. In {{one of the more}} striking examples of the consequences of fence-building on terrestrial migrations, Botswanan authorities placed thousands of kilometres of fences across the Kalahari that prevented wildebeests from reaching watering holes and grazing grounds, resulting in the deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals, reducing the wildebeest population to less than 10% of its previous size. Illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many areas, along with natural threats posed by main predators (such as lions, leopards, hunting dogs and hyenas). Where the black and blue wildebeest share a common range, the <b>two</b> <b>can</b> hybridise, and this is regarded as a potential threat to the black wildebeest.|$|E
