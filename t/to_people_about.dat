25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>about</b> this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} Monaco was first prototyped when Andy Schatz {{was working for}} TKO Software, a video game {{development}} company based in Santa Cruz, California. The game was originally inspired by the top-down minimap in the Hitman series and was described by Schatz as being similar to Jason Rohrer's 2014 video game The Castle Doctrine during its early stages of development. His original plans were to release Monaco as an Xbox Live Indie Games title, made within six weeks. He {{said that when he}} was talking <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>about</b> it at this stage, he described it as [...] "The Sims meets Diablo meets Hitman". The development at TKO was done in three weeks while the company solicited paying work. Before TKO shut down in 2005, Schatz left and founded his own independent company, Pocketwatch Games. After Pocketwatch Games experimented with simulation games, such as 2006 Independent Games Festival finalist [...] and Wildlife Tycoon: Venture Dinosauria, Schatz prototyped an early version of Monaco using Microsoft XNA as to see if it worked on the Xbox 360.|$|E

He stated once that he [...] "just happened to be there". He spoke to his wife once about the flag raising during their 47-year marriage. That was on their first date, and he seemed very uninterested with it during the conversation. His daughter Barbara said that “Reading a book on Iwo Jima at home would have been like reading a playgirl magazine…it would have been something I had to hide.” He told his children more than once that the only real heroes on Iwo Jima were those that did not survive.|$|E

60|$|It was Mr. Britling's {{case for}} Hugh {{that he was}} {{something}} exceptional, something exceptionally good, and that the peculiar need there was {{to take care of}} him was due to a delicacy of nerve and fibre that was ultimately a virtue. The boy was quick, quick to hear, quick to move, very accurate in his swift way, he talked unusually soon, he began to sketch at an early age with an incurable roughness and a remarkable expressiveness. That he was sometimes ungainly, often untidy, that he would become so mentally preoccupied as to be uncivil <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>about</b> him, that he caught any malaise that was going, was all a part of that. The sense of Mrs. Britling's unexpressed criticisms, the implied contrasts with the very jolly, very uninspired younger family, kept up a nervous desire in Mr. Britling for evidences and manifestations of Hugh's quality. Not always with happy results; it caused much mutual irritation, but not enough to prevent the growth of a real response on Hugh's part to his father's solicitude. The youngster knew and felt that his father was his father just as certainly as he felt that Mrs. Britling was not his mother. To his father he brought his successes and to his father he appealed.|$|E
60|$|In {{my early}} journalistic days, I served upon a paper, {{the forerunner of}} many very popular {{periodicals}} of the present day. Our boast was that we combined instruction with amusement; as to what {{should be regarded as}} affording amusement and what instruction, the reader judged for himself. We gave advice <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>about</b> to marry--long, earnest advice that would, had they followed it, have made our circle of readers the envy of the whole married world. We told our subscribers how to make fortunes by keeping rabbits, giving facts and figures. The thing that must have surprised them was that we ourselves did not give up journalism and start rabbit-farming. Often and often have I proved conclusively from authoritative sources how a man starting a rabbit farm with twelve selected rabbits and a little judgment must, at the end of three years, be in receipt of an income of two thousand a year, rising rapidly; he simply could not help himself. He might not want the money. He might {{not know what to do}} with it when he had it. But there it was for him. I have never met a rabbit farmer myself worth two thousand a year, though I have known many start with the twelve necessary, assorted rabbits. Something has always gone wrong somewhere; maybe the continued atmosphere of a rabbit farm saps the judgment.|$|E
6000|$|That evening--the {{evening of}} {{his return from}} Beauclere--he was {{conscious}} of a keen desire to get away, to go abroad, to leave behind him the little chatter his resignation would be sure to produce {{in an age of}} publicity which never discriminated as to the quality of events. Then he felt it decidedly better to stay, to see the business through on the spot. Besides, he would have to meet his constituents--would a parcel of cheese-eating burgesses ever have been [...] "met" [...] on so queer an occasion?--and when that was over the incident would practically be closed. Nick had an idea he knew in advance how it would affect him to be pointed at as a person who had given up a considerable chance of eventual [...] "office" [...] to take likenesses at so much a head. He wouldn't attempt down at Harsh to touch on the question of motive; for, given the nature of the public mind of Harsh, that would be a strain on his faculty of exposition. But as regards the chaff of the political world and of society he had a hope he should find chaff enough for retorts. It was true that when his mother twitted him in her own effective way he had felt rather flattened out; but then one's mother might have a heavier hand than any one else. He had not thrown up the House of Commons to amuse himself; he had thrown it up to work, to sit quietly down and bend over his task. If he should go abroad his parent might think he had some weak-minded view of joining Julia and trying, with however little hope, to win her back--an illusion it would be singularly pernicious to encourage. His desire for Julia's society had succumbed for the present at any rate to a dire interruption--he had become more and more aware of their speaking a different language. Nick felt like a young man who has gone to the Rhineland to [...] "get up" [...] his German for an examination--committed to talk, to read, to dream only in the new idiom. Now that he had taken his jump everything was simplified, {{at the same time that}} everything was pitched in a higher and intenser key; and he wondered how in the absence of a common dialect he had conversed on the whole so happily with Mrs. Dallow. Then he had aftertastes of understandings tolerably independent of words. He was excited because every fresh responsibility is exciting, and there was no manner of doubt he had accepted one. No one knew what it was but himself--Gabriel Nash scarcely counted, his whole attitude on the question of responsibility being so fantastic--and he would have to ask his dearest friends to take him on trust. Rather indeed he would ask nothing of any one, but would cultivate independence, mulishness, and gaiety, and fix his thoughts on a bright if distant morrow. It was disagreeable to have to remember that his task would not be sweetened by a sense of heroism; for if it might be heroic to give up the muses for the strife of great affairs, no romantic glamour worth speaking of would ever gather round an Englishman who in the prime of his strength had given up great or even small affairs for the muses. Such an original might himself privately and perversely regard certain phases of this inferior commerce as a great affair; but who would give him the benefit of that sort of confidence--except indeed a faithful, clever, exalted little sister Biddy, if he should have the good luck to have one? Biddy was in fact all ready for heroic flights and eager to think she might fight the battle of the beautiful by her brother's side; so that he had really to moderate her and remind her how little his actual job was a crusade with bugles and banners and how much a grey, sedentary grind, the charm of which was all at the core. You might have an emotion about it, and an emotion that would be a help, but this was not the sort of thing you could show--the end in view would seem so disproportionately small. Nick put it to her that one really couldn't talk <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>about</b> the [...] "responsibility" [...] of what she would see him pottering at in his studio.|$|E
