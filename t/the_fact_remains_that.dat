5|$|Nos. 607 and 609 Squadrons {{engaged the}} Germans {{south-west}} of The Needles. The British reported 30–40 Bf 110s with 15 Do 17s in support. The tonnage of bombs dropped suggested {{there were fewer}} bombers than claimed. The RAF fighters claimed four Do 17s. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> the Germans penetrated the airspace without interception and {{came very close to}} inflicting critical damage to the Spitfire factory. The radar had done its job and alerted No. 11 and 10 Group 20 minutes before the bombs started to fall. The fault lay either with the No. 10 or 11 Group controllers who were late in ordering their Squadrons to scramble.|$|E
25|$|Mende can {{be granted}} a special status to orienteering, an {{individual}} sport with team competitions. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> Mende is {{playing in the}} elite league of France, and M. G. C. Pétanque and its three veteran champions of France in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The general {{physical}} {{degradation of}} material resources {{taking place in}} the economy can neither be explained nor described by the entropy law (Georgescu's first mistake); but <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> such physical degradation does take place all the time — continuously, irreversibly and in a variety of ways.|$|E

25|$|Baldwin is {{now seen}} as having done more than most and perhaps as much as was {{possible}} in the context, but <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> it was not enough to deter the aggressors or ensure their defeat. Less equivocal was his rediscovery as a moderate and inclusive Conservative for the modern age, part of a 'one nation tradition'.|$|E
25|$|The already poor {{knowledge}} of Aix history from Roman times is further obscured {{due to the}} lack of sources regarding the end of the Roman Empire and the early Middle Ages. We are left to conjecture by studying the destruction from the barbarian invasions that have left traces of fires on Gallo-Roman villas of the area, such as at Arbin. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> the Roman Baths of Aix fell to ruins from the fifth century and traces of urban development are lost.|$|E
25|$|Now, as it happened, I had {{confined}} myself {{strictly to}} the business of clearing the line, which was entrusted to me, and although I do not pretend that I considered the matter in its legal aspect at the time, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> I did not give a shot, nor was I armed when captured. I therefore claimed {{to be included in the}} same category as the civilian railway officials and men of the breakdown gang, whose declared duty it was to clear the line, pointing out that though my action might differ in degree from theirs, it was of precisely the same character, and that if they were regarded as non-combatants I had a right to be considered a non-combatant too.|$|E

"I am sorry," [...] Arnold replied, [...] "if {{anything}} I said to {{your sister}} {{has given her}} <b>that</b> impression. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains,</b> however, <b>that</b> Mrs. Weatherley has declined to give me any explanation of various incidents which were certainly more than bewildering.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains,</b> however, <b>that</b> Jane Austen's {{universe}} is a privileged world which conceals {{the harshness of}} the living conditions {{of the vast majority}} of the rural population, a population which is impoverished, uneducated and brutal. Thus common amusements include the omnipresent dog fighting and cockfighting. In the spirit of the times, this brutality is considered by many politicians as being necessary to get the British people accustomed to the sight of blood, and to forge [...] "the true British bulldog character".|$|R
25|$|Jewish {{historians have}} stated {{that it is hard}} to {{describe}} the national sense of shock and trauma that set in when the masses of Jews all over the world learned that someone as famous as Sabbatai Zevi had officially abandoned his faith for Islam. However, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> Zevi is the most famous Jew to have become a Muslim, which is also what the term Sabbatean has come to denote. Many within Zevi's inner circle followed him into Islam, including his wife Sarah and most of his closest relatives and friends. Nathan of Gaza, the scholar closest to Zevi, who had caused Zevi to reveal his Messiahship and in turn became his prophet, never followed his master into Islam but remained a Jew, albeit excommunicated by his Jewish brethren.|$|E
25|$|As Governor Bush's {{counsel in}} Texas, Gonzales also {{reviewed}} all clemency requests. A 2003 article in The Atlantic Monthly asserted that Gonzales gave insufficient counsel, {{and failed to}} second-guess convictions and failed appeals. Gonzales' deputy general counsel from 1995 to 1999, Pete Wassdorf, in turn sought to defend Gonzales from what he characterized as an inaccurate and incomplete picture of the clemency process under Bush. Under Section II, Article 4 of the Texas Constitution, the Governor cannot grant a pardon or commute a death sentence except with a majority vote recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, so Bush was constrained in granting clemency {{even if he had}} wanted to do so in a case. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> only one death sentence was overturned by Governor Bush, and the state of Texas executed more prisoners during Gonzales's term than any other state.|$|E
25|$|Organ {{donation}} is {{fast becoming}} an important bioethical issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black market trend {{often referred to as}} transplant tourism. The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice {{on the one hand and}} a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the organ trade should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not. Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure. These studies looked only at people who sold a kidney in countries where organ sales are already legal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of such applications is {{the mission of}} vacuum nanoelectronics. However, field emitters work best in conditions of good ultrahigh vacuum. Their most successful applications to date (FEM, FES and EM guns) have occurred in these conditions. <b>The</b> sad <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> field emitters and industrial vacuum conditions do not go well together, and the related problems of reliably ensuring good [...] "vacuum robustness" [...] of field emission sources used in such conditions still await better solutions (probably cleverer materials solutions) than we currently have.|$|R
40|$|Recognition of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that bovine {{mastitis}} {{is the most}} costly single cattle disease is disconcerting to the conscientious veterinarian.

60|$|I could {{judge from}} {{the terror of}} de Meneval, {{as well as from}} the scene which I had {{witnessed}} with Admiral Bruix, what the influence was which the Emperor exercised over those who were around him. They were never at their ease, always upon the brink of a catastrophe, encouraged one day only to be rudely rebuffed the next, bullied in public and slighted in private, and yet, in spite of it all, <b>the</b> singular <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> they loved him and served him as no monarch has been loved and served.|$|R
500|$|In 1641, the Massachusetts Body of Liberties was enacted, codifying {{rules about}} slavery, {{among many other}} things. [...] Winthrop {{was a member of}} the {{committee}} which drafted the code, but his exact role is not known because records of the committee have not survived. [...] C.S.

500|$|Walpole, {{though he}} was devoted to the works of Trollope, and {{published}} a study of him, {{thought that there was}} no real comparison between the two of them: [...] "I am far too twisted and fantastic a novelist ever to succeed in catching Trollope's marvellous normality." [...] Priestley was less impressed by the supposed Trollopian side of Walpole's work, finding some of it formulaic. He was more taken with a darker, Dostoyevskian, side that he found in the writing: [...] "suddenly it will transform the pleasant easy scene he is giving us into transparency behind which are bright stars and red hellfire... No matter how jolly and zestful he may appear to be, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> he possesses an unusually sharp sense of evil." ...|$|E
500|$|Maurice Richardson, {{writing in}} The Observer, lamented that [...] "perhaps Ian Fleming was very tired {{when he wrote}} it. Perhaps... he left it unrevised. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> this posthumous Bond is a sadly sub-standard job." [...] His praise for the novel was muted, admitting [...] "it isn't of course by any means totally {{unreadable}} but it's depressingly far from the best Bond." [...] Writing in The Observers sister paper, The Guardian, Christopher Wordsworth noted that [...] "since Goldfinger 007 has been toiling hopelessly {{in the wake of}} the Zeitgeist." [...] Prior to this novel, Wordsworth writes, [...] "the distance between Live and let Die, Ian Fleming's second and best, and You Only Live Twice, his last and worst, is a long iron down the Sandwich fairway."

60|$|Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> indisputable <b>that</b> domesticated varieties, {{of animals}} and of plants, which differ greatly from one another in structure, but which are {{certainly}} descended from the same aboriginal species, such as the races of the fowl, pigeon, many vegetables, {{and a host of}} other productions, are extremely fertile when crossed; and this seems to make a broad and impassable barrier between domestic varieties and natural species. But, as I will now attempt to show, the distinction is not so great and overwhelmingly important as it at first appears.|$|R

On the surface {{that is what it}} appears to be, although some would argue that the "winwin" is not necessarily in equivalent terms. But that is for them to argue it out. What is sad of course is that another part of peninsular Malaysia is now no longer with us. <b>The</b> historical <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> <b>that</b> Pulau Batu Putih used to {{be an integral part of}} the Johor sultanate as documented in the ICJ submission...|$|R

If we could in {{imagination}} disregard for a moment all question of how the hours of work are to be shortened and how production is to be maintained and ask only what would be the ideal number of the daily hours of compulsory work, for character's sake, few of us would put them at more than four or five. Many of us, as applied to ourselves, at least, would take a chance on character at two.|$|R

As might be expected, church schools such as Blue Coat are keen to stress their egalitarian philosophy and principles, and the good work performed by school pupils in the local community. To the school's credit it is a regular supporter of many local good causes, with Rochdale Hospice in particular traditionally being a major benefactor.|$|R
