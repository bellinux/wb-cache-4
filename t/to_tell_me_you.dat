500|$|Throughout the song, {{the narrator}} {{addresses}} an unidentified girl, asking [...] "When {{will you come}} with me", and lamenting {{the fact that she}} laughs at him for having nothing to his name. He tells her he wants to give her his hopes and bring her freedom, that [...] "the earth is turning under your feet" [...] and [...] "the waters of life are flowing free", yet she persists in scorning him. He asks why she laughs at the pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on going, with nothing to his name. At last, he tells her that he has waited for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to grab her by the hands, to [...] "take you away with me". As he sees her hands tremble, and her eyes [...] "overflow with tears", he asks her, [...] "Do you really mean <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>you</b> love me as I am?" ...|$|E
500|$|In his 1908 autobiography, Barrington repeats a {{line from}} a first night review of his {{performance}} as Dr Daly in The Sorcerer: [...] "Mr Barrington is wonderful. [...] He always manages to sing one-sixteenth of a tone flat; it's so like a vicar." [...] Barrington {{went on to say}} that producer Richard D'Oyly Carte later came to see him, saying, [...] "...what's the matter? ...some one has just come out of the stalls <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>you</b> are singing in tune. [...] It will never do." [...] Barrington said that [...] "This pleased me so much that I have never sung flat since, except, of course, when I wished...." [...] Several contemporaries did find Barrington's singing occasionally flat, including Francois Cellier. Many years later, in her memoir, Ellaline Terriss wrote: [...] "...dear old Rutland scarcely ever did sing in tune – but how grand he was.... He had a beautifully clear diction and a marvellous sense of timing – and was one of the finest singers of the then popular topical songs that our stage ever knew." [...] Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald wrote of Barrington in his 1899 book, The Savoy Opera, [...] "His peculiar tranquil or impassive style has always exactly suited the characters allotted to him, and it would now be difficult to imagine a Savoy opera without him. However, Barrington's performance as Dr Daly impressed the critics and audiences, and he won a permanent place in D'Oyly Carte's company.|$|E
