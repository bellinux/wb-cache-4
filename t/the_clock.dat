Tech backup quarterback Nick Sorensen then entered the game, and running back Andre Kendrick gained a first down with a run to the 33-yard line. Kendrick then gained a first down at the Alabama 39-yard line. Kendrick {{continued to}} advance the ball with short runs, draining <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> to secure the Tech lead.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>clock</b> and {{carillon}} (bell tower) of 23 bells {{was erected}} in 1922, {{the same year}} as Lutyens' memorial, on the corn exchange in the town centre. Three of the bells were inscribed with names of casualties from the war, chosen to represent all of Spalding's war dead, while others were inscribed with names of those involved in the commemorations. The corn exchange was demolished in 1972 and replaced with the South Holland Centre, an arts venue, with <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> and carillon re-housed in a tower on the roof. After refurbishment of the South Holland Centre in 1998, a new glass tower was built to house <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> and carillon after the bells were cleaned. On Armistice Day (11 November) 1998, the Western Front Association unveiled a plaque on the South Holland Centre to explain the significance of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> tower.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Bily <b>Clocks</b> Museum {{is located}} in Spillville, Iowa. <b>The</b> museum {{contains}} <b>clocks</b> that were made by hand from the years 1913 to 1958. <b>The</b> <b>clocks</b> were made by Frank and Joseph Bily, together known as the Bily brothers. <b>The</b> <b>clocks</b> include <b>the</b> American Pioneer <b>Clock,</b> {{a version of the}} World's Smallest Church and <b>the</b> Apostles Parade <b>Clock.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>clock</b> has its {{original}} medieval face. As well as showing {{the time on}} a 24-hour dial, it reflects {{the motion of the}} Sun and Moon, the phases of the Moon, and the time since the last new Moon. The astronomical dial represents a geocentric or pre-Copernican view of the universe, with the Sun and Moon revolving round a central fixed Earth, like that of <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> at Ottery St Mary. The quarters are chimed by a quarter jack {{in the form of a}} small automaton known as Jack Blandifers, who hits two bells with hammers and two with his heels. At the striking of <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> jousting knights appear above <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> face.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{returned}} the kick to their 43-yard line, and the Hokies proceeded {{to run out}} <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> by executing running plays—which do not stop <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> at their conclusion. Tempers ran high among Texas players, and Texas defender Stoney Clark was ejected from the game after throwing the football at a Virginia Tech player following {{the conclusion of a}} play. Texas was assessed two personal-foul penalties, which advanced the ball to the Texas 31-yard line and gave Virginia Tech a first down. Tech continued to run down <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> with rushing plays, and the Hokies brought in freshman backup quarterback Al Clark to supervise the game's final plays. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> rolled to zero, and Virginia Tech secured a 2810 victory.|$|E

25|$|Each {{time the}} {{pendulum}} swings through its centre position, it releases one tooth of the escape wheel (g). The force of <b>the</b> <b>clock's</b> mainspring or a driving weight {{hanging from a}} pulley, transmitted through <b>the</b> <b>clock's</b> gear train, causes the wheel to turn, and a tooth presses {{against one of the}} pallets (h), giving the pendulum a short push. <b>The</b> <b>clock's</b> wheels, geared to the escape wheel, move forward a fixed amount with each pendulum swing, advancing <b>the</b> <b>clock's</b> hands at a steady rate.|$|R

5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn {{began to run}} out <b>the</b> <b>clock.</b> The Tigers failed {{to pick up a}} first down, and after going three and out, punted the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies started their drive at their two-yard line, and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20-yard pass, rushing for 10yards, then completing a five-yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield. On the fourth play of the drive, however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. The Tigers, their offense again on the field, began running out <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> again. Tech attempted to interrupt Auburn's clock management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> with each timeout. Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three and out, and the Tigers again punted the ball away with 2:13 remaining.|$|E

Mikhail sacrifices himself with a grenade, causing the car to crash into the tower's main courtyard and separating Jill and Carlos briefly. At <b>the</b> <b>Clock</b> Tower, Jill summons the helicopter by ringing <b>the</b> <b>Clock</b> Tower's bell before being confronted by Nemesis, which destroys the helicopter and infects Jill with the T-virus. Jill manages to temporarily defeat Nemesis but falls unconscious due to the T-Virus. Carlos finds Jill and takes her to safety within <b>the</b> <b>Clock</b> Tower. Three days later, he manages to find a cure for Jill's T-Virus infection in the Raccoon City General Hospital. He returns to Jill and injects her with a vaccine, saving her.|$|E

5|$|California {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 35-yard line following the post-touchdown kickoff and a short return. The Bears began to run out <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> rushing the ball more than passing it, as had been the trend throughout the game. Though Aaron Rodgers completed four passes during the drive for 38yards, J. J. Arrington and Vincent Strang rushed the ball a total of eight times during the possession. California ran 7:09 off <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> before Vincent Strang broke free for a 13-yard rush {{that resulted in a}} touchdown. The score restored California's 14-point lead, making the game 49–35 with 6:26 remaining.|$|E

5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff merely needing {{to run down}} <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> to secure its lead and the win. Twocomplete passes set up a third-and-two for Drew Weatherford, but his third-down pass fell short, stopping <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> and forcing a Florida State punt. Only {{a minute and a}} half had run off <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> and Virginia Tech recovered the punt at its 22-yard line. On the second play after the punt, Florida State committed a pass interference penalty that gave Virginia Tech 15automatic yards and a first down. As in the previous drive, the penalty kick-started the Virginia Tech offense. On the next play, Vick connected with Josh Morgan on a 50-yard pass—the longest offensive play of the game—that drove the Hokies to the Florida State nine-yard line. After that, a Florida State holding penalty gave Virginia Tech a first-and-goal from inside the FSU five-yard line. Marcus Vick scrambled fouryards for the touchdown, and what had been a 24-point Seminole lead was now cut to 11points. The drive had taken just 55seconds off <b>the</b> <b>clock,</b> and it appeared that Virginia Tech still had a chance to make it a close game. As before, Virginia Tech attempted a two-point conversion, and as before, it failed. With 10:50 remaining in the game, the score was now Florida State 27, Virginia Tech 15.|$|E
