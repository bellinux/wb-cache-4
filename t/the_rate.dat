5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E

5|$|Aurelian's {{attempt to}} reform the {{currency}} had failed; the denarius was dead. Diocletian restored the three-metal coinage and issued better quality pieces. The new system consisted of five coins: the aureus/solidus, a gold coin weighing, like its predecessors, one-sixtieth of a pound; the argenteus, a coin weighing one ninety-sixth of a pound and containing ninety-five percent pure silver; the follis, {{sometimes referred to as}} the laureatus A, which is a copper coin with added silver struck at <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of thirty-two to the pound; the radiatus, a small copper coin struck at <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of 108 to the pound, with no added silver; and a coin known today as the laureatus B, a smaller copper coin struck at <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of 192 to the pound. Since the nominal values of these new issues were lower than their intrinsic worth as metals, the state was minting these coins at a loss. This practice could be sustained only by requisitioning precious metals from private citizens in exchange for state-minted coin (of a far lower value than the price of the precious metals requisitioned).|$|E
