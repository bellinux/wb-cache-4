50|$|Containerboard, (CCM or {{corrugated}} case material) {{is a type}} {{of paperboard}} specially manufactured for the production of corrugated board. It includes both linerboard and corrugating medium (or fluting), the two types of paper that make up corrugated board. Since containerboard is made mainly out of natural unbleached wood fibers, it is generally brown, although its shade may vary {{depending on the type of}} wood, pulping process, recycling rate and impurities content. For certain boxes that demand good presentation, white bleached pulp or coating is used on the <b>top</b> <b>ply</b> of the linerboard that goes outside the box.|$|E
50|$|A liquid {{packaging}} board {{might be}} up to five plies and is formed on a multi-ply paper machine with online coating. The most common is to use three plies with a basis weight of about 300 g/m2. The base or middle ply is normally made of pulp from bleached or unbleached chemical pulp, CTMP or broke (waste paper from a paper machine). CTMP gives more bulk and stiffness. The <b>top</b> <b>ply</b> (inside) is made of bleached chemical pulp. The barrier coating depend of the application and might be applied on both sides. When induction welding is employed an aluminum foil layer is used for barrier protection and for heating. The {{back side of the}} board is the printing side and might have an extra ply made from chemical pulp of quality that is suitable for the printing applications. Liquid packages are normally heat sealed.|$|E
40|$|Expanded {{graphite}} was {{compressed into}} graphite sheets {{and used as}} a coating for carbon fiber reinforced PMR- 15 composites. BET analysis of the graphite indicated an increase in graphite pore size on compression, however the material was proven {{to be an effective}} barrier to oxygen when prepegged with PMR- 15 resin. Oxygen permeability of the PMR- 15 /graphite was an order of magnitude lower than the compressed graphite sheet. By providing a barrier to oxygen permeation, the rate of oxidative degradation of PMR- 15 was decreased. As a result, the composite thermo-oxidative stability increased by up to 25 %. The addition of a graphite sheet as a <b>top</b> <b>ply</b> on the composites yielded little change in the material's flexural strength or interlaminar shear strength...|$|E
40|$|The {{material}} behavior under dynamic processes, such as ballistic impacts, demands a deep knowledge of high-rate testing techniques, dynamic material response and dynamic material models. In this field, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) composites {{have been proven}} to be extremely effective against such threats. During a ballistic impact, a transverse shock wave travels through the material layers. When the shock wave is reflected at the rear face of the component, tensile stresses are created through the material thickness. This dynamic sequence produces a damage mechanism which combines shearing within the <b>top</b> <b>plies</b> of the material, and bulging and delamination at the rear face of the component...|$|R
40|$|Laminated fiber-reinforced {{composite}} stiffened {{plate with}} [0 / 90 /plus or minus 45]s plies made of S-Glass/epoxy are evaluated via computational simulation to study damage and fracture progression. The loads are pressure and temperature which varies from 21 to 65. 5 C (case I) and from 143. 3 to 21 C (case II). An integrated computer code {{is used for}} the simulation of the damage progression. Results show that damage initiation begins at low load level, with matrix cracking at the 0 deg. (bottom and <b>top)</b> <b>plies,</b> fiber fracture at the bottom (0 deg.) ply and interply delamination at the <b>top</b> (0 deg.) <b>ply.</b> Increasing the applied pressure, the damage growth is expended resulting in fracture through the thickness of the structure. At this stage, 90 percent of the plies damage at applied pressure 15. 306 MPa for the case I and 15. 036 MPa for the case II. After this stage the cracks propagate rapidly and the structure collapses...|$|R
40|$|The {{creasing}} and folding {{behavior of}} three paperboards {{have been studied}} both experimentally and numerically. Creasing and folding studies were performed on strips in both the machine direction and the cross machine direction. A finite element model that mimicked the experimental creasing and folding setup was developed, and the creasing and folding behavior could be well predicted for all three paperboards. An experimental characterization scheme consisting of three experiments was proposed, and was shown to be sufficient to predict the creasing and folding behavior. For the whole paperboard the shear strength profiles in the through thickness direction was determined with the notched shear test. Each ply was laid free by grinding, and density measurements and in-plane tension tests were performed on the bottom, middle and <b>top</b> <b>plies</b> of each paperboard. Instead of assuming uniform properties in each ply, the shear strength profiles were used to map the measured properties in the through thickness direction. Numerical simulations were performed when the ply and interface properties of the paperboards were altered to follow different shear strength profiles. This was done in order to mimic different production strategies. It was shown that the interface strengths mainly influenced the folding behavior. Whereas altered the ply properties affected the creasing force needed. QC 20130815 </p...|$|R
40|$|Cationic starch is {{a common}} wet-end {{additive}} in the paper industry which is mainly used to enhance retention and dry strength of the finished paper. At Smurfit Kappa Piteå, cationic starch {{is by far the}} most costly chemical used in the paper mill. It is therefore important that the added starch works efficiently, as poor adsorption of starch causes dissolved starch to circulate in the systems. This could cause slime deposits affecting the runnability of the paper machine and other equipment. In the planned production expansion at Smurfit Kappa Piteå during the nearest future, the demand on well-functioning wet-end starch will increase. Through mappings and laboratory studies, the purpose of the present project was to determine the efficiency of the current starch used in the paper mill and to identify any potential for improvements. A method to measure starch content in paper, pulp and white water was implemented to enable the above-mentioned activities to be carried out. As a tool for quality control of cooked starch, a microscopic method was implemented. The method was proven to be a simple and quick tool to verify whether the cooked starch was completely solubilized or not. Mappings at both paper machines were performed where adsorbed and dissolved starch content were analyzed according to the above-mentioned test method. The results showed the highest level of adsorption in the <b>top</b> <b>ply</b> system at PM 2 while the base ply systems at both paper machines displayed lower levels. A significant difference of conductivity in pulps as well as furnishes is likely to explain the difference in adsorption efficiency between the systems. High levels of dissolved starch were observed in the <b>top</b> <b>ply</b> system at PM 1 despite any use of cationic starch in this system. This is explained by dissolved starch in the white water that originates from other stock preparation systems is introduced via the shared dilution of pulp. A laboratory study was conducted to compare the adsorption of starches with different degree of substitution in pulp suspensions. The electrolyte concentration was adjusted to reflect the conditions in the base ply systems at PM 1 and PM 2.  Slightly higher adsorption was observed at higher levels of dosage for starch with a higher DS. Based on these values, the use of this product in the base ply systems at PM 1 and PM 2, could reduce the costs of starch through lowered dosages. A suggestion on how a rebuilding of the starch preparation system could be implemented has been made...|$|E
40|$|Crack-free {{magnesium}} joints of AZ 31 {{magnesium alloy}} strips were produced using laser assisted self-piercing riveting (LSPR). Thermal analysis of LSPR, using modelling and temperature measurements by infra-red thermal imaging, {{indicated that the}} laser absorption was about 18 to 35 % depending on the surface preparation of the magnesium surface, and the thermal coupling between {{the top and bottom}} plies was about 70 %. Thus, cracking was prevented not only in the bottom ply, but also in the <b>top</b> <b>ply,</b> and crack-free AZ 31 joints as thick as 6. 6 mm could be produced within 5 s cycle time. It was found that cracks during joining initiated in shear zones which formed due to limited dynamic recrystallisation (DRX) and strain localisation in regions of large and variable grain size. Since DRX is enhanced at higher temperatures, cracking was prevented by preheating to higher temperatures, up to a maximum temperature to avoid incipient melting and hot shortness. The strength of the joints was affected by the rivet length and hardness, which influenced the characteristics of the joints such as the interlock of the rivet leg into the bottom ply. Strength values as high as 5720 N and 7340 N were obtained for 4. 7 mm and 6. 4 mm thick joints respectively. Salt spray testing showed there was no corrosion issue for the various coated steel rivets, and little or no corrosion around the rivet head in either the steel or the magnesium, but significant corrosion occurred some distance from the coated rivet. Results highlighted the importance of improving the corrosion resistance of the magnesium and develop a suitable, production ready corrosion resistant system for magnesium sheet combinations...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringScarf bonded repair is {{the most}} widely used {{technique}} to repair composite laminates, especially critical and highly loaded components. This thesis presents the findings from an attempt at the prediction of the strength of scarf repaired laminate under remote in-plane tensile loads using the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT). For accuracy purposes, around the scarf repair which is the region of interest, each composite adherend ply is simulated by an individual layer of three-dimensional solid elements. Instead of assuming any particular failure types, all possible cases including cohesive, interlaminar and interface failures are investigated. Cases where VCCT is combined with progressive failure and others that consider only the progressive failure are also examined. In all considered cases, it is assumed that the adhesive layer is elastic till failure. A linear elastic analysis of pristine scarf repaired laminate model under remote tension revealed that the most critical point which is the failure initiation location in the specimen, is situated in the <b>top</b> <b>ply</b> of the patch at a very small distance from the patch-adhesive interface. This might imply that fracture in the examined scarf repaired composite laminate was initiated within the patch material. The results of VCCT and progressive failure analyses showed that the finite element model that assumes crack location at the patch-adhesive interface and uses interlaminar fracture toughness values gives the best prediction of failure load compared to the experimental data. Also, it was shown that VCCT analysis without progressive failure is capable enough in accurately predicting the strength of the scarf repaired composite laminate...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} misalignments in ply orientation, uniform variations in ply thickness, and through-thickness thermal gradients on the post-cure shape errors for symmetric cross-ply laminates constructed from ultra-thin composite materials. Photogrammetry-based surface measurements are performed for laminates cured at elevated temperatures. Significant out-of-plane shape errors are observed, with amplitudes ∼ 75 times the laminate thickness. The magnitude of each imperfection is also characterized experimentally on coupon-level samples. A non-linear finite element model is developed and demonstrates that these imperfections result in cylindrical and twisting modes of deformation. Results are compared to Classical Lamination Theory predictions which are shown to be inadequate in predicting shape errors that require changes in Gaussian curvature. Through these studies, it is determined that thickness variations between the <b>top</b> and bottom <b>plies</b> have the most pronounced effect on shape errors...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of delaminated composite plates with integrated active fibre composite (AFC) actuators and sensor under hygrothermal environment has been {{undertaken in the}} present work. The <b>top</b> and bottom <b>plies</b> of the laminate constitute AFC actuators and sensors. In the present investigation, hygrothermal loading is taken into consideration, {{and the effect of}} moisture and temperature on the delaminated plate structures is analysed. The minimum total potential energy approach is used for arriving at the governing equation. A finite element model for centrally located delamination is developed on the basis of first order shear deformation theory. An eight noded serendipity element with five degrees of freedom per node is considered for the finite element formulation. A parametric study on the effect of stacking sequence, boundary conditions and environmental conditions in the presence of delamination on the laminated plate is studied. The key observations from the parametric study are: there will be reduction in natural frequencies in the presence of delamination and/or hygrothermal loading, and reduction in structural stiffness due to the presence of delamination can be negated by applying voltage to the active fibre actuator layer...|$|R
40|$|The {{inherent}} {{structural dynamics}} of drained peatland forests {{may result in}} a great variation in various wood and fi ber properties. We examined variation in fi ber and pulp properties i) among stands, ii) among trees within stands, and iii) within trees in young stands dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The stands, selected to cover a maximal range of the potential variation, were all at a stage of development where the fi rst commercial thinnings would be feasible. Differences in the processability of the thinning removals were small. In similar kraft cooking conditions, a 5 -unit variation in the kappa number of unbleached pulp was observed among the stands. Stand origin had no effect on pulp bleaching. The wood formed prior to drainage had a higher density, shorter fi bers, was slightly slower delignifi ed by cooking, and its yield was slightly lower than that of post-drainage wood. These properties, except for high density, are typical for juvenile wood in general, and at stand level they did not correlate with the proportion of pre-drainage wood. When the variation in fi ber and pulp properties was broken down into its components, most of it was derived from tree-level in all the cases. On average, the fi ber and pulp properties did not differ from those observed for fi rst-thinning pulpwood from upland sites. Consequently, peatland-grown pulpwood may be mixed with other pulpwood in industrial processes. It would probably be best suited as the raw material for pulps with high bonding requirements, e. g. in the <b>top</b> <b>ply</b> of multi-ply board grades or in some specialty grades...|$|E
