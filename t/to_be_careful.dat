5|$|Earlier, Pope Urban VIII had {{personally}} asked Galileo to give arguments {{for and against}} heliocentrism in the book, and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to advocate heliocentrism. He made another request, that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter of those requests was fulfilled by Galileo.|$|E
5|$|Some early {{travellers}} found dodo meat unsavoury, {{and preferred}} to eat parrots and pigeons; others {{described it as}} tough but good. Some hunted dodos only for their gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird. Dodos were easy to catch, but hunters had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to be bitten by their powerful beaks.|$|E

5|$|If {{permanent}} brachytherapy is used, {{low dose}} radioactive sources (seeds) {{are left in}} the body after treatment – the radiation levels are very low and decrease over time. In addition, the irradiation only affects tissues within a few millimeters of the radioactive sources (i.e. the tumour being treated). As a precaution, some people receiving permanent brachytherapy may be advised to not hold any small children or be too close to pregnant women {{for a short time}} after treatment. Radiation oncologists or nurses can provide specific instructions to patients and advise for how long they need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years, British {{officials}} depended on native officials for advice {{and to act}} as interpreters. However, they had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> about ethnic rivalries. Thus Fadl el-Mula, a Dinka {{who had been a}} police quartermaster, greatly impressed the Governor of Mongalla and was appointed assistant superintendent of the Twic Dinka in 1909. He was credited with keeping the peace between the Dinka and the Nuer people, two groups with a history of fighting and cattle raiding. However, Fadl el-Mula was so strongly biased towards the Dinka that his police were attacked by angry Nuer and he had to be removed from his post.|$|E

5|$|Last Clear Chance is a 1959 American {{short film}} {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Robert Carlisle. Sponsored by Union Pacific Railroad, Last Clear Chance is a safety film intended to warn young drivers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> at railroad crossings. The film's cast consists of William Boyett, Harold Agee, Mrs. Harold Agee, Tim Bosworth, William Agee, Christine Lynch, and Lou Spraker. Written by Leland Baxter, the film was shot in parts of Idaho. Wondsel, Carlisle & Dunphy Inc, based in New York City, served as the film's production company.|$|E
5|$|The {{men in the}} Castle Inn {{retreated to}} Penydarren House, who were joined by the initial {{reinforcements}} from the Yeomanry, bringing the establishment's numbers to around 300, {{not all of them}} were armed and able to fight. They faced increasingly well-armed insurgents and Bute became increasingly concerned {{about the quality of the}} opposition facing his men. Bute sent spies into the insurgency, and nearby Cyfarthfa Castle was pressed into service as an observation post. Bute mobilised military pensioners, and used them to start to bring Penydarren House additional weaponry from Cardiff; he was advised <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful,</b> however, in case the shipments fell into the hands of the insurgency. Morgan's forces were able to prevent the radical crowds from entering either Penydarren or Cyfartha, and Bute arrested potential insurgents in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Planck, Einstein {{entertained the}} {{possibility}} that there might be actual physical quanta of light—what we now call photons. He noticed that a light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, the ultraviolet catastrophe, and the photoelectric effect. Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than the frequency of the light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.|$|E

5|$|Whilst Tommy {{is under}} day-release, Toshiko (Naoko Mori) elects {{to keep him}} company. Whilst Toshiko spends time with Tommy, Jack (John Barrowman) and Gwen (Eve Myles) {{discover}} that the abandoned Cardiff hospital is showing signs of time distortion, with elements of the 1918 hospital appearing in the present. Meanwhile, Toshiko and Tommy grow closer; after an afternoon in the pub, he kisses her romantically. Later, Toshiko's colleague Owen (Burn Gorman) realises that Toshiko has developed feelings for Tommy and warns her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> as {{he does not want}} her to get hurt. Upon their return, Jack realizes that the present year is when Tommy will be needed: he will have to travel back to 1918 and activate a Rift Key to close the connection between 1918 and the present and prevent disaster. As Tommy is due to be executed for cowardice three weeks after his return to 1918, Tosh initially refuses to let him go back. Jack persuades her of the necessity of Tommy's return.|$|E
5|$|Saint Charles Bay {{serves as}} a habitat for {{approximately}} 300 species of birds. Birders venture to the site between November and March, when the creatures winter near the bay. The endangered whooping crane, the largest bird in North America, is the most highly prized sight as {{only a few hundred}} remain, including three families on St. Charles Bay. The bird was near extinction in the early 20th century, as only two flocks between Canada and Texas remained. The population increased following the organization of the Aransas Migratory Waterfowl Refuge in 1937, after the Federal government purchased the land of the St. Charles ranch from San Antonio oilman Leroy G. Denman, using funds from commemorative stamps. The Refuge later became known as the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Whooping cranes are also protected by Goose Island State Park, which was established by the State of Texas in 1931. Other birds that migrate to the bay include the sandhill crane, American white pelican, brown pelican, roseate spoonbill, great blue heron and Canada goose. The blue crab and other shellfish, help sustain the bird population. Thirty seven species of mammals are found on Blackjack peninsula, including white-tailed deer, nine-banded armadillos and collared peccaries. The spotted seatrout and redfish are the common finfish that reside in the bay. While trout are generally found in the bay's deeper waters, redfish live in shallow waters; their tail fins can be spotted above the surface during the peak summer and fall months. The bay also supports a healthy population of American alligators, which reside in shallow waters. Signs alert visitors <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful.</b>|$|E
