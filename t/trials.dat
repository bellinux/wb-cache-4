Nearly 40% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E

5|$|After a {{farewell}} {{visit from the}} Eastern Fleet commander, Admiral Sir James Somerville on 12 January 1943, Illustrious sailed for home the next day. She flew off her aircraft to Gibraltar on 31 January and continued on to the Clyde where she arrived five days later. She conducted deck-landing <b>trials</b> for prototypes of the Blackburn Firebrand and Fairey Firefly fighters, {{as well as the}} Fairey Barracuda dive/torpedo bomber from 8 to 10 February. On 26 February she began a refit at Birkenhead that lasted until 7 June during which her flight deck was extended, new radars were installed, her light antiaircraft armament was augmented, and two new arrestor wires were fitted aft of the rear lift which increased her effective landing area. While conducting her postrefit <b>trials,</b> she also conducted flying <b>trials</b> for Martlet Vs and Barracudas. Both sets of <b>trials</b> were completed by 18 July, by which time the Illustrious had joined the Home Fleet.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Fleet Air Arm was {{receiving}} its first aircraft, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment had three FG.1s delivered to its 'C' Squadron for flight deck <b>trials</b> aboard Eagle. Two sets of <b>trials</b> were successfully carried out in March and June 1969; the first comprised approaches and touch and go landings, while the second set of <b>trials</b> involved full catapult launch and arrested recovery. As a result of the reheat from the Spey turbofans, the ship's jet blast deflectors (JBD) were not used; instead a steel plate was fixed to the deck to absorb the heat of the engines building to launch, and fire hoses were used after each launch to prevent them melting.|$|E
50|$|The <b>trial</b> {{typically}} {{goes through}} stages of: initial registration, ongoing record updates, and basic summary result submission. Each <b>trial</b> record {{is administered by}} <b>trial</b> record manager. A <b>trial</b> record manager typically provides initial <b>trial</b> registration prior the study enrolls the first participant. This also facilitates informing potential participants that the <b>trial</b> is no longer recruiting participants. Once all participants were recruited, the <b>trial</b> record may be updated to indicate that is closed to recruitment. Once all measurements are collected (the <b>trial</b> formally completes), the <b>trial</b> status is updated to 'complete'. If the <b>trial</b> terminates for some reason (e.g., lack of enrollment, evidence of initial adverse outcomes), the status may be updated to 'terminated'. Once final <b>trial</b> results are known or legal deadlines are met, the <b>trial</b> record manager may upload basic summary results to the registry either by filling a complex web-based form or submitting a compliant XML file.|$|R

5|$|In late 1829, with {{construction}} of the railway almost complete, the Rainhill <b>Trials</b> were held on a short level stretch of the completed line near Rainhill, to test how the track withstood locomotives running over it and to determine which type of locomotive would be used, with a £500 prize at stake. The <b>Trials</b> were widely publicised, and 10,000–15,000 people attended the first day on 6October 1829. Of the five entrants Rocket, built by George Stephenson and his son Robert, was the only entrant to complete the trial without suffering a serious failure, and was duly selected as the design to be used. (Although often described as a race, and shown as such in illustrations, the Rainhill <b>Trials</b> were a series of independent <b>trials.</b> Each engine ran on a different day.) At {{around the time of}} the Rainhill <b>Trials</b> the tunnel to the forthcoming Liverpool terminus—the first tunnel ever dug under a major built-up area—was completed.

Participants are usually taken from the poorest groups in society, and outsourcing increasingly means that <b>trials</b> may be conducted in countries with highly competitive wages by contract research organizations (CROs).
