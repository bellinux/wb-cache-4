5|$|Following {{the example}} of the wealthy Italian city-states of the era, such as Venice, Florence, and Lucca, which had become the center of the luxury-textile industry, Lyon {{obtained}} a similar function in the French market. In 1466, King Louis XI decided to develop a national silk industry in Lyon. In the face of protests by the Lyonnais, he conceded and moved the silk fabrication to Tours, but the industry in Tours stayed relatively marginal. His main objective was to reduce France's <b>trade</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>with</b> the Italian states, which caused France to lose 400,000 to 500,000 golden écus a year. It was under Francis I in around 1535 that a royal charter was granted to two merchants, Étienne Turquet and Barthélemy Naris, to develop a silk trade in Lyon. In 1540, the king granted a monopoly on silk production to the city of Lyon. Starting in the 16th century, Lyon became the capital of the European silk trade, notably producing many reputable fashions. Gaining confidence, the silks produced in the city began to abandon the original oriental styles in favor of their own distinctive style, which emphasized landscapes. Thousand of workers, the canuts, devoted themselves to the flourishing industry. In the middle of the 17th century, over 14,000 looms were used in Lyon, and the silk industry fed a third of the city's population.|$|E

U.S. steel manufacturers subsequently beseeched the White House to halt an influx of Chinese steel pipe used to make plumbing and fence materials. This was a recurring complaint and the United States International Trade Commission recommended imposing import quotas, noting [...] "the economic threat to the domestic pipe industry from the Chinese surge."

This occurred {{at a time when the}} U.S. steel industry lost $150 million in profit between 2005 and 2007, although China's minister of commerce cited the U.S. industry's [...] "record high profit margins" [...] in the first half of 2004 and continued growth in 2005.

40|$|After {{remaining}} low {{throughout the}} 1970 s and 1980 s, Bangladesh's <b>trade</b> <b>deficits</b> (as percent of GDP) with India {{have been rising}} sharply since 1993. The size of its illegal <b>trade</b> <b>deficits</b> <b>with</b> India is also large and perceived to be rising since the early 1990 s. Thus, instead of interdependence between two trading neighbours at the same stage of development, the Bangladesh-India trade relations suggest an absolute dependence of Bangladesh on India. The debate that has now generated in Bangladesh from such a onesided trade flow has two polar themes. At one extreme are those commentators who consider Bangladesh's large and growing <b>trade</b> <b>deficits</b> <b>with</b> India as a "natural and positive development" {{on the grounds that}} India is believed to be at a higher stage of development and to have gained technological maturity in the production of those goods that Bangladesh imports from India. The alternative view is that Bangladesh's large and growing <b>trade</b> <b>deficits</b> are a recent phenomenon and {{have nothing to do with}} India's technological maturity or prowess. As an explanation, such deficits are cnnsidered to be the result both of India's deep devaluation policy and tariff and non-tiff barriers to Bangladesh's exports to its markets. This paper examines the disaggregated structure of trade, as well as the revealed comparative advantage of Bangladesh and India and finds no support for the thesis of Bangladesh's technological imports from India on grounds of their maturity. It then examines the sensitivity of trade flows between the two countries to exchange rates and the possible role of trade liberalisation in generating <b>trade</b> <b>deficits</b> within the framework of intra-industry trade models for differentiated products. The available evidence suggests that through subsidies, interventions and deep devaluation policy, India has artificially created a comparative advantage over Bangladesh in differentiated products. India has also managed to keep its markets closed for Bangladesh's products despite trade negotiations, between the governments. This gives credence to the suggestion that Bangladesh's trade with India is neither fair nor competitive. Finally, the paper considers the political economy of the large and growing trade imbalances between them before drawing policy conclusions. ...|$|R
