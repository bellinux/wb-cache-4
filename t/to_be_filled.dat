5|$|Christopher Richter {{suggested}} that the majority's legalistic approach, while yielding a workable construction of {{the provisions of the}} Migration Act, resulted in a dangerous situation in this case because the Act did not specifically address the situation of stateless persons, and the literal approach did not allow for gaps in the legislation <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled.</b>|$|E

5|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate. Pierce {{spent the first}} few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled.</b> This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E

5|$|It {{was only}} in 1946, after the Japanese Occupation and the {{disbanding}} of the Straits Settlements, that the people were allowed to elect members into the Legislative Council. The Council then consisted of at least 22 {{but not more than}} 24 members. Only nine members were elected, out of which the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Indian Chamber of Commerce were each allotted one seat. The other six seats were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> by democratic elections based on universal suffrage. Elections were held {{for the first time on}} 20 March 1948.|$|E
5|$|The 767 {{features}} a twin-aisle cabin with a typical configuration of six abreast in business class and seven across in economy. The standard seven abreast, 2–3–2 economy class layout places approximately 87percent of all seats at a window or aisle. As a result, the aircraft can be largely occupied before center seats need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled,</b> and each passenger {{is no more}} than one seat from the aisle. It is possible to configure the aircraft with extra seats for up to an eight abreast configuration, but this is less common.|$|E
5|$|The {{aforementioned}} Baysdorfer provided Omaha {{with another}} invention by successfully flying an airship {{in the city}} in 1889. In 1929 a bond was passed that would construct the Omaha Municipal Airport in East Omaha.

The land was swampy and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> in with silt taken {{from the bottom of}} Carter Lake. Northwest Airlines started service between Minneapolis and Omaha in 1930.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} a {{telephone}} survey of 1000 workers to explore whether alternative, nonunion forms of representation appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filling</b> the gap left by union decline, whether this matters to authority relations at work, {{and whether it}} may, indeed, help to explain union decline. It finds that non-union associations do not appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filling</b> this gap, but that management established, non-union representation systems are twice as widespread as is union representation and are evaluated as favourably by workers. It also finds that unions appear to have positive implications for authority relations at work, as reflected in worker perceptions of security, fairness, and justice. Non-union representation systems do not in-and-of themselves appear to do so, but they tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of a bundle of practices that, in combination, does. Finally, although {{the results suggest that}} these systems are often in violation of section 8 (a) (2) of the Wagner Act, they bear no association with worker propensity to vote for a union...|$|R
5|$|The block {{voting system}} was used, with each peer casting as many votes {{as there were}} seats <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled.</b> The system, however, {{permitted}} the party with {{the greatest number of}} peers, normally the Conservatives, to procure a disproportionate number of seats, with opposing parties sometimes being left entirely unrepresented. The Lord Clerk Register was responsible for tallying the votes. The return issued by the Lord Clerk Register was sufficient evidence to admit the representative peers to Parliament; however, unlike other peers, Scottish representatives did not receive writs of summons.|$|E

Tessier, however, {{wanted to find out}} how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity.|$|E
