5|$|On May 23, 1994, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez {{again in}} Matamoros for {{possessing}} two stolen vehicles. He {{was interviewed by}} Mexican authorities and stated {{that he was not}} guilty of Fischer's murder. He admitted to having stolen cars since he was young, and stated that Garza was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> blame on him to protect himself from prosecution. Olivarez justified himself by saying that he had never been arrested with a gun. He admitted going to Dallas in 1992, but stated that he only knew Garza by name. He said he was a self-employed auto mechanic who supported his wife, mother, and uncle. Mexican officials said that Olivarez's auto theft ring extended all the way to Monterrey, as well as in Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. There was an arrest warrant for him issued by a state judge in Reynosa for being connected to about 50 car thefts. Brownsville investigators went to Mexico {{to see if they could}} talk to Olivarez, and began extradition procedings to bring him to a Texan court.|$|E
500|$|Raich Carter {{once said}} of Frank Swift {{that he looked}} so big in goal that as a forward it often seemed that trying to score against him was like <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> ball into a matchbox. Swift's hands, which had a finger span of , were {{sufficiently}} large for him to easily pick up the ball with one hand, and {{gave rise to the}} nickname [...] "Frying Pan Hands". Swift kicked with his left foot as the result of an injury to his right foot sustained during his youth. However, where possible he preferred throwing the ball to the wing over kicking it downfield. When asked for advice to give to young goalkeepers, Swift replied that he drew diagrams of each goal scored against him {{to see if he was}} at fault.|$|E
500|$|On November 20, 2007, Torres {{signed with}} the Chicago Cubs. In 2008, he engaged a private hitting {{instructor}} named Chris O'Leary to help him out. He began trying to model his swing after Albert Pujols, instead of merely <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> ball {{on the ground and}} run to first base, which is what he had been doing. He spent the entire season with the Iowa Cubs of the Pacific Coast League, batting [...]306 in 118 games with 11 home runs. He finished fifth in the league with 91 runs scored, tied for second in the league with 10 triples (tied with Trent Oeltjen and Nate Schierholtz behind Tim Raines, Jr.'s 13), and led the league with 29 stolen bases. However, the Cubs did not re-sign him and he once again filed for free agency following the season.|$|E

500|$|Even some staunch traditionalists {{from both}} the urban and rural folk music {{communities}} had an affinity for the Kingstons' polished commercial versions of older songs. In her memoir And A Voice To Sing With, singer and activist Joan Baez recalled that [...] "Traveling across the country {{with my mother and}} sisters, we heard the commercial songs of the budding folk boom for the first time, the Kingston Trio's 'Tom Dooley' and 'Scotch and Soda.' Before I turned into a snob and learned to look down upon all commercial folk music as bastardized and unholy, I loved the Kingston Trio. When I became one of the leading practitioners of 'pure folk,' I still loved them..." [...] Arthel [...] "Doc" [...] Watson of North Carolina, {{one of the most respected}} and influential musicians performing traditional music, remarked, [...] "I’ll tell you who pointed all our noses in the right direction, even the traditional performers. They got us interested in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> good stuff out there—the Kingston Trio. They got me interested in it!" ...|$|E
500|$|Jill {{is known}} for her feud with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), which took place over four decades. BuddyTV wrote that, [...] "Nothing spells rivalry like the {{on-going}} feud between Jill Foster Abbott and Katherine Chancellor." [...] In 1993, Katherine {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and shared several tender scenes with Jill. Nancy Reichardt of the Los Angeles Times noted that the characters were acting out of character; she wrote: [...] "Katherine's breast cancer scare was touching and seeing Katherine and Jill come together added an intriguing new dimension to their relationship. To confuse us, the show has thrown out this budding friendship as if it never happened. How much more moving it would have been if these two women faced Katherine's request for Jill to name her child Phillip as former adversaries <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> past behind them instead of as bitter enemies of days gone by." [...] Of working with Cooper, Walton has stated: [...] "I thank God every day for that woman. She feeds me. She is like a shot in the arm when you see her in the morning. [...] She is funny and sharp and I love her." ...|$|E

Paxman later accused Reid of having a chip {{on his shoulder and}} Reid accused Paxman of class prejudice.|$|E
2500|$|French breakfasted with Kitchener (31 March) {{who told}} him that he and Joffre were [...] "on ... trial" [...] over the next five weeks, and that the Allied governments would {{reinforce}} other theatres unless they made [...] "substantial advances" [...] and [...] "br the German line". [...] There were rumours in both British and French circles, probably baseless, that Kitchener coveted French's job for himself. French also objected (2 April 1915) to rumours that Joffre was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> BEF under Foch's command.|$|E
2500|$|Overwatch {{director}} Jeff Kaplan {{stated in}} an interview that he and his team have purposefully kept the romantic relationships and sexual identities of their characters vague in order to not [...] "pander" [...] to the audience. Kaplan described the porn scene as [...] "an inevitable reality of the internet in 2016." [...] When Randy Pitchford, CEO of Gearbox Software, tweeted about the existence of pornographic content based on Overwatchs competitor game Battleborn, he was immediately mocked and trolled by fans of the more popular game. Pitchford was accused of [...] "desperately <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> spotlight back on his game", and the Reddit website he linked to was flooded by Overwatch references.|$|E

2500|$|The scallop {{shell is}} a {{traditional}} reference to pilgrimage. For Pope Benedict XVI, it also reminded [...] him of the legend according to which one day St. Augustine, pondering {{the mystery of the}} Trinity, saw a child at the seashore playing with a shell, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> water of the ocean into a little hole. Then he heard the words: This hole can no more contain the waters of the ocean than your intellect can comprehend the mystery of God. The crowned Moor is a regional motif in heraldry often seen in Bavaria, Benedict's German homeland. [...] Benedict has been quoted saying that, in addition to the obvious reference back to Saint Corbinian, the founder of the diocese where Benedict would become bishop in 1977, the bear represents Benedict himself being [...] "tamed by God" [...] to bear the spiritual burdens of Benedict's own ministries first as bishop, then as cardinal, and now as pope.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, {{during an}} {{interview}} with MTV News, Knowles spoke about her more aggressive stage persona, Sasha Fierce. She said: [...] "I absolutely get scared every time I get on the stage. I get nervous. I'm actually really scared when I'm not nervous because then I don't transform into that person that {{people are used to}} seeing." [...] She added that in real life, she was nothing like the person people see in her videos and performances: [...] "I'm really more quiet, reserved. I speak when spoken to and polite. When I'm onstage, I'm aggressive, I'm strong, I'm fearless." [...] Knowles' third album I Am... Sasha Fierce formally introduced Sasha Fierce as her alter ego; she revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her single [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003). In an interview with People magazine, Knowles affirmed that her alter ego is strictly for the stage and Sasha Fierce was further described as the singer's sensual, aggressive alter ego. In October 2008, Billboard magazine reported that Knowles would go on tour in the spring of 2009 to support her third studio album. Beyoncé's father and manager Mathew Knowles revealed that it would visit different countries worldwide. The tour dates for the European leg were announced in December 2008. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Knowles confirmed that she was excited about the tour and that she would be backed by her all-female band which also accompanied her during her previous tour The Beyoncé Experience (2007). She also stated that she worked on the tour for eight months, rehearsing and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> set list together. Knowles further revealed that the twelve-hour rehearsals for the tour included dancing the choreography in heels for two months before it commenced. She also added that she learnt to make transition from herself to Sasha Fierce really fast for the performances. Knowles further acknowledged that I Am... World Tour was a huge production and that she was proud of the theatrical show she created. She said that it was a mixture of everything she loved: [...] "I tried to bring jazz and hip-hop, and ballet and fashion, and everything together... It is the best thing I've done as far as my tours go." ...|$|E
