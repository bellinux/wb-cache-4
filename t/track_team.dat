He finished the season ranked fourth in the country. In 1973, in just his second season as an expert, Roberts won the national championship, amassing a record 2,014 points in the 25-race series.|$|E

5|$|McGovern {{attended}} Mitchell High School, {{where he}} was a solid but unspectacular member of the <b>track</b> <b>team.</b> A turning point came when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he became quite active. His high-school debate coach, a history teacher who capitalized on McGovern's interest in that subject, proved to be a great influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style. McGovern and his debating partner won events in his area and gained renown in a state where debating was passionately followed by the general public. Debate changed McGovern's life, giving him a chance to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a sense of personal and social confidence. He graduated in 1940 in the top ten percent of his class.|$|E

After two more years with the Browns, however, Speedie left the team for the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU) amid a conflict with Paul Brown, Cleveland's head coach.

Usain Bolt held the record for medals won by a Jamaican at the Beijing games, medaling gold in every event in which he participated.|$|E
5|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Yamaha could not develop a dirt track motorcycle capable of competing with the dominant Harley-Davidson dirt <b>track</b> <b>team,</b> the American Yamaha importer, Yamaha USA, offered to send Roberts to Europe in 1978 to compete in the World Championship Grand Prix road racing series, along with Kel Carruthers to act as his mentor and crew chief. Roberts also secured the financial backing of the Goodyear tire company. The team planned to compete in the 250cc world championship as well as the Formula 750 series in order to have more practice time to learn the tracks, but their main focus would be on the 500cc class, considered the premier class at the time. His main competition in the 500cc world championship would come from Suzuki rider Barry Sheene, winner of the two previous titles. Roberts said that he was initially indifferent about competing in Europe, but when he read that Sheene had labeled him as"no threat", he made up his mind to compete. Few observers gave Roberts any chance of winning the championship, citing the reasoning that it would take him at least one season to learn the European circuits.|$|E
