5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object. Dyadic joint attention involves mutual gaze between <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> infant. Mutual gaze is marked by both <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> infant looking at each other's face. If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.|$|E

25|$|Human males do {{not have}} the anatomy needed for natural {{embryonic}} and fetal development. The theoretical issue of male ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterine cavity) by implantation in biological males has been addressed by experts in the field of fertility medicine, who stress that the concept of ectopic implantation, while theoretically plausible, has never been attempted and would be difficult to justify – even for women lacking a uterus – owing to the extreme health risks to both <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> child.|$|E
25|$|For some nuclei, {{the process}} occurs as {{conversion}} of two protons to neutrons, emitting two electron neutrinos and absorbing two orbital electrons (double electron capture). If the mass difference between <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> daughter atoms {{is more than}} 1.022MeV/c2 (two electron masses), another decay is accessible, capture of one orbital electron and emission of one positron. When the mass difference is more than 2.044MeV/c2 (four electron masses), emission of two positrons is possible. These theoretical decay branches have not been observed.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, DNA {{profiling}} {{suggested a}} parent-offspring relationship between Carignan and the Rioja wine grape Graciano {{though it was}} not yet clear which variety is <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> which is the offspring. However, some grape geneticist and ampelographers such as José Vouillamoz dispute the 2006 findings and believe that the DNA profiles of both grapes are too distinct to have a close parent-offspring relationship at all. It is more likely, Vouillamoz and others suggest, that Carignan and Graciano were the result of two separate spontaneous crossing of unknown Vitis vinifera parents that occurred somewhere in northeast Spain.|$|E
25|$|Layering is a {{technique}} in which rooting is encouraged from part of a plant, usually a branch, while it is still attached to the parent plant. After rooting, the branch is removed from <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> grown as an independent entity. For bonsai, both ground layering and air layering can create a potential bonsai, by transforming a mature branch {{into the trunk of}} a new tree. The point at which rooting is encouraged can be close to the location of side branches, so the resulting rooted tree can immediately have a thick trunk and low branches, characteristics that complement bonsai aesthetics.|$|E
25|$|Ampelographers {{also thought}} that Mondeuse noire was a color {{mutation}} of Mondeuse blanche but DNA evidence {{has shown that}} {{not to be the}} case with the two varieties having a parent-offspring relationship though it is not yet clear which variety is <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> which is the offspring. References to Mondeuse usually are to Mondeuse noire rather than to Mondeuse blanche. Mondeuse noire does have a pink-berried color mutant, Mondeuse grise, which {{was on the verge of}} extinction until ampelographer Pierre Galet was able to identify vines and have cuttings planted at the Domaine de Vassal conservation vineyard in Montpellier run by the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA).|$|E
2500|$|The tight {{bundling}} {{is enough}} to stimulate the baby: vestibular stimulation from <b>the</b> <b>parent's</b> breathing <b>and</b> chest movement, auditory stimulation from <b>the</b> <b>parent's</b> voice <b>and</b> natural sounds of breathing and the heartbeat, touch by the skin of <b>the</b> <b>parent,</b> <b>the</b> wrap, <b>and</b> the natural tendency to hold the baby.

50|$|Parenting- Parents {{can have}} a strong effect on {{religious}} development in children and adolescents, as they tend to adopt the religion that is practiced during their upbringing. <b>The</b> relationship between <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> their children however can change this. If {{there is a positive}} relationship between <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> child, <b>the</b> child {{will be more likely to}} adopt their religious beliefs. In the case where there is a negative relationship between <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> child, <b>the</b> child will be more likely to disaffiliate themselves with their parents religious ideas.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} few months after birth, the infant is unable to obtain food on its own. For this reason, the infant rides on <b>the</b> <b>parent's</b> back <b>and</b> {{receives}} food from <b>the</b> <b>parents.</b> It drinks milk in the 4 to 5 weeks after birth; after that, <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> other group-members share food with the infant. Sharing involves both offers from <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> begging by <b>the</b> infant. Usually, until the age of approximately 15 weeks, the infant will receive the majority of its food (especially insects) from others. The number of offers from group-members peaks at week 7; after week 15, sharing slowly declines, stopping by week 26.|$|R
25|$|Heaps are {{commonly}} implemented with an array. Any binary tree {{can be stored}} in an array, but because a binary heap is always a complete binary tree, it can be stored compactly. No space is required for pointers; instead, <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> children of each node can be found by arithmetic on array indices. These properties make this heap implementation a simple example of an implicit data structure or Ahnentafel list. Details depend on the root position, which in turn may depend on constraints of a programming language used for implementation, or programmer preference. Specifically, sometimes the root is placed at index 1, in order to simplify arithmetic.|$|E
25|$|This form of {{division}} {{results in a}} size reduction of the daughter cell that received the smaller frustule from <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> therefore the average cell size of a diatom population decreases, until the cells are about one-third their maximum size. It has been observed, however, that certain taxa {{have the ability to}} divide without causing a reduction in cell size. Nonetheless, in order to restore the cell size of a diatom population for those that do endure size reduction, sexual reproduction and auxospore formation must occur. Vegetative cells of diatoms are diploid (2N) and so meiosis can take place, producing male and female gametes which then fuse to form the zygote. The zygote sheds its silica theca and grows into a large sphere covered by an organic membrane, the auxospore. A new diatom cell of maximum size, the initial cell, forms within the auxospore thus beginning a new generation. Resting spores may also be formed as a response to unfavourable environmental conditions with germination occurring when conditions improve.|$|E
25|$|Many {{believers in}} young Earth creationism– a {{position}} {{held by the}} majority of proponents of flood geology– accept biblical chronogenealogies (such as the Ussher chronology, which in turn is based on the Masoretic version of the Genealogies of Genesis). They believe that God created the universe approximately 6000 years ago, in the space of six days. Much of creation geology is devoted to debunking the dating methods used in anthropology, geology, and planetary science that give ages in conflict with the young Earth idea. In particular, creationists dispute the reliability of radiometric dating and isochron analysis, both of which are central to mainstream geological theories of the age of the Earth. They usually dispute these methods based on uncertainties concerning initial concentrations of individually considered species and the associated measurement uncertainties caused by diffusion of <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> daughter isotopes. A full critique of the entire parameter-fitting analysis, which relies on dozens of radionuclei parent and daughter pairs, has not been done by creationists hoping to cast doubt on the technique.|$|E

500|$|In Rothbard's view of parenthood, [...] "the parent {{should not}} have a legal {{obligation}} to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> depriving the parent of his rights." [...] Thus, Rothbard stated that parents should have {{the legal right to}} let any infant die by starvation, and should be free to engage in other forms of child neglect. However, according to Rothbard, [...] "the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children". In a fully libertarian society, he wrote, [...] "the existence of a free baby market will bring such 'neglect' down to a minimum".|$|E
500|$|The Dubna–Livermore {{collaboration}} strengthened {{their claim}} for {{the discovery of}} nihonium by conducting chemical experiments on 268Db, the final decay product of 288Mc. This was valuable as none of the nuclides in this decay chain were previously known, so that their claim was not supported by any previously obtained experimental data, and chemical experimentation would strengthen the case for their claim. In June 2004 and again in December 2005, this dubnium isotope was successfully identified by extracting the final decay products, measuring spontaneous fission (SF) activities and using chemical identification techniques to confirm that they behave like a group 5 element (as dubnium {{is known to be}} in group 5 of the periodic table). Both the half-life and decay mode were confirmed for the proposed 268Db which lends support to the assignment of <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> daughter nuclei to moscovium and nihonium respectively.Am + 48Ca|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.72.034611|date=2005|author=Oganessian, Yu.

500|$|Seven {{years after}} the Santosky decision, the United States Supreme Court held in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins that Santosky's higher burden of proof is an {{exception}} to the [...] "conventional rules of civil litigation [...] that parties to civil litigation need only prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence." [...] The Court later extended Santoskys finding of governmental interest in [...] "preserving and promoting the welfare of the child" [...] when it held in Reno v.

In 2000, the right of parents to choose how to raise their child, one of the main constitutional interests at issue in Santosky, was affirmed in Troxel v.
