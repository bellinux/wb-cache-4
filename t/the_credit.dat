5|$|The {{federal tax}} credit for new plug-in {{electric}} vehicles is worth $2,500 plus $417 for each kilowatt-hour of battery capacity over 5 kWh, and the portion of <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> determined by battery capacity cannot exceed $5,000. Therefore, {{the total amount of}} <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> allowed for a new PEV is $7,500. Several states have established incentives and tax exemptions for BEVs and PHEV, and other non-monetary incentives.|$|E

5|$|Within Mississauga, {{the freeway}} {{encounters}} its narrowest right-of-way, sandwiched between residential subdivisions {{on either side}} that prevent further expansion. It crosses <b>the</b> <b>Credit</b> River Valley, where a second bridge is under construction. The segment east of <b>the</b> <b>Credit</b> River is being examined for expansion possibilities, but, like the previous section, there is little room for more lanes without property acquisition. After crossing Etobicoke Creek, which forms the boundary between Mississauga / Peel Region and Toronto, the route curves eastward to meet Highway427 at a large sprawling interchange. The QEW formerly continued beyond this interchange to the old Toronto city limits at the Humber River; this section was downloaded from provincial to municipal ownership on April1, 1997, and {{became part of the}} Gardiner Expressway.|$|E
5|$|Ancient authors {{agreed that}} the worship of Terminus was of Sabine origin, ascribing its {{introduction}} to Rome either to Titus Tatius, the Sabine colleague of Rome's founding king Romulus (traditional reign 753717 BC), or to Romulus' successor Numa Pompilius (717673 BC). Those authors who gave <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> to Numa explained his motivation as the prevention of violent disputes over property. Plutarch further states that, in keeping with Terminus's character as a guarantor of peace, his earliest worship did not involve blood sacrifices.|$|E

5|$|Emperors of the Antonine and Severan dynasties overall debased the currency, {{particularly}} the denarius, under {{the pressures of}} meeting military payrolls. Sudden inflation {{during the reign of}} Commodus damaged <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> market. In the mid-200s, the supply of specie contracted sharply. Conditions during the Crisis of the Third Century—such as reductions in long-distance trade, disruption of mining operations, and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemies—greatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector by the year 300. Although Roman coinage had long been fiat money or fiduciary currency, general economic anxieties came to a head under Aurelian, and bankers lost confidence in coins legitimately issued by the central government. Despite Diocletian's introduction of the gold solidus and monetary reforms, <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> market of the Empire never recovered its former robustness.|$|E

5|$|In 1825, Jones wrote {{a letter}} to Indian Agent James Givins {{regarding}} the year's delivery of gifts (due from various land purchases) to the Mississaugas. The letter was the first Givins had received that had been written by an Indian. Givins arranged a meeting with Jones during the second week of July. Jones arrived at the Humber River at the prescribed time, leading the approximately 50 Christian Indians, and his former adoptive father Captain Jim arrived leading the approximately 150 non-Christian Indians. At this meeting, a further 50 of the approximately 200 Indians of Jones' band were converted. Givins was accompanied by several members of Upper Canada's aristocracy, including Bishop John Strachan. The Christian dress and style of Jones' band of converts, including their singing of hymns, which had been translated into Ojibwe by Jones, created a favourable impression of the group with Strachan and the other political leaders present. Although Strachan, an Anglican, had strongly denounced the Methodists, he saw in Jones the opportunity to Christianize the Indians of Upper Canada. He hoped to convert Jones (and thereby his followers) to Anglicanism later. The Crown had previously agreed to build a village on <b>the</b> <b>Credit</b> River for the Mississaugas in 1820, but nothing had been done. Strachan told Jones he would make good on this agreement, and after a short meeting, all of the Christian Indians agreed to accept it. Construction of the settlement, called <b>the</b> <b>Credit</b> Mission, was soon underway and Jones moved there in 1826. By the summer of 1826, with construction of the settlement well under way, the rest of the band had joined the Methodist church and settled at <b>the</b> <b>Credit</b> Mission. Among the last holdouts was Jones' former adoptive father, Captain Jim, and his family. At about this time Methodist Reverend Egerton Ryerson was assigned to <b>the</b> <b>Credit</b> Mission, and Jones quickly struck up a friendship with him. Ryerson's work at the camp freed Jones to begin taking lengthy missionary expeditions to other parts of Upper Canada. During the period 182527, Jones undertook missionary missions to Quinte, Munceytown, Rice Lake and Lake Simcoe. He preached in the native language, a key factor to helping the Indians understand and accept Christianity; small groups of Indians in these areas soon converted to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, the French Academy of Sciences made {{understanding}} bicycle dynamics {{the goal}} of its Prix Fourneyron competition.

5|$|Investigating {{appropriations}} led Randall {{to focus}} on financial impropriety in Congress and the Grant administration. The most famous of these was <b>the</b> <b>Crédit</b> Mobilier scandal. In this scheme, the Union Pacific Railroad bankrupted itself by overpaying its construction company, <b>the</b> <b>Crédit</b> Mobilier of America. Crédit Mobilier was owned by the railroad's principal shareholders and, as the investigation discovered, several congressmen also owned shares {{that they had been}} allowed to purchase at discounted prices. Randall's role in the investigation was limited, but he proposed bills to ban such frauds and sought to impeach Vice President Schuyler Colfax, who had been implicated in the scandal. Randall was involved with the investigation of several other scandals, as well, including tax fraud by private tax collection contractors (known as the Sanborn incident) and fraud in the awarding of postal contracts (the star route scandal).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} Children’s Fitness Tax Credit and similar credits to {{determine}} whether they are suitable to increase physical activity levels in Canada. It begins by reviewing the literature on physical activity to establish that increasing physical activity is a worthy public policy goal. It then reviews the literature on tax expenditures and health behaviour interventions to provide information in order to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>credits.</b> <b>The</b> <b>credits</b> are then described and their stated purpose is discussed. This description establishes how quickly <b>the</b> <b>credits</b> expanded from one small credit to many. One of <b>the</b> <b>credits,</b> <b>the</b> Active Families Benefit, requires a new concept to evaluate it as it is not simply a tax measure or a spending measure. The term hybrid tax measure is introduced to explore this credit. An evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>credits</b> considering their effectiveness, efficiency and equity in determining their suitability to increase physical activity is performed and the conclusion is made that they are unlikely to be effective and that the inequity of <b>the</b> <b>credits</b> is problematic, particularly in light of this ineffectiveness finding. It is recommended that <b>the</b> <b>credits</b> be repealed and no new credits be created, but as repeal is unlikely, alternative recommendations are also provided...|$|R

50|$|The {{division}} of work between the ghostwriter and <b>the</b> <b>credited</b> author varies a great deal. In some cases, the ghostwriter is hired to edit a rough draft of a mostly completed manuscript. In this case, the outline, ideas {{and much of the}} language in the finished book or article are those of <b>the</b> <b>credited</b> author. If it is agreed upon, for example in a signed contract, the ghostwriter will sign over all the rights to everything he or she adds into the work that is not otherwise copyrighted to someone else. In many cases, a ghostwriter handles most of the writing, using concepts and stories provided by <b>the</b> <b>credited</b> author. In this case, a ghostwriter will do extensive research on <b>the</b> <b>credited</b> author or their subject area of expertise. It is rare for a ghostwriter to prepare a book or article with no input from <b>the</b> <b>credited</b> author; at a minimum, <b>the</b> <b>credited</b> author usually jots down a basic framework of ideas at the outset or provides comments on the ghostwriter's final draft.|$|R
