5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} is turned on before it turns off so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo from the target is received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs {{would not be able to}} see returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling at the speed of light would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E
5|$|The RAE's {{comments}} about the self-exciting transmitter were not random: they were referring to work that was just coming to fruition at EMI {{as a direct result}} of Lewis' earlier contract. EMI engineers Alan Blumlein and Eric White had developed a system that dispensed with a self-exciting transmitter circuit and instead used a separate modulator that fed the signal into the transmitter for amplification. The oscillator signal was also sent to the receiver, using it to damp its sensitivity. The combined effect was to sharpen the <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse,</b> while reducing 'ringing' in the receiver. In a test in May 1940, Hanbury Brown was able to clearly see the return at a range of , and could still make it out when they approached to 400.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid mixers, fed by a {{waveform}} generator and an exciter for a complex but coherent waveform. This waveform {{can be generated}} by low power/low-voltage input signals. In this case the radar transmitter must be a power-amplifier, e.g., a klystron tube or a solid state transmitter. In this way, the <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> is intrapulse-modulated and the radar receiver must use pulse compression techniques.|$|E
50|$|Each <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> is {{separated}} in distance the ambiguous range interval. Multiple samples are taken between <b>transmit</b> <b>pulses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Pulse-Doppler signal {{processing}} begins with samples taken between multiple <b>transmit</b> <b>pulses.</b> Sample strategy expanded for one <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> is shown.|$|R
50|$|Intra-pulse {{scalloping}} {{is improved}} by shortening the <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> or by modulating the <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse.</b> This can include frequency or phase shifting associated with pulse compression.|$|R
25|$|High voltage switch for non-coherent keyed power-oscillators These {{modulators}} {{consist of}} a high voltage pulse generator formed from a high voltage supply, a pulse forming network, and a high voltage switch such as a thyratron. They generate short pulses of power to feed, e.g., the magnetron, a special type of vacuum tube that converts DC (usually pulsed) into microwaves. This technology is known as pulsed power. In this way, the <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> of RF radiation is kept to a defined and usually very short duration.|$|E
25|$|Beams 2 through 9 were {{projected}} in horizontal array; 10 through 17 (although 10 actually lies in {{the horizontal}} row) were grouped as the vertical component. All beams of each group were powered simultaneously. Except for being controlled by a master timing signal, {{each of the eight}} channels operated independently of the others. Each transmitter was on a slightly different frequency to prevent interaction with the others. The <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse,</b> 2000 microseconds long, was coded, or tagged, by being passed through a tapped delay line which may reversed the phase at 20-microsecond intervals. Upon reception the returned signal was passed through the same tapped delay line and compressed 100:1, to 20 microseconds in order to increase the accuracy and resolution of the range measurement, which was of course a function of the interval between transmission and return.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{characteristics}} of the magnetron's output make radar use of the device somewhat problematic. The first of these factors is the magnetron's inherent instability in its transmitter frequency. This instability results not only in frequency shifts from one pulse to the next, but also a frequency shift within an individual <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse.</b> The second factor is that {{the energy of the}} <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> is spread over a relatively wide frequency spectrum, which requires the receiver to have a correspondingly wide bandwidth. This wide bandwidth allows ambient electrical noise to be accepted into the receiver, thus obscuring somewhat the weak radar echoes, thereby reducing overall receiver signal-to-noise ratio and thus performance. [...] The third factor, depending on application, is the radiation hazard caused by the use of high power electromagnetic radiation. In some applications, for example a marine radar mounted on a recreational vessel, a radar with a magnetron output of 2 to 4 kilowatts is often found mounted very near an area occupied by crew or passengers. In practical use these factors have been overcome, or merely accepted, and there are today thousands of magnetron aviation and marine radar units in service. [...] Recent advances in aviation weather avoidance radar and in marine radar have successfully replaced the magnetron with semiconductor microwave oscillators, which have a narrower output frequency range. [...] These allow a narrower receiver bandwidth to be used, and the higher signal to noise ratio in turn allows a lower transmitter power, reducing exposure to EMR.|$|E
50|$|Moving target {{indicator}} (MTI) {{begins with}} sampling two successive pulses. Sampling begins {{immediately after the}} radar <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> ends. The sampling continues until the next <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> begins.|$|R
50|$|This is {{explained}} best {{using the following}} example, where PRF A produces a <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> every 6 km and PRF B produces a <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> every 5 km.|$|R
50|$|High power {{microwave}} devices, like crossed-field amplifier, are not phase-stable. The {{phase of}} each <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> {{is different from}} the previous and future <b>transmit</b> <b>pulses.</b> This phenomenon is called phase jitter.|$|R
2500|$|Herbert G. Winful {{argues that}} the train analogy is {{a variant of the}} [...] "reshaping argument" [...] for superluminal {{tunneling}} velocities, but {{he goes on to say}} that this argument is not actually supported by experiment or simulations, which actually show that the <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> has the same length and shape as the incident pulse. Instead, Winful {{argues that the}} group delay in tunneling is not actually the transit time for the pulse (whose spatial length must be greater than the barrier length in order for its spectrum to be narrow enough to allow tunneling), but is instead the lifetime of the energy stored in a standing wave which forms inside the barrier. Since the stored energy in the barrier is less than the energy stored in a barrier-free region of the same length due to destructive interference, the group delay for the energy to escape the barrier region is shorter than it would be in free space, which according to Winful is the explanation for apparently superluminal tunneling.|$|E
50|$|Pulse {{compression}} is {{a signal}} processing technique commonly used by radar, sonar and echography {{to increase the}} range resolution {{as well as the}} signal to noise ratio. This is achieved by modulating the <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> and then correlating the received signal with the <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{power of the}} <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> is [...] The energy put into that signal is: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{digital filter}} {{produces}} as many frequency outputs {{as the number}} of <b>transmit</b> <b>pulses</b> used for sampling. Production of one FFT with 1024 frequency outputs requires 1024 <b>transmit</b> <b>pulses</b> for input.|$|R
50|$|Moving objects cause a {{phase-shift}} {{within the}} <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> that produces signal cancellation. This phenomenon also has detrimental effect on {{moving target indicator}} systems, where the detection scheme subtracts signals received from two or more <b>transmit</b> <b>pulses.</b>|$|R
30|$|Provided the <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> {{optimized}} by the orthogonal method, naive receiver {{refers to}} the receive pulse which adopts a symmetric shape of the <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> generated by Algorithm 1, i.e., γ(t)=g(t). Herein, we provide several design examples in this section.|$|R
50|$|Each pulse {{is made up}} of a step up {{followed}} after a short interval by a step down. It is possible, even in {{the presence}} of electronic noise, to recover the timing of these steps and from that regenerate the <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> stream almost noiselessly. Then the accuracy of the transmission process reduces to the accuracy with which the <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> stream represents the input waveform.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately the {{analysis}} for the <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> stream has, in many cases, been carried over, uncritically, to the ADC.|$|E
5000|$|Besides, {{the power}} of the noise does not change through {{intercorrelation}} since it is not correlated to the <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> (it is totally random). As a consequence: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Transmit</b> <b>pulses</b> {{are sent}} at the pulse {{repetition}} frequency.|$|R
30|$|The {{addition}} {{of the ability to}} monitor <b>transmitting</b> <b>pulse</b> intensity.|$|R
50|$|First, {{the shape}} of the <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> is {{adjusted}} to smooth the leading edge and trailing edge so that RF power is increased and decreased without an abrupt change. This creates a <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> with smooth ends instead of a square wave, which reduces ringing phenomenon that is otherwise associated with target reflection.|$|R
5000|$|If the PRI is uniform, blind ranges {{will remain}} {{unchanged}} along azimuth, and after compression in azimuth, the image would have blind strips of width [...]If the PRI varies, although, the blind ranges still exist, but {{the position of}} these blind ranges also vary and will be different for each <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse,</b> because <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> are only related to the preceding transmitted pulses. So when the overall synthetic aperture is taken into consideration, {{it turns out that}} at each slant range, only some of the transmitted pulses are missing, thus it is possible to obtain a SAR image over a wide continuous swath. The figure on the right shows the location of blind range of both fixed PRI and varied PRI.|$|E
5000|$|The range {{resolution}} (the ability {{to separate the}} pixels of the image perpendicular to the direction of flight) of an SLAR depends {{on the length of}} the <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse.</b> At the ground of Earth the {{range resolution}} has got an inverse relationship with the depression angle: ...|$|E
50|$|Clearly narrow beamwidths {{and short}} pulses are {{required}} to reduce the effect of clutter by reducing {{the volume of the}} clutter cell. If pulse compression is used then the appropriate pulse duration {{to be used in the}} calculation is that of the compressed pulse, not the <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Pulse-Doppler signal processing. The Range Sample axis {{represents}} individual {{samples taken}} in between each <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse.</b> The Range Interval axis represents each successive <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> interval during which samples are taken. The Fast Fourier Transform process converts time-domain samples into frequency domain spectra. This {{is sometimes called}} the bed of nails.|$|R
50|$|Non-Doppler radar {{are blind}} for the {{duration}} of the <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse.</b>|$|R
5000|$|D = Doppler {{filter size}} (<b>transmit</b> <b>pulses</b> in each Fast Fourier transform) ...|$|R
50|$|The time {{of flight}} of an {{ultrasonic}} pulse that has been transmitted through the material is measured using an electronic timer that determines {{the start of the}} <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> and the start of the received pulse using threshold detection. This timer is typically accurate to microsecond or better resolution.|$|E
5000|$|Why {{this will}} work? Because in {{satellite}} SAR imaging, antenna length and required azimuth resolution set an upper {{bound to the}} selected PRI. The PRI, in turn, will limit the maximum continuous swath width in slant range, which is only slightly influenced by the uncompressed <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> length [...] The continuous time interval that the radar echo can be received is upper bounded by the time interval {{between the end of}} a <b>transmitted</b> <b>pulse</b> and the beginning of next one, say [...] However, when the radar is transmitting, the device cannot receive radar echo, thus the radar can only receive a signal from targets that are included within [...] The difference between these two time intervals [...] causes the blind range area which is given by , where [...] is the speed of light in free space.|$|E

50|$|The {{pulse width}} of each sample matches the pulse {{width of the}} <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse.</b>|$|R
50|$|Energy {{from the}} <b>transmit</b> <b>pulses</b> {{propagate}} through space {{until they are}} disrupted by reflectors. This disruption causes some of the transmit energy to be reflected back to the radar antenna or transducer, along with phase modulation caused by motion. The same tone {{that is used to}} generate the <b>transmit</b> <b>pulses</b> is also used to down-convert the received signals to baseband.|$|R
50|$|Sampling begins {{after each}} <b>transmit</b> <b>pulse</b> is extinguished. This is the {{quiescent}} {{phase of the}} transmitter.|$|R
