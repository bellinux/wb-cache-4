5|$|The {{molecules}} {{bound and}} acted upon by enzymes are called substrates. Although enzymes can consist {{of hundreds of}} amino acids, it is usually {{only a small fraction}} of the residues <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with the substrate, and an even smaller fraction—three to four residues on average—that are directly involved in catalysis. The region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site.|$|E
5|$|Best {{known for}} biting neat round chunks of tissue from marine mammals and large fish, the cookiecutter shark is {{considered}} a facultative ectoparasite, as it also wholly ingests smaller prey. It has a wide gape and a very strong bite, by virtue of heavily calcified cranial and labial cartilages. With small fins and weak muscles, this ambush predator spends much of its time hovering in the water column. To maintain neutral buoyancy, its liver, which can comprise some 35% of its weight, is rich in low-density lipids. As this species has higher skeletal density than Euprotomicrus or Squaliolus, its body cavity and liver are proportionately much larger, and the oil content is much higher. Its large caudal fin allows for a quick burst of speed to catch larger, faster prey <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> range.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team schedules {{the release}} of a major update approximately every three months. Each of these free content patches includes a continuation of the main scenario as well as new raids, features, trials, and dungeons. Minor patches <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> between major updates focus on quality of life changes. In addition to regular free updates, the game features full expansion packs that add new zones, races, jobs, and premiere a new content cycle. The first expansion is titled Heavensward; and the second, Stormblood.|$|E

5|$|Toxic {{blue-green algae}} blooms are a {{reasonably}} common occurrence in the lake. Warnings about coming {{into contact with}} the water are released when an algal bloom is detected. Attempts are being made to limit the amount of phosphates entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality. Blue-green algae (more correctly cyanobacteria) produce toxins, which can be harmful for humans and any other animals <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with the contaminated water. There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water.|$|E
5|$|Turbinates {{are thin}} bones or cartilages <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> two types, with two functions. Nasal {{olfactory}} turbinates {{are found in}} all living tetrapods and function in smell. Respiratory turbinates function to prevent water loss through evaporation and are found only in birds and mammals, modern endotherms (warm-blooded animals) who could lose {{a great deal of}} water while breathing because they breathe more often than comparably sized ectotherms (cold-blooded animals) to support their higher metabolism. Ruben and others in 1996 concluded that respiratory turbinates were probably not present in Nanotyrannus, Ornithomimus or Hypacrosaurus based on CT scanning, thus {{there was no evidence that}} those animals were warm-blooded.|$|E
5|$|Super Smash Bros. Brawl {{features}} a new Adventure Mode titled Super Smash Bros. Brawl: The Subspace Emissary. This mode features unique character storylines along with numerous side scrolling levels and multiple bosses to fight, {{as well as}} CG cut scenes explaining the storyline. The Subspace Emissary {{features a}} new group of antagonists called the Subspace Army, who are led by the Ancient Minister. Some of these enemy characters appeared in previous Nintendo video games, such as Petey Piranha from the Mario series and a squadron of R.O.B.s based on classic Nintendo hardware. The Subspace Emissary also boasts a number of original enemies, such as the Roader, a robotic unicycle; the Bytan, a one-eyed ball-like creature which can replicate itself if left alone; and the Primid, enemies <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> many variations. Though primarily a single-player mode, The Subspace Emissary allows for cooperative multiplayer. There are five difficulty levels for each stage, and there is a method of increasing characters' powers during the game. This is done by placing collected stickers onto the bottom of a character's trophy between stages to improve various aspects of a fighter.|$|E

25|$|Knock-down {{fasteners}} are {{a hardware}} device {{made for the}} purpose of constructing butt joints that can be assembled and re-assembled repeatedly (hence knock-down). This type of fastener is very popular in flat-pack furniture, which is typified by items such as book cases and wall units <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> a package of pre-cut and pre-drilled components ready to assemble by a novice. They are also very common in modern modular kitchens.|$|E

Each of these free content patches includes a continuation of the main scenario as well as new raids, features, trials, and dungeons. Minor patches <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> between major updates focus on quality of life improvements. As with A Realm Reborn, Square Enix released five major patches for Heavensward over the course of its two year content cycle. The final patches serve as a segue into the story of the second expansion, Stormblood.|$|E
25|$|The Abruzzo {{region has}} the Apennines running along its western border and {{includes}} Corno Grande, {{the highest point}} on mainland Italy. The mountain range serves as a tempering influence on the climate, blocking many storms <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> from the west. However, this does leave the area prone to storm systems originating from the east, which are blocked in their westward progression by the mountains, causing high levels of precipitation to fall on the vineyards, as happened during several rain soaked vintages of the late 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{gameplay}} involves solving puzzles {{by using}} items with other items or with objects and characters onscreen. Another significant {{aspect of the}} game involves talking with characters in the game, namely the bots that work in the ship and a parrot, by inputting prompts in the Chat-O-Mat mode. Additionally to conversation with characters through interpreting of user input, the parser often provides hints or explanations <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> the form of pre-recorded speech, which can help the player in progressing in the game.|$|E

Oversized loads, such as a survival shack hauled by Dufresne, sometimes require his help to get from the edge of town to the freight yard. His cousin Isaac drives with Rowland to get some road experience before taking the written exam for his truck driver's license.|$|E
25|$|Contaminants in a {{collection}} can pose a threat {{not only to the}} objects within the collection, but also to those individuals <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with them. It is therefore necessary to ensure that all objects brought into {{a collection}} are carefully documented and researched to prevent accidental contaminations, and to create storage conditions, such as those mentioned above, to mitigate the potential for future contaminate development. Potential contaminants can take the form of gases, liquids, or solids and may therefore pollute objects, and the individuals caring for them, through airborne delivery or physical contact. Collections affected by contaminants will show signs of disintegration, discoloration, or corrosion, with porous materials being the most susceptible.|$|E
25|$|Edit mode {{allows the}} {{creation}} of tracks. Players can lay track pieces <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> an assortment of sizes and shapes. Each piece has a list of obstacles available. Track pieces are valued at varying points, for example, larger pieces are worth more points. A track may have up to 255 points. Players can participate in races on them, or setup camera angles to spectate artificial intelligence (AI)-controlled racers. Custom tracks can be saved to one of thirty slots for future use and shared with other players via Game Link Cable. The game can also generate a track-specific password that can be inputted on any Climax cartridge for conversion back to the custom track.|$|E

25|$|Postage stamps <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> strips {{with the}} {{individual}} stamps arranged side by side or one above the other and rolled into a coil for sale {{at the post office}} are referred to as coil stamps. The coil configuration made the repeated removal of individual stamps easier for the clerks and others who dealt with mass mailings on a daily basis. The coil configuration also made it possible to dispense individual stamps in vending machines. Responding to complaints from vending machine companies that coil stamps with standard perforations (perforated 12) separated too easily, the postal service introduced a much coarser gauge—perforated 8½—in 1910. This gauge, however, proved problematic for opposite reasons: the stamps proved too difficult to separate. As a result, a finer gauge, perforated 10, was used for coils from 1914 on.|$|E

25|$|Prions, the {{infectious}} agent of CJD, {{may not be}} inactivated by means of routine surgical instrument sterilization procedures. The World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that instrumentation used in such cases be immediately destroyed after use; short of destruction, {{it is recommended that}} heat and chemical decontamination be used in combination to process instruments <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with high-infectivity tissues. No cases of iatrogenic transmission of CJD have been reported subsequent to the adoption of current sterilization procedures, or since 1976. Copper-hydrogen peroxide has been suggested {{as an alternative to the}} current recommendation of sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite. Thermal depolymerization also destroys prions in infected organic and inorganic matter, since the process chemically attacks protein at the molecular level, although more effective and practical methods involve destruction by combinations of detergents and enzymes similar to biological washing powders.|$|E
