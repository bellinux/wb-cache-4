This may lead drastically to the reduction in bank rates on loans since the banks can establish whether <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> servicing a loan from another bank which {{will result in a}} reduction in the incidents of bad debts.|$|E
5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} {{formation}} of L.torminosus is pileostipitocarpic. In {{this type of}} development, the hymenium forms early {{on the underside of}} the cap and upper stem of the mushroom primordium. As the cap enlarges, the margin, made of flaring filamentous hyphae that grow outward and downward, tends to curve inward, eventually forming a flap of tissue roughly parallel to the stem surface. As further development takes place, these hyphae make contact with and adhere to the hymenial surface of the stem, covering basidia and macrocystidia (very long cystidia) already present. The junction between the two tissues produces a cavity that provides some temporary protection to the basidia, although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> fertile when the cap margin starts to grow.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pinniped}} {{continue to be}} harvested. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals allows limited hunting of crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. However, Weddell seal hunting is prohibited between September and February if the animal is over one year of age, to ensure breeding stocks are healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant seals, Ross seals and Antarctic fur seals. The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents {{argue that it is}} irresponsible to kill harp seals as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> threatened by declining habitat.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} people who visited Malta in 2009 dropped {{considerably}} compared to the figures for 2008 - overall, the country's tourism industry suffered an 8 percent drop from 2008. Visits from non-European Union countries dropped more considerably than visits from European Union countries (and even more so than visits from Eurozone countries), while the average stay length remained the same for both 2008 and 2009. Visitors from most countries require a visa to visit Malta. The nationalities requiring a visa are standardised as per European Union rules. Visitors already holding a valid Schengen Area visa most likely will not need to complete any more formalities to enter Malta (so long as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> inside the Schengen Area). Visitors holding citizenship of the European Union do not require a visa to enter Malta as they hold the right to free movement within the European Union. In recent years, the country's tourism industry has been faced with a number of issues relating to the nation's small size, both in terms of area and population. These issues include stretched resources and infrastructure (such as water, waste management, beaches and roads), especially during the summer months of July and August.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the females}} {{initiate}} courtship, {{female and male}} cardinalfish are mutually selective. Females have been observed courting larger males more intensively. Even when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> {{in the process of}} courting one male, they often moved on to an intruder male if it is larger than the original. Females have also been observed producing larger eggs for larger, hence more ‚Äòattractive,‚Äô males. Females are also able to increase egg size even after the onset of egg maturation if they encounter a new, larger male to brood its eggs.|$|E
25|$|When the {{bottleneck}} is localized, optimization usually {{starts with}} a rethinking of the algorithm used in the program. More often than not, a particular algorithm can be specifically tailored to a particular problem, yielding better performance than a generic algorithm. For example, the task of sorting a huge list of items is usually done with a quicksort routine, {{which is one of}} the most efficient generic algorithms. But if some characteristic of the items is exploitable (for example, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> arranged in some particular order), a different method can be used, or even a custom-made sort routine.|$|E
25|$|This dress {{has fallen}} into disuse since the 1980s. Initially {{this was due}} to Sir Paul Reeves, as a cleric, {{choosing}} not wearing a military uniform. Although not specifically colonial, the traditional dress was abandoned as overt reminders of a colonial legacy. Usually the Governor-General will now wear a black lounge jacket with morning dress trousers for men or formal day dress for ladies (or military uniform if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> entitled to it) for ceremonial occasions and normal day dress at other times. The undress form of the uniform is still worn on rare occasions, such as when the Governor-General visits military bases.|$|E

25|$|Patent {{prints are}} chance {{friction}} ridge impressions which are obvious {{to the human}} eye and which {{have been caused by}} the transfer of foreign material from a finger onto a surface. Some obvious examples would be impressions from flour and wet clay. Because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> visible and have no need of enhancement they are generally photographed rather than being lifted in the way that latent prints are. An attempt to preserve the actual print is always made for later presentation in court, and there are many techniques used to do this. Patent prints can be left on a surface by materials such as ink, dirt, or blood.|$|E
25|$|There are {{advantages}} to using biological polymers over synthetic polymers. They are {{very likely to}} have good biocompatibility and be easily degraded, because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> present in nature in some form. However, there are also several disadvantages. They have unwieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that cannot be controlled over a wide range. In addition, {{there is always the}} possibility that naturally-derived materials may cause an immune response or contain microbes. In the production of naturally-derived materials there will also be batch-to-batch variation in large-scale isolation procedures that cannot be controlled. Some other problems plaguing natural polymers are their inability to support growth across long lesion gaps due to the possibility of collapse, scar formation, and early re-absorption. Despite all these disadvantages, some of which can be overcome, biological polymers still prove to be the optimal choice in many situations.|$|E
25|$|A common {{degradation}} {{issue in}} ceramics involves soluble salts. Soluble salts can either enter the clay {{body from the}} environment, for example from being buried underground for decades, or <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> naturally occurring due to {{the components of the}} materials or clay used. Non-archaeological objects, such as modern dishware, can acquire salts from normal use such as storing salt. Soluble salts respond to changes in humidity both high and low. In high humidity salts become soluble and in low humidity they crystallize. The changing from soluble to crystallization and back damages the surface of the ceramic because salt crystals are larger than liquid salt and therefore will shrink and expand the ceramic body. A white haze on the surface is the first indication of soluble salts, which is the salt crystallizing. Overtime the physical component of the body will crumble until it is completely destroyed.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, in {{response}} to lobbying scandals involving, among others, Jack Abramoff and Duke Cunningham, Congress passed a lobbying and ethics reform package to which Vitter proposed a package of five amendments. The Senate approved three that limited which legislators' spouses could lobby the Senate, created criminal penalties for legislators and executive branch officials who falsify financial reports, and doubled the penalties for lobbyists who failed to comply with disclosure requirements. The Senate rejected prohibiting legislators from paying their families with campaign funds with some saying it was unrelated to the current legislation and others that the payments were not a problem. Additionally, they tabled his proposal to define Indian tribes as corporations and its members as stockholders {{so that they are}} required to contribute to candidates through political action committees instead of their tribal treasury. Senators objected saying that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> subjected to campaign laws for unincorporated entities and individuals and that the proposal was singling them out unfairly. The reform package became law in September 2007.|$|E
