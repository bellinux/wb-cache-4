[...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> with filtering content at the user end, and not at the source. [...] It is impossible to enforce parental monitoring of their children. [...] Justice Breyer uses an example illustrating that “more than 28 million school age children have both parents or their sole parent in the work force, at least 5 million children are left alone at home without supervision each week, and many of those children will spend afternoons and evenings with friends who may well have access to computers and more lenient parents.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Judaism has {{traditionally}} taught that God is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent. Yet, these claims are in jarring {{contrast with the}} fact that there is much evil in the world. Perhaps the most difficult question that monotheists have confronted is [...] "how can one reconcile the existence of this view of God with the existence of evil?" [...] or [...] "how can there be good without bad?" [...] "how can there be a God without a devil?" [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of evil. [...] Within all monotheistic faiths many answers (theodicies) have been proposed. [...] However, in light of the magnitude of evil seen in the Holocaust, many people have re-examined classical views on this subject. How can people still have any kind of faith after the Holocaust? [...] This set of Jewish philosophies is discussed in the article on Holocaust theology.|$|E

50|$|Earlier {{attempts}} at designing such an engine {{met with the}} difficulty of arranging the pistons {{to move in the}} correct manner, for all three cylinders in one delta, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> which caused Junkers Motorenbau to leave behind work on the delta-form while continuing to prototype a diamond-form four-crankshaft 24-cylinder Junkers Jumo 223. Mr. Herbert Penwarden, a senior draughtsman with the Admiralty Engineering Laboratory, suggested that one crankshaft needed to revolve anti-clockwise to achieve the correct piston-phasing, so Napier designers produced the necessary gearing in order that one of them rotated in the opposite direction to the other two.|$|R
