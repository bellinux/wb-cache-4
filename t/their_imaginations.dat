5|$|As {{noted by}} several critics and commentators, the film's story and style mirror {{elements}} from Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera. V and the Phantom both wear masks {{to hide their}} disfigurements, control others through the leverage of <b>their</b> <b>imaginations,</b> have tragic pasts, and are motivated by revenge. V and Evey's relationship also parallels many of the romantic elements of The Phantom of the Opera, where the masked Phantom takes Christine Daaé to his subterranean lair to re-educate her.|$|E
5|$|The censors thus {{expanded}} their jurisdiction {{from what was}} seen to what was implied in the spectator's mind. In The Office Wife (1930), several of Joan Blondell's disrobing maneuvers were strictly forbidden and the implied image of the actress being naked just off-screen was deemed too suggestive even though it relied upon the audience using <b>their</b> <b>imaginations,</b> so post-Code releases of the film had scenes which were blurred or rendered indistinct, if allowed at all.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} of academic, peer-reviewed research concerning {{different aspects of}} Magic: The Gathering. One example examined how players use <b>their</b> <b>imaginations</b> when playing. This research studied hobby players and showed how players sought to create and participate in an epic fantasy narrative. Another example used online auctions for Magic cards to test revenue outcomes for various auction types. A final example uses probability to examine Magic card-collecting strategies. Using {{a specific set of}} cards in a specialized manner has shown Magic: The Gathering to be Turing complete.|$|E

25|$|The primary corroborative sighting, however, {{occurred}} {{ten days}} later (July 4) when a United Airlines crew over Idaho en route to Seattle also spotted five to nine disk-like objects that paced their plane for 10 to 15 minutes before suddenly disappearing.

The main difference in shape was that the United crew thought the objects appeared rough on top. This {{was one of the}} few sightings that Arnold felt was reliable, most of the rest he thought were the public seeing other things and letting <b>their</b> <b>imaginations</b> run wild. Arnold and Cpt. Smith became friends, met again with Army Air Force intelligence officers on July 12 and filed sighting reports, then teamed up again at the end of July in investigating the strange Maury Island incident.|$|E

40|$|Many {{scholars}} {{acknowledge that}} entrepreneurs use <b>their</b> <b>imagination.</b> What entrepreneurs use <b>their</b> <b>imagination</b> for is known. However, what imagination is, and how entrepreneurs can use <b>their</b> <b>imagination</b> most effectively remain unknown. The {{goal of this}} research is to increase our understanding of the use of imagination by entrepreneurs. We conceptualize, demarcate and define the concept of imagination based on social and cognitive psychology literature. Subsequently, we theorize how certain factors influence the effective use of imagination by entrepreneurs. Based on the literature and the interviews we conducted with entrepreneurs, we developed propositions that guide us in our research. We analyzed the use of imagination by entrepreneurs by studying their diaries and conducting experiments. Among other results, we find that prospective thinking, which is future-oriented imagination, is effective for entrepreneurs to identify business opportunities. Additionally, we find that counterfactual thinking, which is alternatives-oriented imagination, is effective for entrepreneurs to develop business strategies. Our research contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by offering a theoretical lens to study the use of imagination by entrepreneurs. Furthermore, our research informs practice by suggesting that entrepreneurs should train the use of <b>their</b> <b>imagination</b> and that entrepreneurship support organizations could include such trainings in their programs...|$|R
25|$|The {{children}} {{became interested}} in writing from an early age, initially as a game which later matured into a passion. Although they all displayed a talent for narrative, it was the younger ones whose pastime it became to develop them. At {{the centre of the}} children's creativity were twelve wooden soldiers which Patrick Brontë gave to Branwell at the beginning of June 1826. These toy soldiers instantly fired <b>their</b> <b>imaginations</b> and they spoke of them as the Young Men, and gave them names. However, it was not until December 1827 that their ideas took written form, and the imaginary African kingdom of Glass Town came into existence, followed by the Empire of Angria. Emily and Anne created Gondal, an island continent in the North Pacific, ruled by a woman, after the departure of Charlotte in 1831. In the beginning, these stories were written in little books, the size of a matchbox , and cursorily bound with thread. The pages were filled with close, minute writing, often in capital letters without punctuation and embellished with illustrations, detailed maps, schemes, landscapes, and plans of buildings, created by the children according to their specialisations. The idea was that the books were of a size for the soldiers to read. The complexity of the stories matured as the children's imaginations developed, fed by reading the three weekly or monthly magazines to which their father had subscribed, or the newspapers that were bought daily from John Greenwood's local news and stationery store.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the reasons}} Trimmer {{believed}} fairy tales were dangerous was because they led child readers into a fantasy world where adults could not follow and control their exposure to harmful experiences. She was just as horrified by the graphic illustrations included with some fairy tale collections, complaining that [...] "little children, whose minds are susceptible of every impression; and who from the liveliness of <b>their</b> <b>imaginations</b> are apt to convert into realities whatever forcibly strikes their fancy" [...] {{should not be allowed}} to see such scenes as Blue Beard hacking his wife's head off.|$|E

While {{the rest of the}} world dismiss them as monstrous figments of <b>their</b> <b>imaginations</b> and elements of childhood nightmares, Magnus realizes that they are the world's triumphs and mistakes. Magnus hence becomes their protector, but in some cases, their captor. She is also described as [...] "bold and straightforward, brave and no-nonsense, yet she remains proudly true to her formal Victorian English sensibilities". Portraying actress Amanda Tapping described Magnus as a [...] "crazy character" [...] who is [...] "very eccentric and very sexy and very unapologetic".|$|E

500|$|Geisel's {{drawings}} {{formed a}} part of the narrative, bordering on the blending of text and image found in the much-denigrated comics medium. The artwork in children's literature before Geisel's appearance was much more restrained than Geisel's, and relegated to a lower status than the text it illustrated. By linking text and image, the book helps children follow the story even if they cannot read every word of the text. By encouraging children to explore the page, the drawings allow them to use <b>their</b> <b>imaginations</b> to fill in gaps in the text. The details shown in the pictures but not explained in the text creates a tension between them that leads the reader to think and imagine further. In the case of Mulberry Street, Philip Nel writes, readers might be moved to ask questions such as [...] "Why is the elephant blue?" [...] or [...] "Where did the airplane come from?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} {{begins with}} Bond laying flowers {{at the grave}} of his wife Tracy Bond, before a Universal Exports helicopter picks him up for an emergency. Control of the helicopter is taken over by remote control by a bald man in a grey Nehru jacket with a white cat. This character is unnamed in either the film or the credits, although he looks and sounds like Ernst Stavro Blofeld as played by Donald Pleasence or Telly Savalas. Director John Glen referred to {{the identity of the}} villain obliquely: [...] "We just let people use <b>their</b> <b>imaginations</b> and draw their own conclusions... It's a legal thing". The character is deliberately not named due to copyright restrictions with Kevin McClory, who owned the film rights to Thunderball, which supposedly includes the character Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the organisation SPECTRE, and other material associated with the development of Thunderball. Eon disputed McClory's ownership of the Blofeld character, but decided not to use him again: the scene was [...] "a deliberate statement by Broccoli of his lack of need to use the character." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Bob Sertner {{wanted the}} film to have higher-end special effects to mimic the quality of those seen in feature films. [...] To do this, the film uses visual computer effects created by special effects company Area 51 FX, which created over 100 different shots using the digital modeling program LightWave 3D. During shooting, special effect supervisor Craig Weiss noted that the scenes with Randy Quaid were particularly difficult to capture on film due to his appearing in multiple scenes where his character was chased by twisters and surrounded by their destructive aftermaths. The actors also faced new challenges, as the film often replaced traditional green screen setup, where the special effects were added during editing, with live shots taken with the effects {{in place at the}} same time. Nancy McKeon, who was pregnant with her first child during production, filmed some of her scenes using a green screen. She found the experience to be fun, noting that it challenges actors to use <b>their</b> <b>imaginations</b> while performing. She also found it easy to play a television reporter due to her being a self-admitted [...] "news junkie." ...|$|E
