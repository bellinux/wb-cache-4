40|$|This {{dissertation}} gives {{a description}} of the regulation of marriage, registered partnership and cohabitation - emphazising the joint dwelling - in the perspective of two basic normative patterns, on one side community and on the other financial independence/individual ownership, trying to explain the differences and similarities between the regulations. The content of the legal regulation is, furthermore, set in relation to the question whether marriage and cohabitation are best characterised as status or contractual relationships. The idea of marriage as a lifelong union for the common good stands in opposition to the view on marriage as a <b>terminable</b> <b>contract.</b> Marriage as a status relationship builds on the idea of community. The basic normative pattern of community stands, however, in conflict with the basic normative pattern of individual ownership and financial independence, which is also at work in the field of family law. The tension between these different normative poles surfaces constantly in the law of marriage, and now even in the law governing registered partnership. The concept of cohabitation - whether heterosexual or homosexual - does not, contrary to marriage, include an expectation that the relationship should be life-long. The idea of a community exists nevertheless also in a cohabitation relationship and conflicts with the pattern of financial indepence and indvidual ownership. As in the case for spouses, the levelling of community property for cohabitees serves several purposes: economic justice, protecion of the weaker party and the ambition to achieve economic equality between men and women...|$|E

Mr Rigby, {{who worked as a}} lathe {{operator}} on £129 a week with a <b>contract</b> <b>terminable</b> on 12 weeks’ notice, made it known he did not accept the wage reduction.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Strategic alliances are a prevalent form of business organization. The critical characteristics of strategic alliances are detailed using Coase (1937) and the resulting definition tested through primary research and the alternative form, the infrastructure alliance posited. The thesis examines whether strategic alliances add value in the European banking sector through four types of analysis at two levels of engagement - a 23 historical review (at industry level); a review of over 400 papers in the academic literature; a questionnaire survey (at firm level) and in-depth interviews (at firm level). Bankers high pre-existing propensity to enter into strategic alliances is determined and three lifecycles, and the underpinning, conditions identified - Clubs and Consortium Banks, Bankassurance and the Virtual bank - the latter involving {{a fundamental change in}} Coase (1937) enabled by the underpinning technology. Bankers were found to be followers of potential business steams and the strategic alliance was one form of market entry. The questionnaire research, however, identified European bankers prefer to enter into alliances (as opposed to own branch or M&A) only in countries which had the appropriate supporting conditions such as definable, enforceable and <b>terminable</b> <b>contracts,</b> the provision of accounting information, stable governments and economic freedom. Direct discussions with senior bankers resulted in a number of valuable insights into the conceiving, forming, organizing evolving and dissolving of alliances. Further research into the infrastructure alliance, including 'oscillation' between infrastructure and strategic forms is proposed. The Co-Evolution Model of Strategic Alliances is proposed and taxonomy consisting of parallel co-evolution, convergent coevolution, divergent co-evolution and the subsidiary taxonomy of differential parallel coevolution, differential convergent co-evolution and differential divergent co-evolution detailed and further research suggested. Strategic alliances are found to add value in European banking but this value is contingent on the strength of the business stream, the global, national and industry conditions and the nature of managerial decisions and drive...|$|R

50|$|The {{line from}} Kanpur to Allahabad was opened in 1859. In 1860, the Kanpur-Etawah section was opened to traffic and between 1862 and 1866 all gaps between Howrah and Delhi were filled and the {{connection}} to Agra was built. The bridges over the Yamuna at Allahabad and at Delhi were completed in 1865 and 1866 respectively. In June 1867 the Allahabad-Jabalpur branch was completed and a connection made at Jabalpur with the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, thus completing the rail connections between Calcutta and Delhi and Calcutta and Bombay. On 31 December 1879, the British Indian Government purchased the East Indian Railway Company, but leased {{it back to the}} company to work under a <b>contract</b> <b>terminable</b> in 1919.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{simultaneously}} exposes {{a fundamental}} error in employment termination doctrine and a paradox in contract law jurisprudence. Contemporary employment law has developed {{under the assumption}} that at-will parties may terminate their relationship both without reason and without notice. This Article argues that the second half of this formulation—the idea that parties reserve the procedural right to terminate without notice—is neither historically supported nor legally correct. Employment at will, as originally expressed, was a mere duration presumption reflecting America’s rejection of the predominant British rule favoring one-year employment terms. While subsequent case law expanded the presumption in various ways, a reinterpretation that requires advance notice of termination remains compatible with the way in which most contemporary courts articulate the rule. In fact, an examination of general contract law reveals that in a variety of nonemployment contexts, courts impose on parties to an indefinite relationship the duty to provide reasonable notice while still safeguarding their right to terminate at will. Such an obligation serves not only as a gap filler in the face of contractual silence, but also as a good faith limitation on parties’ exercise of substantive discretion. Absent such a notice requirement, employment is an illusory relationship, one that lacks the modicum of consideration necessary to create a binding contract. While courts have sought to circumvent this problem by theorizing employment as a unilateral contract, that formulation is ill-suited to the reality that both sides generally anticipate an ongoing, dynamic relationship. This Article recasts employment as a bilateral <b>contract</b> <b>terminable</b> at will by either party upon reasonable notice. Establishing a reasonable notice obligation will grant terminated workers paid transition time to seek new employment and develop new skills. At the same time, adopting this rule paves the way for a more unified body of contract law. The case for deviations from general contract principles is strongest where context-specific rules fulfill the reasonable expectations of the weaker party. Employment-specific contract rules, as they currently stand, do precisely the opposite. While ordinary contract law cannot adequately protect workers’ interests in all circumstances, this Article demonstrates that in at least some instances mainstream doctrine, properly understood and applied, can produce results that are both good for workers and in harmony with existing law...|$|R
