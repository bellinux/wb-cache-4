5|$|The {{success of}} ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from {{its ability to}} adapt to the {{conditions}} of the Nile River valley for agriculture. <b>The</b> <b>predictable</b> flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a pharaoh, who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people {{in the context of an}} elaborate system of religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Wildfire {{intensity}} increases during daytime hours. For example, burn {{rates of}} smoldering logs {{are up to}} five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground {{during the day and}} causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00a.m. because of <b>the</b> <b>predictable</b> increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1980s, Swedish Viggen fighter pilots, using <b>the</b> <b>predictable</b> {{patterns}} of Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird routine flights over the Baltic Sea, {{had managed to}} achieve missile lock-on with radar on the SR-71 on numerous occasions. Despite heavy jamming from the SR-71, target illumination was maintained by feeding target location from ground-based radars to the fire-control computer in the Viggen. The most common site for the lock-on to occur was the thin stretch of international airspace between Öland and Gotland that the SR-71 used on the return flight. The Viggen is the only aircraft to get an acknowledged radar lock on the SR-71.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} has found {{the average length of}} abstinence for bulimics in OA was significantly higher than the average length for binge eaters. Paradoxically, bulimics were also found to attend fewer meetings, and had less of a commitment to write their thoughts and feelings down daily. However, the frequency of relapse for bulimics and binge eaters was not significantly different. The differences may be explained by <b>the</b> <b>predictable</b> nature of the bulimic cycle. Other {{research has}} found binge eaters in OA had better success than bulimics. Most OA members who have reported negative experiences in the program are anorexic. This could be caused by OA's focus on problems of eating too much rather than too little. Some OA practices, such as refraining from eating certain kinds of foods, are antithetical in the case of anorexics. Though, most anorexics have a previous history of bulimia.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of the early Roman Empire, {{especially}} after Rome's conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE, open-ocean crossing of the Arabian Sea direct to southern India's Malabar Coast was near routine. Details of this trading across the Indian Ocean have been passed down in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. According to the Roman geographer Strabo, the early Empire sent a fleet of around 120 ships on an annual one-year trip to China, Southeast Asia, India and back. The fleet timed its travel across the Arabian Sea to take advantage of <b>the</b> <b>predictable</b> monsoon winds. Returning from India, the ships travelled up the Red Sea, from where the cargo was carried overland or via the Nile-Red Sea canal to the Nile River, barged to Alexandria, and shipped from there to Italy and Rome. The rough geographical outlines of this same trade route would dominate the pepper trade into Europe for a millennium and a half to come.|$|E

40|$|Postmortem {{interval}} (PMI) estimation is {{very important}} in a suspicious death investigation. Myoglobin is a hemoprotein presents in striated muscles of living body. After death, myoglobin is exuded from muscles to blood, tissues and organs. So, the aim {{of this study was to}} estimate PMI from myoglobin concentrations in glandular tissues. This study was done on rats to detect the Postmortem concentration of myoglobin in pituitary, parotid and adrenal glands at different time intervals. There was a significant correlation between myoglobin concentration in glandular tissues and PMI. By multiple stepwise linear regression analysis, <b>the</b> most <b>predictable</b> model was <b>the</b> combination between pituitary, adrenal and parotid myoglobin concentrations (R 2 = 0. 992). <b>The</b> second <b>predictable</b> model was <b>the</b> combination between adrenal and pituitary myoglobin concentrations (R 2 = 0. 99). <b>The</b> last <b>predictable</b> model was adrenal myoglobin concentration (R 2 = 0. 980).
