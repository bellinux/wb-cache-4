Moore, on stage, credited the No Disco documentary with inspiring the reunion.|$|E

500|$|Actress Georgia Taylor {{was cast}} as Toyah {{and the role}} marked her acting debut. Taylor was {{studying}} for her A-levels when she originally auditioned for the part of Zoe Tattersall. She was unsuccessful, so she then auditioned for Toyah and won the role. Of her casting, she explained [...] "When I got the call to say that I'd got the part I just sat there open-mouthed, hugging my best friend. I could barely believe it. It is all very different than being on stage – it's not quite so intense because your audience isn't right <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of you. But it's a very different type of satisfaction, working much faster with storylines and characters developing all the time." [...] At {{the time of her}} casting, Taylor was two years older than the character she portrayed.|$|E
500|$|On 16 February, after {{observing the}} area for a few days, U-156 came around to the refineries. <b>There</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of her target were two Lago Company {{flat-bottom}} steamers, [...] and , both British-owned oilers. At 01:31, U-156 surfaced in San Nicolaas Harbour some [...] offshore and attacked the two British tankers at anchor. Hartenstein fired one torpedo from his bow tubes at Pedernales. The torpedo attack was successful and Pedernales was hit amidships. Loaded with crude oil, the steamer immediately burst into flames, killing eight of her 26 crewmen and wounding her captain Herbert McCall. Oranjestad then began to lift anchor and steam away {{but she was too}} late and was hit by a second torpedo fired from U-156. She too burst into flames and sunk an hour later in about [...] of water. Fifteen of her 22 crewmen were killed.|$|E
500|$|The {{read-through}} of [...] "The Vampires of Venice" [...] {{took place}} on 23 November 2009. It is the first Doctor Who episode to be directed by Campbell and the first co-produced by Patrick Schweizter. The episode was filmed in the fifth production block with [...] "Vincent and the Doctor". Due to the fact it would take time to cover up all the modern shops found in present-day Venice, the episode was filmed in the coastal town of Trogir, Croatia in late 2009. The Venetians had actually colonised Trogir, and the city bears much historical architecture, including some that was influenced by Venice. The interior of the Calvierri house was filmed at Atlantic College, Caerphilly Castle, Castell Coch, and the Town Hall of Trogir, while the Llancaich Fawr Manor, a 16th-century manor house near Cardiff, was used as Guido's home. The production team incorporated the Calvierri crest into as many locations as possible and the art department designed a [...] "fish gargoyle" [...] for the tower of the Calvierri house. A church tower in Trogir {{was used for the}} climax; this scene was challenging to film because of the stunts for Smith and a stunt double. The roof of the tower was constructed in the studio and some of the scene was filmed <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a greenscreen.|$|E

50|$|Lyrically, the up-tempo 'Right <b>In</b> <b>Front</b> Of You' {{explores the}} idea that people often search for things that they believe are so far away from them, without {{realising}} that they're under their noses.

500|$|By 1974, Patti Smith was {{performing}} rock music, initially with guitarist, bassist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and {{later with a}} full band comprising Kaye, Ivan Kral on guitar and bass, Jay Dee Daugherty on drums and Richard Sohl on piano. Ivan Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia who {{had moved to the}} United States in 1966 with his parents, who were diplomats. After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Kral decided not to return. Financed by Sam Wagstaff, the band recorded a first single, [...] "Hey Joe / Piss Factory", in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard {{with the addition of a}} spoken word piece about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst ("Patty Hearst, you're standing <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread, I was wondering were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women..."). A court later heard that Hearst had been confined against her will, and had been repeatedly threatened with execution and raped. The B-side describes the helpless anger Smith had felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she discovered in the form of a shoplifted book, the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations. In a 1996 interview which discusses artistic influences during her younger years, Smith said, [...] "I had devoted so much of my girlish daydreams to Rimbaud. Rimbaud was like my boyfriend." ...|$|E

I was wondering: were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women? Or were you really dead? And now that you're on the run, {{what goes on in}} your mind? Your sisters they sit by the window. You know, your mama does sit and cry. And your daddy—well, you know what your daddy said Patty. You know what your daddy said, Patty?

2500|$|In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus {{repeatedly}} {{spoke of}} forgiveness, [...] "Blessed are the merciful, for {{they will be}} shown mercy."

[...] Mark 11:25 (NIV)* [...] "But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.

Trendafil went to collect them from the villagers. When he surrendered the arms, they shot him with a gun and the bullet scratched his eye. Then I heard Ahmet Aga command with his own mouth for Trendafil to be impaled and burnt. The words he used were [...] "Shishak aor" [...] which is Turkish for [...] "to put on a skewer (as a shish kebab). After that, they took all the money he had, undressed him, gouged his eyes, pulled out his teeth and impaled him slowly on a stake, until it came out of his mouth. Then they roasted him while he was still alive. He lived for half-an-hour during this terrible scene. At the time, I was near Ahmet Aga with other Bulgarian women. We were surrounded by Bashi-Bozouk, who had us surrounded, and forced us to watch what was happening to Trendafil.“ One of her children, Vladimir, who was still a baby at his mother's breast, was impaled on a sword in front of her eyes. “At the time this was happening, Ahmet Aga's son took my child from my back and cut him to pieces, <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of me.
