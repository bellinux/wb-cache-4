5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the English Civil War in 1642 between <b>the</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> Charles I and Parliament, the castle was occupied by Captain Richard Swanley, a supporter of Parliament. In December 1648 it was briefly used to detain the King before his trial and execution. During the interregnum, it remained in use under the command of Colonel Thomas Eyre and was reinforced in 1650 to deal with the threat of a Royalist invasion.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War in 1642 between <b>the</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> Charles I and those of Parliament, Dartmouth initially sided with Parliament. In 1643, Prince Maurice besieged and took the town, whose defences proved vulnerable to a landward attack. In January 1646, Sir Thomas Fairfax led a Parliamentary army to retake Dartmouth, seizing Bayard's Cove Fort and the five iron artillery guns stationed there by the Royalists to protect the estuary.|$|E

5|$|In 1628 {{the castle}} site was {{granted by the}} Crown to Giles Clutterbuck; the local gentry complained, leading to a legal {{case in which the}} county {{successfully}} reclaimed the site. In 1642 England descended into a period of civil war between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and <b>the</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> Parliament. Worcester's city walls were refortified and a sconce, or small fort, was built on top of the motte of Worcester Castle.|$|E

Rallis asked Queen Olga to become regent until Constantine's return.|$|E

5|$|Although Michael VIII Palaiologos engaged {{him in a}} {{marriage}} alliance and awarded him with the high title of sebastokratōr, John remained the foremost of Palaiologos' Greek opponents throughout the latter's reign. A staunch opponent of the Union of the Churches promoted by Palaiologos for political reasons, he provided refuge to several political opponents of the emperor, and even convoked synods that anathematized Palaiologos and <b>the</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> the Union. He resisted several attempts by Byzantine armies to conquer Thessaly, and allied himself with Palaiologos' Latin enemies, including the Duchy of Athens and Charles of Anjou. He died in 1289, leaving the rule of Thessaly to his sons, Constantine and Theodore.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he was not}} {{prominently}} {{involved in}} the May Revolution that deposed Cisneros, he was appointed as secretary of war of the new government, the Primera Junta. Along with Juan José Castelli, he promoted harsh policies against <b>the</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> the former government and the strengthening of the new one. These policies were detailed at a secret document, the Operations plan; some historians dispute its authorship. Moreno organized military campaigns to Paraguay and Upper Peru, and ensured the execution of Santiago de Liniers after the defeat of his counter-revolution. He established the first Argentine newspaper, La Gazeta de Buenos Ayres, and translated Jean-Jacques Rousseau's The Social Contract into Spanish.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War between <b>the</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> Charles I and those of Parliament in 1642, Dartmouth initially sided with Parliament and the town invested money in Kingswear's castle doors. The following year, Prince Maurice besieged and took the town. An earthwork fort, called Mount Ridley or Kingsworth, may subsequently have been built to protect the vulnerable position behind Kingswear Castle; an alternative supposition is that the fort was first built in 1627 and was simply brought back into use during the conflict. In January 1646, Sir Thomas Fairfax led a Parliamentary army to retake Dartmouth, capturing Kingswear from Sir Henry Cary, the High Sheriff of Devon, who had been left in charge of defending it.|$|E

5|$|Belgrano studied {{near the}} {{intellectual}} elite of Spain, {{and by that}} time there were heated discussions about the ongoing French Revolution. The principles of equality and freedom, the universal scope of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and criticism of the divine right of kings were constant topics of debate. Among <b>the</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> these ideas it was thought that Spain should be remade under similar principles, and critics of such thought were rejected as tyrants or proponents of outdated ideas. However, the Spanish Enlightenment was slightly different from the French one as it still respected religion and the monarchy. Thus, despite the new influences, Belgrano remained a strong Catholic and monarchist.|$|E
5|$|Civil {{war broke}} out across England in 1642 between <b>the</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> King Charles I and Parliament. Fortifications and {{artillery}} {{played an important role}} in the conflict, and most of the Device Forts saw service. The south and east of England were soon largely controlled by Parliament. The blockhouses at Gravesend and Tilbury were garrisoned by Parliament and used to control access to London. The castles along the Sussex and Kentish coastline were seized by Parliament in the opening phase of the war, Camber Castle then being decommissioned to prevent it being used by the enemy, the remainder continuing to be garrisoned. The royal fleet, which had been positioned in the Downs anchorage, sided with Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Curiously, {{the legend}} {{has not been}} {{reported}} by any Byzantine author. However, {{an investigation of the}} surviving holes wherein the metal letters were riveted verified its accuracy. It also showed that the first line stood on the western face of the arch, while the second on the eastern. According to the current view, this refers to the usurper Joannes (r. 423–425), while according to <b>the</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> the traditional view, it indicates the gate's construction as a free-standing triumphal arch in 388–391 to commemorate the defeat of the usurper Magnus Maximus (r. 385–388), and which was only later incorporated into the Theodosian Walls.|$|E

5|$|Deal Castle {{was seized}} by Parliamentary forces {{at the start of}} the first English Civil War between <b>the</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> King Charles I and Parliament, {{resulting}} in the dismissal of Byng as a suspected Royalist, and his replacement by Colonel Rainsborough, a vice-admiral. The castle did not play a significant role in the remainder of the initial conflict. After the few years of unsteady peace after 1645, the Second Civil War broke out in 1648, this time with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by their Scottish allies. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by Walmer and the other Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was under way across Kent.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, {{tensions}} arose {{between the}} ARF and Armenian SSR. The death of Catholicos Garegin of the Holy See of Cilicia prompted {{a struggle for}} succession. The National Ecclesiastic Assembly, which was largely influenced by the ARF, elected Zareh of Aleppo. This decision {{was rejected by the}} Echmiadzin-based Catholicos of All Armenians, the anti-ARF coalition, and Soviet Armenian authorities. Zareh extended his administrative authority over {{a large part of the}} Armenian diaspora, furthering the rift that had already been created by his election. This event split the large Armenian community of Lebanon, creating sporadic clashes between <b>the</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> Zareh and those who opposed his election.|$|E
