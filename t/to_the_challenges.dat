5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day. Because the criteria for continuous care is similar to general inpatient care, and due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous care {{is intended to be}} used for short periods of time.|$|E
5|$|The ideological {{war between}} the Protestant and Catholic camps at first enriched the {{intellectual}} life of the Commonwealth. The Catholic Church responded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> with internal reform, following the directions of the Council of Trent, officially accepted by the Polish Church in 1577, but implemented not until after 1589 and throughout the 17th century. There were earlier efforts of reform, originating from the lower clergy, and from about 1551 by Bishop Stanislaus Hosius (Stanis≈Çaw Hozjusz) of Warmia, a lone at that time among the Church hierarchy, but ardent reformer. At {{the turn of the}} 17th century, a number of Rome educated bishops took over the Church administration at the diocese level, clergy discipline was implemented and rapid intensification of Counter-Reformation activities took place.|$|E

5|$|Care {{of young}} is protracted, {{extending}} {{for as long}} as six months, among the longest for birds. For example, once common guillemot chicks fledge, they remain with the male parent for several months at sea. The frigatebirds have the longest period of parental care of any bird except a few raptors and the southern ground hornbill, with each chick fledging after four to six months and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen months. Due to the extended period of care, breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species. This life-history strategy has probably evolved both in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> of living at sea (collecting widely scattered prey items), the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions, and the relative lack of predation compared to that of land-living birds.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{favorable}} economic development, the military potential of 16th century Poland was modest in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> and threats coming from several directions, {{which included the}} Ottoman Empire, the Teutonic state, the Habsburgs, and Muscovy. Given the declining military value and willingness of pospolite ruszenie, {{the bulk of the}} forces available consisted of professional and mercenary soldiers. Their number and provision depended on szlachta-approved funding (self-imposed taxation and other sources) and tended to be insufficient for any combination of adversaries. The quality of the forces and their command was good, as demonstrated by victories against a seemingly overwhelming enemy. The attainment of strategic objectives was supported by a well-developed service of knowledgeable diplomats and emissaries. Because of the limited resources at the state's disposal, the Jagiellonian Poland had to concentrate on the area most crucial for its security and economic interests, which was the strengthening of Poland's position along the Baltic coast.|$|E
5|$|The golden white-eye is a generalist, {{feeding on}} fruit, berries, and insects. Nectar forms {{part of the}} diet, and, along with the Micronesian myzomela and the bridled white-eye, the golden white-eye is a {{pollinator}} of some trees, albeit not one as important as these other species. Insects may be either gleaned from the bark of trees and from leaves, or caught in the air. Certain tree species are preferred as foraging habitat. The common forest tree Cynometra ramifolia is the most favoured tree and used more frequently than the equally common Guamia mariannae. There is considerable overlap between this species' foraging range {{and that of the}} bridled white-eye, but the golden white-eye is more generalised in its diet. Within the forest there is some partitioning of niche, with bridled white-eyes (and Micronesian myzomelas) feeding primarily in the forest canopy, and the golden white-eye feeding in both the canopy and understory of the forest, as well as a variety of smaller trees and bushes. It shares the understory with the rufous fantail, which has a different feeding technique. At a smaller scale additional partitioning occurs. The golden white-eye shows differences in the preferred microhabitat for obtaining insects, for example, feeding in dead leaves and branches, whereas the bridled white-eye prefers gleaning insects on live leaves. It is the most generalised of all the extant forest passerines on Saipan. It has been suggested that the versatility in diet and foraging technique is an adaptation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> presented by typhoons, which can dramatically alter the structure of the forest.|$|E

25|$|In 1943, the Hankey Committee was {{appointed}} to oversee the resumption of television broadcasts after the war. Baird persuaded them to make plans to adopt his proposed 1000-line Telechrome electronic colour system as the new post-war broadcast standard. The picture resolution on this system would have been comparable to today's HDTV (High Definition Television). The Hankey Committee's plan lost all momentum partly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> of postwar reconstruction. The monochrome 405-line standard remained in place until 1985 in some areas, and the 625-line system was introduced in 1964 and (PAL) colour in 1967. A demonstration of large screen three-dimensional television by the BBC was reported in March 2008, over 60 years after Baird's demonstration.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} has responded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> in various ways, including through {{a ban on}} drilling new wells, the introduction of more efficient irrigation techniques, the reduction of water losses, an ambitious municipal wastewater treatment program, and the gradual concentration of industries in newly created industrial estates. However, there are no limits on the extraction of water from more than 25,000 existing wells, water distribution losses remain high, the use of efficient irrigation techniques remains limited and untreated wastewater continues to be discharged into the environment. The challenges thus are far from being resolved. In 2006 the {{government has}} temporary revived plans for an expensive scheme to bring in water from the Euphrates river, located more than 400km from Damascus.|$|E

25|$|In the jousting match Lancelot easily defeats {{all three}} knights. He wounds Sir Lionel, who fights him last, {{so badly that}} the crowd thinks he is dead. But the dismay of the crowd turns to awe as Lancelot's distraught cries for Sir Lionel to live {{seemingly}} resurrect a dead man. Reflecting the adoration of the crowd, Guinevere finds herself {{falling in love with}} Lancelot. She does not wish to violate her marriage vows, however, and wishes Lancelot would leave Camelot ("Before I Gaze at You Again"). By some unfortunate twist of fate, Lancelot, in spite of his boasts that he is immune to pleasures of the flesh, is also madly in love with Guinevere, and is similarly torn by the conflict between this love and his devotion to Arthur. Arthur makes Lancelot a Knight of the Round Table. As it happens, the shrewd King Arthur guesses that Lancelot and Guinevere have feelings for each other, but hopes it will blow over, as he does not wish to upset the tranquility of Camelot. He soliloquizes to his sword Excalibur, that they will rise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> they will all face, together.|$|E
25|$|Integrated {{urban water}} {{management}} (IUWM) in Buenos Aires {{is not unlike}} many large urban areas in Latin America where in past decades, more focus was placed on just a few sectors or perhaps only one sector. The water management philosophy in Buenos Aires has evolved to one that is integrating efforts in reducing water pollution, improving stormwater management, adding drainage infrastructure, and improving {{water supply and sanitation}} (WSS). Primary challenges in urban water management continue to be flood control and stormwater management as Buenos Aires is situated in the low-lying pampas region where heavy rain is expected all year long. Adding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges,</b> urbanization has outpaced planning and development in the various water sectors. Efforts have been made to control the major tributaries of R√≠o de la Plata such as channelizing and building culverts into urban rivers, however, this has increased flooding as the natural meander and saturating ability of the rivers have been lost. Rapid urbanization and very large quantities of industrial discharge have also caused severe contamination of the water basins that Buenos Aires is built upon. The Matanza-Riachuelo river (MR), a tributary of the R√≠o de la Plata (La Plata River), is a prime example and has become the most contaminated basin in Argentina.|$|E
