40|$|The present thesis {{provides}} a systematic investigation of coordination polymers of 3 d, rare-earth (4 f) and main group element (Bi) using both rigid aromatic, flexible aliphatic linkers. Luminescent sensing behavior towards nitro aromatics, metal ions and ferroelectric behavior {{have been investigated}} {{using some of the}} prepared compounds. The possible usefulness of lone pair on the structure has been investigated using bismuth based coordination polymers. The thermal and optical behavior of lanthanide coordination polymers (Ce, Pr and Nd) have also been studied. Chapter 1 An Overview of Coordination Polymer (CP) Compounds This chapter presents a brief introduction to coordination polymer (CP) compounds. Starting from the brief historical background on coordination compounds, this chapter shed light on some earlier developments in this family of compounds by Yaghi, Robson and others. The usefulness of carboxylate and imidazolates in construction of some important coordination polymer compounds like MOF- 5, HKUST- 1, ZIFs, MIL- 53, UiO- 66, CD-MOF- 1 etc has been described in detail along with its properties. The coordination polymers exhibit many important properties and some of the properties like sorption, separation, ionic conductivity, catalysis and ferroelectricity have been discussed briefly and summerized. Chapter 1 also provides the general synthetic and characterization approaches that have been employed during the present studies. Chapter 2 Part A: Adenine Based Coordination Polymers with Cyclohexane dicarboxylic acids This chapter presents the synthesis, structure and properties of four new coordination polymers [Zn 4 (C 8 H 10 O 4) 2. 5 (C 5 H 4 N 5) 3. 2 H 2 O]. 7 H 2 O. 2 DMA (I), [Cd 3 (C 8 H 10 O 4) 2 (C 5 H 4 N 5) 2. H 2 O] (II), [Cd(C 8 H 11 O 4) 2 (C 5 H 5 N 5) 2. 2 H 2 O] (III), [Cd(C 8 H 10 O 4) (C 7 H 8 N 5 O). H 2 O]. 4 H 2 O (IV), (CHDA = cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, ad = adenine, DMA = dimethylacetamide, 9 -HEA = 9 -hydroxyethyl adenine). The compound I and II forms three-dimensional structure having distinct arrangements of 1, 4 -CHDA and adenine units with Zn and Cd metals respectively. The molecular complex unit is observed in compound III with 1, 2 -CHDA and adenine. Compound IV forms two-dimensional structure with 9 -HEA and 1, 2 -CHDA. The observation of base-pairing interactions in the above compounds is noteworthy. In compounds I, II and IV amino groups are appears to be free and utilized for the detection of nitro aromatic explosives through fluorescence quenching. The results revealed that the emission behavior of the present compounds is greatly influenced by the hydroxyl nitroaromatic analyses like indophenol, dinitrophenyl and <b>trinitrophenols</b> with very low detection limits. The compound I also exhibits considerable sensitivity towards metal ion detection, especially Fe 2 +/Fe 3 +, Cr 3 +, Ag+ and Hg 2 + ions in solution. The presence of free nitrogen sites in compound II has been explored for the base catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation reaction, the quantitative yields are observed with various aldehyde substrates. Part B: Adenine Based Coordination Polymer with Oxydiacetic acid: [Cd 2 (C 4 H 4 O 5) 2 (C 5 H 5 N 5) ]. H 2 O. DMA The synthesis, structure and properties of a Cd based coordination polymer with oxydiacetic acid and adenine, [Cd 2 (C 4 H 4 O 5) 2 (C 5 H 5 N 5) ]. H 2 O. DMA is described. The compound has a two-dimensional structure formed by the connectivity involving Cd and oxydiacetic acid. The adenine ligand binds with the Cd metal center through the pyrimidine nitrogen and hangs in the inter layer spaces. The layers are stacked in a ABAB [...] fashion and the inter layer spaces occupied by the dimethyl amine and water molecules. The water molecules are very labile and its removal can be accomplished by heating the sample at 100 °C, which is also confirmed by the single crystal XRD, PXRD and IR studies. The availability of free amino groups of adenine molecule has been utilized for the detection of nitroaromatics, especially nitrophenols with good sensitivity. The amino group was also found to be useful in catalyzing Knoevenagel condensation reactions. Chapter 3 : Rare-Earth Metal Carboxylates: Ln 2 (µ 3 -OH) (C 4 H 4 O 5) 2 (C 4 H 2 O 4) ]. 2 H 2 O [Ln=Ce, Pr and Nd] This chapter describes synthesis, structure and properties of series of rare-earth based compounds, [Ln 2 (µ 3 -OH) (C 4 H 4 O 5) 2 (C 4 H 2 O 4) ]. 2 H 2 O (Ln = Ce, Pr and Nd). The malic acid and fumaric acid form part of the structure. The lanthanide centers are connected by the malate units to form a two dimensional layers, which are pillared by fumarate units forming the three-dimensional structure. Overall, structure can be described as I 2 O 1 type inorganic in two-dimension (Ln-O-Ln layers) and organic in one dimension. The extra framework water molecules form a dimer and occupy the channels. The robustness of the framework was reflected in terms of facile removal and reinsertion of the water molecules, which is also confirmed by single crystal XRD, variable temperature IR and cyclic TGA study. The presence of water dimers and weakly interacting water chain suggested the possibility of proton migration in these compounds. Proton conductivity studies reveal the conductivity values of ~ 2. 85 x 10 - 6 Ω- 1 cm- 1 at 98 % relative humidity. The optical studies revealed an up-conversion behavior involving more than one photon for the neodymium compound. Chapter 4 : Bismuth Carboxylates with Brucite and Fluorite Related Structures The synthesis, structure and properties of three new bismuth based coordination polymers have been described in this chapter. The compounds [C 4 N 2 H 10][Bi(C 7 H 4 NO 4) (C 7 H 3 NO 4) ]. H 2 O (I), [Bi(C 5 H 3 N 2 O 4) (C 5 H 2 N 2 O 4) ] (II) and [Bi(µ 2 -OH) (C 7 H 3 NO 4) ] (III) were isolated employing hydrothermal condition with three different heterocyclicdicarboxylic acids, 3, 6 -pyridinedicarboxylic acid, 4, 5 -imidazoledicarboxylic acid and 3, 4 -pyridinedicarboxylic acid respectively. The structures of all the compounds have linkages between Bi 2 O 2 and the corresponding dicarboxylate forming a simple molecular unit in I, a bilayer arrangement in II and a three-dimensional extended structure in III. The topological arrangement of the nodal building units in the structures resembles brucite related layers in II and fluorite related arrangement in compound III. By utilizing the secondary interactions, the structure of III can be correlated to a Kagome related net. The observation of such classical inorganic related structures in the bismuth carboxylates is noteworthy. Heterogeneous catalytic studies indicate Lewis acidic nature in the bismuth center in all three compounds. Chapter 5 : Solvent dependent Delamination, Restacking and Ferroelectric studies in a Two-Dimensional Compound [NH 4][Ag 3 (C 9 H 5 NO 4 S) 2 (C 13 H 14 N 2) 2]. 8 H 2 O This chapter describes synthesis, structure, water dependent delamination/restacking and ferroelectric behavior in a layered coordination polymer compound, [NH 4][Ag 3 (C 9 H 5 NO 4 S) 2 (C 13 H 14 N 2) 2]. 8 H 2 O. The compound has a two-dimensional structure with the water molecules occupying the inter-lamellar spaces. The lattice water molecules can be fully removed and reinserted, which accompany the crystalline-amorphous-crystalline transformation. This transformation resembles the collapse/delamination and re-stacking of the layers. This transformation has also been investigated by in-situ IR and PXRD studies. The presence of a natural dipole (anionic framework and cationic ammonium ions) along with the non-centrosymmetric space group gives rise to a room-temperature ferroelectric behavior to the compound with saturation polarization (Ps) of 1. 95 μC/cm 2 and remnant polarization of 0. 63 μC/cm 2. The temperature dependent dielectric measurements indicate that the ferroelectric-paraelectric transformation occurs at 320 K.

40|$|AbstractThe motile {{activity}} of outer hair cells’ cell body {{is associated with}} large nonlinear capacitance due to a membrane motor that couples electric displacement with changes in the membrane area, analogous to piezoelectricity. This motor is based on prestin, {{a member of the}} SLC 26 family of anion transporters and utilizes the electric energy available at the plasma membrane associated with the sensory function of these cells. To understand detailed mechanism of this motile activity, we examined the effect of amphipathic ions, cationic chlorpromazine and anionic <b>trinitrophenol,</b> which are thought to change the curvature of the membrane in opposite directions. We found that both chemicals reduced cell length at the holding potential of − 75 mV and induced positive shifts in the cells’ voltage dependence. The shift observed was ∼ 10 mV for 500 μM <b>trinitrophenol</b> and 20 mV for 100 μM cationic chlorpromazine. Length reduction at the holding potential and voltage shifts of the motile activity were well correlated. The voltage shifts of nonlinear capacitance were not diminished by eliminating the cells’ turgor pressure or by digesting the cortical cytoskeleton. These observations suggest that the membrane motor undergoes conformational transitions that involve changes not only in membrane area but also in bending stiffness...|$|E

Here, whole-cell patch clamp recordings {{were employed to}} investigate the effects of hypoxia on hTREK- 1 channels stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. Acute hypoxia caused a rapid and reversible inhibition of whole-cell K+ current amplitudes; this was PO 2 dependent with a maximal inhibition achieved at 60 mmHg and below. In accordance with previous studies, hTREK- 1 current amplitudes were enhanced by arachidonic acid. This effect was concentration dependent, with maximal enhancement observed at a concentration of 10 μm. Membrane deformation by the crenator <b>trinitrophenol</b> (to mimic cell swelling) or the cup former chlorpromazine (to mimic cell shrinkage) caused robust activation and inhibition of currents, respectively. However, current augmentation by either arachidonic acid or <b>trinitrophenol</b> was completely prevented during hypoxia; conversely, hypoxia blunted the inhibitory action of chlorpromazine. The abilities of arachidonic acid to augment currents and of hypoxia to completely abrogate this effect were also observed in cell-attached patches. Our data indicate that hypoxia interacts with hTREK- 1, and occludes its modulation by arachidonic acid and membrane deformation. These findings also suggest that the potential neuroprotective role of TREK channels, which has recently been proposed, requires reconsideration since hTREK- 1 activation is unlikely when ambient PO 2 is below 60 mmHg – a situation which normally pertains in the CNS even during systemic normoxia...|$|E

Adult mice exposed to 500 rads were initally unable to produce a humoral immune response to both phosphorylcholine and <b>trinitrophenol</b> antigens, and the direct plaque- forming cell response was slowly regained over several weeks. Clonotypic analysis wity antisera directed against the H 8 idiotype showed that the H 8 clone initially dominated {{the recovery of the}} response to phosphorycholine but that 60 days after the irradiation significant numbers of non-H 8 clones could be detected. This same pattern could be seen in mice irradiated with 100 rads, a dose that does not completely abrogate the H 8 response to phosphorylcholine. Sublethal irradiation of neonates before they had acquired responsiveness to phosphorylcholine could also eventually lead to the emergence of non-H 8 idiotypes. Thus, a radiosensitive element regulates the expression of clonal dominance in anti-phosphorylcholine responses of BALB/c mice...|$|E
40|$|Various amphipathic {{compounds}} {{have been}} found to activate mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels in the bacterium Escherichia coli. These results were interpreted qualitatively in terms of the bilayer couple hypothesis. Here we present a mathematical model that describes the results quantitatively. According to the model, the uneven partitioning of amphipaths between the monolayers of the cell membrane causes one monolayer to be compressed and the other expanded. Because the open probability (Po) of the E. coli channels increased independently of which monolayer the amphipaths partitioned into, the model suggests that Po of the MS channels is determined by the monolayer having higher tension. We derived a relation between Po and amphipath concentration. The kinetics of Po variation after exposure of the cell membrane to the amphipaths was calculated based on this relation. The results fit satisfactorily the experimental data obtained with the cationic amphipath chlorpromazine and with the anionic amphipath <b>trinitrophenol.</b> Experiments which should further test the predictions following from the model are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Femtosecond laser {{time-of-flight}} mass {{spectra of}} solid samples of trinitrobenzene (TNB), trinitrotoluene (TNT) and <b>trinitrophenol</b> (TNP) have been recorded. Desorption {{of the solid}} samples was enacted by the fourth harmonic output (266 nm) of a 5 ns Nd:YAG laser. Subsequent femtosecond post-ionisation of the plume of neutral molecules was achieved using 800 nm laser pulses of 80 fs duration. Mass spectra have been recorded for desorption laser intensities from 2 - 6 × 109 W cm- 2 with ionisation laser intensities between 2 × 1014 and 6 × 1015 W cm- 2. Femtosecond laser ionisation {{has been shown to}} be capable of generating precursor and characteristic high-mass fragment ions for labile nitro-aromatic molecules commonly used in high-explosive materials. This feature is critical in the future development of femtosecond laser-based analytical instruments that can be used for complex molecular identification and quantitative analysis of environmentally important labile molecules. Furthermore, a comparison of femtosecond post-ionisation mass spectra with standard 70 eV electron impact data has revealed similarities in the spectra and hence the fragmentation processes...|$|E
40|$|In the {{industrial}} adiabatic benzene nitration process, the by-products dinitrophenol (DNP) and <b>trinitrophenol</b> (TNP) {{have a great}} contribution to the environmental footprint of industrial plants. Therefore, nitrophenols (NPs) reduction is a relevant target in process operations. In this context, Quadros et al. (2005) studied the benzene nitration in a pilot plant and developed both mechanistic as well as empirical multivariate linear regression (MLR) models {{for the formation of}} mononitrobenzene (MNB) and NPs. Nevertheless, those MLR models are not able to predict the global performance in a set of continuous adiabatic reactors in series. To overcome this, in the present work new models were developed by a different approach which includes in the set of regressors the CSTR outlet state variables. In order to develop the MLR models, the sequential forward stepwise regression method was applied. The extended models thus obtained, confirm that the selectivity and conversion of these liquid-liquid reactions can be optimized, as they depend significantly on reaction temperature, residence time and interfacial area {{as well as on the}} concentrations of some of the chemical compounds involved in this process. 1...|$|E
40|$|Picrate (<b>trinitrophenol)</b> is {{a unique}} {{uncoupler}} of oxidative phosphorylation. Unlike the commonly used uncouplers (e. g., 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, pentachlorophenol, m-chlorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone, and 5 -chloro- 3 -t-butyl- 2 ′-chloro- 4 ′-nitrosalicylanilide), picrate seems to penetrate the mitochondrial inner membrane very slowly. Consequently, it is ineffective when added to intact mitochondria or to mitochondria depleted of their outer membranes. In contrast, when added to phosphorylating submitochondrial particles prepared by sonication in which the inner membrane orientation is inside-out, picrate binds to the uncoupler-binding sites and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation. This unique property of picrate {{has made it possible}} to compare the potencies of picrate and dinitrophenol for (a) uncoupling and (b) increasing the proton permeability of submitochondrial particle vesicles. At 50 % uncoupling concentration, dinitrophenol increased the proton permeability of submitochondrial particle vesicles by 9 - to 12 -fold. In contrast, at 100 % uncoupling concentrations or higher, picrate augmented the proton permeability of the particles by only about 3 -fold. These results indicate that facilitation of transmembrane proton equilibration does not determine the degree of uncoupling, and lead to the corollary conclusion that the magnitude of transmembrane proton gradient need not be the quantitative driving force for ATP synthesis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCFTR-NBF- 2 was {{expressed}} in Escherichia coli in fusion with glutathione-S-transferase, the soluble portion was purified and {{identified as a}} stuctured protein by its CD spectrum. Association reactions of the recombinant NBF- 2 with adenine nucleotides were monitored qualitatively by demonstrating its ability to bind specifically to ATP-, ADP- and AMP-affinity agarose and quantitatively by recording the fluorescence enhancement of excited <b>trinitrophenol</b> (TNP) -labelled adenine nucleotides occuring {{as a result of}} binding to NBF- 2. Best-fit monophasic binding curves to the fluorescence data indicated Kd values of 22 μM for TNP-ATP, 39 μM for TNP- ADP and 2. 1 μM for TNP-AMP. The corrected K values for unlabelled adenine nucleotides competing with the fluorophores were determined to be 37 μM for ATP, 92 μM for ADP and 12 μM for AMP. The recombinant NBF- 2 did not show any hydrolytic activity on ATP (detection limit 0. 001 s'). Our findings support the concept of a central role of NBF- 2 in CFTR activity regulation acting as an allosteric switch between channel opening and closing and give the first experimental evidence that the channel inhibitor AMP could act via NBF- 2...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the cellular interactions involved in the immune response to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) in a murine model, an in vitro antibody induction system was developed. This comprised HSV- 1 -primed T cells from infected mice, <b>trinitrophenol</b> (TNP) -primed B cells from mice primed with TNP-coupled calf erythrocytes, and TNP-HSV- 1 as antigen. When antigen-presenting cells (APC) {{were removed from the}} assay system, the induced antibody response disappeared but could be reconstituted by the addition of APC derived from the peritoneal cavity or skin of normal mice. Since HSV- 1 is an epidermal pathogen, it was decided {{to investigate the}} role of skin APC in HSV- 1 immunity. Skin APC from mice irradiated 3 days previously with a suberythemal dose of ultraviolet (UV) -B were found to have a decreased capacity to present HSV- 1 antigen in vitro. However, the APC capacity of their peritoneal cells was unaffected. The reduction in APC capacity is not only a local effect at the irradiated site, as APC from mice exposed to UV-B with one ear protected by black electrical tape were equally affected in both ears...|$|E
40|$|The {{specificity}} of the antibody response following natural or experimental infection of domestic cats with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) was examined. The antibody {{response to a}} range of non-viral antigens, including <b>trinitrophenol</b> (TNP), ovalbumin, beta-galactosidase, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH), was measured in 220 cats naturally infected with FIV. Infected cats had higher antibody levels to these antigens, in particular TNP, KLH and beta-galactosidase, than non-infected control cats. Competition binding studies demonstrated that this response was not due to the presence of cross-reacting epitopes on recombinant FIV p 17 or p 24 antigens, suggesting that the B-cell activation associated with infection was polyclonal rather than entirely virus specific. Studies on cats experimentally infected with FIV revealed a similar pattern, with infected cats developing an antibody response to heterologous non-viral antigens at 6 - 8 weeks post-infection. There were two discernible peaks of antibody activity, the first occurring 10 - 20 weeks post-infection and the second peak 40 - 60 weeks post-infection. The antibody response to KLH, DNA and beta-galactosidase remained elevated throughout the 90 -week study period, whereas the antibody levels to the other antigens declined to levels approaching those observed in normal cats...|$|E
40|$|The BCL 1 tumor is a B cell {{neoplasm}} {{that causes}} massive splenomegaly and leukemia in BALB/c (Ig- 1 a) mice (1). The tumor cells bear IgM and IgD on their surface and are phenotypically and functionally analogous to immature B cells (2). When mice from an allotype-congenic strain, C. B- 20 (Ig-l~), are injected with 10 °- 107 BCL 1 cells, they {{are resistant to}} tumor growth (3). These mice generate T cells that can adoptively transfer tumor immunity to sublethally irradiated C. B- 20 recipients. Upon in vitro rechallenge of their spleen cells, cytotoxic effector cell activity is generated that is directed against antigens on BALB/c lymphoblast target cells {{as well as on}} BCLt cells (3). Little information is available on the role of cytotoxic T cells in regulating B cell neoplasms. Abbas et al. (4) described effector cells that inhibited MOPC 315 secretion in vitro. These cells were phenotypically characteristic of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)) However, their specifcity was directed against the myeloma's ligand, <b>trinitrophenol,</b> rather than against immunoglobulin (Ig) itself. Most CTL activity that has been described is directed against viral antigens, minor H antigens, or hapten...|$|E
40|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) 1 {{has been shown to}} exercise two kinds of control over the cytotoxic response of murine T cells to foreign antigens. First, cytotoxic T cells recognize foreign antigens such as viruses, minor histocompatibility antigens, and <b>trinitrophenol</b> (TNP) in association with H- 2 K and H- 2 D region gene products (1, 2). Second, MHC genes can also affect the magnitude of the cytotoxic response to specific foreign antigens in association with selected H- 2 K or H- 2 D antigens (3 - 6), an effect which may be analogous to the Ir gene control of antibody responses (7). Recent studies of the human cytotoxic response to the male Y antigen (8), dinitrophenol (9), and influenza virus (10) demonstrated that human T cells also recognize these antigens in conjunction with determinants that are associated with HLA-A and-B. Furthermore, in each of these human studies there was a suggestion of selective recognition of MHC gene products, because T cells did not appear to recognize these antigens in association with all the HLA-A and-B specificities that were analyzed. To better define the genetic controls of human T-cell cytotoxic responses to foreig...|$|E
