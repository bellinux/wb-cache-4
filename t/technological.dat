5|$|In 1865, the English {{economist}} William Stanley Jevons {{observed that}} <b>technological</b> improvements that increased {{the efficiency of}} coal-use led to the increased consumption of coal {{in a wide range}} of industries. He argued that, contrary to common intuition, <b>technological</b> progress could not be relied upon to reduce fuel consumption.|$|E

5|$|For {{over three}} centuries during the Song Dynasty (960–1279) China {{experienced}} sustained growth {{in per capita}} income and population, structural change in the economy, and increased pace of <b>technological</b> innovation. Movable print, improved seeds for rice and other commercial crops, gunpowder, water-powered mechanical clocks, the use of coal {{as a source of}} fuel for a variety of industries, improved techniques for iron and steel production, pound locks and many other <b>technological</b> innovations transformed the economy. In north China, the main fuel source for ceramic kilns and iron furnaces shifted from wood to coal.|$|E

5|$|SIM's new {{technology}} {{was meant to}} lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life. NASA has already started developing future missions that will build on SIM's <b>technological</b> legacy. The <b>technological</b> development phase of the mission was completed in November 2006 with the announcement that the eight, mission-technology-milestones set by NASA were reached. The milestones were necessary steps in the <b>technological</b> development before flight control instruments could begin to be designed. The completion of each milestone meant that new systems had to be developed for nanometer control as well as picometer knowledge technology; these systems enable the telescope to make its accurate measurements with extreme accuracy.|$|E

5|$|The {{start of}} the Industrial Revolution was marked by a massive boom in the textile industry, with {{remarkable}} <b>technological</b> innovations made, led by the cotton industry of Great Britain. In its early years, there were often disparities in <b>technological</b> innovation between different stages of fabric manufacture, which encouraged complementary innovations. For example, spinning progressed much more rapidly than weaving.|$|E

25|$|Some theorists such as Raymond Kurzweil {{think that}} the pace of <b>technological</b> {{innovation}} is accelerating and that the next 50 years may yield not only radical <b>technological</b> advances, but possibly a <b>technological</b> singularity, which may fundamentally {{change the nature of}} human beings. Transhumanists who foresee this massive <b>technological</b> change generally maintain that it is desirable. However, some are also concerned with the possible dangers of extremely rapid <b>technological</b> change and propose options for ensuring that advanced technology is used responsibly. For example, Bostrom has written extensively on existential risks to humanity's future welfare, including ones that could be created by emerging technologies.|$|E
25|$|In {{analogy with}} Thomas Kuhn's {{definition}} of a scientific paradigm, Dosi has defined a <b>technological</b> paradigm as the general outlook on the productive problems faced by firms. As such, a <b>technological</b> paradigm is composed by some sort of model of the technology at stake (e.g. the model of a microprocessor) and by the specific <b>technological</b> problems posed by such model (e.g. increasing computational capacity, reducing dimensions, etc.). Therefore, technology is identified as a problem-solving activity in which the problems to be solved are selected by the paradigm itself. In this sense, a <b>technological</b> paradigm entails strong prescriptions on the direction of <b>technological</b> change, that is the direction toward which future technical improvements will converge. Such gradual improvements along the specific lines prescribed by the paradigm are what constitute <b>technological</b> trajectories and progress.|$|E

25|$|<b>Technological</b> {{change is}} a {{combination}} of more and of better technology. A 2011 study in the journal Science showed that the peak of the rate of change of the world's capacity to compute information was in 1998, when the world's <b>technological</b> capacity to compute information on general-purpose computers grew at 88% per year. Since then, <b>technological</b> change clearly has slowed. In recent times, every new year allowed humans to carry out roughly 160% of the computations that possibly could have been executed by all existing general-purpose computers in the year before. This still is exponential, but shows the varying nature of <b>technological</b> change.|$|E
25|$|Some areas {{experienced}} {{slow but}} steady <b>technological</b> advances, with important developments such as the stirrup and moldboard plough arriving every few centuries. There were, however, in some regions, periods of rapid <b>technological</b> progress. Most important, perhaps, was the Mediterranean area during the Hellenistic period, when hundreds of technologies were invented. Such periods were followed by periods of <b>technological</b> decay, as during the Roman Empire's decline and fall and the ensuing early medieval period.|$|E

25|$|The role of <b>technological</b> {{progress}} {{as an explanation}} of contemporary economic growth (S.F.1) has led Dosi to carefully analyze the nature of technology.
