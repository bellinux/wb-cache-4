5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a solar park, is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into <b>the</b> <b>electricity</b> grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E

40|$|The {{generator}} {{that normally}} {{used in the}} market, which is <b>the</b> iron-cored <b>electricity</b> generator has high cogging and starting torques. By redesigning of <b>the</b> iron-cored <b>electricity</b> generator, Axial-flux Permanent Magnet (AFPM) configuration minimizes the usage of ferrite material. AFPM, one of <b>the</b> coreless <b>electricity</b> generator configuration has a less counter electromotive force (CEMF) compare to <b>the</b> cored <b>electricity</b> generator.

There are two main parameters present in this paper, different number of turns of coil per phase and distance between a pair of the magnet. The result of the analysis shows that when the coil turns per phase increased, the voltage output and magnetic flux within the coil also increased. While increasing the distance between the magnets, the voltage output, and magnetic flux within the coil decreases...|$|R
