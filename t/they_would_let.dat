They dragged the foliage drag behind {{them in a}} systematic fashion to create dust storms behind hills to appear to the enemy as a much larger army, thereby forcing the enemy to surrender.

Days before the bombing, the RIRA had Dixon steal the maroon Vauxhall Cavalier it would use in the attack. Dixon immediately told his handler; Detective Sergeant John White. On 12 August, White passed this on to his superior; Detective Chief Superintendent Dermot Jennings. According to White, Jennings told him that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> the bomb go through, mainly so that the RIRA would not become suspicious of Dixon.|$|E

They said that they believe the Army summarily executed civilians out of rage for the incidents that occurred on May 1 in Villa Purificación. The families also said that the Army was not letting cattle ranchers give water to their livestock in order to kill them, and asked President Peña Nieto to intervene in the incidents. One {{of the family}} members who supposedly approached the military men guarding the bodies told the press that when he asked a soldier if she could get close to the bodies to see if any of them corresponded to her missing relative, the soldier told her that they were not getting their bodies back and that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> the corpses rot. The lady claimed that the soldier told her that they killed those people because they were responsible for death of their comrades.|$|E
