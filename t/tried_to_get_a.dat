5|$|Brandenburg-Prussia {{tried to}} acquire Crab Island in 1687, but {{the island was}} claimed also by Denmark, England and Spain, and when a second {{expedition}} in 1692 found the island in Danish hands, the plan was abandoned. 1689, Brandenburg-Prussia annexed Peter Island, but the small rock proved ineligible for trade or settlement. In 1691, Brandenburg-Prussia and the Duchy of Courland agreed on a partition of Tobago, but since Courland was no longer present on the island which was meanwhile claimed by England, the agreement was nullified, and negotiations with England {{did not result in}} an agreement. In 1695, Brandenburg-Prussia <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> hold of Tortola, but England denied them settlement. Likewise, England declined an offer to purchase Sint Eustatius in 1697.|$|E
5|$|On leaving {{school in}} 1934, the 14-year-old Ramsey <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{job at the}} Ford plant, then told his family he {{intended}} to become a greengrocer. To that end he became an apprentice at a local branch of the Co-op, delivering groceries on a bicycle. The manual work helped to bulk up Ramsey's physique, but he found himself unable to play organised football {{because he had to}} work on Saturday afternoons. After a two-year hiatus, he returned to the game when he joined Five Elms, a newly formed amateur club whose matches on Thursdays fitted with his work schedule. About a year later, during the 1937–38 season, Ramsey was spotted by Ned Liddell, a scout from Portsmouth, then a well-established top-flight club. Liddell offered a contract as an amateur. Rather than signing on the spot, Ramsey asked to take the forms home to examine first; he signed them that night and sent them to Portsmouth by post. Much to Ramsey's disappointment, Portsmouth did not contact him again. He spent the next two years working at the Co-op while playing cricket in the summer and football in the winter.|$|E

5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time {{when his father was}} unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E

25|$|The Boomers planned excursions, {{which they}} called raids, {{into the area}} and {{surveyed}} townsites, built homes, and planted crops.

In 1829 a parliamentary committee on patent reform was set up, after Thomas Barrett Lennard had pushed for an enquiry: Robertson lowered expectations in advance, and was partly justified by a lacklustre and scanty representation of manufacturing interests, with John Farey, Jr. providing the bulk of detailed criticism where John Taylor and Marc Brunel showed little knowledge of the system. Lennard's resulting bill ran out of time in the next session of parliament.|$|E

25|$|With {{no driver}} for 2000 and Kodiak leaving the team, Hedrick decided to hire {{journeyman}} Rick Mast to drive. After a long search, LHM signed Big Daddy's BBQ Sauce as sponsor. The team struggled at first, but when Mast left for A.J. Foyt Racing, many questions began surrounding the organization. It was soon revealed that Big Daddy's had neglected {{to pay their}} sponsorship fees, and had instead given Hedrick 11 million shares of stock in the company. Hedrick <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> cash deal with New Holland as well as ordering Big Daddy's to pay their money, with neither working out. (The stocks were later proven to be worthless). During this time, Bradberry returned for a three-race deal, but the team took {{the rest of the}} year off because of the sponsorship problems.

25|$|Edmund Blampied {{was born}} {{on a farm in}} the Parish of Saint Martin, Jersey in the Channel Islands on 30 March 1886, five days {{after the death of his}} father, John Blampied. He was the last of four boys and was brought up by his mother, Elizabeth, a {{dressmaker}} and shopkeeper mostly in the Parish of Trinity, Jersey. His first language was Jèrriais. He finished parochial school at the age of 14 and went to work in the office of the town architect in Saint Helier, the capital of the island. Some of his pen and ink sketches of an agricultural show in May 1902 were noticed by Mlle Marie Josephine Klintz, a woman who ran a local private art school. She gave the young Blampied his first formal lessons in art and introduced him to watercolours. His caricatures of politicians such as the Constable of St. Helier, Philippe Baudains, during a local election brought Blampied to the attention of a businessman named Saumerez James Nicolle who offered to sponsor him at art school in London, provided he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> scholarship.|$|E
25|$|Antigonus {{spent the}} winter of 316 BC in Media, whose ruler was once again Peithon. Peithon's lust for power had grown, and he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> portion of Antigonus' troops to revolt to his side. Antigonus, however, {{discovered}} the plot and executed Peithon. He then superseded Peucestas as satrap of Persia. In the summer of 315 BC Antigonus arrived in Babylon and was warmly welcomed by Seleucus. The {{relationship between the two}} soon turned cold, however. Seleucus punished one of Antigonus' officers without asking permission from Antigonus. Antigonus became angry and demanded that Seleucus give him the income from the province, which Seleucus refused to do. He was, however, afraid of Antigonus and fled to Egypt with 50 horsemen. It is told that Chaldean astrologers prophesied to Antigonus that Seleucus would become master of Asia and would kill Antigonus. After hearing this, Antigonus sent soldiers after Seleucus, who had however first escaped to Mesopotamia and then to Syria. Antigonus executed Blitor, the new satrap of Mesopotamia, for helping Seleucus. Modern scholars are skeptical of the prophecy story. It seems certain, however, that the Babylon priesthood was against Seleucus.|$|E
