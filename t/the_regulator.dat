5|$|This formula neglects the {{cracking}} pressure required to open both {{first and second}} stages of <b>the</b> <b>regulator,</b> and pressure drop due to flow restrictions in <b>the</b> <b>regulator,</b> {{both of which are}} variable depending on the design and adjustment of <b>the</b> <b>regulator,</b> and flow rate, which depends on the breathing pattern of the diver and the gas in use. These factors are not easily estimated, so the calculated value for breathing duration will be more than the real value.|$|E
5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input seat of <b>the</b> <b>regulator.</b> The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening {{can make the}} yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E

5|$|DIN {{screw thread}} {{connectors}} - <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> screws into the cylinder valve trapping the O-ring securely between the sealing {{face of the}} valve and the O-ring groove in <b>the</b> <b>regulator.</b> These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Regulators</b> lacked <b>the</b> leadership, organization, and {{ammunition}} that Tryon had, but the early {{course of the}} battle went well for them.

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{cylinder}} valve or pillar valve is to control gas flow {{to and from the}} pressure vessel and to provide a connection with <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> or filling hose. Cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A metal or plastic dip tube or valve snorkel screwed {{into the bottom of the}} valve extends into the cylinder to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in the cylinder getting into the gas passages when the cylinder is inverted, and blocking or jamming <b>the</b> <b>regulator.</b> Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening, but some have an integral filter.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable moment in history for South Carolina was the {{creation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Regulators</b> in <b>the</b> 1760s, one of the first organized militias in the New World. The militia proposed ideas of independence and brought increased recognition to the need for backcountry rights in the Carolinas. This led to the War of <b>the</b> <b>Regulators,</b> a battle between <b>the</b> <b>regulators</b> and <b>the</b> British soldiers, led mainly by British Royal Governor William Tryon, in the area. This battle was the first catalyst in the American Revolution.|$|R
5|$|The {{simplest}} compliance {{model is}} a regulatory framework or model known as dualistic, where <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> reacts to an entity's behaviours {{depending on whether the}} behaviour is seen as either right or wrong. This is also known as a black and white response, and is often used for strict liability offences in law.|$|E
5|$|When the {{reaction}} of <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> {{is tied to the}} behaviour, it is known as a responsive compliance model. The responsive compliance model was suggested by Ian Ayres and John Braithwaite in their book Responsive Regulation: Transcending the deregulation debate which built on earlier work by John Scholz.|$|E

5000|$|As Morton was {{believed}} to have been one of those who killed John Tunstall, his fate looked grim, especially when <b>the</b> <b>Regulators</b> and their prisoners detoured on their way to Lincoln into the Capitan foothills. Although <b>the</b> <b>Regulators</b> were intent on killing Morton and Baker rather than turning them over for trial, one of their number, William McCloskey, was friendly with Morton and tried to talk <b>the</b> <b>Regulators</b> out of killing him. On March 9, 1878, <b>the</b> <b>Regulators</b> made their move along the Blackwater Creek. According to Pat Garrett's biography of Billy the Kid, McNab shot McCloskey in the head when he tried to stop the imminent execution of Morton and Baker, who then spurred their mounts and tried to escape before being gunned down by Billy the Kid.|$|R

5|$|The process {{requires}} <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> {{to directly}} link a robust risk assessment to a suggested regulatory response (e.g. financial penalties, criminal imprisonment). Regulatory risk differentiation is {{also referred to}} as the Compliance Model in some regulatory agencies.

PAIRS is the Probability And Impact Rating System, while SOARS is the Supervisory Oversight And Response System.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{commonly}} used configurations of manifold. The oldest type is a tube with a connector on each end which {{is attached to}} the cylinder valve outlet, and an outlet connection in the middle, to which <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> is attached. A variation on this pattern includes a reserve valve at the outlet connector. The cylinders are isolated from the manifold when closed, and the manifold can be attached or disconnected while the cylinders are pressurised.|$|E

5|$|Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME {{of the newly}} formed Southern Railway in 1923, and inherited the 1920 SECR order for ten Kclass locomotives. The order was still outstanding in 1924, {{although most of the}} component parts had been made. On 14 January 1925, Maunsell ordered No.790 to be overhauled and trialled on the Central section. As the locomotive proved suitable for the operating conditions of this section, the Southern Railway's Locomotive Committee proceeded with the assembly of the Kclass parts using outside contractors. Nine sets of parts (Nos. A791A799) were conveyed to Armstrong Whitworth for assembly and the finished locomotives delivered in May and June 1925. These were dual-fitted with vacuum and Westinghouse (air) brakes for use with the former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) rolling stock on the Central section. Other differences from the prototype included the relocation of <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> to the dome and an increase in superheater area. The tenth set of parts was retained by Ashford and used for the first member of the K1class later that year.|$|E
5|$|Open circuit scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any gas mixture with them {{that is to be}} used on the dive. However, if they are confident of returning by a specific route, the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route. The cylinders used for this purpose are called stage cylinders, and they are usually provided with a standard regulator and a submersible pressure gauge, and are usually left at the stop with <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> pressurized, but the cylinder valve turned off to minimize the risk of gas loss. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E
5|$|The new European Norm EN144-3:2003 {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} valve, similar to existing 232 bar or 300 bar DIN valves, however, with a metric M26×2 fitting on both the cylinder and <b>the</b> <b>regulator.</b> These are intended to be used for breathing gas with oxygen content above that normally found in natural air in the Earth's atmosphere (i.e. 22–100%). From August 2008, these were required in the European Union for all diving equipment used with nitrox or pure oxygen. The idea behind this new standard is to prevent a rich mixture being filled to a cylinder that is not oxygen clean. However even with use of the new system there still remains nothing except human procedural care to ensure that a cylinder with a new valve remains oxygen-clean - which is exactly how the previous system worked.|$|E
