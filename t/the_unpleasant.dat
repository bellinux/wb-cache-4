5|$|The Army Service Forces was {{abolished}} on 14 May 1946, on {{the recommendation}} of War Department's Simpson Board, but the Army Ground Forces remained. Devers' November 1945 testimony before the board had urged that the Army Service Forces be retained. Army Ground Forces was given control of the six armies in the United States, but as demobilization gathered pace, the strength of the army shrank dramatically. Devers was faced with <b>the</b> <b>unpleasant</b> task of informing many officers that they were being demoted. One reform that he did achieve was {{to reduce the number of}} combat branches to just three: infantry, armor and artillery.|$|E
5|$|Members of the red-breasted {{nuthatch}} superspecies excavate their own tree holes, although most other nuthatches use natural holes or old woodpecker nests. Several species {{reduce the size}} of the entrance hole and seal up cracks with mud. The {{red-breasted nuthatch}} makes the nest secure by daubing sticky conifer resin globules around the entrance, the male applying the resin outside and the female inside. The resin may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the resin by diving straight through the entrance hole). The white-breasted nuthatch smears blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} <b>the</b> <b>unpleasant</b> smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.|$|E

5|$|Predators {{of adult}} nuthatches include owls and diurnal {{birds of prey}} (such as sharp-shinned and Cooper's hawks), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small squirrels, and {{climbing}} snakes such as the western rat snake. The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making hn-hn calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell. The nuthatch may also smear blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} <b>the</b> <b>unpleasant</b> smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years, but the record is twelve years and nine months.|$|E
5|$|Salicylate medicines—including salicin, {{salicylic}} acid, {{and sodium}} salicylate— were difficult and wasteful to extract from plants, and in 1860 Hermann Kolbe {{worked out a}} way to synthesize salicylic acid. Throughout the late 1800s use of salicylates grew considerably, and physicians increasingly knew what to expect from these medicines: reduction of pain, fever, and inflammation. However, <b>the</b> <b>unpleasant</b> side effects, particularly gastric irritation, limited their usefulness, as did their intense bitterness. By the 1880s, the German chemical industry, jump-started by the lucrative development of dyes from coal tar, was branching out to investigate the potential of new tar-derived medicines. The turning point was the advent of Kalle & Company's Antifebrine, the branded version of the well-known dye derivative acetanilide—the fever-reducing properties of which were discovered by accident in 1886. Antifebrine's success inspired Carl Duisberg, the head of research at the small dye firm Friedrich Bayer & Company, to start a systematic search for other chemical fever-reducers. Bayer chemists soon developed Phenacetin, followed by the sedatives Sulfonal and Trional.|$|E
5|$|South Carolina Congressman Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), the Democratic Majority Whip, {{leaves his}} house in Washington, D.C. after hearing his neighbors’ dog {{get hit by a}} car. As he comforts the mortally-wounded dog, he looks into the camera and says “Moments like this require someone who will act, who will do <b>the</b> <b>unpleasant</b> thing, the {{necessary}} thing,” before calmly proceeding to strangle it. This introduces both his habit of breaking the fourth wall to narrate, and his cold and vicious nature. Frank and his wife, Claire (Robin Wright), go on to attend a New Year’s Eve party in honor of the new President-elect, Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), a fellow Democrat and winner of the 2012 election. Frank confesses to the viewer that he does not like Walker, but saw his political potential early on and ingratiated himself to him, putting himself in line to be nominated as Walker’s Secretary of State after 22 years in Congress.|$|E

5|$|When the British {{government}} relented in mid-1915, {{having been}} warned by Theodore Roosevelt that the reporting limitations were affecting {{public opinion in}} the United States, Valentine Williams became the Daily Mail's first accredited war correspondent. No longer in prison, Beach Thomas resumed his war reporting in December of the same year, when Williams enlisted in the Irish Guards. As with the other accredited journalists, he was paid by the War Office rather than by his newspaper {{and they were all}} assured that {{they would be able to}} publish memoirs of their service to offset the differential between an officer's pay and that of a journalist. Beach Thomas filed reports from places such as the Somme in a format matching that of his colleagues, who regularly downplayed <b>the</b> <b>unpleasant</b> aspects of the conflict such as the nature of death. His reports were published in the Daily Mirror as well as the Daily Mail.|$|E
5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes <b>the</b> <b>unpleasant</b> symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|It is {{explained}} that, {{in the aftermath}} of her being left by Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) at the altar, Yang spent her honeymoon travelling with Meredith. Having just returned, she is shocked to learn that Burke has resigned from Seattle Grace, and relocated to an unknown location. Stevens has to deal with her romantic feelings for O'Malley, whose marriage to Torres is being threatened by his yet to be exposed affair. O'Malley, who finds himself in <b>the</b> <b>unpleasant</b> situation of repeating his internship, quickly gains support in Lexie, who decides not to tell the fellow interns about his failed exam. Karev is revealed to have visited Rebecca Pope (Elizabeth Reaser), following her departure. In the absence of Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), who relocated to Los Angeles, California, Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) seeks reconciliation with Shepherd, formerly his closest friend and confidant. Initially unwilling to resume his friendship with Sloan, Shepherd ultimately gives him a second chance. Bailey manifests a cold attitude towards Webber, in order to express her disappointment in not being considered for the position of Chief Resident, in spite of her enviable reputation among the hospital staff. Lexie meets Meredith for the first time, but is demoralized when she becomes aware of her apparent discomfort. Meredith and Shepherd encounter difficulty in being broken up, realizing that their mutual romantic feelings are an impediment in their attempt at having separate lives.|$|E

25|$|Automotive {{antifreeze}} has {{a characteristic}} odor {{due to the}} additive tolytriazole, a corrosion inhibitor. <b>The</b> <b>unpleasant</b> odor in industrial use tolytriazole comes from impurities in the product that are formed from the toluidine isomers (ortho-, meta- and para-toluidine) and meta-diamino toluene which are side-products {{in the manufacture of}} tolytriazole.

However, the most important accomplishment made by Ferreira was the acquisition of several key players that led Olimpia to a record five consecutive championships, from 1956 to 1960 (with an undefeated championship in 1959).|$|E

Aging the tea increases its value, but may be unprofitable.|$|E
