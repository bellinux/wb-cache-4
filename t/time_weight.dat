25|$|The gastric bypass {{reduces the}} size of the stomach by well over 90%. A normal stomach can stretch, {{sometimes}} to over 1000 mL, while the pouch of the gastric bypass may be 15 mL in size. The gastric bypass pouch is usually formed from the part of the stomach which is least susceptible to stretching. That, and its small original size, prevents any significant long-term change in pouch volume.

Over time, the functional capacity of the pouch increases; by that <b>time,</b> <b>weight</b> loss has occurred, and the increased capacity should serve to allow maintenance of a lower body weight.|$|E

60|$|At {{the same}} time, too, {{and out of}} the same mental processes, came the first {{distinct}} ideas of number. In the earliest stages, the presentation of several like objects produced merely an indefinite conception of multiplicity; as it still does among Australians, and Bushmen, and Damaras, when the number presented exceeds three or four. With such a fact before us we may safely infer that the first clear numerical conception was that of duality as contrasted with unity. And this notion of duality must necessarily have grown up side by side with those of likeness and equality; seeing {{that it is impossible to}} recognise the likeness of two things without also perceiving that there are two. From the very beginning the conception of number must have been as it is still, associated with the likeness or equality of the things numbered. If we analyse it, we find that simple enumeration is a registration of repeated impressions of any kind. That these may be capable of enumeration it is needful that they be more or less alike; and before any absolutely true numerical results can be reached, it is requisite that the units be absolutely equal. The only way in which we can establish a numerical relationship between things that do not yield us like impressions, is to divide them into parts that do yield us like impressions. Two unlike magnitudes of extension, force, <b>time,</b> <b>weight,</b> or what not, can have their relative amounts estimated only by means of some small unit that is contained many times in both; and even if we finally write down the greater one as a unit and the other as a fraction of it, we state, in the denominator of the fraction, the number of parts into which the unit must be divided to be comparable with the fraction.|$|E
60|$|Thus, in an undertone, I {{tell you}} that my little Jenny, as she is zealously and {{systematically}} arranging the fire, and trimly whisking every untidy particle of ashes from the hearth, shows in every movement of her little hands, in the cock of her head, in the knowing, observing glance of her eye, and in all her energetic movements, that her small person is endued and {{made up of the}} very expressed essence of housewifeliness,--she is the very attar, not of roses, but of housekeeping. Care-taking and thrift and neatness are a nature to her; she is as dainty and delicate in her person as a white cat, as everlastingly busy as a bee; and all the most needful faculties of <b>time,</b> <b>weight,</b> measure, and proportion ought to be fully developed in her skull, if there is any truth in phrenology. Besides all this, she has a sort of hard-grained little vein of common sense, against which my fanciful conceptions and poetical notions are apt to hit with just a little sharp grating, if they are not well put. In fact, this kind of woman needs carefully to be idealized in the process of education, or she will stiffen and dry, as she grows old, into a veritable household Pharisee, a sort of domestic tyrant. She needs to be trained in artistic values and artistic weights and measures, to study all the arts and sciences of the beautiful, and then she is charming. Most useful, most needful, these little women: they have the centripetal force which keeps all the domestic planets from gyrating and frisking in unseemly orbits, and, properly trained, they fill a house with the beauty of order, the harmony and consistency of proportion, the melody of things moving in time and tune, without violating the graceful appearance of ease which Art requires.|$|E

40|$|Field {{gradient}} NMR {{techniques have}} proved very useful for measurements of molecular self-diffusion coefficients in many materials ranging from simple liquids to more complex {{materials such as}} polymer melts, porous media and biological tissues. In such multicomponent systems, spin relaxation phenomena may not only lead to a reduction of the signal intensity available for the field gradient NMR experiment but also to systematical errors in the measured diffusion coefficient due to unwanted relaxation <b>time</b> <b>weighting.</b> While pulsed field gradient (PFG) techniques allow better separation of relaxation and diffusion effects, they require {{at the same time}} longer echo times. This in turn aggravates unwanted weighting by transverse relaxation. For materials containing fast-relaxing components such as clayey sediments or partially hydrated cement the use of static field gradient (SFG) techniques suggests substantial benefits due to shorter echo times (i. e. less transverse relaxation <b>time</b> <b>weighting).</b> However, the separation of relaxation and diffusion effects is more difficult in SFG.
