50|$|A lower <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> is an alloy/steel <b>bar</b> that <b>ties</b> {{the lower}} {{suspension}} pick-up points {{of a vehicle}} (with an independent suspension) together. It increases chassis rigidity by bracing {{the left and right}} lower-control-arm sheet metal mounting points. The lower <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> is designed to reduce the non-pivoting movement of the control arms and to stiffen the subframe to lessen the distortion of the lower suspension, especially during hard cornering. As a result, it improves the handling and steering response of the vehicle. It may also provide additional benefits in front-wheel drive vehicles by reducing wheel hop and torque steer. The bar may lower ground clearance by as much as 30 millimeters on some aftermarket installations.The lower <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> is mostly an aftermarket car component. Some of the few exceptions to this rule are the Honda Integra and Civic Type-R, as well as the Daihatsu Charade GTti. Since the lower <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> is one of the cheapest upgrade that tuners can install on their cars, it {{is probably one of the}} first performance accessories is acquired. The lower <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> is a bolt-on device and no stock parts will have to be replaced or removed when it is being installed on the vehicle (unless the vehicle already has one on it). These characteristics make the lower <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> a popular performance upgrade among car tuning enthusiasts for its appearance and slight performance gain.|$|R

25|$|In August, however, {{there were}} {{problems}} with the Derwent Aqueduct which required considerable modification. The spandrel walls had parted due to the horizontal forces imposed by the canal, and a longitudinal split had opened up in the arch. In his report to the canal committee, Jessop gave his opinion {{that the use of}} Crich lime, being unusually pure, had delayed the setting of the mortar. Later writers, with the benefit of engineering knowledge acquired after Jessop's time, have suggested that the spandrel walls were simply too slender for the forces imposed. At any rate, the arch was partly dismantled and steel <b>tie</b> <b>bars</b> and lateral reinforcing arches were installed, together with external buttresses. This Jessop did at his own expense.|$|E

40|$|The H- 46 {{helicopter}} {{has experienced}} early in-service failures in its <b>tie</b> <b>bar.</b> The <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> is a multi-component {{system that is}} {{a critical part of}} the linkage, which attaches the rotor blade to the rotating hub of the helicopter. This research developed methodology to predict the life of the <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> under nominal operational flight loads. A probability model is indispensable because a revised design has yet to accumulate field data, and laboratory testing can never be sufficiently extensive for non-parametric reliability prediction. An algorithm was developed for three and four component systems that will generate the probability of system failure based on the probability of failure in its components. Finite element analysis was conducted on the <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> to determine stress on each component for all possible damage configurations of the <b>tie</b> <b>bar.</b> A given set of flight loads was resolved into boundary conditions for the stress analysis. A methodology was developed to determine the probability of failure of each component using an idealized load history, based on the expected stress- life (S-N) relation of the component at the stress levels experienced by the component. The result is a prediction method that can fortify laboratory results to predict the probability of failure of a system given the system load history. This model will be verified using the early in-service failure statistics of the current design and can be used to assess revised designs. The model will provide a prediction of the failure distributions, (the bell-shaped distribution) as a fabrication of flight hours, or one, two, three, and four elements of failures within the leaves of the <b>tie</b> <b>bar.</b> (MM) NANAU.

The patent describes the solution as 'revetments or retaining walls for the banks of rivers or canals and concerns an arrangement, particularly suitable for rivers and canals which are relatively shallow at the banks, in which the revetment comprises a series of sheet metal plates arranged end-to-end and suitably secured together to form a wall of sheet metal pile sections, driven into the ground vertically by a power hammer and interlocked so that a complete wall of steel piles is provided between the bank and the water.
