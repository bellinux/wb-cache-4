25|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, the Soviet Union {{had reached a}} rough parity with the United States in some {{categories}} of strategic weaponry, {{and at that time}} offered to negotiate limits on strategic nuclear weapons deployments. The Soviet Union wished to constrain U.S. deployment of an antiballistic missile (ABM) system and retain the ability to place multiple independently <b>targetable</b> re-entry vehicles (MIRVs).|$|E
25|$|The Trident missile is a submarine-launched {{ballistic}} missile (SLBM) equipped with multiple independently <b>targetable</b> reentry vehicles (MIRV). Originally developed by Lockheed Missiles and Space Corporation, the missile is armed with thermonuclear warheads and is launched from nuclear-powered {{ballistic missile}} submarines (SSBNs). Trident missiles are carried by fourteen US Navy s, with US warheads, and four Royal Navy s, with British warheads. The missile {{is named after}} the mythological trident of Neptune.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} {{effectiveness}} per cost rate {{it was the}} most potent fortification system during World War 2. The method of system requires complete alignment with the terrain, thus there is no standard layout and every fortress was unique. This fact increases efficacy, since {{it was not possible to}} beat different völgyzárs with uniformised methodology. All of buildings, dugouts and obstacles are adapted to the landscape and were especially effectively camouflaged, hence there are no easily <b>targetable</b> large objects in the line.|$|E
25|$|A CG(X) {{based on}} the Zumwalt hull would lose {{one or both of}} its guns, and replace them with more VLS {{launchers}} for anti-aircraft missiles. However, Zumwalts lack of capability in air defense and BMD was cited as a major reason for the near-cancellation of the class in July 2008. Recent intelligence that China is developing <b>targetable</b> anti-ship ballistic missiles {{based on the}} DF-21 appears to be shaping the Navy's thinking on the CG(X)'s capabilities, when previously Zumwalts air defense was believed to be good enough to justify delaying the introduction of the CG(X).|$|E
25|$|The Agni-V missile is an Intercontinental {{ballistic}} missile meant for long-range deterrence. The Agni-V {{is the newest}} version and has the longest range of up to 5000–6000km. Agni-V would also carry Multiple independently <b>targetable</b> reentry vehicle payloads and will have countermeasures against Anti-{{ballistic missile}} systems. It was successfully test fired on 19 April 2012. The missile will utilise a canister and will be launched from it. Sixty percent of the missile will {{be similar to the}} Agni-III missile. Advanced technologies like ring laser gyroscope and accelerometer will be used in the new missile.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union {{developed}} {{a new series of}} long-range missiles, called the SS-9 (NATO codename Scarp). A question developed concerning the extent of their capability to carry nuclear weapons; at issue was whether the missile were a Multiple independently <b>targetable</b> reentry vehicle (MIRV) or not. The CIA information was that these missiles were not 'MIRVed' but Defense intelligence considered that they were of the more potent kind. If so, the Soviet Union was possibly aiming at a first strike nuclear capacity. The Nixon administration, desiring to employ the existence of such Soviet threat to justify a new American antiballistic missile system, publicly endorsed the Defense point of view. Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security advisor, asked Helms to review the CIA's finding, yet Helms initially stood by his analysts at CIA. Eventually, however, Helms compromised.|$|E
25|$|The U.K. had a {{stockpile}} of 215 thermonuclear warheads, of which 120 were operational, as of 2016, {{but the country}} has refused to declare the exact size of its arsenal. Since 1998, the Trident nuclear programme {{has been the only}} operational nuclear weapons system in British service. The delivery system consists of four Vanguard class submarines based at HMNB Clyde in Scotland. Each submarine is armed with up to sixteen Trident II missiles, each carrying warheads in up to eight Multiple independently <b>targetable</b> reentry vehicles. With at least one submarine always on patrol, the Vanguards perform a strategic deterrence role and are also believed to have a sub-strategic capability. Unlike the other permanent members of the Security Council, the U.K. operates only a submarine-based delivery system, having decommissioned its tactical WE.177 free-fall bombs in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Many tumors express {{mutations}}. These mutations potentially {{create new}} <b>targetable</b> antigens (neoantigens) {{for use in}} T cell immunotherapy. The presence of CD8+ T cells in cancer lesions, as identified using RNA sequencing data, is higher in tumors with a high mutational burden. The level of transcripts associated with cytolytic activity of natural killer cells and T cells positively correlates with mutational load in many human tumors. In non–small cell lung cancer patients treated with lambrolizumab, mutational load shows a strong correlation with clinical response. In melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, long-term benefit is also associated with a higher mutational load, although less significantly. The predicted MHC binding neoantigens in patients with a long-term clinical benefit were enriched {{for a series of}} tetrapeptide motifs that were not found in tumors of patients with no or minimal clinical benefit. However, human neoantigens identified in other studies do not show the bias toward tetrapeptide signatures.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Air Force {{currently}} operates 450 ICBMs, located {{primarily in}} the northern Rocky Mountain states and the Dakotas. These are all of the Minuteman III ICBM variants. Peacekeeper missiles were phased out of the Air Force inventory in 2005. All USAF Minuteman II missiles have been destroyed {{in accordance with the}} START treaty and their launch silos imploded and buried then sold to the public. To comply with the START II most U.S. multiple independently <b>targetable</b> reentry vehicles, or MIRVs, have been eliminated and replaced with single warhead missiles. However, since the abandonment of the START II treaty, the U.S. is said to be considering retaining 500 warheads on 450 missiles. The U.S. goal under the SORT treaty is to reduce from 1,600 warheads deployed on over 500 missiles in 2003 to 500 warheads on 450 missiles in 2012. The first Minuteman III were removed under this plan in 2007 while, at the same time, the warheads deployed on Minuteman IIIs began to be upgraded from smaller W62s to larger W87s from decommissioned Peacekeeper missiles.|$|E
25|$|British {{nuclear weapons}} are {{designed}} and developed by the UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment. The boats are capable of deploying with a maximum of 192 independently <b>targetable</b> warheads, or MIRVs, with immediate readiness to fire. However, {{as a result of}} a decision taken by the 1998 Strategic Defence Review this was reduced to 48 warheads with a readiness to fire reduced 'to days rather than minutes'. Furthermore, the total number of warheads maintained by the United Kingdom was reduced to approximately 200, with a total of 58 Trident missiles. The reduced warhead load per missile allowed the development of lower-yield non-strategic warheads loading options. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review reduced this number further and the submarines will put to sea in future with a reduced total of 40 warheads and a reduced missile load of 8 (from a maximum possible 16). The number of operationally available nuclear warheads is to be reduced 'from fewer than 160 to no more than 120 and the total UK nuclear weapon stockpile will number no more than 180.|$|E
500|$|The {{specifications}} for the ZBGM-75 {{called for a}} large solid-fuel-powered missile, which would be fitted with between 10 and 20 multiple independently <b>targetable</b> reentry vehicles (MIRVs). The missiles would be based in silo launchers, which were specified to be hardened {{by a factor of}} 10 over the existing silos used by Minuteman missiles. [...] In addition, there was also a plan to develop a railroad-based deployment system for the AICBM. Improvements in accuracy over existing missiles, combined with penetration aids under development to enhance the effectiveness of each missile, were expected to make the AICBM capable of defeating existing and projected Soviet anti-ballistic missile systems.|$|E
2500|$|In future, Agni-V is {{expected}} to feature Multiple independently <b>targetable</b> reentry vehicle (MIRVs) with each missile being capable of carrying 2–10 separate nuclear warheads. Each warhead can be assigned to a different target, separated by hundreds of kilometres; alternatively, two or more warheads can be assigned to one target. [...] MIRVs ensure a credible second strike capability even with few missiles. According to DRDO sources,an MIRV payload would be significantly heavier, since it would consist of several nuclear warheads, each of them weighting [...] about [...] 400 [...] kilogrammes. A [...] 5-warhead [...] MIRV, therefore, would weigh two tonnes.|$|E
2500|$|The Vladivostok Summit Meeting on Arms Control was {{a two-day}} summit held on November 23 and 24, 1974 in Vladivostok {{for the purpose}} of {{extending}} arms control provisions between the Soviet Union and the United States. After a series of talks between American President Gerald Ford and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in Washington and American Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's visit to Moscow, Ford traveled to Vladivostok to meet with Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev directly. The two heads of state agreed to terms that would limit both nations an [...] "equal aggregate number" [...] of various weapons, including strategic nuclear delivery vehicles (SNDVs), intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) fitted with multiple independently <b>targetable</b> reentry vehicles (MIRVs).|$|E
2500|$|The {{estimated}} 68 {{nuclear warheads}} of land-based nuclear weapons of India {{are under the}} control of and deployed by the Indian Army, using a variety of both vehicles and launching silos. They currently consist of three different types of ballistic missiles, the Agni-I, the Agni-II, Agni-III and the Army's variant of the Prithvi missile family – the Prithvi-I. Additional variants of the Agni missile series are currently under-development, including the most recent, the Agni-IV and Agni-V, which are due to enter full operational service in the near future. Agni -IV has been inducted in the armed forces and Agni-V has successfully been tested and fired 4 times as of 2016. In addition to that Agni-IV has an estimated range of 4000km and Agni-V of 5500–6000km (estimated). Agni-VI is also under development, with an envisioned range of 8000–12000km and features such as Multiple independently <b>targetable</b> reentry vehicles (MIRVs) or Maneuverable reentry vehicles (MARVs).|$|E
2500|$|Further complicating matters, under global {{nuclear war}} scenarios, with {{conditions}} similar to that during the Cold War, major strategically important cities, like Moscow, and Washington {{are likely to be}} hit not once, but numerous times from sub megaton multiple independently <b>targetable</b> re-entry vehicles, in a cluster bomb or [...] "cookie cutter" [...] configuration. It has been reported that {{during the height of the}} Cold War in the 1970s Moscow was targeted by up to 60 warheads. The reasons that the cluster bomb concept is preferable in the targeting of cities is twofold, the first is down to the fact that large singular warheads are much easier to neutralize as both tracking and successful interception by anti-ballistic missile systems than it is when several smaller incoming warheads are approaching. This strength in numbers advantage to lower yield warheads is further compounded by such warheads tending to move at higher incoming speeds, due to their smaller, more slender physics package size, assuming both nuclear weapon designs are the same (a design exception being the advanced W88). The second reason for this cluster bomb, or ‘layering’ (using repeated hits by accurate low yield weapons), is that this tactic along with limiting the risk of failure, also reduces individual bomb yields, and therefore reduces the possibility of any serious collateral damage to non-targeted nearby civilian areas, including that of neighboring countries. This concept was pioneered by Philip J. Dolan and others.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 July 2008, Vice Admiral Barry McCullough (Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Resources and Capabilities) and Allison Stiller (Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Ship Programs) {{stated that}} [...] "the DDG 1000 cannot perform area air defense; specifically, it cannot {{successfully}} employ the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2), SM-3 or SM-6 and {{is incapable of}} conducting Ballistic Missile Defense." [...] Dan Smith, president of Raytheon’s Integrated Defense Systems division, has countered that the radar and combat system are {{essentially the same as}} other SM-2-capable ships, [...] "I can’t answer the question as to why the Navy is now asserting … that Zumwalt is not equipped with an SM-2 capability". The lack of anti-ballistic missile capability may represent a lack of compatibility with SM-2/SM-3. The Arleigh Burke-class ships have BMD systems with their Lockheed-Martin AEGIS tracking and targeting software, unlike the DDG-1000's Raytheon TSCE-I targeting and tracking software, which does not, as it is not yet complete, so while the DDG-1000, with its TSCE-I combat system, does have the SM-2/SM-3 missile system installed, it does not yet have the BMD/IAMD upgrade planned for the derived CG(X). The Aegis system, on the other hand was used in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. Since the Aegis system has been the navy's chief combat system for the past 30 years when the navy started a BMD program, the combat system it was tested on was the Aegis combat system. So while the DDG-51 platform and the DDG-1000 platform are both SM-2/SM-3 capable, as a legacy of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System only the DDG-51 with the Aegis combat system is BMD capable, although the DDG-1000's TSCE-I combat system had both BMD and IAMD upgrades planned. And in view of recent intelligence that China is developing <b>targetable</b> anti-ship ballistic missiles based on the DF-21, this could be a fatal flaw.|$|E
