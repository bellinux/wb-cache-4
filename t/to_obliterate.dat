5|$|Launching a fresh assault, Pit {{succeeds in}} {{injuring}} Hades, but the Great Sacred Treasure is badly damaged {{during the battle}} leaving only its cannon intact. Hades attempts to launch a massive attack, but a revived Medusa injures him further, giving Palutena the chance to charge the Great Sacred Treasure's cannon with her power. Pit then uses the cannon <b>to</b> <b>obliterate</b> Hades' body, saving the world. At {{the start of the}} credits, Pit and Dark Pit are flying around as Palutena and Viridi have a brief argument.|$|E
5|$|The retreat {{continued}} until 11 May. On 12 May, Hampel carried out surrender {{negotiations with the}} British Army at Sankt Veit an der Glan. On 15 May {{most of the men}} were transported to Rimini in Italy, where they were incarcerated with other prisoners of war from 7th SS Division and 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS. Scattered remnants did not surrender until 18 May and many attempted <b>to</b> <b>obliterate</b> their SS blood group tattoo. Hampel escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Fallingbostel.|$|E
5|$|Forge and the Spartans {{return to}} the Spirit of Fire and the crew follows Anders' signal to an uncharted planet in another star system. The planet's surface is infested by the {{parasitic}} Flood, who attack and assimilate any sentient life they encounter. The Spirit of Fire inadvertently activates a Forerunner docking station and enters the planet's interior. Flood board the ship, and very soon Forerunner Sentinels appear to cleanse the Flood threat and also to destroy all UNSC forces in the process. The crew discovers the planet is actually hollow, with a habitable interior and a miniature sun. The Covenant's plan is to activate a dormant fleet of highly advanced Forerunner starships inside the planet, and use them <b>to</b> <b>obliterate</b> humanity.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the Bantu and European-origin settlers, the nomadic {{aboriginal}} people had lived harmoniously and in pure tranquility with the elephants and had little incentive for killing them or exploiting the forests. In two centuries the European settlers came close <b>to</b> <b>obliterating</b> the forests and killing the seemingly inexhaustible wild life to the verge of extinction, so that currently no large herbivores such as hippo, rhino and elephant are found alive outside nature reserves, the handful of Knysna elephants being the sole exception.|$|R

5|$|Receiving a {{broadcast}} of CIA agent Daniels being interrogated by the 33rd, the team chooses to interfere. Tracing the signal's origin, they find Daniels already {{dead and the}} broadcast was a trap set for fellow CIA agent, Gould. Gould helps Delta escape, but is later captured and killed while assaulting a location called the Gate. The team heads there and continues the attack. Finding it heavily guarded by the 33rd, the team employs white phosphorus <b>to</b> <b>obliterate</b> their opposition and advance further into the city. While walking through the aftermath, they realize they accidentally killed 47 civilians moved to the Gate for shelter by the 33rd. Walker blames the 33rd and vows revenge.|$|E
5|$|Timmy and his fairies {{return to}} the Blue Moon via M.E.R.F.'s escape pod to {{retrieve}} the second wand. A weakened Turbo Thunder reveals the second wand only opens underneath a secret cave, which contains magical wands and the final part of the cave prophecy: to find the ice wand. The group returns to Fairy World with the wands to free the imprisoned fairies before everyone heads back to Earth. The fairies arrive and use their magic to remove the Earth's metal casing. Timmy heads into space with the Destructinator following him; the Destructinator attacks him, which sends him {{back down to the}} Earth, at its north polar region. After Timmy tricks the Destructinator into inhaling the explosives, he reveals that he stole the detonator remote from him back in space and uses it <b>to</b> <b>obliterate</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Tyrion {{discovers that}} the Sons of the Harpy are {{funded by the}} slavers of Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis, and {{arranges}} a meeting with representatives of those cities to give them seven years to abolish slavery. Despite Tyrion's insistence that compromise is necessary, this solution is met with disapproval by Daenerys' other advisors and the freedmen of Meereen. Tyrion also enlists {{the assistance of the}} red priestess Kinvara, who believes that Daenerys is a messianic figure prophesied by her faith and offers the support of the followers of R'hllor. Meereen begins to prosper, but the city's success attracts the ire of the slavers, who fear it will undermine the legitimacy of slavery, and so launch a massive naval attack against the city. Daenerys returns in the chaos, and though she is displeased with Tyrion's failure, she is persuaded by him <b>to</b> <b>obliterate</b> the slavers' fleet and force their ultimate surrender rather than destroy them outright. Soon after, Theon and Yara Greyjoy arrive in Meereen offering Daenerys the Iron Fleet; they are joined by the fleets of Dorne and the Reach, who have defected from the Lannisters. Daenerys names an honored Tyrion as her Hand of the Queen. Tyrion then joins her, the dragons, and her army as they sail to Westeros.|$|E

25|$|Culturally, the Sassanids {{implemented}} {{a system of}} social stratification. This system was supported by Zoroastrianism, which was established as the state religion.

While excision of the intimal tear may be performed, it does not significantly change mortality.|$|E
25|$|The Samaritans, {{who claim}} descent from the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh (plus Levi through Aaron for kohens), are {{named after the}} Israelite Kingdom of Samaria, but until modern times many Jewish {{authorities}} contested their claimed lineage, deeming them to have been conquered foreigners who were settled in the Land of Israel by the Assyrians, as was the typical Assyrian policy <b>to</b> <b>obliterate</b> national identities. Today, Jews and Samaritans both recognize each other as communities with an authentic Israelite origin.|$|E
25|$|The play is {{composed}} {{almost entirely of}} speeches and contains little action since its protagonist is chained and immobile throughout. At the beginning, Kratos (Authority), Bia (violence), and the smith-god Hephaestus chain the Titan Prometheus to a mountain in the Caucasus, with Hephaestus alone expressing reluctance and pity, and then departing. According to the author, Prometheus is being punished not only for stealing fire, but also for thwarting Zeus's plan <b>to</b> <b>obliterate</b> the human race. This punishment is especially galling since Prometheus was instrumental in Zeus's victory in the Titanomachy.|$|E

40|$|Objective: In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>obliterating</b> the aneurysm using clipping or coil-ing, decompressive {{surgery for}} control of rising intracranial pressure (ICP) {{is thought to be}} crucial to prevention of adverse outcomes in patients with poor grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). We eval-uated the clinical characteristics of patients with poor-grade aSAH, and compared outcomes of aneurysmal clipping with simultaneous decom-pressive surgery to those of coil embolization followed by decompression. Materials and Methods: In 591 patients with aSAH, 70 patients with H-H grade IV and V underwent decompressive surgery including craniectomy, lobectomy, and hematoma removal. We divided the patients into two groups according to clipping vs. coil embolization (clip group vs. coil group), and analyzed outcomes and mortality. Results: Aneurysmal clipping was performed in 40 patients and coil emboli-zation was performed in 30 patients. No significant differences in demo-graphics were observed between the two groups.

25|$|Another novel, One Against the Legion, {{tells of}} a Purple pretender who sets up a robotic base on a world over seventy light years from Earth, and tries to conquer the Solar System via matter {{transporter}} technology he has stolen. In this story robots are outlawed, {{as they are in}} Dune. The story also features Jay Kalam, lobbying to allow the New Cometeers to leave the Solar System in peace, as many people were demanding that AKKA be used <b>to</b> <b>obliterate</b> the departing swarm of planets once and for all.|$|E
25|$|The Ghosts {{are sent}} to the Shrineworld Hagia, {{religious}} capital of the Sabbat worlds and homeworld of the revered Saint Sabbat herself, to reclaim the holy world from the clutches of Pater Sin and his so-called Infardi.

A warp-beacon is activated in the process, and a Chaos fleet advances on Hagia <b>to</b> <b>obliterate</b> the Imperial forces.|$|E
25|$|The last Dom, {{apparently}} a military leader, is discovered {{hiding in a}} bomb bunker. The Dom has anticipated defeat and, before Feric has the pleasure of killing him, triumphantly reveals that the Doms had salvaged and rearmed one of the ancient nuclear weapons. It is a doomsday weapon, and he triggers the failsafe. After Feric and his cohorts have evacuated Bora, a cobalt bomb detonates, and as the Dom planned, its fallout utterly corrupts the gene pool of Heldon. If any of its citizens, including Feric, reproduce, they will produce the mutants that they had previously sought <b>to</b> <b>obliterate.</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{validate}} {{the technique of}} PUGSI in high risk patients for adhesions during laparoscopy. Design: Prospective study on PUGSI <b>to</b> predict <b>obliterated</b> subumbilical adhesions. Setting: El-Shatby Maternity Hospital, Alexandria University. Patients: Sixty women with risk factors for intraabdominal adhesions. Interventions: Preoperative examination with PUGSI. Results: The prevalence of obliterated subumbilical adhesions was 26. 7 %. Abnormal PUGSI was detected among 18 patients, of these, 15 patients were diagnosed {{at the time of}} laparoscopy <b>to</b> have <b>obliterated</b> subumbilical adhesions (9 patients with omental and 6 patients with bowel adhesions). PUGSI had a diagnostic accuracy of 93. 3 %, a sensitivity of 93. 8 %, a specificity of 93. 2 %, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 83. 3 % and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 97. 6 %. Conclusion: PUGSI can accurately predict obliterated subumbilical adhesions prior to laparoscopy in patients at high risk of visceral injury. Widespread application of this technique may decrease trocar-related injuries during laparoscopic access...|$|R
