We conducted a comprehensive systematic literature review of <b>transcranial</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in orthopedic surgery to evaluate its status in this setting. Fourteen studies were selected for qualitative analysis. The highest number of patients studied was 45; emboli were detected in all studies, occurring in 20 %– 100 % of patients.

Discussion: TCD has been frequently employed for the clinical evaluation of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH).

After the advances in mechanical ventilation and cardiopulmonary resucitation techniques the term “brain death” has been used instead and with the worldwide increase in cadaveric organ transplantation this term has increasingly gained importance. Brain death is a state which is diagnosed by neurological examination in patients who fulfill some specific criteria. In patients who cannot be examined thoroughly or in whom an apnoea test cannot be performed a confirmatory test is mandatory. Diagnostic tests for brain death can either be those who show neural activity or those who evaluate cerebral circulation.

Cerebral oxygen saturations, cerebral blood flow velocities, and cerebral blood volume index values were compared by Mann-Whitney U test. Correlations between values of cerebral blood volume index and cerebral blood flow velocity were tested with Spearman rank order correlation. ResultsTwenty patients were studied. Median cerebral oxygen saturations for the right and left sides were 95 % and 95 % before regional low-flow cerebral perfusion, 95 % and 87 % during regional low-flow cerebral perfusion (P =. 054), and 93 % and 94 % after regional low-flow cerebral perfusion. Median cerebral blood flow velocity values did not change during regional low-flow cerebral perfusion. Cerebral blood volume index exhibited a poor correlation with cerebral blood flow velocity.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Blood flow {{within the}} middle {{cerebral}} artery can be mon-itored by <b>transcranial</b> <b>Doppler</b> (TCD) <b>ultrasonography.</b> Arterial stenosis can produce turbulent flow, but controversy remains regarding {{the degree of}} stenosis needed to cause TCD-detectable turbulence. Furthermore, cerebral emboli and turbulent flow may coexist in the same patient. The current {{study was designed to}} study the relationship between stenotic degree and TCD-detectable turbulent flow and its differentiation from cerebral emboli. METHODS: A stenotic middle cerebral artery model was constructed to allow the study of different degrees of stenosis. TCD was used to detect the turbulent flow and embolic materials in the circulation model, and signal intensities were analyzed. RESULTS: Turbulent flow was generated with a series of short, asymmetric stenoses in this test. Transition of turbulence from laminar flow began to occur at a moderate degree of stenosis (55 % reduction of cross-sectional area) but became dampened at the high degrees of stenoses (> 75 %). Turbulence caused a notable increase in average Doppler signal intensity. However, the degree of stenosis was not associated with signal intensity at the region where turbulence existed, but rather was related to the mean flow velocity measured at the narrowed region...|$|R

The <b>transcranial</b> <b>Doppler</b> (TCD) <b>ultrasonography</b> technique allows real-time monitoring of the intracranial circulation and makes it possible to evaluate the physiopathological correlation between ventricular dilatation and CBF.

40|$|Objectives: Dynamic {{cerebral}} autoregulation (CA) is impaired after stroke.

We performed a pilot study to assess dynamic CA in acute stroke patients using a novel technique of combining <b>transcranial</b> <b>Doppler</b> (TCD) <b>ultrasonography</b> with rhythmic handgrip. Methods: Ten patients with ischaemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory were studied. We performed continuous recordings of bilateral MCA velocities and used rhythmic handgrip to induce BP oscillations. Changes in autoregulation were indicated by changes in phase shift and gain of MCA velocity in relation to BP. Patients were examined at < 7 days, 6 weeks, and 3 months after stroke. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} in phase shift or gain between the affected and unaffected cerebral hemispheres. Combining the results from both hemispheres, there was a trend of increasing phase shift (P= 0. 04) and decreasing gain (P= 0. 24) over the first three months after stroke, indicating improving CA. Rhythmic handgrip produced an average percentage change in BP (peak-to-trough) of 10 % around the mean, and the frequency of the induced BP oscillations was very similar to that of the rhythmic handgrip. Conclusions: Combining TCD with rhythmic handgrip appeared to be a useful technique for assessing dynamic CA and it deserves further studies. In this pilot study, there was some evidence that CA might improve up to 3 months after ischaemic stroke. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Transcranial</b> <b>Doppler</b> (TCD) <b>ultrasonography</b> is a noninvasive bedside {{tool that}} can {{evaluate}} {{cerebral blood flow}} hemodynamics in major intracranial arteries. TCD-derived pulsatility index (PI) {{is believed to be}} influenced by intracranial pressure (ICP). OBJECTIVE: To correlate TCD-PI with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure (representing ICP), measured by standard lumbar puncture (LP) manometry. METHODS: CSF pressures (CSF-P) were measured in 78 patients by LP manometry. Stable TCD spectra were obtained 5 minutes before LP from either middle cerebral arteries using Spencer's head frame and 2 -MHz transducer. PI values were calculated from the TCD spectra by an independent neurosonologist. RESULTS: Factors displaying a significant relationship with CSF-P included age (R = -. 426, P <. 0005); EDV (R = -. 328, P =. 002;) and PI (R =. 650, P <. 0005). On analyzing dichotomized data (CSF-P < 20 vs. ≥ 20 cm H 2 0) TCD-PI was an independent determinant (OR per. 1 increase in PI = 2. 437; 95 % CI, 1. 573 - 3. 777; P <. 0005). PI ≥ 1. 26 could reliably predict CSF-P ≥ 20 cm H 2 0 (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy were 81. 1 %, 96. 3 %, 93. 8 %, 88. 1 %, and 90. 1 % respectively).

Material and methods: We have analyzed the existing literature on the protocols for performing TCD in the evaluation of patients with acute cerebral ischemia. Extended applications of TCD in enhancing intravenous thrombolysis in acute stroke, emboli monitoring, right-to-left shunt detection, and vasomotor reactivity have also been described. Results: In acute cerebral ischemia, TCD is capable of providing rapid information about the hemodynamic status of the cerebral circulation, monitoring recanalization in real-time and, additionally, has a potential for enhancing tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) -induced thrombolysis. Extended applications of TCD make it an important and valuable tool for evaluating stroke mechanisms, for planning and monitoring treatment, and for determining prognosis. Discussion and conclusion: TCD has an established clinical value in the diagnostic workup of stroke patients and is suggested as one of the essential components of a comprehensive stroke center. TCD is also an evolving ultrasound method with increasing diagnostic value and a therapeutic potential in cerebral ischemi...|$|R
