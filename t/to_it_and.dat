5|$|Ants are {{distinct}} in their morphology from other insects in having elbowed antennae, metapleural glands, {{and a strong}} constriction of their second abdominal segment into a node-like petiole. The head, mesosoma, and metasoma are the three distinct body segments. The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma (thorax plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused <b>to</b> <b>it)</b> <b>and</b> gaster (abdomen less the abdominal segments in the petiole). The petiole may be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or {{the second and third}} abdominal segments).|$|E

5|$|Because of its {{position}} more than 2,000 {{miles from the}} nearest continental landmass, the island of Hawaii {{is one of the most}} geographically isolated landmasses on Earth; this in turn has strongly influenced its ecology. The majority of the species present on the island are endemic <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> can be found nowhere else on Earth, the result of an isolated evolutionary lineage sheltered from external biotic influence; this makes its ecosystem vulnerable both to invasive species and human development, and an estimated third of the island's natural flora and fauna has already gone extinct.|$|E

5|$|Ports use Makefile to {{automatically}} fetch the desired application's source code, either {{from a local}} or remote repository, unpack it on the system, apply patches <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> compile it.

Most ports also have package counterparts (i.e. pre-compiled binaries), giving the user a choice. Although this method is faster, the user has fewer customisation options.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the virtual}} {{intelligence}} {{is kept in}} lockdown in another research station, Archers tells Shepard that he/she needs to manually override security from two other facilities to gain access <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> shut it down. Once the station where the virtual intelligence is contained has been unlocked, Shepards proceeds to the main server room. Shepard eventually accesses a terminal to cut all access to the outside world, {{but in the process}} the virus infects Shepard's cybernetic implants. Shepard awakens in a virtual reality, and heads to the central core room, where he finds that Archer had experimented on David in an attempt to control the geth. Shepard manages to defeat the virtual intelligence as it attempts to establish an upload link to the Normandy. Afterwards, David is shown in the core tied up to tubes in his arms and mouth, begging for help. Archer comes and argues for Shepard to keep the experiment going. Shepard is then given the option to either take David to a specialized academy or leave him at the station with his brother.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of season two, Shannon loses Vincent in the jungle. While searching for him, she is shocked to find Walt {{standing}} before her, dripping wet. However, when Sayid finds her, Walt disappears. Over the next few days, Sayid builds Shannon a shelter on the beach. He brings her <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> they soon decide to sleep {{together for the first}} time. Sayid leaves to get a bottle of water for Shannon and in his absence, Shannon again sees a vision of Walt, standing in the shelter with her. Sayid brushes off her experience as a dream. She uses Vincent to try to find Walt, only for him to lead her to Boone's grave. After a while, she takes Vincent into the jungle again, with Sayid in pursuit. As it starts to rain, Sayid and Shannon admit their feelings for each other before both seeing Walt. Shannon runs after him, only to be accidentally shot by Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), who mistakes her for an Other. She dies moments later in Sayid's arms. Shannon's death not only left Sayid heartbroken, but also caused a rift between the survivors and the Tailies. Throughout the rest of the season, Ana Lucia is shown to be guilt-ridden over killing Shannon.|$|E
5|$|Bill Pugh, {{the chief}} {{plastics}} designer at Cascelloid, based in Leicester, and former Royal Air Force pilot, created {{a prototype of}} the blown lemon-shaped plastic shaped container based upon Hack's idea sometime in the 1950s, {{as well as other}} types of blown containers. Pugh's experimented with the initial design until he was satisfied with its appearance. This plastic lemon product was then used for Hax lemon juice. Edward Hack, Ltd. produced and marketed Hax brand squeezable plastic lemon containers filled with two ounces of Sicilian lemon juice. Per Edward Hack, Ltd., the juice was unfiltered, had no water added <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> contained a preservative to prevent spoilage. Retailers could purchase the product in packs of six bags that contained 12 squeeze packs each, totalling 72 units. Upon introduction to the marketplace, Hax juice and the plastic lemon design received some press coverage. The Hax logo used on Hax lemon juice dates back to at least 1935, at which time it was used in advertisements for Hax brand iodine pencils and Hax brand aspirin.|$|E

The province studied this and other options over the following years, before a formal announcement was made by Minister of Transportation Tony Clement on 22 June 1998 along with York Region chairman Bill Fisch. The plan called for an extension of Highway404 north to Green Lane, and expansion of Highway9 (now part of York Region Road 31), the western extension of Davis Drive outside town, to five lanes between Highway400 and Bathurst Street. At the time over 20,000 vehicles used Davis Drive on an average day.|$|E
