To date, this approach has mainly been used to target orthologous loci within the same species ('homologous' capture). Our aim was to test the efficiency of this method across closely or distantly related species (‘heterologous’ capture). Specifically, we focused on the MHC locus, {{which is one of}} the most dynamic regions of mammalian genomes, and a model to study host-pathogen coevolution. A 385 K solid phase array (NimbleGen) encompassing the MHC was designed using the Sus scrofa Hp 1 a. 0 haplotype as a reference ([URL] Individuals from 9 species of Suidae (n= 69) and 2 species of <b>Tayassuidae</b> (n= 19) were selected for the study. Sets of 12 uniquely indexed sequencing libraries were prepared using Illumina kits, pooled, enriched, and sequenced on a HiSeq platform. In Suidae, the average values of coverage and specificity (% on target sequences) were respectively 86 x and 32 %. Results varied significantly across libraries, e. g. decreasing the number of cycles during PCR steps reduced the percentage of duplicate reads, but without improving specificity. On the other hand, in <b>Tayassuidae</b> both the coverage and the specificity showed lower efficiency. We can conclude that heterologous capture is a reliable technique at the level of Suidae, while in the case of <b>Tayassuidae</b> further optimization will be required to achieve better results.

40|$|<b>Tayassuidae</b> {{represent}} one of {{the first}} mammalian immigrants that entered South America during the “Great American Biotic Interchange. ” However, the exact moment of its arrival {{for the first time in}} South America is controversial. Three genera are recognized in South America: Platygonus, Catagonus, and Tayassu. This paper aims to: (1) review the paleontological record of the South American <b>Tayassuidae</b> and update it; and (2) discuss its geographical and statigraphical distribution pattern in South America. The genus Platygonus (middle Pliocene to early Pleistocene) is registered in Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, and Bolivia; Catagonus (late Pliocene? to Recent) in Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and Bolivia; and Tayassu (middle Pleistocene to Recent) in Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. Platygonus and Catagonus have adaptations to dry and relatively open environments; in contrast, Tayassu is adapted mainly to humid climates and woodland and forest environments. The faunal changes that took place since the middle-late Pliocene could have been strongly influenced by climate. Open and arid environments developed during the glacial cycles, allowing the latitudinal expansion of Platygonus and Catagonus. Considering ecological and anatomical information, it is possible to infer that Platygonus species were replaced by those of Catagonus since the middle Pleistocene, probably due to a reduction of the open environments to which Platygonus species were better adapted. The alternation of these mainly arid or semiarid, cold conditions with warmer and more humid short pulses would have allowed the posterior expansion of Tayassu species. According to phylogenetic analysis and chronological as well as geographical evidence, Platygonus and Catagonus represent two <b>Tayassuidae</b> lineages that originated in North America and then migrated to South America. This migration would have occurred on more than one occasion and with different taxa. Evidence indicates that Tayassu represents a lineage that differentiated in the Southern Hemisphere and then migrated to North America. Fil: Gasparini, Germán Mariano.

40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{is common}} in polygynous species, and there is clear evidence that both intra-sexual competition and female preferences can drive the evolution of large body size in males. In contrast, sexual monomorphism is often argued to reflect a relaxation of male mate competition or an intensification of resource competition among females. Alternatively, it might imply opportunities for females to circumvent or counteract male mate competition in a polygynandrous mating system. We test the prediction that sexual monorphism is associated with polygynandry in the collared peccary (Pecari tajacu, <b>Tayassuidae),</b> a social ungulate {{closely related to the}} old-world suids. The genetic mating system in the <b>Tayassuidae</b> is unknown, but its sexual monomorphism presents a striking contrast to the strong size dimorphism found in most Suidae, so that a departure from the polygynous system common in Suidae would be noteworthy. We characterized genetic relationships among adults within herds in three geographically distinct populations, assigned parents to 75 offspring, and tested for skew in individual reproductive success. Parentage assignment data indicated that multiple males sire offspring within a herd, and in the population for which genetic data were most complete, 19 % of parentage assignments were potentially sired by extra-herd males. Some litters have multiple sires, and neither males nor females monopolized reproduction, even in small herds. This result supports our prediction and suggests that sexual monomorphism may either select for or be an evolutionary consequence of a promiscuous mating system...|$|E
40|$|I {{investigated}} cranial {{and dental}} morphology in 37 species of fossil and living peccaries, Family <b>Tayassuidae,</b> from North and South America. PAUP analysis of 94 apomorphous character states among 33 species represented by adequate samples produced {{a set of}} trees (C. I. = 0. 74) which unequivocally support the monophyly of several clades within the <b>Tayassuidae.</b> The subfamily Tayassuinae comprises the three living species of peccary and 23 Miocene and younger species. The Miocene taxa Hesperhys, 2 ̆ 2 Thinohyus 2 ̆ 2 siouxensis, Floridachoerus, 2 ̆ 2 Cynorca 2 ̆ 2 sociale, and two unnamed species form a clade which is the sister group of the Tayassuinae. The Oligocene species Perchoerus probus is the sister group of the clade comprising Hesperhys and the Tayassuinae; another Oligocene species, Thinohyus lentus, is the sister group of all tayassuids surveyed. Analysis {{of a set of}} predominantly tayassuine taxa yielded a set of trees (C. I. = 0. 84) which resolve relationships among several tayassuine clades. Tayassu is the sister group of a clade comprising Prosthennops (restricted to P. serus), Mylohyus, and Platygonus. Catagonus and Dicotyles are sister groups, and together form a clade which is the sister group of the clade which unites Tayassu and Platygonus. Progressively distant sister groups of that clade include three unnamed Miocene species, Macrogenis, 2 ̆ 2 Prosthennops 2 ̆ 2 xiphidonticus, 2 ̆ 2 Prosthennops 2 ̆ 2 niobrarensis, 2 ̆ 2 Cynorca 2 ̆ 2 occidentale, and Dyseohyus. ^ Miocene and younger tayassuids possess within their nasal cavities an elaborate complex of bony structures that is unique among mammals. The floor of the nasal cavity is developed into a pneumatic, labyrinthine structure. The vomer is also pneumatic, and is developed into a pair of large, bilaterally symmetrical chambers. Many members of the clade of late Miocene and younger tayassuines that includes Macrogenis and its sister taxa have wing-like zygomatic processes; possession of these processes is primitive for that clade. Primitively both sexes (diagnosed by discretely bimodal canine diameters) possessed them, but they are sexually dimorphic in some species of Platygonus. Zygomatic processes were reduced in size in as many as five clades; their reduction was accompanied by reduction in the degree of canine dimorphism. A minimum of four dispersal events is required to account for the diversity of South American <b>Tayassuidae.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The pig-like Javelina of the American Southwest can fre-quently {{be seen in}} {{the desert}} eating cacti, spines and all.

The Javelina belongs to the related New-World Peccary Family (<b>Tayassuidae).</b> An ability to cope with high levels of dietary tannic acid appears to be a basic feature of both families.

40|$|Porcine {{endogenous}} retroviruses (PERV) {{are discussed}} as putative infectious agents in xenotransplantation. PERV classes A, B, and C harbor different envelope proteins. Two {{different types of}} long terminal repeat (LTR) structures exist, of which both are present only in PERV-A. One type of LTR contains a distinct repeat structure in U 3, while the other is repeatless, conferring {{a lower level of}} transcriptional activity. Since the different LTR structures are distributed unequally among the proviruses and, apparently, PERV is the only virus harboring two different LTR structures, we were interested in determining which LTR is the ancestor. Replication-competent viruses can still be found today, suggesting an evolutionary recent origin. Our studies revealed that the age of PERV is at most 7. 6 × 106 years, whereas the repeatless LTR type evolved approximately 3. 4 × 106 years ago, being the phylogenetically younger structure. The age determined for PERV correlates with the time of separation between pigs (Suidae, Sus scrofa) and their closest relatives, American-born peccaries (<b>Tayassuidae,</b> Pecari tajacu), 7. 4 × 106 years ago...|$|E
40|$|Palms (Arecaceae) are a {{dominant}} element within the neotropical plant community {{and because they}} substantially contribute to the overall and year-round fruit availability they are considered a key resource for frugivores, particularly for peccaries. Similarly, peccaries (<b>Tayassuidae)</b> are {{a dominant}} element within the neotropical mammal community. Their evolution of a strong mastication apparatus, unique interlocking canines, patterns of movement, and foraging ecology are viewed as adaptations to exploit hard seeds, particulary palm seeds. But how strong are the interactions between peccaries and palms, {{and what are the}} ecological ramifications? This review synthesizes over 76 papers, published between 1917 and 2004, which revealed that peccaries consumed fruits from 46 palm species, 73 % of whose seeds were destroyed after ingestion. Furthermore, peccaries disperse palm seeds; eat flowers, seedlings, and roots; and trample seedlings. Thus, peccaries affect the spatiotemporal distribution and demography of palms. Local extinction of peccaries resulted in dramatic changes in the forest ecology. New conservation strategies are required to protect peccaries and prevent negative cas-cading effects. Key words: Arecaceae, diversity, herbivory, Pecari tajacu, seed dispersal and predation, Tayassu pecari, trampling Throughout the Neotropics, palms are a dominating element, with approximately 150 species in Central America and 350 species in South America (A.

40|$|Peccaries and pigs, <b>Tayassuidae</b> and Suidae respectively, diverged {{approximately}} one {{million years ago}} from a common ancestor. Because these families share some pathogens, peccaries can act as reservoirs of infectious pathogens for domestic and wild swine. We evaluated the presence of swine infectious agents in the spleen and lung tissues of white-lipped peccaries (WLP; Tayassu pecari) and collared peccaries (CP; Pecari tajacu) in Brazil. Samples from 10 adult CP and three WLP, which had been hunted by locals or hit by motor vehicles, were obtained from two free-ranging Brazilian populations. The samples were tested by PCR for Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, porcine circovirus 2 (PCV 2), Suid herpesvirus 1 (SuHV- 1), and porcine parvovirus (PPV). Positive samples were sequenced. Both species were negative for PPV and B. bronchiseptica and positive for PCV 2 and SuHV- 1. The lungs of two animals were positive for M. hyopneumoniae and P. multocida. This report is the first demonstration of PCV 2 and SuHV- 1 swine viruses and of M. hyopneumoniae and P. multocida bacteria in peccaries. One factor contributing to this detection was access to tissue samples, which is uncommon. The role of these infectious agents in peccaries is unknown and further epidemiologic studies should be performed. This study identified several infectious agents in peccaries and highlighted {{the importance of the}} tissue type used to detect pathogens.

40|$|The {{origin of}} late Neogene Hippopotamidae (Artiodactyla) {{involves}} {{one of the}} most serious conflicts between comparative anatomy and molecular biology: is Artiodactyla paraphyletic? Molecular comparisons indicate that Cetacea should be the modern sister group of hippos. This finding implies the existence of a fossil lineage linking cetaceans (first known in the early Eocene) to hippos (first known in the middle Miocene). The relationships of hippos within Artiodactyla are challenging, and the immediate affinities of Hippopotamidae have been studied by biologists for almost two centuries without resolution. Here, we compare opposing hypotheses implicating several “suiform” families. This morphological analysis of a comprehensive set of taxa and characters offers a robust solution to the origins of Hippopotamidae. This family appears to be deeply nested within the otherwise extinct artiodactyl family Anthracotheriidae, most precisely within the most advanced selenodont forms. The proposed sister group of hippos is the middle to late Miocene African semiaquatic Libycosaurus. Any close relationships of hippos with suoids, particularly with <b>Tayassuidae,</b> are rejected. Furthermore, the clade (Hippopotamidae, Anthracotheriidae) is proposed as the sister group of the Cetacea, offering broad morphological support for a molecular phylogeny, such support being also consistent with the fossil record. Corroboration of this relationship requires an exploration of anthracothere affinities with other Paleogene artiodactyls. Among those, the position of Ruminantia is a central question, still to be solved. Further progress in this debate is likely to come from morphological studies of paleontological data, whether known or still to be discovered...|$|E
40|$|The microvascularization of the {{collared}} peccary (Tayassu tajacu) placenta was studied by vascular casts and immunolocalization of alpha-smooth muscle actin and vimentin, {{to identify the}} three-dimensional organization and vascular flow interrelation in the microvasculature between the maternal and fetal compartments of the placentae. The immunolocalization of vimentin in the vascular endothelium and in the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels showed indented capillaries along the uterine epithelium and the trophoblast {{at the sides of}} complementary maternal and fetal microfolds, or rugae. This confers the three-dimensional structure observed in vascular casts. On the maternal side, casts demonstrated uterine folds coated by with primary and secondary ridges, and by areolae dispersed between these ridges. The arteriole runs through the center/middle of ridges, branching at the top into a microvascular network wall in a basket-like fashion. At the base of these baskets venules were formed. On the fetal side, arterioles branched centrally in the fetal rugae into a capillary network in a bulbous form, complementary to the opposite maternal depressions forming the baskets. At the base of the bulbous protrusions, the fetal venules arise. The blood vessel orientation in the materno-fetal interface of the placentae of collared peccaries suggests a blood flow pattern of the type countercurrent to crosscurrent. The same pattern has been reported in domestic swine demonstrating that, even after 38 million years, the <b>Tayassuidae</b> and Suidae families exhibit similar placental morphology, which is here characterized at the microvascular level.

40|$|In 1980, Ginsburg {{created the}} new genus Xenobyus {{for a large}} suiform {{artiodactyl}} which he considered {{to belong to the}} family Suidae. Among the distinguishing characters of the genus, Ginsburg cited the enlarged, strongly curved and inflated central upper incisors possessing a distal accessory cusplet, the shortened muzzle, the enlarged lower first and second incisors, and the c 10 se packing of the entire tooth row (i. e. reduced to absent diastemata). These and other characters, such as the vertically implanted mandibular canines, the sympbyseal morphology, and the shape of the third upper incisor, suggest that Xenobyus belongs instead to the family <b>Tayassuidae,</b> subfamily Doliochoerinae. Whereas Ginsburg suggested that Xenobyus had an unknown ancestry and that it represented an immigrant into Europe at about the beginning of zone MN 2 b, it now seems more likely that it represents a late doliochoere of the sort represented by Doliochoerus quercyi which occurs in late Stampian deposits (Ginsburg, 1974). In many ways it is merely an enlarged version of this species, but there are sufficient morphological differences to warrant retention of the genus Xenobyus. Viewed within a tayassuid framework, Xenobyus is not seen to be unusual and not to run counter to evolutionary trends in the Suidae, the latter view being a necessity following its identifiation as a suid. Sorne fundamental similarities between tbe molars of Xenobyus and Kenyapotamus could provide a link between late doliochoeres and early hippopotamids, an hypothesis already mentioned by Pickford (1983). Newly discovered fossils from Loranca, Cuenca, Spain belong to two different species of Xenobyus, X venitor and an undescribed larger species. Nuevos f&# 243;siles, descubiertos en Loranca (Cuenca, Espa&# 241;a), pertenecientes a dos diferentes especies de Xenobyus; X vemtor y Xenobyus sp. de talla mayor que el anterior, son tambi&# 233;n descritos en este trabajo. Ginsburg (1980) cre&# 243; un nuevo g&# 233;nero Xenobyus para un suiforme de talla grande que consider&# 243; como perteneciente a la familia Suidae. Entre los caracteres que distingu&# 237;an a este nuevo g&# 233;nero, Ginsburg citaba la morfolog&# 237;a peculiar del tercer incisivo superior; ensanchado, fuertemente curvado, centralmente hinchado y con un tub&# 233;rculo accesorio distal. As&# 237; como el acortamiento del morro, los incisivos inferiores (I 1 e I 2) y la ausencia en la serie dentaria de diastemas. Este y otros caracteres, como son la implantaci&# 243;n vertical de los caninos en la mancUbula, la morfolog&# 237;a sinfisaria, y la forma del tercer incisivo superior, sugieren que Xenobyus pertenece m&# 225;s bien a la familia <b>Tayassuidae,</b> subfamilia Doliochoerinae. Para Ginsburg, Xenobyus no ten&# 237;a ning&# 250;n ancestro conocido en Europa y por tanto, deb&# 237;a ser un inmigrante, cuya entrada se habr&# 237;a producido cerca de los comienzos de la unidad NM 2 b. Xenobyus es ahora visto como uno de los &# 250;ltimos miembros de los doliochoerinos, representados por Doliochoerus quercyi en los dep&# 243;sitos del Estampiense superior (Ginsburg, 1974). De alguna manera, Xenobyus es meramente una versi&# 243;n agrandada de esta especie, pero hay suficientes diferencias morfol&# 243;gicas que apoyan la retenci&# 243;n del g&# 233;nero. Algunas similaridades fundamentales entre los molares de Xenobyus y Kenyapotamus podr&# 237;an probar una relaci&# 243;n entre los &# 250;ltimos doliochoerinos y los primeros hipop&# 243;tamos, hip&# 243;tesis ya ciertamente mencionada por Pickford (1983) ...|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the concern}} over {{potential}} infection hazards {{in the use of}} porcine tissues and organs for xenotransplantation to humans, we investigated the diversity of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) genomes in the DNA of domestic pigs and related species. In addition to the three known envelope subgroups of infectious gamma retroviruses (PERV-A, -B, and -C), classed together here as PERV group γ 1, four novel groups of gamma retrovirus (γ 2 to γ 5) and four novel groups of beta retrovirus (β 1 to β 4) genomes were detected in pig DNA using generic and specific PCR primers. PCR quantification indicated that the retroviral genome copy number in the Landrace × Duroc F 1 hybrid pig ranged from 2 (β 2 and γ 5) to approximately 50 (γ 1). The γ 1, γ 2, and β 4 genomes were transcribed into RNA in adult kidney tissue. Apart from γ 1, the retroviral genomes are not known to be infectious, and sequencing of a small number of amplified genome fragments revealed stop codons in putative open reading frames in several cases. Analysis of DNA from wild boar and other species of Old World pigs (Suidae) and New World peccaries (<b>Tayassuidae)</b> showed that one retrovirus group, β 2, was common to all species tested, while the others were present among all Old World species but absent from New World species. The PERV-C subgroup of γ 1 genomes segregated among domestic pigs and were absent from two African species (red river hog and warthog).

40|$|This is {{the fourth}} {{in a series of}} papers by Jones, et al., dealing with the {{systematics}} and distributional status of mammals on the Yucatán Peninsula of México. The present contribution lists 24 native species belonging to the orders Carnivora (18 species), Sirenia (one), Perissodactyla (one), and Artiodactyla (four). Among the carnivores there are one canid, six procyonids, six mustelids, and five felids, whereas the Artiodactyla is represented by two families (<b>Tayassuidae</b> and Cervidae), each with two species. The Yucatán Peninsula as treated in this series of papers includes the Mexican states of Campeche and Yucatan, and the Federal Territory of Quintana Roo; physiographically the peninsula also includes portions of Guatemala and British Honduras (later known as Belize). The Recent mammals of the Mexican part of the peninsula were treated in an early work by Gaumer (1917) and sub-Recent faunas were studied by Hatt et al. (1953). The physiography and vegetation of the region have been described previously by Duellman (1965, 1966), Jones, et al. (1973), Klaas (1968), and Paynter (1955). Many specimens reported in this paper were collected in the summer of 1962 by a field party under the direction of W. E. Duellman and also by a survey team, led by J. K.

40|$|More than 30 {{species of}} exotic freeranging mammals have become {{established}} in the United States since European colonization (De Vos et al., 1956; McKnight, 1964; Roots, 1976). These species often become serious economic pests and can have grave consequences on their host environments (Cottam, 1956; De Vos et al., 1956; Mayer and Brisbin, 1991). True wild pigs (Suidae) are not native to the United States. Only the collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu; <b>Tayassuidae)</b> that inhabits the southwestern and south-central parts of the United States is native (Mayer and Brandt, 1982; Mayer and Wetzel, 1986). Feral swine (Sus scrofa) in the United States have originated from varieties of domestic swine, Eurasian wild boar, and their hybrids (Jones, 1959; Wood and Lynn, 1977; Rary et al., 1968; Mayer and Brisbin, 1991). Domestic swine {{were introduced to the}} United States as early as 750 - 1000 A. D. during the settlement of the Hawaiian Islands (Towne and Wentworth, 1950; Joesting, 1972; Smith and Diong, 1977). Christopher Columbus introduced domestic swine to the West Indies during the 1400 s, where they proliferated and became pests. In the 1500 s, Spanish explorers, such as DeSoto and Cortez, were the first to bring domestic swine to the United States mainland (Towne and Wentworth, 1950; Beldon and Frankenberger, 1977). By the 1960 s, domestic swine and Eurasian wild boar were established in 3 ̆e 20 states (McKnight, 1964). Swine introductions have intentionally or accidentally occurred by a variety of means, including: 1) translocation to establish populations for hunting, 2) escapees from shooting preserves or confinement operations, 3) avoidance of capture by domestic pigs in free-ranging livestock operations, 4) abandonment by their owners, and 5) dispersal from established feral populations (Gipson et al., 1997; Witmer et al., 2004). Feral swine are the most abundant free-ranging, exotic ungulate in the United States (McKnight, 1964; Decker, 1978) and have become widespread because of their reproductive potential and adaptability {{to a wide range of}} habitats. Like domestic swine, litter size depends on the sow’s age, nutrition, and time of year. Feral swine are capable of producing two litters per year with average litter size varying from 4. 2 to 7. 5 piglets (Taylor et al., 1998), but up to 10 piglets can be born during ideal conditions (Conquenot et al., 1996). Mayer and Brisbin (1991) and Mackey (1992) report feral swine populations in 23 states. A Southeastern Cooperative Disease Study (1994) and Nettles (1997) point out an additional 16 states with feral swine populations. An estimated population of 4 million feral swine currently occur in the United States (Pimentel et al., 2000) with the largest populations inhabiting Texas (1 to 1. 5 million; Pimentel et al., 2000), Florida (3 ̆e 500, 000; Layne, 1997), Hawaii (80, 000; Mayer and Brisbin, 1991), and California (70, 000; Barrett, 1993). Since 1965, feral swine have expanded their range from 15 (26...|$|E
40|$|O cateto (Tayassu tajacu) pertence à familia Tayassui-dae e é caracterizado por "colar" de pêlos brancos ao redor do pescoço que se estende bilateralmente cranialmente aos ombros. Pode ser encontrado do sudoeste dos Estados Unidos da América até a Argentina. Na {{literatura}} verificou-se a falta de dados a respeito da anatomia funcional do cateto especialmente trabalhos que envolvem a anatomia do plexo braquial. Visando elucidar o comportamento do plexo braquial do cateto e com a finalidade de contribuir para o desenvolvimento da anatomia comparada, realizou-se esta pesquisa. Utilizou-se 30 animais de idades diferentes (13 fêmeas e 17 machos) provenientes do Centro de Multiplicação de Animais Silvestres, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-árido, Mossoró, Rio Grande do Norte. Após o abate, realizou-se a dissecação bilateral dos plexos braquiais e registraram-se os resultados através de desenhos esquemáticos e as disposições agrupadas em tabelas para subseqüente análise estatística e obtidas as freqüências percentuais. Observou-se que o plexo braquial de catetos é resultado das comunicações estabelecidas, principalmente, entre os ramos ventrais dos três últimos nervos espinhais cervicais (C 6, C 7 e C 8) e dos dois primeiros nervos espinhais torácicos (T 1 e T 2), tendo uma contribuição do quarto e quinto nervos cervicais em 16, 67 % e 50, 00 % dos casos, respectivamente. Em 40, 00 % das dissecações a formação do plexo, mais freqüente, foi do tipo C 6, C 7, C 8, T 1 e T 2. Os principais nervos derivados do plexo braquial dos catetos e suas respectivas origens foram: nervo supraescapular (C 6 e C 7), nervo subscapular (C 5, C 6 e C 7 ou C 6 e C 7), nervo axilar (C 6 e C 7), nervo músculocutâneo (C 7 e C 8), nervo mediano (C 7, C 8, T 1 e T 2), nervo ulnar (C 8, T 1 e T 2), nervo radial (C 8, T 1 e T 2), nervos peitorais craniais (C 7) e caudais (C 7 e C 8), nervo toracodorsal (C 6, C 7 e C 8), nervo torácico longo (C 7 e C 8) e nervo torácico lateral (C 8, T 1 e T 2). Collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu) {{belongs to}} the <b>Tayassuidae</b> family, characterized by a "collar" of white hairs that cross behind the neck and extend bilaterally {{in front of the}} shoulders. It can be found from south-western United States to Argentina. In the literature a shortage of data is verified regarding the functional anatomy of the collared peccaries, especially of studies that involve the anatomy of the brachial plexus. To elucidate the behavior of this plexus of collared peccaries and with the purpose to contribute for the development of compared anatomy, this study was accomplished. Thirty animals of different ages were used (17 males and 13 females) coming from the Wild Animal Multiplication Center of the "Universidade Federal Rural do Semiárido" Mossoró, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. After slaughter bilateral dissection of the brachial plexuses took place, and the results were registered in schematic drawings and the dispositions grouped in tables for subsequent statistical analysis based on the percentile frequency. It was found that the Plexus brachialis of collared peccaries is the result of established communications, mainly among the Rami ventrales of the last three cervical nerves and of the first two thoracic nerves, having a contribution of the fourth and fifth cervical nerves in 16. 67 % and 50. 00 % of the cases, respectively. In 40. 00 % of the dissections the most frequent plexus was of the type C 6, C 7, C 8, T 1 and T 2. The main nerves derived from brachial plexus of the collared peccaries and its respective origins had been: Nervus suprascapularis (C 6, C 7), Nn. subscapulares (C 5, C 6 e C 7 or C 6 e C 7), N. axillaris (C 6, C 7), N. musculocutaneus (C 7, C 8), N. medianus (C 7, C 8, T 1, T 2), N. radialis (C 8, T 1, T 2), N. ulnaris (C 8, T 1, T 2), cranialis (C 7), and caudalis (C 7, C 8) Nn. pectorales, N. thoracodorsalis (C 6, C 7, C 8), N. thoracicus longus (C 7, C 8), and N. thoracicus lateralis (C 8, T 1, T 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Estudaram-se a morfologia macroscópica e microscópica da {{placenta}} de 12 fêmeas adultas prenhes de cateto (Tayassu pecari) e 03 de queixada (Tayassu pecari). Os animais foram obtidos em criatórios autorizados pelo IBAMA e no Centro de Multiplicação de Animais Silvestres, Mossoró,RN. Fragmentos da placenta e do cordão umbilical foram colhidos imediatamente após a morte do animal e fixados por imersão em paraformoldeído 4 % e glutaraldeído 2, 5 %, ambos em tampão fosfato 0, 1 M, para microscopia de luz, de transmissão e de reflexão, e para análise macroscópica o conjunto dos órgãos genitais foi fixado em solução aquosa de formol 10 %. Para microscopia de luz, o material foi embebido em paraplast e historesina e para a microscopia eletrônica em resina Araldite®. A arquitetura microvascular foi estudada com moldes vasculares preparados a partir da combinação dos lados materno e fetal, e destes isoladamente, obtidos pela injeção de Mercox® na artéria umbilical e na artéria uterina. O cordão umbilical está composto por três vasos do tipo muscular, duas artérias e uma veia umbilical, e por um ducto alantóide. A placenta dos Taiassuídeos é corioalantóide, difusa e pregueada. O saco coriônico é fusiforme e possui superfície recoberta por pequenas pregas e aréolas. Os cortes transversais evidenciaram o epitélio uterino íntegro e o trofoblasto, caracterizando a placenta epiteliocorial. O trofoblasto é cilíndrico na base das rugas coriônicas, com células polarizadas, núcleos esféricos e citoplasma contendo numerosos vacúolos PAS+ no pólo basal, enquanto que no topo das rugas são cubóides, como o epitélio materno. Os capilares fetais possuem alta capacidade de entremearem-se no trofoblasto no topo e paredes das rugas fetais. A interface materno-fetal é PAS+, bem como o epitélio glandular e a sua secreção. As glândulas uterinas secretam na cavidade areolar material PAS+ e as células glandulares são Perls+. A barreira placentária possui todas as camadas e pode chegar a 3 micrômetros de espessura ou menos. A análise dos moldes vasculares demonstra que a relação entre sangue materno-fetal desenvolve-se de contra-corrente para corrente-cruzada. Os capilares fetais formam fileiras de protrusões bulbosas, que se encaixam nos cestos maternos formados por rugas e depressões. A placenta dos pecaris pode ainda ser classificada como adeciduada. Macro and microscopic morphology in placenta of {{the twelve}} collared peccary (Tayassu pecari) and three white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) were studied. The animals were obtained from authorized farms by IBAMA and from CEMAS, Mossoró, RN. Fragments from placenta and from umbilical cord were obtained immediately after slaughter and fixed by immersion in 4 % paraformoldehyde and 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0. 1 M phosphate buffer, to light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy analysis and the genital organs were fixed in aqueous solution of formaldehyde 10 % to macroscopic analysis. For light microscopy, the pieces of organs were embedded in paraplast or historesin and to transmission electron microscopic were embedded in Araldit® resin. The microvascular architecture was studied with blood vessels casts prepared from de maternal, fetal and combined maternal and fetal sides, by Mercox® injection into the umbilical artery and uterine artery. The umbilical cord has three muscular vessels, two arteries and one umbilical vein, and one alantoic duct. The placenta of <b>Tayassuidae</b> is chorioalantoid, diffuse and folded. The chorionic sac is fusiform and its surface is covered with folds and small areolas. The transversal sections show {{the presence of the}} trophoblast and maternal epithelium, characterizing the epitheliochorial placenta. The trophoblast is columnar on the base of fetal rugae and contains polarized cells, spherical nucleus and cytoplasm with many vacuoles with material PAS + in the basal polo, while on the top of rugae the trophoblast is cuboid as the uterine epithelium. The capillaries have characteristics of the indentation between trophoblast cells on the top and side of the fetal rugae. The materno-fetal interface is PAS+, as well as the glandular epithelium and their secretion. The uterine glands secreted in the areolar cavity PAS+ material and their cells are Perls+. The interhemal barrier has all layers and may have three micrometers or less. The analysis of the vessels casts shows that materno-fetal blood interrelationship develops into a crosscurrent to countercurrent. The fetals capillaries form rows of bulbous protrusions fitting into the complementary maternal baskets formed by ridges and troughs. The placenta of peccaries still may be classified as adeciduade...|$|E
