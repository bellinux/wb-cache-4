5|$|After the Thuns {{learned the}} game, they began {{teaching}} its rules to their fraternity brothers at Williams College around 1926. Daniel W. Layman, in turn, learned {{the game from}} the Thun brothers (who later tried to sell copies of the game commercially, but were advised by an attorney that the game could not be patented, as they were not its inventors). Layman later returned to his hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana, and began playing the game with friends there, ultimately producing hand-made versions of the board based on streets of that city. Layman then commercially produced and sold the game, starting in 1932, with a friend in Indianapolis, who owned a company called Electronic Laboratories. This game was sold under the name <b>The</b> <b>Fascinating</b> Game of Finance (later shortened to Finance). Layman soon sold his rights to the game, which was then licensed, produced and marketed by Knapp Electric. The published board featured four railroads (one per side), Chance and Community Chest cards and spaces, and properties grouped by symbol, rather than color. Also in 1932, one edition of The Landlord's Game was published by the Adgame Company with {{a new set of}} rules called Prosperity, also by Magie.|$|E

Miyagawa {{said in an interview}} that the characters, “they are identified by their types, such as Crazy Woman, Mystical Warrior, Woman with Tragic Hair, and Gangster on the Run, in an attempt to create sympathetic characters without making them into our neighbors.” The play received critical acclaim. The Huffington Post said, “Miyagawa's plays, this one especially, sit somewhere between this world and another world. They also commit so fully to their own aesthetic that I usually find myself pondering <b>the</b> <b>fascinating</b> rules of this alternate existence hours or even days later (this lingering life indeed).” The New Yorker praised the play as” clever, stylish, and often funny”.|$|E

25|$|Liquid {{crystals}} made of rod-like molecules {{had been}} discovered in 1888, and many compounds had been synthesized at Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany in the 1920s and 30s. Some physical studies had been undertaken by the German and Russian schools during that era, but the subject later languished till the mid-fifties. Starting in the late fifties, the systematic synthetic effort by George William Gray in the UK and the physical studies by Wilhelm Maier in Germany (including the well-known Maier–Saupe or MS theory) started {{a revival of the}} subject. Chandrasekhar and his co-workers made contributions to the application of the dynamical theory of reflections to study <b>the</b> <b>fascinating</b> optical properties of cholesteric liquid crystals which have a helical structure with a pitch which is usually ~ 0.5mm, and to the extensions of the molecular theory of nematic liquid crystals beyond the MS model. Chandrasekhar was invited to establish a liquid crystal laboratory in RRI after the Department of Science and Technology started supporting it in 1971. The move had a highly positive impact on his productivity. Along with a couple of former students who moved with him to RRI, in a short time, he developed a laboratory with all the essential facilities needed for research in the chosen area. Realizing that cutting-edge research would not be possible without an in-house capacity to produce new materials, a synthetic organic chemistry laboratory was set up. Soon many new experimental and a few theoretical results emerged and the Liquid Crystal Laboratory at RRI became one of the leading centres of research in the world. The twisted nematic liquid crystal display was invented in Europe in 1971 and recently, LCDs have displaced CRTs as commercially the most important displays. In cooperation with Chandrasekhar and his colleagues, the Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Bangalore, developed indigenous know-how for the manufacture of simple LCDs for the domestic market.|$|E

However, there have been instances of later artists incorporating elements of The Garden of Earthly Delights into their own work. Pieter Bruegel the Elder (c. 1525–1569) in particular directly acknowledged Bosch as an important influence and inspiration, and incorporated many elements of the inner right panel into several of his most popular works. Bruegel's Mad Meg depicts a peasant woman leading an army of women to pillage Hell, while his The Triumph of Death (c. 1562) echoes the monstrous Hellscape of The Garden, and utilizes, according to the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, the same [...] "unbridled imagination and <b>the</b> <b>fascinating</b> colours".|$|E

The title itself contains a lewd pun. [...] It is based on several plays by Molière, with added features that 1670s London audiences demanded: colloquial prose dialogue in place of Molière's verse, a complicated, fast-paced plot tangle, and many sex jokes.

According to co-star Bobby Cannavale, the film took three years to make and was not at first written with Dinklage in mind, Cannavale said McCarthy [...] "set out {{to tell a story}} about a guy who was a train enthusiast who had chosen to isolate himself from the world", but when McCarthy actually started [...] "putting pen to paper" [...] for the screenplay he decided to write the role for him. Speaking about the role, Dinklage noted that usually [...] "roles written for someone my size are a little flat"—often either comical or [...] "sort of Lord of the Rings" [...] type characters filled with wisdom; further: [...] "They're not sexual, they're not romantic" [...] and [...] "they're not flawed". What attracted him to the character McCarthy had written was that it was not one of the stereotypical roles people with dwarfism play; rather, McBride has [...] "romantic feelings" [...] as well as [...] "anger and ... flaws". The role earned him the Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor nominations. In the New York Observer, reviewer Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "Dinklage projects both size and intelligence in <b>the</b> <b>fascinating</b> reticence of his face." [...] Besides being Dinklage's highest-rated film on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Station Agent was modestly successful at the box office, earning over $8 million against its small budget.|$|E
