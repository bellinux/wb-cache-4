5|$|Stafford {{received}} further favour {{from the}} Crown soon after, being granted the wardship {{of the son}} and heir of John Tuchet, 4th Baron Audley, and, when <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> back in 1409, he received estates in Shropshire and Cambridgeshire in compensation. Unusually ("striking", says Helen Castor) {{he was not a}} retainer of the crown or the Duchy of Lancaster, in Staffordshire, but rather of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, for whom Humphrey represented the interests of the main Stafford family.|$|E
5|$|Route S3 {{was defined}} in 1929 {{to run from}} Route 3 in East Rutherford west to Route 6 (US46) in Clifton, (this {{is now part of}} Route 3). In 1942, the state took over the {{alignment}} and made it an unnumbered state highway was defined to run from the intersection of Clifton Avenue and Van Houten Avenue southwest to Route S3, which then ran along Allwood Road. World War II delayed completion of Route S3 long enough for an alternate freeway route to be selected, and the part of Allwood Road <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> over is no longer a state highway. In 1948, the route was assigned the number Route S3 Spur. The number was changed to Route 161 in the 1953 state highway renumbering, and ever since then it has remained an isolated state highway.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{would allow}} him to retain the 11th Guards and {{suggested}} that Colonel-General N. E. Chibisov, an officer he had served under, assume his position. Bagramyan, however, commented that he had had a frictional relationship with Chibisov and instead nominated Lieutenant-General K. N. Galitsky. Stalin, belatedly realizing that Bagramyan was implying that the two would be unable to coordinate harmoniously due to a conflict of holding the same rank, agreed to Bagramyan's suggestion and promoted him to the rank Army General. He also agreed to have the Second Baltic Front return a tank corps and an infantry division <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> from the 11th Guards, thus bolstering the forces under Bagramyan to a total of four armies: 11th Guards, 39th, 43rd and the 4th Shock.|$|E

5|$|The 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries saw {{the rise of}} modern Irish nationalism, {{primarily}} among the Roman Catholic population. The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was Daniel O'Connell. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Ennis in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat as a Roman Catholic. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the Duke of Wellington. Steering the Catholic Relief Bill through Parliament, aided by future prime minister Robert Peel, Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant George IV to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. George's father had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, Pitt the Younger, to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing Catholic Emancipation to be {{in conflict with the}} Act of Settlement 1701.|$|E
5|$|The {{unilateral}} French decision led to {{a censure}} debate in the House of Commons. By 1967, when the French decided {{to withdraw from the}} AFVG programme, the Air Ministry was faced with a dilemma stemming from the imminent prospect of cancelling the F-111K, a decision <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> in November 1967, to be formalized on 20 March 1968. Up to this point, Britain had spent £2.5 on the AFVG for practically no gains. In order to justify the absence of any new strike aircraft following the failure of multiple projects to develop or procure one, Healey decided to entirely dismantle the requirement for one. Thus, in 1968, Prime Minister Harold Wilson, alongside Healey, announced that British troops would be withdrawn in 1971 from major military bases in South East Asia, the Persian Gulf and the Maldives, collectively known as 'East of Suez'.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1970s plans {{continued}} to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock {{site and the}} whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside.|$|E

5|$|As Vettel {{maintained}} his lead, the stewards informed the Lotus team that Kovalainen {{had been caught}} speeding in the pit lane, {{for which he was}} served with a ten-second stop-and-go penalty <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> on lap thirty-nine. Alonso set a new fastest lap and closed the gap to 1.2 seconds behind Vettel at the start of lap thirty-seven. Further back, Sutil overtook Heidfeld for twelfth on the following lap. Sutil tried to pass Kobayashi on lap thirty-eight at turn three but out-braked himself, allowing Kobayashi to retake the position. He passed the Kobayashi because of his higher straight line speed, but Sutil braked later and slid off the track, rejoining in fourteenth. One lap later, Alonso was told by his team to drive less aggressively through turns seven and eight in an effort to preserve tyre life because he was spinning his tyres under acceleration. At the conclusion of lap thirty-nine, all of the drivers had made pit stops. Vettel was leading Alonso, who was followed by Hamilton, Massa, Schumacher, Barrichello, Petrov, Hülkenberg, Kubica, Liuzzi, Kobayashi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Sutil, Button, Senna, Kovalainen and Yamamoto. A dry line began to emerge on lap forty-one as Petrov lost control of the rear-end of his car between turns seventeen and eighteen; he slid sideways into the tyre barrier at the pit lane entry.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc {{objected to}} the use of his troops in the attack on Royan in April 1945. As a result, only part of 2e DB was employed. The {{division}} rejoined Seventh Army, crossing the Rhine on 25 April, and joining the pursuit into Bavaria. Leclerc visited Dachau concentration camp after its liberation by the Americans. In an incident that took place 8 May 1945 at Bad Reichenhall in Bavaria, he was presented with a defiant group of captured Frenchmen of the SS Charlemagne Division. He asked them why they wore a German uniform, to which one of them replied by asking why Leclerc wore an American one. Leclerc told his men to get rid of them. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> as a death sentence. The group of French Waffen-SS men was summarily executed by the RMT without any form of military tribunal procedure, and their bodies left where they fell until an American burial team collected them. For his services leading the 2e DB, Leclerc was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour.|$|E
5|$|Using {{a similar}} strategy, S. D. Malone and S. Bor {{analyzed}} the known intensities for the 1872 shock, then compared intensity patterns {{for a number}} of instrumentally recorded earthquakes that also occurred in the Pacific Northwest. A factor <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> into consideration was that for earthquakes that have either circular or slightly elliptical isoseismal maps, the epicenter is usually close {{to the center of the}} pattern, but that for shocks where instrumental information are also available, the epicenter is sometimes not where it would have been assumed to be, had only the intensity information (and no instrumental information) been available. An isoseismal map of the 1949 Olympia earthquake was presented as an example of a distorted or convoluted pattern that was attributed to local geological conditions that either attenuated or amplified the seismic waves, and it was emphasized that not taking into account these local features could lead to a misinterpretation of the felt intensities and to a misplaced epicenter.|$|E
