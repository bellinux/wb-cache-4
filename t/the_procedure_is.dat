5|$|The game {{world is}} {{presented}} in a horizontal wraparound and consists of three platforms which Jetman can manoeuvre onto. Jetman must assemble his rocket (which spawns in instalments scattered around the map), and then fill it with fuel before taking off to the next planet, where <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> broadly repeated. In addition, the player has to defend themselves from the planet's aliens, and for bonus points collect valuable resources which occasionally fall from above.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> {{performed}} completely {{without any}} additional drugs in 73 patients (92  %), whereas propofol was added in 6 (8  %). Six patients presented side effects including bradypnea (n =  5) and hypotension (systolic arterial pressure of 70  mmHg, n =  1) that occured during <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> and <b>were</b> completely reversible with TCI goal decrease.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} in our hospital {{with the aim}} of providing a safe, effective and value-for-money alternative to other methods of surgical management, which increased convenience and reduced recovery time. Milingos et al. [17], in a retrospective observational study, showed that <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> effective in 95  % cases with no major complications and our experiences from the first 2  years of its use support these findings. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> completed successfully in all cases and there were no major complications in our cohort.|$|R
5|$|Tracing in English {{law is a}} {{procedure}} to identify property (such as money) that has been taken from the claimant involuntarily. It is not in itself a way to recover the property, but rather to identify {{it so that the}} courts can decide what remedy to apply. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> used in several situations, broadly demarcated by whether the property has been transferred because of theft, breach of trust, or mistake.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} methods to perform {{sterilization}} via the cervix are being studied. One involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility. While <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> inexpensive {{and does not}} require surgical skills, there are concerns regarding long-term side effects. Another substance, polidocanol, which functions {{in the same manner}} is being looked at. A device called Essure, which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes and blocks them, was approved in the United States in 2002.|$|E
5|$|A {{position}} paper {{published by the}} American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2007 warns {{that there is no}} valid medical reason to perform the procedure, which is not considered routine or accepted by the College; and it has not been proven to be safe or effective. The potential risks include sexual dysfunction, infection, altered sensation, dyspareunia, adhesions and scarring. The College position is that it is untenable to recommend the procedure. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the American Medical Association, and no peer-reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E

30|$|Methods: The {{women were}} {{randomised}} to either 200 micrograms of self-administered vaginal misoprostol {{at home or}} no medication use. All the patients answered a questionnaire minutes before <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> and minutes after. All <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> performed by <b>the</b> same doctor.

5|$|Certain African {{cultural}} groups, {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> also {{practiced by}} some cultural groups or individual family lines in the Sudan, Zaire, Uganda and in southern Africa. For some of these groups, circumcision appears to be purely cultural, done with no particular religious significance or intention to distinguish members of a group. For others, circumcision might be done for purification, {{or it may be}} interpreted as a mark of subjugation. Among these groups, even when circumcision is done for reasons of tradition, it is often done in hospitals. It is not clear how many deaths and injuries result from traditional circumcisions which occur outside of hospitals.|$|E
5|$|Dermabrasion is an {{effective}} therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties. Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin. Dermabrasion has fallen out of favor {{with the introduction of}} laser resurfacing. Unlike dermabrasion, {{there is no evidence that}} microdermabrasion is {{an effective}} treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{is often}} administered without tracheal intubation in selected cases where <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> brief in duration, or procedures where {{the depth of}} anesthesia {{is not sufficient to}} cause significant compromise in ventilatory function. Even for longer duration or more invasive procedures, a general anesthetic may be administered without intubating the trachea, provided that patients are carefully selected, and the risk-benefit ratio is favorable (i.e., the risks associated with an unprotected airway are believed to be less than the risks of intubating the trachea).|$|E
30|$|The {{paper is}} {{structured}} as follows. In Section  2 {{the methodology of}} <b>the</b> participative <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> analysed. Outcomes of <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>are</b> shown and discussed in Sections  3 and 4, respectively. The last section concludes.|$|R

5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E
5|$|The amputated parts {{might be}} placed in a pouch for the girl to wear. A single hole of 2–3mm is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid. The vulva is closed with {{surgical}} thread, or agave or acacia thorns, and might be covered with a poultice of raw egg, herbs and sugar. To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after two to six weeks. If the remaining hole is too large {{in the view of the}} girl's family, <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> repeated.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{a remake}} of the {{original}} Jetpac with overhauled high-definition graphics and 128 levels. It also features competitive gameplay over Xbox Live, leaderboards, and achievements. Similar to the first instalment, the player assumes control of Jetman and is presented in a horizontal wrap around which consists of six platforms on which Jetman can manoeuvre onto. Jetman has to first assemble his rocket, which spawns in separate parts that are scattered around a map, and then fills it with six fuel canisters before taking off to the next planet, where <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> repeated. In addition, Jetman has to defend himself from each planet's hostile aliens, and collect valuable resources such as gold and platinum, which occasionally fall from the atmosphere, for bonus points.|$|E

5|$|The {{indwelling}} cannula: Outside of the United States, many piercers use {{a needle}} containing a cannula (or catheter), a hollow plastic tube {{placed at the}} end of the needle. In some countries, the piercing needle favoured in the United States is regarded as a medical device and is illegal for body piercers. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> similar to the piercing needle method, but the initial jewellery is inserted into the back of the cannula and the cannula and the jewellery are then pulled through the piercing. More bleeding may follow, as the piercing is larger than the jewellery.|$|E
5|$|The {{positions}} of the world's major medical organizations range from considering elective circumcision of babies and children as having no benefit and significant risks to having a modest health benefit that outweighs small risks. No major medical organization recommends either universal circumcision of all males or banning the procedure. Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and human rights have been raised over the circumcision of babies and children for non-medical reasons; for these reasons <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> controversial.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> {{high risk}} as a diver {{suffering}} from DCS may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing whilst under water. Any {{one of these}} events may result in the diver drowning or further injury to the diver during a subsequent rescue to the surface. These risks can be mitigated to some extent by using a helmet or full-face mask with voice communications on the diver, and suspending the diver from the surface so that depth is positively controlled, and by having an in-water standby diver attend the diver undergoing the treatment at all times.|$|E
30|$|The {{experimental}} {{details and}} <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>are</b> explained in <b>the</b> following sections.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> DKS <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> {{named for}} three {{physicians}} - Paul Damus, Michael Kaye, and H. C. Stansel - who independently reported <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> in <b>the</b> {{literature in the}} 1970s. At that time, <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> used for patients who had TGA with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). By the late 2000s, <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> employed in situations where the right ventricle is bigger than the left ventricle and the left ventricle connects to the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta; examples include double inlet left ventricle, TGA with tricuspid atresia and TGA with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.|$|R
30|$|Methods/results: Sixty {{patients}} {{delivered at}} time, 11 patients underwent premature (four) delivery or spontaneous abortion (seven) in 103 patients with septate uterus. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> performed in 45 due to pregnancy {{loss in the}} first or second trimester of these 35 (80 %) delivered later at time. In 27 patients <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> performed due to infertility and a septum was detected coincidentally and 12 (44 %) delivered at time and two premature, in 21 the septum was detected during C section and 15 delivered later at time, in ten <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> done due to premature delivery and five delivered at time and two prematurely.|$|R
5|$|The series {{features}} two families, {{one in each}} {{half-hour of}} the episode, preparing their family recipe while the professional chefs cook a restaurant {{version of the same}} meal. The family begins by revealing the dish they have selected to cook to the chefs as well as how longer they think it will take to prepare it. The chefs are then given {{the same amount of time}} to create their own version. Once the first cook-off is complete, the second family is brought out, and <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> repeated with their own meal. After the second cook-off, the judges reveal the winning dish from each round. If the family's home cooked meal beats the chefs' professional version, the family wins $25,000; if the chefs win, the family receives $1,000 worth of kitchen supplies.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of Voviyo (wedding songs), sung by women during a Ros, {{is important to}} this community. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> that an elderly lady, usually the yejman (wife of the master of ceremonies, who is known as yejmani) who knows the voviyos, leads the song {{while the rest of}} the women sing along. Only women whose husbands are still living may sing. In ancient times, the wedding songs expressed very lofty sentiments and gave vent to the feelings of the people about the marriage partners and their families, invoking the blessing of God on them.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} some debate within Islam over {{whether it is a}} {{religious}} requirement, circumcision (called khitan) is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males. Islam bases its practice of circumcision on the Genesis 17 narrative, the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, however, it is a tradition established by Islam's prophet Muhammad directly (following Abraham), and so its practice is considered a sunnah (prophet's tradition) and is very important in Islam. For Muslims, circumcision is also a matter of cleanliness, purification and control over one's baser self (nafs). There is no agreement across the many Islamic communities about the age at which circumcision should be performed. It may be done from soon after birth up to about age 15; most often it is performed at around six to seven years of age. The timing can correspond with the boy's completion of his recitation of the whole Quran, with a coming-of-age event such as taking on the responsibility of daily prayer or betrothal. Circumcision may be celebrated with an associated family or community event. Circumcision is recommended for, but is not required of, converts to Islam.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> basic <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> often {{obtained}} from textbooks, and <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> sketchy. Reproducibility {{was important in}} summer preps, so students were required to keep meticulous record books. <b>The</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>were</b> finally collected and published {{for the first time}} in a four-pamphlet set called Organic Chemical Reagents, which quickly sold out. The publishers received submissions from other chemists, which spawned the idea for serial publication, and the first annual volume of Organic Syntheses was thus published in 1921. By then, chemists from other universities and industry were also contributing.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> mostly {{performed}} electively in the outpatient setting by two hospital consultants in {{the early}} pregnancy assessment unit (EPAU). However, in emergency situations of heavy haemorrhage with cardiovascular compromise, <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> {{carried out in the}} gynaecology ward treatment room, accident and emergency (A&E) or in an operating theatre. Pre-procedure vaginal misoprostol was not administered in emergency situations.|$|R
