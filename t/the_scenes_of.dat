5|$|Minton {{played an}} {{important}} role behind <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> the Court as a peacemaker between its two opposing factions. These attempts to keep the peace led Justice Frankfurter to remark that while Minton would never be remembered as a great justice, he would be remembered as a great colleague by his fellow justices.|$|E

Simon photographed the men at sites that had particular significance to their wrongful conviction: <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> misidentification, <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> arrest, <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crime or <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alibi.

5|$|RKO reissued Fantasia {{once more}} on September 1, 1946, with the {{animated}} sequences complete and <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> Taylor, Stokowski, and the orchestra restored but shortened. Its running time was restored to one hour and fifty-five minutes. This edit {{would be the}} standard form for subsequent re-releases, and {{was the basis for}} the 1990 restoration.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> walrus, bowhead whale, and caribou hunting are all real. Because {{the hunting}} season for caribou, polar bear, walrus, and whale {{occur at the}} same time, the {{production}} was forced {{to spend more than}} a year in the Arctic (covering two hunting seasons) {{in order to get the}} necessary footage.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{having been}} {{prompted}} by the new international situation and the recent strike wave in Poland, in September 1988 preliminary talks between government representatives and Solidarity leaders ensued in Magdalenka. Numerous meetings took place involving Wałęsa and the minister of internal affairs, General Czesław Kiszczak among others, {{at that time and}} in the following year, behind <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> the official negotiations conducted then. In November, Wałęsa debated on national TV Alfred Miodowicz, chief of the official trade unions. The encounter enhanced Wałęsa's image.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of the music video, a 45-minute {{documentary}} was released that provided candid glimpses behind <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> the music video's production. Entitled Making Michael Jackson's Thriller, it, like the music video, was shown heavily on MTV for a time and was the top-selling home-video release of all time at one point, with over nine million copies sold. MTV paid $250,000 for the exclusive rights to show the documentary; Showtime paid $300,000 for pay-cable rights; and Vestron Video reportedly paid $500,000 to market the cassette, in a profit participation agreement.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the season}} the team lost five seniors from the roster: guard Eso Akunne, guard Josh Bartelstein (captain), forward Blake McLimans, guard Corey Person and guard Matt Vogrich. The team's {{required}} 10-year dissociation with players {{implicated in the}} University of Michigan basketball scandal ended on May 8, 2013. Bartelstein blogged for the team from October 15, 2010, until April 11, 2013. His blogs from this season were turned into an ebook about the season entitled We On: Behind <b>the</b> <b>Scenes</b> <b>of</b> Michigan's Final Four Run.|$|E
5|$|Goldsman took on {{the project}} as he admired the second I Am Legend film adaptation, The Omega Man. A rewrite was done to {{distance}} the project from the other zombie films inspired by the novel, {{as well as from}} the recently released 28 Days Later, although Goldsman was inspired by <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> a deserted London in the British horror film to create <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> a deserted New York City. A 40-page scene-by-scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006. When delays occurred on Smith's film Hancock, which was scheduled for 2007, it was proposed to switch the actor's films. This meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks: production was given a green light, using Goldsman's script and the outline. Elements from Protosevich's script were introduced, while the crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and solitary confinement. Rewrites continued throughout filming, because of Smith's improvisational skills and Lawrence's preference to keep various scenes silent. The director had watched Jane Campion's film The Piano with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son, and realized that silence could be very effective cinema.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} eighteenth century the {{province}} was <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> a rebellion of the Aymara-speaking population led by Tomás Katari and exacerbated by his assassination in January 1781. It was also <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> a peasant rebellion in 1927.|$|R
50|$|Its central location, vast open space, and the {{collection}} of government buildings have made and continue to make Civic Center <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> massive political rallies. It has been <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> massive anti-war protests and rallies since the Korean War. It was also <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> major moments of the Gay Rights Movement. Activist Harvey Milk held rallies and gave speeches there. After his assassination on November 27, 1978, a massive candlelight vigil was held there. Later, it was <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Night Riots {{in response to the}} lenient sentencing of Dan White, Milk's assassin. Recently, Civic Center was the center point of the Gay Marriage activism, as Mayor Gavin Newsom married couples there.|$|R

5|$|In 2006, {{shortly before}} the U.N. Headquarters {{underwent}} major renovations, Del Toro and Soderbergh shot <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> Guevara speaking to the U.N. General Assembly in 1964. The director wanted to shoot {{the first part of}} The Argentine in Cuba, but was prevented from travelling there by the U.S. government's embargo. Doubling Santa Clara proved to be difficult because it was a certain size and had a certain look. Soderbergh spent four to five months scouting for a suitable replacement, looking at towns in Veracruz/Yucatán before settling on Campeche, which had the elements they needed.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with US News, Riordan said that to write the book, he used his experience of having traveled to the Mediterranean with his family {{as part of a}} Disney-Hyperion promotion {{for the end of the}} Percy Jackson & the Olympians. Many of the tourist destinations he visited were included in the series, but because of the conflicting portrayals of Tartarus in literature, the author said that he appealed to his imagination to write <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> the underworld.|$|E
5|$|In the 2006 modern dress film adaptation, set among gangsters in Melbourne, Fleance (Craig Stott) is {{depicted}} as a teenage boy, looking slightly older than in the original play. He also appears a bit more often, mainly in <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> Act V, where he sneaks on board a truck full of timber and witnesses the death of Macbeth before killing the maid and being directed home by Macduff.|$|E

5|$|Let us {{bring up}} women, not {{to aspire to}} {{advantages}} which the Constitution denies them, but to know and appreciate those which it guarantees them... Men are destined {{to live on the}} stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places before their eyes all <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home is better for the education of women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.|$|E
5|$|Screen {{time was}} divided up equally between the couples {{over the course}} of an episode, though {{occasionally}} some scenes would run longer; in Series 4, Episode 3, <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> Karen clubbing went on for ten uninterrupted minutes. These scenes were also a rarity for location filming; usually filming in public places was done on a Sunday during closing hours but the clubbing scenes in this episode were filmed during opening hours at the Music Box in Manchester. A hand-held camera was used to enhance the frenetic pace.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone along with Dan Sterling. The episode served as both a parody of genetic {{engineering}} and a statement against its potential evils. <b>The</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> Stan getting beat up by his sister were inspired by Parker's real-life childhood experiences with his own sister, who is also named Shelley.|$|E

5|$|The journalists quickly {{decided they}} needed expert advice on {{ballistics}} and explosives, to which end they engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles, GC, a retired British Army {{officer who had}} served as a bomb-disposal officer in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Styles arrived in Gibraltar on 23 March, and immediately went to inspect the car park where Savage had parked the white Renault {{on the day of the}} shootings, after which he walked through the town along what the journalists believed was the IRA members' most likely route. When asked his opinion by the journalists, Styles cast doubt on the authorities' stated reasons for the shootings. He explained to the journalists that, had Savage's white Renault contained a substantial bomb, the weight would have been evident on the vehicle's springs. Styles also felt that the potential bomb was unlikely to have been detonated with a remote detonator on account of the buildings between <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> the shootings and the likelihood that it would be drowned out by other radio signals in the area. Finally, the journalists asked Styles to examine <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> the shootings, including ricochet marks that the soldiers' bullets had left on the pumps at the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> Kirk and Scott {{approaching}} the Enterprise in drydock spanned two pages of script but took forty-five different shots—averaging one shot a day—for the travel pod containing Kirk {{to make its}} flight from the space office complex to the docking ring. Double shifts around the clock were required to finish the effect on time. For close shots of the pod traveling to the Enterprise, close-ups of Shatner and Doohan were composited into the model, while in long shots lookalike puppets were used.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>of</b> Marty McFly skateboarding in {{the film}} {{occurred}} during the infancy of the skateboarding sub-culture and numerous skateboarders, as well as companies in the industry, {{pay tribute to the}} film for its influence in this regard. Examples can be seen in promotional material, in interviews in which professional skateboarders cite the film as an initiation into the action sport, and in the public's recognition of the film's influence.|$|E
