40|$|We propose {{modifications}} to the travel-time models for non-traditional warehouse layouts, Flying-V Fishbone, by incorporating a vertical <b>travel</b> <b>dimension.</b> The Flying-V model determines a cross aisle intersection for every picking aisle, while the Fishbone model determines a single point where the inserted cross aisle intersects {{the side of the}} warehouse. The shape and angle of the cross aisle is unrestricted for the Flying-V layout, while the angle is unrestricted for the Fishbone layout. The resulting non-linear optimization models incorporate Chebychev travel within the picking aisles. We compare both the shape of the aisle and the percent improvement over a traditional warehouse with the results found in previous research that ignores vertical travel. We show that the percent improvement diminishes as the height of the rack increases, with Fishbone maintaining a higher percent improvement over Flying-V. We also show that while the shape of Flying-V can be considerably altered by considering vertical travel, the Fishbone layout often maintains its recommended shape regardless of the height of the rack. We also altered the travel rules for the Flying-V model in order to find simpler designs and obtained near-optimal results. We conclude with recommendations for effective implementation of these two designs...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to the literature on tourists’ perception by evaluating the relationship between destination travel attributes and tourist satisfaction. Using a sample of 140 international tourists exiting Kuala Lumpur Malaysia, the influence of travel attributes on satisfaction and the moderating effect of demographic factors in the relationship between travel attributes and tourist satisfaction were investigated. Partial Least Square (PLS), a variance based structural equation model was employed to analyse the data. The travel attributes had satisfactory predictive relevance and explained the changes in the variance of the endogenous variable tourist satisfaction. All the demographic factors considered moderated the relationship between {{at least one of the}} <b>travel</b> <b>dimensions</b> and tourist satisfaction.

40|$|Emotional {{well-being}} {{has become}} an important societal goal given the rising evidence from psychology research that positive emotions have long-lasting benefits for human development.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the structure, implementation, and application experience of seven different regional Activity-Based Models (ABMs) that share the Coordinated Travel-Regional Activity Modeling Platform (CT-RAMP) design and software platform. The CT-RAMP models {{are characterized by}} a number of features, including a full simulation of travel decisions for discrete households and persons; explicit tracking of time in half-hourly increments and use of time constraints on the generation of travel, as well as explicitly modelled intra-household interactions across a range of activity and <b>travel</b> <b>dimensions.</b> These important features allow for greater behavioral realism in representing the response to numerous transportation policies. The first ABM of the CT-RAMP family was developed in 2004 for the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) located in Columbus, OH, and was adapted for the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) in 2006. The third and forth ABMs were completed i...|$|R
