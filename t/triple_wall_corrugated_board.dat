50|$|Most {{packaging}} for {{the transport}} of pizzas is made of cardboard, because this material is cheap and has many useful properties. Both solid fibre <b>board</b> and single <b>wall</b> <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> are used. The corrugated cardboard in use is often of the E flute size (micro or fine waves with a flute pitch of 1.0 to 1.8 mm), but thicker B flute cardboard with a flute pitch of 2.2 to 3.0 mm are also used. Not only the geometric construction of the cardboard determines {{the stability of the}} box, but also especially the type of paper and its grammage. For the liner mostly containerboard is used {{on the inside of the}} box. This does not only make the box stable, it becomes more resistant against humidity and oil as well.To reduce the space needed to store the packaging to a minimum, the pizza boxes are folded just before use out of flat blanks. The required storage space depends very much on the different thickness of the material.|$|R
50|$|The pizza box is {{supposed}} to allow the transport of a baked pizza with the minimum loss in quality possible. This means the box has two tasks to fulfill that {{are not easy to}} combine: On the one hand, the box should insulate as well as possible against the cold air outside, the occasional wind and heat radiation, {{in order to keep the}} pizza warm. To reduce heat flow the box has to close as firmly as possible to keep the warm air inside. Consumers consider a temperature between 70 and 85 °C to be ideal for pizza consumption. On the other hand, the box should keep the pizza from getting soggy, so that the crust and the covering are crisp on arrival. To ensure this, the condesation caused by the pizza must be let out (airing holes and some diffusion through the cardboard) or absorbed by the box. Pizza boxes made of single <b>wall</b> <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> that are not equipped with additional insulation cool the transported pizza down too far after just ten minutes.|$|R

40|$|<b>Corrugated</b> <b>board</b> is an {{engineering}} structure, whose strength characteristics {{depend on the}} cross–section geometry and the material properties of liner and corrugated medium. Therefore, the board combination (combination of material for preparing <b>corrugated</b> <b>board)</b> of <b>corrugated</b> <b>boards</b> should be optimized with considering the quality characteristics of <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> demanded to achieve the optimum packaging design. The <b>board</b> combinations of <b>corrugated</b> <b>boards</b> can be determined by employing the configuration method for the paperboard stiffness and the basis weight. The results of board combinations can greatly affect the buckling resistance and compression strength of the box. In order to analyze {{the effect of the}} configuration method for the board stiffness and the basis weight on the flexural stiffness of <b>corrugated</b> <b>board,</b> we performed experiments based on cost– and time–consuming procedures. However, by using a simulation method such as finite element analysis (FEA) has the advantages such as saving of the time and cost in experiments and sample production as well as detailed analysis by adjusting several parameters. In the case of the simulation method, the estimation of reliability and reproducibility of the results should be strongly considered. In this study, we observed the strength–optimal design conditions for the <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> combinations by analyzing the flexural stiffness index (FSI). The FEA method was used in the study using the four–point loading conditions. We found that the difference between the FEA result and the test results were approximately 18 – 31 %. However, it was estimated that the variations in FSI estimated by using both methods are similar.

The aim was to create a practical tool for strength analysis of boxes that can be used by <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> box designers. This tool is based on finite element analysis. The first studies concerned testing and analysis of <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> in three-pointbending and evaluation of the bending stiffness and the transverse shear stiffness. The transverse shear stiffness was also measured using a block shear test. It was shown that evaluated bending stiffness agrees with theoretically predicted values. However, evaluation of transverse shear stiffness showed significantly lower values than the predicted values. The predicted values were based on material testing of constituent liners and fluting prior to corrugation. Earlier {{studies have shown that the}} fluting sustains considerable damage at its troughs and crests in the corrugation process and this is probably a major contributing factor to the discrepancy. Furthermore, the block shear method seems to constrain the deformation of the board and consistently produces higher values of the transverse shear stiffness than the three-point-bending test. It is recommended to use the latter method. Further experimental studies involved the construction of rigs for testing <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> panels under compression and cylinders under combined stresses. The panel test rig, furnishing simply supported boundary conditions on all edges, was used to study the buckling behaviour of <b>corrugated</b> <b>board.</b> Post-buckling analysis of an orthotropic plate with initial imperfection predicted failure loads that exceed the experimental values by only 6 - 7 % using the Tsai-Wu failure criterion. It was confirmed, by testing the cylinders that failure of biaxially loaded <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> is not significantly affected by local buckling and that the Tsai-Wu failure criterion is appropriate to use.

Up to triple-wall <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> is accommodated in the finite element model.

40|$|International audienceCreasing is {{a process}} which indents a section of <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> along fold lines to {{facilitate}} a neat fold. Most common failure site in a box made out of <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> is at the folds, where the stiffness is reduced by the creasing operation. Crease depth is an important parameter to be controlled. If the crease is too shallow, the section will crack during folding due to excessive strain on the outer liner. On the other hand, if the crease is too deep, the board may crack during the creasing operation itself or it may fail during handling due to excessive reduction in local strength along the fold line.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Packaging as a {{component}} in the supply chain impacts efficiency and effectiveness. In the interaction between packaging systems and the supply chain, actors place various needs on packaging. These {{can be related to}} infrastructure or product characteristics, business settings or operations. They also depend on the supply chain context, the distribution conditions, the product and packaging types in use. The purpose of the research presented in this thesis is {{to bridge the gap between}} supply chain needs placed on packaging and their satisfaction in the context of developing countries. Three qualitative investigations were conducted. The first was a case study exploring the interactions between the packaging system and the supply chain in developing countries. The second was also a case study about the packaging design and development methods used for fulfilling supply chain needs. The third investigation was a combination of a literature study and interviews to identify various available models and software for <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> and box design and to explore their use for different actors in the <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> packaging supply chain. Supply chain needs placed on secondary packaging in developing countries are identified, described and categorized. This provides new insights for supply chain managers, logisticians and packaging engineers about the interaction between the supply chain and the packaging system in developing countries. For supply chain managers and logisticians, the information and knowledge about supply chains in developing countries can help them to attain and maintain effectiveness and efficiency in such contexts. For packaging engineers, a generic list of needs can serve as input to packaging design and development methods, processes and analysis tools. The thesis also provides a structured design and development method and an analysis tool that can be used to satisfy the needs placed on packaging in supply chains in developing countries. It offers packaging engineers further insights into how product design and development methods and tools can be adapted for packaging systems to satisfy these needs. The thesis contributes to improving the use and development of prediction models and software for <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> and box properties in <b>corrugated</b> <b>board</b> supply chains.
