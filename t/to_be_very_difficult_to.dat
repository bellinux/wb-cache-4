5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E

Flight tests continued without the waist guns and their gunner until the ACh-30BF's were fitted between May and July 1944. Despite modifications, the aircraft still suffered from poor controllability at low speeds and high weights as well as very poor gliding performance. Throughout the flight tests the engines performed satisfactorily in the air, but were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> start in low ambient temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements. Further development was canceled.|$|E

The Hamiltonians to which we know exact solutions, such as the hydrogen atom, the quantum harmonic oscillator and the particle in a box, are too idealized to adequately describe most systems.

500|$|Kikuta finds {{composing}} {{music to}} be natural, [...] "like breathing". He considers {{it to be}} his [...] "vocation", and contrasts it with designing and creating video games, which he calls his [...] "wish" [...] and finds <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> do in comparison to composition. Kikuta does not worry about the style of music that he composes, considering it to only be a tool or method. As a result, his music is frequently composed of combinations of styles mixed together. He is inspired to create his music by things that he has seen, especially while traveling; he credits much of the musical imagery in Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3 as being inspired by several islands in Fiji he has visited. Rather than {{trying to be a}} [...] "pure artist" [...] that creates art for art's sake, Kikuta says that his primary goal in composing is to entertain the listeners. He has not been influenced by other video game composers, though he claims to admire Hitoshi Sakimoto, whom he worked with at Square. He has named Pink Floyd as his single biggest musical influence, and guitarist Allan Holdsworth as the artist he would most like to collaborate with. Kikuta's favorite song that he has composed is [...] "Overture" [...] from Concerto Gate.|$|E

Some of the editing was done in Zappa's living room. On the 1967 and 1968 releases of the album, Zappa was credited as [...] "Francis Vincent Zappa", as Zappa had believed that this was his real name.

Attempts have been made to define jazz from the perspective of other musical traditions, such as European music history or African music. But critic Joachim-Ernst Berendt argues that its terms of reference and its definition should be broader, defining jazz as a [...] "form of art music which originated in the United States through the confrontation of the Negro with European music" [...] and arguing that it differs from European music in that jazz has a [...] "special relationship to time defined as 'swing'", involves [...] "a spontaneity and vitality of musical production in which improvisation plays a role" [...] and contains a [...] "sonority and manner of phrasing which mirror the individuality of the performing jazz musician".

The expression tongue in cheek refers to a statement that is not to be taken entirely seriously – something said or done with subtle ironic or sarcastic humour. A tongue twister is a phrase made specifically <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> pronounce. Aside from being a medical condition, [...] "tongue-tied" [...] means being unable to say what you want due to confusion or restriction. The phrase [...] "cat got your tongue" [...] refers to when a person is speechless. To [...] "bite one's tongue" [...] is a phrase which describes holding back an opinion to avoid causing offence. A [...] "slip of the tongue" [...] refers to an unintentional utterance, such as a Freudian slip. The [...] "gift of tongues" [...] refers to when one is uncommonly gifted to be able to speak in a foreign language, often as a type of spiritual gift.

Then he held her by her hands, and looked into her face, and she could see how strangely he was altered. She thought that she would hardly have known him, had she not been sure that it was he. She herself was also changed. Who can bear sorrow without such change, till age has fixed the lines of the face, or till care has made them hard and unmalleable? But the effect on her was as nothing to that which grief, remorse, and desolation had made on him. He had had no child with him, no sister, no friend. Bozzle had been his only refuge,--a refuge not adapted to make life easier to such a man as Trevelyan; and he,--in spite of the accusations made by himself against his wife, within his own breast hourly since he had left her,--had found it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> satisfy his own conscience.

And then how peculiar were the domestic traits which he told! What was Mr. Crawley to say to a man who had taught his own children to call their mother Thais? Of Thais Mr. Crawley did know something, and he forgot to remember that perhaps Mr. Toogood knew less.
