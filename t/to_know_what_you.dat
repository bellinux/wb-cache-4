500|$|To ensure {{accuracy}} in scriptwriting, the serial employs {{a team of}} researchers to advise writers on nursing issues and health service politics. One medical advisor was given a cameo role in the series as an orthopaedic surgeon, and another, recovery nurse Rachel Carter, appears in Holby City as a scrub nurse. Another adviser, a heart surgeon, has occasionally left open-heart surgery to advise Holby City writers over the telephone. The programme utilises surgeons from different disciplines, who check scripts for accuracy. Carter believes this is particularly important in case viewers copy procedures they have seen in the show, such as CPR. Series star Amanda Mealing commented: [...] "We pride ourselves on being realistic. You need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are doing and why. It is a complex and foreign thing to act out an operation. For training, I watched a number of real ones." [...] Cast members are taught how to give realistic injections, monitor blood pressure and check a pulse, and some are given the opportunity to observe procedures in real hospitals. Original cast member George Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital in preparation for his role as Anton Meyer, while Edward MacLiam observed laparoscopic surgery being performed before joining the cast as Greg Douglas in series twelve.|$|E

"Le diplôme": David Gervais {{says that}} he doesn't only think about [...] "the diploma", he wants <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> know how to do, and maybe he can arrange a little something, if you..., but, embarrassed about what he appears to say, adds it's not in that sense... not sexual.

2500|$|Termination: If {{you don't}} want your subject <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are doing, you simply {{distract}} their attention, usually by some appropriate remark, and casually terminate. Sometimes they remark, [...] "What did you say? I got absentminded {{there for a}} moment and wasn't paying attention to anything." [...] This is slightly distressing to the subjects and indicative of the fact that their attention was so focused and fixated on the peculiar hand stimuli that they were momentarily entranced so they did not hear what was said.|$|E

2500|$|In another interview, Amos explained, [...] " [...] {{said to me}} in March when I {{was visiting}} him in New York, 'I’ve always wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would do with a {{seasonal}} album. You’re a minister’s daughter so you grew up with this stuff, but you’re also a feminist.' A lot of this music was written when things were really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, if that makes any sense. Because he and I were talking about music that goes back, a more pagan style of music where {{there seems to be}} a place where goddesses were honoured if you go back into antiquity. And he said, 'I’d really like to see you have a perspective on the carols and write some of your own.'" ...|$|E
