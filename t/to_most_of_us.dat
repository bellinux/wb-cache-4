500|$|Yankee outfielder Bob Cerv {{recalled}} of the rivalry, [...] "I {{always remember}} the games when Pierce and Ford would lock up. Those were great ballgames – 2–1, 3–2. Usually, if they'd get beat, Mantle would {{hit a home}} run." [...] New York outfielder Hank Bauer noted, [...] "The guy who gave me the most problem – I know he gave 'em to me, and I think he gave 'em <b>to</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> – was Billy Pierce." [...] Tommy Byrne, who pitched for the Yankees {{for most of his}} career from 1943 to 1957 but played for Chicago {{for the first half of}} the 1953 season, said, [...] "Pierce was sneaky fast, a good breaking ball. He was tough. For several years there he was right up there on a par with Ford." [...] Sportswriter Bill Madden recalled in 1982, [...] "Always it was Pierce against Whitey Ford and always, to me, that seemed like an unfair matchup. They were your classic 'stylish' left-handers, equal in guile and guts, but Ford had those howitzers of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Bill Skowron and Hank Bauer behind him, while Pierce came armed with popguns. Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and Minnie Miñoso supported him with hustle and chink singles and I always marveled at the fact that Pierce could duel Ford on even terms despite those odds." [...] Ironically, the Yankees tried to acquire Pierce in the early 1950s when Ford was in the military, but White Sox general manager Frank Lane proposed that New York give up Bauer, first baseman Joe Collins and second baseman Jerry Coleman in exchange for Pierce and outfielder Al Zarilla, and ended talks when Yankees GM George Weiss suggested the Yankees send minor leaguers instead.|$|E

2500|$|Shafran also {{rejects the}} literalism of Christian fundamentalism. He writes, [...] "Nor is 'Biblical literalism' a Jewish approach. Many are the p’sukim (verses) {{that do not}} mean what a simple reading would yield." [...] To Shafran, the Jewish oral {{tradition}} {{is the key to}} the true meaning of the Torah's words. [...] "There are multiple levels of deeper meanings inaccessible <b>to</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> The words of Breishis (Genesis, Ashkenazi Hebrew) and the Midrashim thereon hide infinitely more than they reveal. It is clear that the Torah describes the creation of the universe as the willful act of HaKodosh Boruch Hu (the Holy One), and describes creation as having unfolded in stages. But details are hardly provided." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 9, the Defense Intelligence Agency {{received}} {{information from}} a source considered reliable, predicting that [...] "the situation is presently more critical than previously reported" [...] and postulating a 50% chance Iraq would invade Iran. An April 11 CIA analysis is more blunt: [...] "Evidence indicates that Iraq had probably planned to initiate a major military move against Iran {{with the aim of}} toppling the Khomeini regime"—and had [...] "sought to engage the Kuwaitis to act as intermediary in obtaining United States approval and support for Iraqi military action against Iran." [...] Carter himself has confirmed that fear the U.S. hostages would be executed if Iraq attacked was one reason he approved a failed rescue mission on April 24. In light of these alerts, the claims of senior Carter administration officials involved with Iran—including White, Naas, Precht, and head of the National Security Council (NSC)'s Iran desk Gary Sick—that they were surprised by the invasion require some explanation. In all likelihood, these warnings went unheeded because [...] "those who doubted they amounted to compelling evidence won the argument. In effect, they were right. Only in early July did U.S. observers note the movement of Iraqi assets out of garrison with war-related 'basic loads' of ammunition" [...] and it was not until September 17 that the CIA indicated [...] "the intensification of border clashes between Iran and Iraq has reached a point where a serious conflict is now a distinct possibility." [...] Even then, as recounted by State Department official W. Nathaniel Howell, U.S. officials remained unsure what to make of Saddam's intentions: [...] "We all followed Saddam's actions and rhetoric closely but most people I knew tended to believe he was posturing." [...] When the invasion came on September 22, [...] "it was unclear whether Saddam had simply fallen into a rage following a smaller skirmish." [...] White recalled: [...] "The outbreak of war did, in fact, come as a surprise <b>to</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> because a decent portion of Iraq's ground forces were still in garrison. The hasty movement of the remaining units up to the front immediately after the beginning of major hostilities was the activity that tended to nudge me toward the abrupt scenario in which Saddam ordered the attack before all military preparations had been completed." [...] Thus, in the view of Chris Emery, [...] "it is unlikely that the United States was ever in possession of clear evidence of Saddam's intention to invade Iran. Although the Carter administration drastically underestimated the scale of Saddam's plans, the disorganized and apparently impetuous nature of the invasion, with much of the Iraqi army still in garrison, and occurring in the context of border skirmishes and aggressive propaganda, muddied the waters for U.S. observers." ...|$|E
