5|$|During World War II, the Coast Guard was {{transferred}} to the Department of the Navy and as such many men saw action in said conflict. During the invasion of Saipan, which began on June 15, 1944, Valentin R. Fernandez, a landing craft coxswain, was awarded a Silver Lifesaving Medal for maneuvering a Marine landing party ashore under constant Japanese attack. The first known Hispanic-American Coast Guardsman to be awarded with a Bronze Star Medal was Louis Rua, whose craft, a U.S. Army large tug en route to the Philippines, went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>of</b> another ship which had been torpedoed by enemy action and helped saved 277 survivors from the abandoned ship, while serving aboard a U.S. Army large tug en route to the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|For all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was {{by nature}} neither a bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching {{inadvertently}} led to attacks on Jews; a fanatical French monk named Rudolf was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland, Cologne, Mainz, Worms and Speyer, with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>of</b> the Holy Land. Bernard, the Archbishop of Cologne and the Archbishop of Mainz were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany {{to deal with}} the problem and quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.|$|E

5|$|Pliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was {{in command}} of the Roman fleet at Misenum, and had {{meanwhile}} decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue. Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>of</b> Rectina's party.|$|E
5|$|Stanley Frederick Gibbs, GC (2 January 1909 – 3 March 1991) was an Australian {{shipping}} clerk and an exchange {{recipient of the}} George Cross, the highest civil decoration for heroism in the United Kingdom and formerly in the Commonwealth.

He managed to fend off the shark by striking at it with his legs and fists and, with the assistance of a friend, pulled Allum clear of the water. Although Alllum died from his injuries, Gibbs was publicly praised by the coroner and local community leaders for his actions, and was subsequently awarded the Albert Medal.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{eyewitness account}} of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian Tacitus.

5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from their mothers. Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>of</b> hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E

In March 1901 he and his backers purchased a majority of the shares of the DR and, in September 1901, took over the B and the GN With the companies under his control, Yerkes established the UERL to raise funds to build the tube railways and to electrify the DR. The UERL was capitalised at £5million with the majority of shares sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which raised a total of £18million by 1903 (equivalent to approximately £ today) for use across all of the UERL's projects.|$|E

5|$|Paskevich, who {{observed}} the artillery duel from Fort 55, {{became convinced that}} his Polish counterpart would not come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>of</b> Fort 56. Initially hesitant, he finally ordered Russian infantry to attack Fort 56 around 10:00. The attack {{was carried out by}} 13 infantry battalions (ca. 6,900 men) from columns commanded by General Lüders and Martinov. The forces of Lüders stormed the obstacles and crossed the stockade, but Polish defenders met them with rifle volleys from within the fort, and the attack was repelled. Lüders quickly ordered his second line (2,300 men) to advance as well. The new forces were twice pushed back into the moat by the commander of the northern wing, Maj. Franciszek Biernacki, but in the end the Polish defenders were overpowered and had to withdraw further into the fort. The Russians followed, but their battalions lost cohesion, which allowed the numerically inferior force under Biernacki to hold out inside the fort and cover the flank of the central wing.|$|E
5|$|Under the papacies of {{successive}} Popes {{smaller groups}} of Crusaders continued {{to travel to}} the Eastern Mediterranean to fight the Muslims and aid the Crusader States in the early 12thcentury. The third decade saw campaigns by Fulk V of Anjou, the Venetians, and Conrad III of Germany and the foundation of the Knights Templar. The period also saw the innovation of granting indulgences to those who opposed papal enemies, and this marked the beginning of politically motivated Crusades. The loss of Aleppo in 1128 and Edessa (Urfa) in 1144 to Imad ad-Din Zengi, governor of Mosul, led to preaching for what subsequently became known as the Second Crusade. King Louis VII and ConradIII led armies from France and Germany to Jerusalem and Damascus without winning any major victories. As in the First Crusade, the preaching led to attacks on Jews including massacres in the Rhineland, Cologne, Mainz, Worms and Speyer amid claims that the Jews were not contributing financially <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>of</b> the Holy Land. Bernard of Clairvaux, who had encouraged the Second Crusade in his preaching, was so perturbed by the violence that he journeyed from Flanders to Germany to deal with the problem.|$|E
5|$|When Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, George's {{first cousin}} (their mothers were sisters), was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the British {{government}} offered political asylum to the Tsar and his family, but worsening {{conditions for the}} British people, and fears that revolution might come to the British Isles, led George {{to think that the}} presence of the Romanovs would be seen as inappropriate. Despite the later claims of Lord Mountbatten of Burma that Prime Minister Lloyd George was opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>of</b> the Russian imperial family, the letters of Lord Stamfordham suggest that it was GeorgeV who opposed the idea against the advice of the government. Advanced planning for a rescue was undertaken by MI1, a branch of the British secret service, but because of the strengthening position of the Bolshevik revolutionaries and wider difficulties with the conduct of the war, the plan was never put into operation. The Tsar and his immediate family remained in Russia, where they were murdered by Bolsheviks in 1918. The following year, Nicholas's mother (George's aunt) Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) {{and other members of the}} extended Russian imperial family were rescued from the Crimea by a British warship.|$|E
