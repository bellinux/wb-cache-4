5|$|The soundtrack for Halo 3 was {{released}} on November 20, 2007. O'Donnell noted he wanted {{to bring back the}} themes from the original game to help tie together the end of the trilogy. The tracks are presented, similarly to <b>the</b> , <b>in</b> <b>a</b> suite form. Unlike previous soundtracks, where much of the music had been synthesized on computer, the soundtrack for Halo 3 was recorded using a 60-piece orchestra, along with a 24-voice chorus. The final soundtrack was recorded by the Northwest Sinfonia at Studio X in Seattle, Washington. The soundtracks were bundled and released as a box set in December 2008. A soundtrack for Halo 3: ODST {{was released}} alongside the game and included many of the tracks from the game.|$|E
25|$|Behind the scenes, Miles and Teo {{took the}} tapes of <b>the</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> Silent Way {{sessions}} and transformed some beautiful, folk-tinged, melody-driven sets into two exquisite, beguiling and otherworldly pieces of music. Using techniques that pre-dated {{the proliferation of}} tape loops, cut-ups, edits and sequencing in rock, pop, hip hop and dance music, Miles and Teo took apart the original recording and reassembled them outside of any traditional or accepted jazz structure or melodic framework. This idea of taking jazz away from its birth, genesis and flowering as a live art and into the studio would soon become standard practice, but in 1969 it was groundbreaking.|$|E

25|$|Typically, {{the justices}} hear oral {{arguments}} {{each morning and}} meet that afternoon for private deliberation of the cases heard that morning. The member designated to write <b>the</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> case opinion directs discussion of it by asking the justice seated at the conference table to the right for comments. The justices then comment in turn with the member designated to write the opinion speaking last. This discussion and debate provide the opinion writer guidance to prepare an opinion reflecting the views {{of a majority of}} the justices. Once a justice has completed a draft of his opinion, copies are circulated to {{the other members of the}} court and the Court Reporter. The court meets again before the next session to review and revise the circulated drafts until they receive final approval. Opinions are made public on the last day of each session, usually the very next session after argument, and are published in the Virginia Reports.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the [...] season the Sauber team, {{planning}} their Formula One debut with Mercedes backing for the following year, invoked a clause in Schumacher's contract that stated that if Mercedes entered Formula One, Schumacher would drive for them. It was eventually agreed that Schumacher would stay with Benetton, Peter Sauber said that [...] " [...] didn't want to drive for us. Why would I have forced him?". The year was dominated by the Williams of Nigel Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, featuring powerful Renault engines, semi-automatic gearboxes and active suspension to control the car's ride height.

500|$|The album's {{style and}} themes are {{exemplified}} by the bookending track [...] "Peace Go with You, Brother", with Scott-Heron's bluesy, jazzy vocals and Afrocentric lyrics accompanied by Jackson's soulful piano arrangements. It features a dreamy, moody soundscape, produced by Jackson's Rhodes electric piano, which evokes <b>the</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> Silent Way-era jazz of Miles Davis. [...] "Peace Go with You, Brother" [...] has Scott-Heron criticizing the selfishness of certain members of his generation, {{as well as people}} for forgetting their common humanity. The song continues to examine the significance of a person's cultural roots, regardless of where they prove to blossom. [...] "Rivers of My Fathers" [...] is the album's longest track and features drummer Bob Adams' swing-style drum rim shots and pianist Jackson’s wide, blocky chords, play in a blue-influenced style. Scott-Heron uses the water motif, a common metaphor in African-American culture, to evoke feelings of home and freedom and represent faith, amid the frustrations of a modern black man. As the opening verse and chorus suggest, [...] "Looking for {{a way out of this}} confusion/I'm looking for a sign, carry me home/Let me lay down by a stream and let me be miles from everything/Rivers of my fathers, could you carry me home." [...] The narrator beseeches the [...] "river" [...] to deliver him home, which is revealed at the last seconds of the song as Scott-Heron silently whispers [...] "Africa".|$|E
30|$|We {{observe that}} the {{distribution}} functions for the A 5 scenario approach large probabilities faster {{than those for}} the A 6 scenario. This means that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>A</b> 5 scenario, a larger fraction of CAMs is received from the near vicinity than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>A</b> 6 scenario. While 90 % of the CAMs are received from other vehicles within a distance of up to 600 m <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>A</b> 5 scenario, this 90 % quantile is about 650 m <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>A</b> 6 scenario. The reason for the difference {{is the fact that}} <b>the</b> eight lanes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>A</b> 5 scenarios cause a larger channel load than <b>the</b> four lanes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>A</b> 6 scenario.

[...] His works received several local performances during this time, including a performance of his Suite in B Minor in 1933 by the Maganini Chamber Symphony at Greenwich’s Masonic Temple. [...] Ide’s Piano Sonata in A was also premiered in 1933 by his pianist friend John Kirkpatrick, at <b>the</b> , <b>in</b> <b>a</b> concert celebrating the composer’s 60th birthday. [...] Ide's Symphony in A Minor was recorded by the Chicago Symphony in 1932, but never performed in concert.

[...] The orchestra performed in his operettas, the most well-remembered of which is The Pied Piper, two of whose numbers were recorded privately by the school orchestra after his death.|$|E
