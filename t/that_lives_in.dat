5|$|A key {{stress on}} both {{freshwater}} and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution, {{the building of}} dams, removal of water for use by humans, {{and the introduction of}} exotic species. An example of a fish that has become endangered because of habitat change is the pallid sturgeon, a North American freshwater fish <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> rivers damaged by human activity.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010, Linguswamy's Paiyaa released. A romantic road-trip film, {{featuring}} a blockbuster album by Yuvan Shankar Raja, {{it was very}} successful. For the first time, he enacted a character <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> an urban area. He said that he accepted the film because he desperately wanted to play a cool dude on screen. Karthi's performances in Aayirathil Oruvan and Paiyaa earned him further nominations at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Actor category. Both films were dubbed into Telugu as Yuganiki Okkadu and Aawara, respectively, and were successful.|$|E
50|$|The first tribe was the Mipedians, which {{consisted}} of lizard-like creatures <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the Overworld deserts. The second was the Danians, which included ant-like creatures <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the Underworlds Mount Pillar location.|$|R
25|$|Several {{life history}} forms of Arctic {{grayling}} occur: fluvial populations <b>that</b> <b>live</b> and spawn <b>in</b> rivers; lacustrine populations <b>that</b> <b>live</b> and spawn <b>in</b> lakes; and potamodromous populations <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> lakes and spawn in tributary streams.|$|R
50|$|The term aquatic can {{in theory}} {{be applied to}} animals <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> either fresh water (fresh water animals) or salt water (marine animals). However, the {{adjective}} marine is most commonly used for animals <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> saltwater, i.e. in oceans, seas, etc.|$|R
5|$|Nests may be {{protected}} from physical threats such as flooding and overheating by elaborate nest architecture. Workers of Cataulacus muticus, an arboreal species <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> plant hollows, respond to flooding by drinking water inside the nest, and excreting it outside. Camponotus anderseni, which nests in the cavities of wood in mangrove habitats, deals with submergence under water by switching to anaerobic respiration.|$|E
5|$|The {{variegated}} fairywren (Malurus lamberti) is a fairywren <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> diverse habitats across most of Australia. Four subspecies are recognised. In {{a species}} that exhibits sexual dimorphism, the brightly coloured breeding male has chestnut shoulders and azure crown and ear coverts, while non-breeding males, females and juveniles have predominantly grey-brown plumage, although females of the subspecies rogersi and dulcis (previously termed lavender-flanked fairywren) have mainly blue-grey plumage.|$|E
5|$|While an Australian Cattle Dog {{generally}} works silently, it will bark {{in alarm}} or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking {{can be a}} sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> a pack with other dogs.|$|E

He is survived by two daughters <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> New England and two sons <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> Florida. Many of his grandchildren and great-grand children still <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the New York area.|$|R

5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Scarygirl, {{a young girl}} with an eye patch, a sewn-shut mouth and a hook-capped tentacle for one arm. The girl, an orphan, was raised and cared for by Blister, an intelligent, mustached octopus that built the girl a tree house to live in. Plagued by recurring nightmares that featured a mysterious man, the girl consults Bunnyguru, a rabbit <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> {{the bottom of the}} tree where the girl makes her home. Bunniguru offers a vision of a city far away from the girl's home. The girl is then sent by Blister into a forest to investigate why the Tree of Life is losing its leaves, where she discovers that one of the keepers of the forest has been kidnapped and taken to the city from Bunnyguru's vision, and becomes tasked with seeing to the keeper of the forest's safe return.|$|E
5|$|Sea Mither, or Mither of the Sea, is {{a mythical}} being of Orcadian {{folklore}} <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> the sea during summer, when she confines the demonic nuckelavee {{to the ocean}} depths. Each spring she battles with her arch-enemy Teran, another spirit of Orcadian legend capable of causing severe winter storms, {{to gain control of}} the seas and the weather. Eventually Sea Mither overcomes Teran and sends him to the depths of the ocean, but the effort of keeping him confined there along with her other benevolent labours during the summer exhaust her, until in the autumn Teran takes advantage of her weakness to wrest control from her once again.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasitic}} trematode {{example is}} seen in a terrestrial setting. Leucochloridium is a genus of flatworm (phylum Platyhelminthes) which matures in the intestine of songbirds. Their eggs pass out of the bird in the feces and are then taken in by Succinea, a terrestrial snail <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> moist environments. The eggs develop into larvae inside this intermediate host, and then must {{find their way into}} the digestive system of a suitable bird. The problem here is that these birds do not eat snails, so the sporocyst must find some way of manipulating its future host into eating it. Unlike related species, these parasites are brightly colored and able to move in a pulsating manner. A sporocyst sac forces its way into the snail's eye stalks, and pulsates at high speed, enlarging the tentacle in the process. It also affects the host's behavior: the snail moves towards light, which it usually avoids. These combined factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous, such that they are soon eaten by a hungry songbird. The snail then regenerates its tentacles, and Leucochloridium carries on with its life cycle.|$|E

25|$|Hyrax Hill {{is named}} after the hyrax, a small mammal <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> rocky areas. Hyraxes were once common in the rocky crevasses of Hyrax Hill, but their numbers have dropped in recent years due to the rapid {{urbanization}} of the surrounding area.|$|E

It also has the legend Por la razón o la fuerza (By reason or by force).|$|E
40|$|Animals <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> {{different}} altitudes {{are exposed}} to different environmental conditions. Among others, ambient temperature, precipitation and availability of resources change along an elevational gradient. An adaptation of vertebrates to these conditions causes that in populations or species <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> higher altitudes individual ecological traits evolves to a different degree than <b>in</b> those <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> lower altitudes. Studies suggest <b>that</b> vertebrates <b>that</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> higher altitudes usually have shorter active and breeding season, reach larger body size and weight, have slower growth, have smaller clutches or litters, mature at later age and live longer. However, almost in all traits we can find opposite trends. In all vertebrate groups similar changes in traits occur. However, some traits aren`t explored in all groups, for example grow of birds and mammals. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R
