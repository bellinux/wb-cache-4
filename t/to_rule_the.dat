5|$|The Mahabharata traces Prithu's lineage from Vishnu.The Almighty Vishnu {{created a}} human named Virajas <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>the</b> earth and bring {{order to the}} Humans.

5|$|A {{member of}} the Greater Poland branch of the House of Piast as the only son of Duke Przemysł I and the Silesian princess Elisabeth, he was born posthumously; for this reason he was brought up at the court of his uncle Bolesław the Pious and {{received}} his own district <b>to</b> <b>rule,</b> <b>the</b> Duchy of Poznań in 1273. Six years later, {{after the death of}} his uncle, he also obtained the Duchy of Kalisz.|$|E
5|$|After Actium and {{the defeat}} of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a {{position}} <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>the</b> entire Republic under an unofficial principate—but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains. He did so by courting the Senate and the people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, appearing that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy. Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the Senate.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of John Sigismund, the Diet of Transylvania elected Christopher's younger brother, Stephen Báthory, voivode (or ruler) on 25 May 1571.

5|$|Although it was {{intended}} for Magnus and Olaf <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>the</b> kingdom jointly without division, in practice Olaf ruled over Viken (the south-eastern part of Norway), while Magnus controlled the Uplands and Trøndelag (the middle parts of Norway) along with Western Norway and Northern Norway. Despite of this division, {{there are no signs}} of hostility between the brothers, and their relationship appears to have been peaceful.|$|E

Leo of Cilicia besieged Antioch to assert Raymond-Roupen's claim. Bohemond made an alliance with Az-Zahir Ghazi, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo, and Kaykaus I, the Seljuq sultan of Rum, who forced the Armenian troops to return to Cilicia.|$|E

5|$|Caracalla's {{official}} portrayal as sole emperor marks a {{break from}} the detached images of the philosopher-emperors who preceded him: his close-cropped haircut is that of a soldier, his pugnacious scowl a realistic and threatening presence. This rugged soldier-emperor, an iconic archetype, was adopted by most of the following emperors, such as Maximinus Thrax, who were dependent on the support of the troops <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>the</b> empire.|$|E
5|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, creatures known as Sarnathians ruled the Earth, {{centring}} their values on torture of other creatures that {{were opposed to}} their rule. Their aim was <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>the</b> universe using a mysterious orb that granted them great power. Thousands of years later, the orb became too powerful and eventually caused a tear in the inter-dimensional fabric of the Realm of Reality and the Realm of Unreality, thus rendering the Sarnathians extinct.|$|E

5|$|Alvear ordered Saavedra to move {{immediately}} to Buenos Aires, {{to close the}} case. He arrived to the city in time, and Alvear was sympathetic to his situation. However, Alvear {{was forced to resign}} a few days later, before being able <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>the</b> case. The Buenos Aires Cabildo, the interim government, restored Saavedra's military rank and honours, but the rule was abolished by Ignacio Álvarez Thomas, the following supreme director. He moved then to the countryside, to live with his brother Luis. He kept requesting to the government the restoration of his rank.|$|E
5|$|Andrew II {{decided to}} return home, leaving the crusaders' camp with Hugh I and Bohemond IV in early 1218. Although {{military}} action was suspended after their departure, the crusaders restored fortifications at Caesarea and Atlit. After new troops arrived from the Holy Roman Empire in April, they decided to invade Egypt. They elected John supreme commander, giving him the right <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>the</b> land they would conquer. His leadership was primarily nominal, since he could rarely impose his authority on an army of troops from many countries.|$|E

5|$|Before his {{departure}} for the Holy Land, Henry of Champagne had bequeathed the Counties of Champagne and Brie to his brother, Theobald, should he die without issue. Although Alice {{and her younger}} sister, Philippa, survived their father, Philip II of France invested their uncle, Theobald III, with Champagne and Brie in January 1198. Theobald III died on 24 May 1201, leaving Champagne and Brie to his posthumous son, Theobald IV, under the regency of his mother, Blanche of Navarre. However, Theobald IV's position was not secure as Alice and Philippa, both born while their father was count, could challenge a posthumous son's right <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>the</b> counties.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} the book was written, Paraguay was under the {{dictatorship}} of Alfredo Stroessner, who went on <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>the</b> country even longer than Francia did. Many consider the book {{to be at least}} in part a thinly disguised attack on Stroessner who used methods similar to Francia’s to achieve and maintain the effective control of the country, including the swift elimination of opposition, the employment of torture and intolerance of dissent. In its portrayal of Francia and criticism of Stroessner, I, the Supreme belongs to the genre of novelas de dictadores or dictator novels, and also to the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The book was first published in Spanish in 1974, and in English (translation by Helen Lane) in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Following the hasty {{departure}} of PedroI, Brazil {{was left with}} a five-year-old boy as head of state. With no precedent to follow, the Empire was {{faced with the prospect}} of a period of more than twelve years without a strong executive, as, under the constitution, PedroII would not attain his majority and begin exercising authority as Emperor until 2 December 1843. A regency was elected <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>the</b> country in the interim. Because the Regency held few of the powers exercised by an emperor and was completely subordinated to the General Assembly, it could not fill the vacuum at the apex of Brazil's government.|$|E
