5|$|An {{individual}} {{identified as}} Mac Ragnaill (son of Ragnall) by <b>the</b> <b>annals</b> {{may have been}} Ragnall's son, though no name is given. In 942 Mac Ragnaill led a raid on Downpatrick, but within a week {{he was killed by}} Matudán, Overking of Ulster. <b>The</b> <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters call Mac Ragnaill a jarl, but <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of Ulster call him a king. <b>The</b> <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters also suggests he and his fellow plunderers came from an island.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters {{records that}} Brian and Máel Sechnaill united their forces, and {{according}} to <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of Ulster, they met the Leinster-Dublin army at Glenmama on Thursday, 30 December 999.

5|$|The {{following}} year, <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of Tigernach {{states that}} Echmarcach succeeded Ímar. <b>The</b> <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters specifies that Ímar was driven from the kingship by Echmarcach, {{who was then}} elected king by the Dubliners. After this point in Ímar's life, all that is known for certain is that he died in 1054, as recorded by <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of Ulster and the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch Cé. Nevertheless, since these sources style Ímar in Gaelic rí Gall ("king of the foreigners"), there may be evidence to suggest that, when Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster (died 1072) drove Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, Diarmait reinstalled Ímar as king.|$|E

5|$|Whatever the {{circumstances}} of Domnall's accession, the Uí Chennselaig regime in Dublin was short-lived. <b>The</b> <b>Annals</b> of Inisfallen, <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters, and the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, all reveal that, within the year, Domnall died after a brief illness, with the latter two sources specifying that he succumbed after three nights of sickness. <b>The</b> <b>Annals</b> of Inisfallen and <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of Ulster accord him the title King of Dublin, and make no mention of any connection with the Leinster kingship. Upon Domnall's demise, Toirdelbach had his own son, Muirchertach (died 1119), appointed King of Dublin. In so doing, Toirdelbach reinforced his authority in Dublin, and followed a precedent started by Domnall's grandfather, in which a claimant to the high-kingship of Ireland installed his own heir to the kingship of Dublin.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{basically}} only one record which give some detail on the kingdoms of Singapura - <b>the</b> Malay <b>Annals</b> written during <b>the</b> heyday of Melaka and re-compiled in 1612 by the Johor court.

As no specific date is given in <b>the</b> Malay <b>Annals,</b> <b>the</b> chronology {{of the history of the}} kingdom of Singapura as set out in <b>the</b> Malay <b>Annals</b> was worked out by calculating from the date of death of Parameswara given in <b>the</b> Ming <b>Annals.</b> While various aspects of the accounts of the Melaka and Johor sultanates given in <b>the</b> Malay <b>Annals</b> are relatively accurate, the same could not be said for the kingdom of Singapura for which there is little corroborating evidence for large part of its accounts. [...] Historians are therefore generally in doubt over the historicity of the kingdom as described in <b>the</b> semi-historical Malay <b>Annals,</b> nevertheless some consider Singapura to be a significant polity that existed between the decline of Srivijaya and the rise of Melaka.

5|$|In 1052, Diarmait drove Echmarcach from Dublin. The {{event is}} {{documented}} by <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters, <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of Tigernach, <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of Ulster, and Chronicon Scotorum. These annalistic accounts indicate that, although Diarmait's conquest evidently {{began with a}} mere raid upon Fine Gall, this action further escalated into the seizure of Dublin itself. Following several skirmishes fought around the town's central fortress, the aforesaid accounts report that Echmarcach fled overseas, whereupon Diarmait assumed the kingship. With Diarmait's conquest, Norse-Gaelic Dublin ceased to be an independent power in Ireland; and when Diarmait and his son, Murchad, died about twenty years later, Irish rule had been exercised over Fine Gall and Dublin in a degree unheard of before. In consequence of Echmarcach's expulsion, Dublin effectively became the provincial capital of Leinster, with the town's remarkable wealth and military power at Diarmait's disposal.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{consider}} that some biographical—or autobiographical—texts are important historical documents.

5|$|Not {{long after}} his {{intrusion}} into the Islesperhaps in 1113 or 1114Domnall {{appears to have}} been either driven out by force, or drawn back to Ireland in an attempt to capitalise on Muirchertach's failing health. This would appear to have been about the point when Amlaíb mac Gofraid began his own forty-year reign in the Isles. The latter, who apparently spent a considerable part of his childhood at the court of Henry I, King of England (died 1135), may well have enjoyed the English king's assistance in assuming control of the Isles, and perhaps precipitated Domnall's departure. Whatever the cause for Domnall's return to Ireland, he certainly predeceased his rival uncle, and was killed by Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht (died 1156), as <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of Inisfallen, the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch Cé, <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of the Four Masters, the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach, and <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of Ulster, all report Domnall's death {{at the hands of the}} Connachta in 1115. In fact, Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair had invaded Thomond earlier that year, and <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of Tigernach elaborates that he had installed Domnall as King of Thomond at that point. This source further reveals that Domnall had afterwards turned against Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, who in turn invaded Thomond and had Domnall eliminated.|$|E
5|$|Surviving Pictish {{sources for}} the period are few, limited to king lists, the {{original}} of which was prepared in the early 720s, {{and a number of}} accounts relating to the foundation of St Andrews, then called Cennrígmonaid. Beyond Pictland, the principal sources are the Irish annals, of which <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of Ulster and <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of Tigernach are the most reliable. These include materials from an annal kept at the monastery of Iona in Scotland. Óengus and the Picts appear occasionally in Welsh sources, such as the Annales Cambriae, and more frequently in Northumbrian sources, of which the Continuation of Bede's chronicle and the Historia Regum Anglorum attributed to Symeon of Durham are the most important.|$|E

5|$|In 1064, Echmarcach {{seems to}} have {{accompanied}} by Donnchad upon a pilgrimage to Rome. By this time the two {{may well have been}} of an advanced age, and both appear to have died in the city soon afterwards. Surviving sources give conflicting dates for Echmarcach's passing, and it is uncertain whether he died in 1064 or 1065. <b>The</b> <b>Annals</b> of Inisfallen, <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of Loch Cé, and <b>the</b> <b>Annals</b> of Ulster indicate that he died in 1064. The eleventh-century Chronicon of Marianus Scotus (died 1082) records that Echmarcach died in 1065, in a statement which implies that Echmarcach and Donnchad travelled to Rome together. Donnchad himself {{seems to have}} died in 1064, as a multitude of sources report his pilgrimage to Rome and demise that year. Several of these sources appear to indicate that Donnchad died at Santo Stefano Rotondo, an ancient basilica on the Caelian Hill. This building was an important place of pilgrimage to contemporaries, and apparently housed both Echmarcach and Donnchad before they died. Pilgrimages such as those of Echmarcach and Donnchad were not unheard of amongst high-ranking Gaelic and Norse-Gaelic contemporaries, and several such high-status figures are known to have perished undertaking pilgrimages of their own to Rome. If Echmarcach's father was indeed Ragnall mac Gofraid, and if Echmarcach had been born only a few years before his father's death, Echmarcach would have thus been about sixty-five when he himself was laid to rest.|$|E
