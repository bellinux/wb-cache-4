5|$|The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regards {{legislation}} as {{an indispensable}} means for realising the rights which {{is unlikely to}} be limited by resource constraints. The enacting of anti-discrimination provisions and the establishment of enforceable rights with judicial remedies within national legal systems are considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> means. Some provisions, such as anti-discrimination laws, are already required under other human rights instruments, such as the ICCPR.|$|E

5|$|The AFL–CIO's {{autonomous}} {{support of}} Solidarity {{was so successful}} that by 1984 both Democrats and Republicans agreed that it deserved public support. The AFL–CIO's example of open support was deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> for a democracy, and much more suitable than the clandestine funding through the CIA that had occurred before 1970. Both parties and President Ronald Reagan supported a non-governmental organization, National Endowment for Democracy (NED), through which Congress would openly fund Solidarity through an allocation in the State Department's budget, beginning in 1984. The NED was designed with four core institutions, associated with {{the two major parties}} and with the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (representing business). The NED's first president was Carl Gershman, a former Director of Social Democrats, USA and former U.S. Representative to the United Nations committee on human rights. From 1984 until 1990, the NED and the AFL–CIO channeled equipment and support worth $4million to Solidarity.|$|E

25|$|In Waldorf education, pentatonic {{music is}} {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> {{for young children}} due to its simplicity and unselfconscious openness of expression. Pentatonic music centered around intervals of the fifth is often sung and played in early childhood; progressively smaller intervals are emphasized within primarily pentatonic as children progress through the early school years. At around nine years of age the music begins to center around first folk music using a six-tone scale, and then the modern diatonic scales, {{with the goal of}} reflecting the children's developmental progress in their musical experience. Pentatonic instruments used include lyres, pentatonic flutes, and tone bars; special instruments have been designed and built for the Waldorf curriculum.|$|E
25|$|Sectors in ℂ {{having their}} vertex at z = 0 often prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> domains for complex expressions. A sector D {{consists}} of all complex z fulfilling z ≠ 0 and α − δ < arg z < α + δ with some α and 0 < δ ≤ π. Often, α can be arbitrarily chosen {{and is not}} specified then. If δ is not given, it {{is assumed to be}} π, and the sector is in fact the whole plane ℂ, {{with the exception of a}} half-line originating at z = 0 and pointing into the direction of −α, usually serving as a branch cut. Note: In many applications and texts, α is silently taken to be 0, which centers the sector around the positive real axis.|$|E
25|$|A {{review was}} {{announced}} on 26 February 2016, after forty-three Coalition backbenchers including former leader Tony Abbott {{had signed a}} petition calling for the program's closure. The review did not consider {{the contents of the}} Minus 18 website, or the contents of the network partners’ websites. The review did not find that any of the official resources were inappropriate. It found that the content in guideline documents was consistent with the aims of the program and that the language and content was suitable. All lesson plans were found to be consistent with the aims of the program as were all the posters. No harm was expected to come from primary schools students viewing the material, just that they may not comprehend some terms such as transphobia or homophobia. The level of interaction between schools and parents was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate.</b>|$|E

25|$|On 2 June 2012, The Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that 331 Members of Parliament, including {{senior members of}} all three main parties, supported a proposal to change the name from Clock Tower to Elizabeth Tower in tribute to Queen Elizabeth II in her diamond jubilee year. This was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> because the large west tower now known as Victoria Tower was renamed in tribute to Queen Victoria on her diamond jubilee. On 26 June 2012, the House of Commons confirmed that the name change could go ahead. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, announced the change of name on 12 September 2012 {{at the start of}} Prime Minister's Questions. The change was marked by a naming ceremony in which the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, unveiled a name plaque attached to the tower on the adjoining Speaker's Green.|$|E
25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.|$|E
25|$|In December 1988, the 328 {{project was}} re-launched {{following}} {{the granting of}} shareholder approval after negotiations between the Dornier family and Daimler Benz. As {{the result of a}} six-month evaluation, a selection of powerplants deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> for the 328 was formed, these being the General Electric CT7-9D, the Garrett TPE-341-21 and the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW119A. While the Garrett engine was viewed by Deutsche Aerospace as being technically superior, Pratt & Whitney's powerplant was more advanced in development and thus was chosen. The engine selection was soon followed by the selection of a six-bladed composite propeller from Hartzell, Hartzell's submission being reportedly substantially lighter than competing bids from Dowty and Hamilton Standard. Following various considerations between electromechanical and digital instrumentation, Dornier opted for a digital glass cockpit and selected Honeywell to provide this after considering options from Saab Group, Rockwell Collins, and Smiths Aerospace.|$|E

25|$|Complications of postsurgical wounds can {{be reduced}} before, during and after surgery. Before surgery, clinicians can treat the patient to reduce {{hemoglobin}} A1c levels to less than 7%. Those anticipating surgery can reduce their risk of complications by stopping smoking thirty days prior to surgery. The patient's skin can be evaluated {{for the presence of}} Staphylococcus areus prior to surgery since this bacterium causes wound infections in postoperative wounds. Treating any other infections prior to surgery also reduces the risks of a postoperative wound infection. Examples of these pre-existing infections are urinary tract infection or lower reproductive system infection. Removing the hair where the skin will be cut helps {{to reduce the risk of}} complications, though shaving is not considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> and instead depilatories are used. Those who come in contact with the person who is receiving the surgery clean and disinfect their own skin surfaces. The patient's skin is also cleaned, scrubbed and treated with antiseptics. Patients undergoing surgery often receive antibiotics before surgery.|$|E
25|$|As the ETP {{was being}} planned by {{the ad hoc}} committee, a Primary School {{patterned}} after the Primary Segment at NRL-Bellevue was considered; Cooke, {{who had been a}} key figure in the NRL activity, was the major proponent of this option. Other committee members felt that students for the Secondary School should be recruited from persons who had already completed a degree, or at least had two years of study in electrical engineering, and could bypass the Primary altogether. A compromise was reached by Eddy’s proposing a Primary School taught in electrical engineering schools and compressing the major topics of {{the first two years of}} a normal curriculum into three months. Eddy would lead a prototype Primary School (previously described as a part or Radio Chicago) that would ensure the curriculum in college-operated schools <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> preparation for Navy-operated Secondary School. The top-performing Navy graduates of Primary School usually received a promotion to Petty-officer 3rd class Radio Technician.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} recent {{approaches}} to work design, the Interdisciplinary Approach is based on the use of careful assessment of current job design, followed by a cost/benefit analysis, and finally changes based on the area in which a job is lacking. The assessment is conducted using the Multi-method Job Design Questionnaire, which is used to determine if the job is deficient in the areas of motivational, mechanistic, biological, or perceptual motor support. Motivational improvements are aligned with the Job Characteristics theory dimensions. Mechanistic improvements are focused on improving the efficiency of the job design. Biological improvements focus on improvements to ergonomics, health conditions, and employee comfort. Finally, perceptual motor improvements focus on the nature and presentation of the information an employee must work with. If improvements are identified using the questionnaire, the company then evaluates the cost of making the improvements and determines if the potential gains in motivation and performance justify those costs. Because of the analysis and cost/benefit components of the Interdisciplinary Approach, it is often less costly for organizations and implementations can be more effective. Only changes deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>appropriate</b> investments are made, thus improving motivation, productivity, and job satisfaction while controlling costs.|$|E
