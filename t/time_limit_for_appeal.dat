2500|$|Section 21 of the Act {{creates a}} Legal Services Ombudsman {{to replace the}} Lay Observer. The Ombudsman is tasked with {{investigating}} any allegation made {{to him about the}} way a complaint to a professional body such as the Law Society about one of its members has been handled. This covers [...] "any professional body" [...] which relates to Licensed Conveyancers, barristers, solicitors, notaries or any other body specified by the Lord Chancellor. The Ombudsman may investigate the subject of the complaint itself, but cannot investigate any matter already settled by a court, the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal or a Bar Disciplinary Tribunal. The Ombudsman also cannot investigate a complaint when the complaint is being investigated by the professional body, while the decision made by the professional body is being appealed or while the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> <b>appeals</b> has not yet expired. An exception to this is if the Ombudsman feels that the professional body has not completed the investigation in a reasonable amount of time, or if they have mishandled the investigation.|$|R

5000|$|The Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth circuit courts {{held that}} the civil <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis is [...] "of the same general character" [...] as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus {{petitions}} follow <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal. However, the Eighth and Ninth circuit courts held that a writ of coram nobis is governed by the criminal <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> filing <b>appeals</b> because it a [...] "step in a criminal case."

2500|$|There are two {{provisions}} in Morgan which has divided the circuit courts on the writ’s <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> to {{file an appeal}} from a district court’s decision on a coram nobis petition. First, Morgan held that “the writ of coram nobis {{is a step in}} the criminal case.” Second, Morgan held that “the writ of coram nobis is of the same general character as the writ of habeas corpus”. The Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth circuit courts have held that the civil <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis [...] "of the same general character" [...] as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal. [...] However, the Eighth and Ninth circuit courts relied upon the statement in Morgan that a writ of coram nobis is a [...] "step in a criminal case" [...] and reasoned that it should therefore be governed by the criminal <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> filing <b>appeals.</b> [...] Criminal rules of appellate procedure only provide a 10-day time period to file an appeal.|$|R
40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>for</b> Tax Assessment The thesis {{deals with}} the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax {{assessment}} as it is regulated especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax. This <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> thus creates a time frame of the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period of time, rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Part Two explains general aspects of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment. Part Three {{deals with the}} calculation of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Chapter Two focuses on legal regulation of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment. Chapter Two is divided in ten parts. Part One defines the beginning of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment. Part Two looks at the extension of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment. Part Three deals with the interruption of time [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In the Republic of Macedonia, the {{legislator}} {{has tried}} {{to solve the problem}} of late payment in commercial transactions by enacting the Financial Discipline Act. The justifications for enacting this Act were the illiquidity of the business sector and the implementation of the EU Directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions. Yet, the Act includes several differences in comparison to the regime envisaged in the Directive. The <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> governing the performance of monetary liabilities in transactions between economic operators (undertakings) are identical with those in the EU Directive; however, the Act does not regulate payment in installment and does not provide for an extension of <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> unless expressly agreed. On the other hand, public authorities have a few privileges: <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> <b>for</b> commercial transactions between public authorities and economic operators are identical with the <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> <b>for</b> transactions between economic operators (whereas in the Directive <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> <b>for</b> public authorities are shorter); contracts on perennial procurement are exempt from compliance with this Act; and particular categories of public authorities should comply with the general <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> <b>for</b> commercial transactions as of 1 January 2016. Additionally, considering the prescribed misdemeanor sanctions applicable in cases where the debtor has failed to pay within the prescribed <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> the purpose of the Financial Discipline Act remains unclear. Has it been enacted to increase or to reduce the liquidity in the national economy?...|$|R
