5|$|Father John Buerlein (Jeremy Sisto) is the mild-mannered Catholic {{priest of}} a small parish in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Overworked and underpaid, he has grown jaded with the {{profession}} and has trouble connecting with his parishioners. During confession, a mysterious and unnamed prostitute (Kristin Chenoweth) confesses to a sin she has not yet committed: she plans to commit suicide on her birthday. Father John is taken aback. The confession ends abruptly, and {{he is unable to}} stop the woman before she disappears. He only knows she wears a crucifix and is an Aries, which means her birthday is soon. Father John grows obsessed with finding and helping <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>and</b> begins visiting the city's red-light district with the hopes of finding her. On his way home, Father John meets a homeless man named Gus (Gene Larche), but with no money for him, he gives him a rosary instead. Later, he seeks counsel from his friend Father Ralph O'Brien (Brian Baumgartner), who advises him not to become too personally involved.|$|E
500|$|Borah was not {{personally}} harmed by {{the stock market}} crash of October 1929, having sold any stocks and invested in government bonds. [...] Thousands of Americans had borrowed on margin, and were ruined by the crash. [...] Congress in June 1930 passed the Hawley–Smoot Tariff, [...] sharply increasing rates on imports. [...] Borah was one of 12 Republicans who joined Democrats in opposing the bill, which passed the Senate 44–42. Borah was up for election in 1930, and despite a minimal campaign effort, took over 70percent of the vote in a bad year for Republicans. When he returned to Washington for the lame-duck session of the Senate beginning in December, Borah pressed the passage of legislation that would help business and suggested that members of Congress turn back their salary to the Treasury. The economy continued to worsen in the winter of 1931, and Borah urged relief legislation, stating that opponents argued [...] "that for the Government to feed <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> her sick children would destroy her self respect and make a bad citizen of her. [...] Does anyone believe it? It is a cowardly imputation on the helpless. [...] I resent it and I repudiate it." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{workplace}} flirtation between Will and Emma, Gilsig deemed Terri [...] "a woman of conviction", {{willing to do}} [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to keep Will from leaving her, [...] "even if that means finding <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> hunting her down". She explained that Will and Terri's communication is weak and that Terri is [...] "missing {{a lot of the}} skills for the marriage", and commented that Terri feels threatened by Will's commitment to the glee club, worried that it will pull him away from her. Gilsig characterized Terri as emotionally still being in high school, and explained: [...] "I think Terri still lives in that world, where I can move the pieces in such a way to create a picture, and that will make it real. I don't think she's learned that you can actually just have open conversations and talk about your fears and ask for your needs to be met in a direct, compassionate way. I think she's still in high school and thinking whatever you do, just don't let anybody know that you don't know what you're doing." [...] Discussing Terri's relationship with her sister Kendra, Gilsig commented: [...] "When Kendra tells Terri to do something, Terri does it. As crazy as Terri might be, she's actually pretty normal in the face of her sister. This [...] is Kendra's brainchild, and she just trusts her implicitly." ...|$|E

In <b>this,</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> girls would develop a visual representation {{of how they}} currently use mobile phones/the Internet, how {{they would like to}} use it, and their safety concerns. These activities will allow service providers to understand risks and ways to mitigate them.|$|R

500|$|The episode {{helped to}} solidify the {{different}} personalities of The Lone Gunmen. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz explained, [...] "Up , they {{were sort of}} interchangeable in the information they delivered. But then Vince, who loved the characters and really wanted a chance to dig more deeply into them, created a back story and they became a lot more interesting." [...] Actor Dean Haglund, who played Langly, said of the episode, [...] "What we read in the script wasn't really our origins as we'd imagined it. I'd thought we were all in a university garage band together or something. Bruce [...] thought he was a photocopier repair man." [...] Much of the episode's action focused on Byers, played by Bruce Harwood. This experience was different for him, and he noted, [...] "I don't think I'd ever done an episode where I was the lead character. But I felt like the lead because it was my story about falling in love with <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> then dragging these other two schmucks into the disaster that followed." [...] Vince Gilligan was particularly happy with his characterization of Byers, later admitting, [...] "I just loved the idea of Byers working for the government and being this very gung-ho pro-government guy. That's just a fundamental drama where you take a character on a journey and the journey take him 180 degrees from who he original was." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his opening}} statement, {{prosecutor}} Brian Leveson portrayed Fred and Rose as sex-obsessed sadistic murderers, terming the bodies discovered at Cromwell Street and Midland Road [...] "secrets more terrible than words can express... last moments on Earth were as objects of the depravity of <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> her husband".|$|E

2500|$|Noriko calmly accepts this {{sexual content}} when couched in the [...] "archaic" [...] form of Noh drama, {{but when she}} sees her father nod politely to the {{attractive}} widow, Mrs. Miwa, who {{is also in the}} audience, [...] "that strikes Noriko as outrageous and outraging. Had <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> her father arranged to meet at this play about sexuality? Is this remarriage 'filthy' like [...] remarriage? She feels both angry and despairing. She is so mad at her father that, quite uncharacteristically, she angrily walks away from him after they leave the theater." [...] Holland thus sees one of the film's main themes as [...] "the pushing of traditional and inhibited Noriko into marriage." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lucy Green {{has focused}} on gender in {{relation}} to musical performers and creators, and specifically on educational frameworks {{as they relate to}} both. She suggests that women's alienation from [...] "areas that have a strong technological tendency such as DJ-ing, sound engineering and producing" [...] are [...] "not necessarily about her dislike of these instruments but relates to the interrupting effect of their dominantly masculine delineations." [...] Despite <b>this,</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> girls do increasingly engage in turntable and DJ practices, individually and collectively, and [...] "carve out spaces for themselves in EDM and DJ Culture".|$|R
