5|$|Other flags {{used in the}} People's Republic of China use a red {{background}} to symbolize the revolution {{in conjunction with other}} symbols. The flag of the People's Liberation Army uses the gold star with the Chinese characters 8-1 (for 1 August, the date of the PLA's founding). The flag of the Communist Party of China replaces all of the stars with the party emblem. Due to government regulations, cities and provinces of China cannot have their own flags; the only sub-national flags that exist are those of the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions. Despite this, at least two cities have adopted flags after the law was passed. The cities of Kaifeng and Shangrao adopted their flags in March 2006 and March 2009 respectively. This implies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> either repealed or not enforced.|$|E

25|$|Three {{areas of}} {{controversy}} have surrounded the Davis–Bacon Act since the 1950s. In the beginning, these were touched {{off because of}} the Interstate Highway System and the volume of military construction {{that took place in}} the Cold War. These became more pronounced in the 1960s as the Space Race took off, and intensified in the wake of Nixon's suspension. Those areas, broadly considered, include (a) data collection and accuracy issues resulting from the way regulations have been formulated and administered, (b) the increased cost of federal construction projects, and (c) claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> racist in conception and effect.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1537, Johannes Agricola (1494–1566)– serving at {{the time}} as pastor in Luther's birthplace, Eisleben– preached a sermon in which he claimed that God's gospel, not God's moral law (the Ten Commandments), {{revealed}} God's wrath to Christians. Based on this sermon and others by Agricola, Luther suspected that Agricola was behind certain anonymous antinomian theses circulating in Wittenberg. These theses asserted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> no longer to be taught to Christians but belonged only to city hall. Luther responded to these theses with six series of theses against Agricola and the antinomians, four of which became the basis for disputations between 1538 and 1540. He also responded to these assertions in other writings, such as his 1539 open letter to C. Güttel Against the Antinomians, and his book On the Councils and the Church from the same year.|$|E
25|$|In November 2004, Southwest {{announced}} their active {{opposition to the}} Wright Amendment, claiming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> anti-competitive and outdated.

Southwest began nonstop flights to Kansas City and St. Louis on December 13. American Airlines and American Eagle began flights from Love to St. Louis, Kansas City, Austin, and San Antonio on March 2, 2006, although American Airlines subsequently pulled out of the market, leaving American Eagle to offer a reduced service to Austin and Kansas City alone. In 2008, American decided to terminate the Austin and Kansas City service and replace it with service to O'Hare International Airport (which Southwest does not serve) using 50-passenger regional jets in compliance with the Wright provisions regarding aircraft size, although American Eagle later stopped service from Love Field altogether.|$|E

25|$|Book 3, subtitled De mundi systemate (On {{the system}} of the world), is an {{exposition}} of many consequences of universal gravitation, especially its consequences for astronomy. It builds upon the propositions of the previous books, and applies them with further specificity than in Book 1 to the motions observed in the solar system. Here (introduced by Proposition 22, and continuing in Propositions 25–35) are developed several of the features and irregularities of the orbital motion of the Moon, especially the variation. Newton lists the astronomical observations on which he relies, and establishes in a stepwise manner that the inverse square law of mutual gravitation applies to solar system bodies, starting with the satellites of Jupiter and going on by stages to show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> of universal application. He also gives starting at Lemma 4 and Proposition 40 the theory of the motions of comets, for which much data came from John Flamsteed and Edmond Halley, and accounts for the tides, attempting quantitative estimates of the contributions of the Sun and Moon to the tidal motions; and offers the first theory of the precession of the equinoxes. Book 3 also considers the harmonic oscillator in three dimensions, and motion in arbitrary force laws.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Henry and his {{descendants}} normally followed {{the will of}} the courts, despite the fact they were theoretically not bound by judges. William Holdsworth infers that by regularly asking the legal officers of the crown and judiciary for legal advice and consent, Henry recognised the need for a stable government to follow the law. He also contends that the view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> supreme over all [...] "was the view of all the leading lawyers and statesmen and publicists of the Tudor period". It was accepted that while the King had [...] "unfettered discretion", he was limited in areas where the courts had imposed conditions {{on the use of the}} prerogative, or where he had chosen to do so.|$|E
500|$|Hale's {{legal theory}} was highly {{influenced}} by both Coke and Selden. He {{argued that the}} making of the law was a contract, but that it was subject to a test of [...] "reasonable" [...] character, something that only the judges could rule on. In this way, he sat in a middle ground between Selden and Coke. This was in conflict with the argument of Hobbes. In 1835, Hale's [...] "Reflections on Hobbes' Dialogue" [...] was discovered; Frederick Pollock posits that since Hobbes' Dialogue was first published in 1681, six years after Hale's death, Hale must have seen an early copy or draft. D.E.C. Yale, writing in the Cambridge Law Journal, suggests that Chief Justice Vaughan had access to the Dialogue, and may have passed a copy on to Hale before his death. In his Reflections, Hale agreed with Coke that the judge's task was to bring the reason of the common law (the coherence of the legal system) in line with the reason of the law in question (to justify that law). He disagreed with Hobbes that a layman could understand the law, saying that [...] "he that hath been educated {{in the study of the}} law hath a great advantage over those that have been otherwise exercised". The distinction between Coke and Hale is that Hale agreed with Selden that law was created through agreement, and disagreed that reason had an inherent binding power. Hale agreed with Hobbes that the interpretation of the law could not be left to individual reason, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> not an exact science; the best that can be produced is a set of laws which give a reasonable outcome in the majority of cases.|$|E

Sonia Saraiya of Nerve ranked Jasmine fifth in her article [...] "Ranked: Disney Princesses From Least To Most Feminist". Saraiya praised her personality, likening her boldness, curiosity, and skepticism of marriage to that of Belle while commending her for [...] "falling for a completely inadequate 'street rat' and whisking him out of poverty, instead of the other way around." [...] However, Saraiya labeled Jasmine's use of sexuality her [...] "only power", criticizing her for sending a negative message to young girls. When questioned about whether or not Jasmine is a positive role model because [...] "all she wants to do is get married", Larkin defended her character, explaining, [...] "That's not true.

[...] Meanwhile, Jasmine's inability to recognize Aladdin despite his disguise has been met with controversy, comparing this characteristic to the relationship between Lois Lane and Clark Kent/Superman, and questioning the princess' intelligence.|$|E
