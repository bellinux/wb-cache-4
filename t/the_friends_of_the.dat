5|$|It was {{not until}} after 1832 and the {{introduction}} of the Scottish Reform Act 1832 that control of Scottish politics was taken from the hands of landowners and a small number of merchants. <b>The</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> People Society in the 1790s was opposed by those landed gentry politicians. After the Act came into effect, the constituencies were changed, and this raised the electorate from under 5,000 to 65,000.|$|E

5|$|Support for {{parliamentary}} reform plummeted {{after the}} launch of the French Revolution in 1789. Many English politicians became steadfastly opposed to any major political change. Despite this reaction, several Radical Movement groups were established to agitate for reform. A group of Whigs led by James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale and Charles Grey founded an organisation advocating parliamentary reform in 1792. This group, known as the Society of <b>the</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> People, included 28 MPs. In 1793, Grey presented to the House of Commons a petition from <b>the</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> People, outlining abuses of the system and demanding change. He did not propose any specific scheme of reform, but merely a motion that the House inquire into possible improvements. Parliament's reaction to the French Revolution was so negative, that even this request for an inquiry was rejected by a margin of almost 200 votes. Grey tried to raise the subject again in 1797, but the House again rebuffed him by a majority of over 150.|$|E

5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} include other {{environmental}} groups, such as <b>the</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River and the Sierra Club – shifted their focus on limiting {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than trying to stop the dam altogether. In the meantime, construction on the dam continued to progress. On April 1, 1978 the gates of the diversion tunnel were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones Dam. As the reservoir filled, work moved ahead on the power plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978. The main embankment of the dam was topped out on October 28, 1978.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, <b>the</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution (Zgromadzenie Przyjaciół Konstytucji Rządowej)which {{included}} many {{participants in the}} Great Sejmwas organised to defend the reforms already enacted and to promote further ones. It is now regarded as the first modern-style political party in Poland's history. The response to the new constitution was less enthusiastic in the provinces, where the Hetmans' Party enjoyed considerable influence. General support among the middle nobility was crucial and still very substantial; most of the provincial sejmiks deliberating in 1791 and early 1792 supported the constitution.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution, {{regarded}} as the first Polish political party, and including many participants of the Great Sejm, was formed to defend the reforms already enacted and to promote further ones.

The Great Sejm's reforms were brought down by the Targowica Confederation and {{the intervention of the}} Russian Empire. On 23 November 1793 the Grodno Sejm annulled all the enactments of the Great Sejm, including the Constitution of May 3, 1791.|$|E

The library's director oversees two and three-quarters full-time and eight part-time employees, including reference and youth librarians. The library is governed by a seven-member board, with a liaison to the village board. Services include computer classes, book discussion groups, young adult programs, a children's room, and a local history collection.

5|$|As Alcibiades had suspected, {{his absence}} emboldened his enemies, {{and they began}} to accuse him of other sacrilegious actions and {{comments}} and even alleged that these actions were connected with a plot against the democracy. According to Thucydides, the Athenians were always in fear and took everything suspiciously. When the fleet arrived in Catana, it found the state trireme Salaminia waiting to bring Alcibiades and the others indicted for mutilating the hermai or profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries back to Athens to stand trial. Alcibiades told the heralds that he would follow them back to Athens in his ship, but in Thurii he escaped with his crew; in Athens he was convicted in absentia and condemned to death. His property was confiscated and a reward of one talent was promised to whoever succeeded in killing any who had fled. Meanwhile, the Athenian force in Sicily, after a few early victories, moved against Messina, where the Generals expected their secret allies within the city to betray it to them. Alcibiades, however, foreseeing that he would be outlawed, gave information to <b>the</b> <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Syracusans in Messina, who succeeded in preventing the admission of the Athenians. With the death of Lamachus in battle some time later, command of the Sicilian Expedition fell into the hands of Nicias, whom modern scholars have judged to be an inadequate military leader.|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{also served}} as a charter member of the first American Civil Liberties Union chapter {{organized}} in the South in the 1950s. She lent her support to the Equal Rights Amendment, speaking to the legislature in Tallahassee urging them to ratify it. In the 1980s Douglas lent her support to the Florida Rural Legal Services, a group that worked to protect migrant farm workers who were centered on Belle Glade, and who were primarily employed by the sugarcane industry. She wrote to Governor Bob Graham in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions the migrant workers endured. The same year, Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center, which had been housed in hot dog stands, needed a building of its own. The center received a portable building until 1991 when the Florida Department of Education endowed $1.8million for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center in Crandon Park. Douglas co-founded <b>the</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Miami-Dade Public Libraries with her longtime friend Helen Muir, and served as its first president.|$|E

5|$|The barn {{was briefly}} in royal {{ownership}} but {{passed into the}} hands of three families who continued to use it for agricultural purposes until as late as the 1970s. It was subsequently owned by a property development company which redeveloped the farm complex. After the company went bankrupt in 2006, the barn was bought by property speculators betting on its compensation value if the nearby Heathrow Airport was expanded. The barn fell into disrepair and was closed to the public for all but one day a year. English Heritage stepped in, using a rare legal procedure to carry out repairs without the owner's consent, and eventually purchased the barn in January 2012. It is now open to the public from April to October on the second and fourth Sunday of each month under the management of <b>the</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Barn group.|$|E
5|$|Zajączek participated as {{a deputy}} from the Podole Voivodeship in the Sejm (parliament of the Commonwealth) session of 1784, {{and was a}} vocal member of the hetman Branicki's faction (known as the Hetmans' Party). In a similar vein he participated in the Sejm of 1786, this time as a deputy from the Kiev Voivodeship. During that time he emerged as a vocal critic of king Stanisław August Poniatowski. In late 1786 he married Aleksandra Iaura, née de Pernet. Meanwhile, he kept being {{promoted}} in ranks, reaching that of colonel in 1787. He was also not a deputy to {{the first half of}} the Four-year Sejm (1788–1792), and spent the first two years of its deliberations with his unit (2nd Front Guard Regiment, Polish: 2 regiment straży przedniej) on the Ukrainian border; in 1790, however, he was elected as a deputy once again and joined his patron Branicki in Warsaw. Soon, however, he left Branicki's camp, joining the faction of Hugo Kołłątaj, the Patriotic Party. Zajączek became involved in the works of a commission tasked with reforming the Polish military, and contributed to a new project on military exercises and officer training. He became one of the supporters of the new Constitution of 3 May 1791, and members of <b>the</b> <b>Friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution society.|$|E
