5|$|C-terminal truncation: The C-terminal end {{segment is}} the most conserved region of TnI. As an {{allosteric}} structure regulated by Ca2+ in the troponin complex, it binds and stabilizes the position of tropomyosin in low Ca2+ state implicating {{a role in the}} inhibition of actomyosin ATPase. A deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids was found during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. It was also seen in myocardial stunning in coronary bypass patients. Over-expression of the C-terminal truncated cardiac TnI (cTnI1-192) in <b>transgenic</b> <b>mouse</b> heart resulted in a phenotype of myocardial stunning with systolic and diastolic dysfunctions. Replacement of intact cTnI with cTnT1-192 in myofibrils and cardiomyocytes did not affect maximal tension development but decreased the rates of force redevelopment and relaxation.|$|E
5|$|In humans, plasma {{triglycerides}} such as triacylglycerols {{have been}} long debated {{as an important}} risk factor for not only cardiovascular disease but also for other relevant morbidities, such as cancer, renal disease, suicide, and all-cause mortality. The APOA5 gene was found by comparative sequencing of ~200 kbp of human and mice DNA as the last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins located on human chromosome 11 at 11q23. Two mouse <b>transgenic</b> <b>mouse</b> models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knockout) confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma triglyceride levels of plasma triglycerides. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are both closely related to plasma triglyceride levels and APOA5. Recent meta-analyses suggest that the effect on metabolic syndrome development is more profound for rs662799 in Asian population and for rs3135506 for Europeans. Moreover, meta-analysis that focused on rs662799 and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus has suggested a significant association in Asian populations, but not in European populations.|$|E

To examine differences between <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> expressing the LPA gene and mice capable of forming Lp(a) particles, LPA -YAC <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> and hAPOB <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> were crossed and their offspring examined.

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{function}} of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in vivo, we have developed <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> expressing HGF in the liver. The bromodeoxyuridine labelling indices in livers from HGF <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> were doubled, compared to those from wild type mice. Livers of HGF <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> expressed high levels of c-myc, which was the consequence of increased transcription rates through the c-myc promoter. After 70 % partial hepatectomy, the livers of HGF <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> recovered in half the time needed for their normal siblings. Since we found that HGF inhibits growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro, we have made two kinds of double transgenic mice: HGF/TGFα and HGF/c-myc <b>mice.</b> The double <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> expressing both HGF and TGFα had lower tumour yields, compared to TGFα <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice.</b> The HGF/c-myc double <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> had a lower incidence of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) and HCC in comparison with c-myc <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice.</b> In HGF/c-myc mice, there were more apoptotic cells and less mitotic cells than c-myc <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice.</b> These data indicate that HGF inhibits growth and occurrence of HCC in vivo. We also found that HGF protects liver from 					D-galactosamine (D-GalN) -induced injury. Hepatic prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) contents in HGF <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> were much higher than those in wild type mice, and were associated with hepatic HGF contents. An anti-HGF antibody inhibits production of PGE 2 in liver after D-GalN administration. These data suggest that HGF protects liver from D-GalN-induced injury through increased liver PGE 2 production.

Smad 6 <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> showed postnatal dwarfism with osteopenia and inhibition of Smad 1 / 5 / 8 phosphorylation in chondrocytes.

In 1907 a bacterium that caused plant tumors, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, was discovered and in the early 1970s the tumor-inducing agent was found to be a DNA plasmid called the Ti plasmid. By removing the genes in the plasmid that caused the tumor and adding in novel genes, researchers were able to infect plants with A. tumefaciens and let the bacteria insert their chosen DNA into the genomes of the plants. Not all plant cells are susceptible to infection by A. tumefaciens, so other methods were developed, including electroporation and micro-injection.

2500|$|Regarding the {{mechanistic}} role of beta-catenin in cardiac hypertrophy, <b>transgenic</b> <b>mouse</b> {{studies have}} shown somewhat conflicting results regarding whether upregulation of beta-catenin is beneficial or detrimental. A recent study using a conditional knockout mouse that either lacked beta-catenin altogether or expressed a non-degradable form of beta-catenin in cardiomyocytes reconciled a potential reason for these discrepancies. There appears to be strict control over the subcellular localization of beta-catenin in cardiac muscle. Mice lacking beta-catenin had no overt phenotype in the left ventricular myocardium; however, mice harboring a stabilized form of beta-catenin developed dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that the temporal regulation of beta-catenin by protein degradation mechanisms is critical for normal functioning of beta-catenin in cardiac cells. In a mouse model harboring knockout of a desmosomal protein, plakoglobin, implicated in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, the stabilization of beta-catenin was also enhanced, presumably {{to compensate for the}} loss of its plakogloblin homolog. These changes were coordinate with Akt activation and glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibition, suggesting once again that the abnormal stabilization of beta-catenin may be involved in the development of cardiomyopathy. [...] Further studies employing a double knockout of plakoglobin and beta-catenin showed that the double knockout developed cardiomyopathy, fibrosis and arrhythmias resulting in sudden cardiac death. Intercalated disc architecture was severely impaired and connexin 43-resident gap junctions were markedly reduced. Electrocardiogram measurements captured spontaneous lethal ventricular arrhythmias in the double transgenic animals, suggesting that the two catenins—beta-catenin and plakoglobin are critical and idispensible for mechanoelectrical coupling in cardiomyocytes.|$|E

Evidence for positive selection of mouse T cell receptors in HLA-DR <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> came both from the acquisition of new, HLA-restricted responses to various peptides and from an increased frequency of T cells using the TCR V beta 4 gene segment.

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{presented here}} {{were performed to}} see whether the level of expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen (Ia antigen) on dendritic cells, {{one of the most critical}} antigen presenting cells (APC), influences the humoral immune response in hepatitis B virus (HBV) <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice.</b> We have reported that <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> had a low responsiveness in specific antibody production to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH), a T-cell dependent, HBV-unrelated antigen compared with the age, sex, and major histocompatibility-matched normal mice, due to a significantly lower T-cell stimulatory capacity of transgenic mice-derived dendritic cells, possibly as a result of significantly lower level of Ia antigen. Immunohistochemical staining has shown that treatment of <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> with mouse recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), daily for six consecutive days resulted in an increased expression of Ia antigen on splenic dendritic cells. Again, flow cytometric analyses have further confirmed the significant increase in the expression of Ia antigen on dendritic cells, isolated from <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> treated with IFN-gamma compared with the same from the untreated or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) -treated <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice.</b> <b>Transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> immunized with two optimum doses of KLH (5 micrograms/mouse) could not produce anti-KLH antibodies in sera, but injecting <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> with the same doses of KLH together with IFN-gamma resulted in the production of anti-KLH antibodies in sera. Again, KLH-primed normal mice-derived T/B lymphocytes produced anti-KLH antibody, when cultured with dendritic cells from IFN-gamma-treated <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> expressing a higher level of Ia antigen, but not with the same from PBS-treated or untreated <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice.</b> Treatment of <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> with IFN-gamma resulted in a reduced level of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in liver and in sera. These experiments have shown that the level of expression of Ia antigen on dendritic cells is a critical factor for its APC capability and its modulation of IFN-gamma may be used for immune therapy in HBV carriers...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{detection}} of infectivity of several agents that cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease {{has previously been}} achieved by assaying for deposits of abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) in follicular dendritic cells in the spleens of <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> carrying the human prion protein gene. In this study, <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> expressing the bovine prion protein were inocu-lated intraperitoneally with classical (C-type) or atypical L-type bovine spongiform encephalopathies (BSE). Pro-teinase-resistant PrPSc were detected in the spleens of all <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> at 75 days after inoculation with both types of BSE. Infectivity in PrPSc-positive spleens of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> revealed that prions of C- and L-type BSE replicated. These results suggest that bioassay system by the <b>transgenic</b> <b>mice</b> could be useful for the rapid {{detection of}} BSE infec-tivity with discriminating between C- and L-type BSEs...|$|R
