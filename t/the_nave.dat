5|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry (mainly gritstone) and dressed with freestone. <b>The</b> <b>nave</b> {{measures}} 44feet 9inches long by 15feet 6inches wide (13.6 by 4.7m) and the chancel measures 32feet 9inches long by 20feet 6inches (10 by 6.25m) wide. <b>The</b> <b>nave</b> has three bays, and the chancel {{at the east}} end of <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> has two bays; it is slightly wider than <b>the</b> <b>nave.</b> <b>The</b> <b>nave</b> and the chancel have external buttresses.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of Chester Cathedral gives {{a warm and}} mellow appearance because of the pinkish colour of the sandstone. The proportions appear spacious because {{the view from the}} west end of <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> to the east end is unimpeded by a pulpitum and <b>the</b> <b>nave,</b> although not long, is both wide and high compared with many of England's cathedrals. The piers of <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> and choir are widely spaced, those of <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> carrying only the clerestory of large windows with no triforium gallery. The proportions are made possible partly because the ornate stellar vault, like that at York Minster, is of wood, not stone.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>nave</b> roof becomes {{increasingly}} elaborate towards the chancel. <b>The</b> <b>nave</b> roof is of eight by twelve panels, boarded with bosses and brattished wall plates.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>nave's</b> west wall has a sculptural group {{depicting}} Magnificence and Religion (1650) by Alessandro Algardi. Algardi {{also helped}} design the high reliefs in stucco {{that run on}} both lateral nave walls just above the entries to the chapels and beneath <b>the</b> <b>nave's</b> grandiose entablature.|$|R
50|$|From the side, {{the tower}} is visible, {{followed}} by the long sides of <b>the</b> <b>naves</b> (with <b>the</b> lateral <b>naves</b> lower in height than the central one), then the transept wall {{at the same height}} as <b>the</b> central <b>nave.</b> On top of the transept is the dome, and after that the walls continue. This façade has an entry that allows direct access to <b>the</b> rightmost <b>nave.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>nave's</b> {{pavement}} has a rare pavement geometrical decoration {{which dates}} from c. 1200.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>nave,</b> {{which is}} aisleless, was {{formerly}} known as the Capel Hir (Long Chapel). The pews in <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> are by Seddon and are of pitch pine with pegged tenon joints. The stonework is almost all nineteenth century to <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> south wall, less so elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Externally, {{there are}} slate roofs and coped gables with cross finials. The roofs have {{patterned}} bands of fishscale Whitland Abbey slates, except on <b>the</b> <b>nave.</b> There are large scale, plain unbuttressed walls without batter for <b>the</b> <b>nave,</b> a nineteenth century south porch, two transepts and a chancel with a nineteenth century {{addition of a}} north choir vestry; the dating of the priests' vestry, {{on the north side}} of the chancel, is less certain. Externally, <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> downpipes on the south side are dated 1884.|$|E
5|$|Since the Reformation, <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> is {{that part}} of the {{building}} which is usually open to and most used by the congregation and general public. There is also, usually in <b>the</b> <b>nave,</b> a raised pulpit from which the dean or other clergy can expound the scriptures. In the late 20th century it became customary in some cathedrals for an hourly prayer to be said, for the benefit of visitors, and this is often presented from <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> pulpit. In a large cathedral, particularly in those where the building is divided by a screen as at Canterbury, an altar may be set at the eastern end of <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> so that services might be held there for large congregations. At each place where services are held there is a lectern on which rests a Bible.|$|E

5|$|St Edwen's {{is built}} from local red gritstone, formed into square blocks and dressed with sandstone. The roof {{is made from}} slate with stone edging. The church, {{which is in the}} Late Decorated style, has a tower topped with a broach spire at the north-west corner of <b>the</b> <b>nave,</b> {{supported}} by buttresses. The church is entered through a porch with an arched doorway in the lowest of the three stages of the tower. Inside, the woodwork of the roof is exposed; some of <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> timbers might be medieval beams reused in the 1856 rebuilding. <b>The</b> <b>nave</b> and chancel are divided by an arch and by three steps leading up from <b>the</b> <b>nave.</b> The chancel and sanctuary are separated by an altar rail set on top of some wooden panels.|$|E
5|$|The church, {{which is}} {{built in the}} Decorated style, has a nave at the west end and a chancel at the east end. It is built from rubble masonry dressed with freestone; the roof is made of slate and edged with stone. There is a porch at {{the west end of}} the south wall of <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> and a vestry at the west end of the north wall of the chancel, {{abutting}} <b>the</b> <b>nave.</b> <b>The</b> <b>nave</b> measures approximately 39feet 8inches by 20feet 8inches (12.10m by 6.30m) and the chancel is shorter and narrower at approximately 18feet by 14feet 1inch (5.50 by 4.30m). The total floor space of the church is approximately 1,076square feet (100m2). There is a large bellcote at the west end of <b>the</b> <b>nave,</b> containing one bell.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{parts of}} the present structure are <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> and the chancel, which are 13th-century. The church shows signs of alterations and additions in subsequent centuries. A transept or chapel {{was added to the}} south side of the chancel in the late 13th or early 14th century. The arch between them was once the archway between the chancel and <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> but was later moved. The bellcote at the west end of the roof was added in the 14th century. The porch on the south side of <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> was built in about 1500, and was re-roofed in 1725. A doorway in the north wall of <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> was inserted in the late 15th or early 16th century, and now leads into a vestry added in the 19th century. The main roof is largely 17th-century. Some repairs were carried out in the 1840s, with further repairs in 1854 under the supervision of the diocesan architect, Henry Kennedy.|$|E
50|$|The {{height of}} <b>the</b> central <b>nave</b> is 41.6 m, whilst <b>the</b> lateral <b>naves</b> are 20.55 m high.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>nave</b> of {{the church}} (where the {{congregation}} sat) has no aisle. The chancel (site of the altar) is at {{the east end of}} <b>the</b> <b>nave.</b> There is a porch, which contains an 18th-century memorial, {{on the south side of}} <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> towards the west end, and a vestry to the north. Each section is steeply gabled, with the west end terminating in a bellcote surmounted by a cross and containing a single bell. The windows in <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> have two lights (sections of window separated by mullions), save for one to the west of the porch, which has one light. The east end of the chancel has three adjoining lancet windows, the tallest in the middle.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> South <b>Nave,</b> (from <b>the</b> Dome) The {{interior}} of the Garden Palace is not less effective or impressive in appearance than is the exterior. From north to south it measures 700 ft., and {{from east to west}} 400 feet, the avenues of <b>the</b> <b>naves</b> and transepts being 50 feet wide. Running round <b>the</b> <b>naves</b> and transepts are spacious galleries, 25 feet in width; the total amount of space in the entire structure being equal to 11, 104, 000 cubic feet. The view of <b>the</b> South <b>Nave,</b> looking south from the dome, shows the exhibits of the New South Wales Department of Mines, the Dutch and Austrian Courts, etc. [...] Printed on facing page.; Also available in an electronic version via the Internet at: [URL]...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>nave</b> was in poorest {{condition}} and the walls were substantially rebuilt and the porch wholly replaced {{in the first phase}} in 1868-9, with Thomas Williams of Cardiff the contractor. The font was restored at this time. Traces of painted decoration were found in <b>the</b> <b>nave,</b> including a colossal St Christopher on the north wall opposite the entrance. Unfortunately this and other traces of fresco could not be saved; they were destroyed without a pictorial record of them having been made. The committee considered an oak roof for <b>the</b> <b>nave,</b> but rejected it as too costly.|$|E
5|$|The vault of <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> rises steeply in {{a simple}} quadripartite form, in harmony with <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> arcade. The eastern end of the choir was {{extended}} and the whole upper part elaborated {{in the second quarter}} of the 14th century by William Joy. The vault has a multiplicity of ribs in a net-like form, which is very different from that of <b>the</b> <b>nave,</b> and is perhaps a recreation in stone of a local type of compartmented wooden roof of which examples remain from the 15th century, including those at St Cuthbert's Church, Wells. The vaults of the aisles of the choir also have a unique pattern.|$|E
5|$|Arcades of {{semi-circular}} arches divide <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> {{from the}} aisles. On {{the south side}} of the cathedral, a large chapel, built in 1911, extends three bays parallel to the aisle. This chapel provides a more intimate place of worship than the main church or its aisles. <b>The</b> <b>nave</b> has a cross vaulted ceiling with clerestory windows above the arcades. The cathedral's main neoclassical altar of translucent alabaster is a modern replacement for the original wooden gothic altar, now located in the southern side chapel. The main altar, built in Burgos, Spain, was donated by the local Ferre family. Except for the side chapel where terrazzo is used, the cathedral's floor is of gray and white marble design.|$|E
50|$|The {{rectangular}} {{floor plan}} {{is divided into}} three parts (naves) of equal height, with <b>the</b> central <b>nave</b> wider than <b>the</b> surrounding two. <b>The</b> <b>naves</b> are separated by thick columns, topped with classical cornices and capitals. On them rest the late-Gothic roof ribs, with liernes over the aisles.|$|R
50|$|The church {{design is}} very unusual for Byzantine architecture. The church is {{constructed}} as a double-church featuring two naves adjacent {{to each other}} and separated by a wall. <b>The</b> <b>naves</b> were quadrangular and each featured a separate dome. <b>The</b> <b>naves</b> have a common narthex of an oblong shape. The twin church design at Üçayak has two naves (naoi) each with a separate semi-circular apse. Each apse includes a rectangular bay in front of it.|$|R

5|$|English cathedrals {{maintain}} a traditional form of church service, of which canticles, the set psalm of the day, responses, and an anthem are sung by a choir traditionally composed of about thirty men and boys. (Many cathedrals now {{also have a}} girls choir, and a lay choir). Because of this tradition, {{that part of the}} building that contains the stalls, usually to the east of the central tower but sometimes extending under it, is called the choir or quire. The choir is sometimes divided from <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> of the cathedral by a wide medieval screen constructed of stone and in some instances carrying a large pipe organ. This screen traditionally separated the quire from <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> and the clergy from the laity, who were expected to worship at parish churches, rather than at the cathedral. <b>The</b> <b>nave</b> of the cathedral, in medieval times, was used primarily for processions. At its western end it contains the font for the ritual washing service of Baptism, at which a person, most often an infant, is symbolically accepted into the church. The font is usually made of stone and is usually the oldest fitting in the cathedral, many of them being Norman.|$|E
5|$|In poor {{condition}} {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century, <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> walls were leaning outward and the roofs decayed, so restoration was proposed in 1848 under R.K. Penson, but not actively pursued until the Reverend John Pugh became vicar in 1861, when new plans were made by William Butterfield. Butterfield however resigned in 1867 and the restoration was finally carried out 1867–84 by John Pollard Seddon. The church was substantially restored in stages {{at a cost of}} £8,500, and the roof was renewed, apart from the wagon roof over the chancel, which survives above Seddon's roof. The restoration work in general consisted of the reconstruction of <b>the</b> <b>nave,</b> the lifting and paving of the chancel, {{the construction of a new}} altar and the reconstruction of the north and south transepts. <b>The</b> <b>nave</b> was opened in 1869 and the tower and south transepts were opened in 1880.|$|E
5|$|St Edern's {{is built}} in the Perpendicular style using local stone, with blocks of cut {{sandstone}} as the external face. The roof is made from slate with stone copings and has a bellcote at the west end, with one bell (dating probably from the 17th century). There is one external buttress to the south-east of <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> to help support {{the weight of the}} building, and there are crosses {{on the roof of the}} porch and at the east end of <b>the</b> <b>nave</b> and chancel roofs.|$|E

50|$|Although it was redecorated in the Baroque {{style and}} has some 19th-century additions, {{it is still}} {{possible}} to see traces of the 5th-century plan, which was a basilica with three <b>naves.</b> <b>The</b> granite columns separating <b>the</b> <b>naves</b> are ancient.|$|R
5000|$|Dividing <b>the</b> <b>naves</b> and chancels is {{a central}} arcade in three bays. In the north wall are two tomb recesses, each {{containing}} two effigies dating probably from the 14th century. [...] These are thought to represent members of the Delabere family who lived locally. <b>The</b> <b>naves</b> are divided from the chancels by two large 16th-century wooden screens. In {{the middle of the}} screens is a Jacobean pulpit. [...] Each screen is in two bays, with a central door.|$|R
