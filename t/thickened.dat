30|$|A {{total of}} 29 CBCT scans met the {{inclusion}} criteria for evaluation, and 93.1 % {{of them had}} maxillary sinus mucosal/tissue <b>thickening.</b> Specifically, 6.9 % of cases exhibited no <b>thickening,</b> 6.9 % had minimal <b>thickening</b> (1 – 2  mm), 20.7 % of cases had moderate <b>thickening</b> (2 – 5  mm), and 65.5 % had severe <b>thickening</b> (> 5  mm). We propose these categorical measurements of tissue <b>thickening</b> as a new “mucosal <b>thickening</b> index.” The tissue <b>thickening</b> did not vary based on gender, age, or smoking status, nor did it relate to the underlying alveolar ridge height. However, patients {{with a history of}} periodontal diseases demonstrated a significant association with mucosal <b>thickening</b> (p[*]=[*] 0.0043). These data indicate that there is high implant and grafting success rate (100 %) in the maxillary sinus despite large and varied physiologic sinus mucosal/tissue <b>thickening.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Thickening</b> of the bowel wall is {{considered}} focal when it extends less than 5  cm [3, 11].

In addition to the clinical presentation, analysis of the wall symmetry, degree of <b>thickening</b> and perienteric abnormalities provides additional information for the correct diagnosis. In the setting of focal wall <b>thickening</b> three main scenarios may occur: (1) asymmetric focal <b>thickening,</b> (2) symmetric focal <b>thickening</b> and (3) perienteric abnormalities (fat stranding) disproportionately greater than the degree of wall <b>thickening.</b>|$|R

Therefore, we researched to get viscosity value in same concentration (2 % in water) to use 24 <b>thickening</b> agents. There are 3 times different viscosity value between highest and lowest <b>thickening</b> agents. If we make criteria which value over 350 mPa・s is high power <b>thickening</b> agent, 8 <b>thickening</b> agents are adapted. The Japanese Society of Dysphagia Rebilitation make criteria which show three different viscosity value.

40|$|Magnetorheological shear <b>thickening</b> fluid {{is a smart}} {{material}} that exhibits both magnetorheological and shear <b>thickening</b> effects. This study focuses on the design and development of a novel magnetorheological shear <b>thickening</b> fluid-based linear damper. First, micron-sized carbonyl iron particles, at a 20 % and 80 % weight fraction, were immersed among the shear <b>thickening</b> fluid base and thoroughly mixed under a high shear condition to produce the magnetorheological shear <b>thickening</b> fluid. Then, a monotube damper with a bypass was designed and fabricated. The testing results using an MTS machine show that the influence of incorporating shear <b>thickening</b> fluid allows the 20 % magnetorheological shear <b>thickening</b> fluid-filled damper to work in different dynamic loading velocities with the stiffness and damping changed, while, simultaneously, {{the dynamics of the}} damper depend on the variations in the magnetic field. The measured responses of the 20 % magnetorheological shear <b>thickening</b> fluid-filled damper prove that the dampers have both the MR effect and shear <b>thickening</b> effect. In contrast, the 80 % magnetorheological shear <b>thickening</b> fluid-filled damper behaves more like a conventional magnetorheological fluid-filled damper because its shear <b>thickening</b> effect is restrained and the MR effect becomes more obvious with higher iron volume...|$|R

5|$|The asci {{are long}} and cylindrical, and taper into a short stem-like base; they measure 300–375 by 14–16µm. Although in most Pezizales all of the ascospores are formed {{simultaneously}} through delimitation by an inner and outer membrane, in S.coccinea the ascospores located in the basal parts of the ascus develop faster. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are about 3µm wide (and only slightly <b>thickened</b> at the apex), and contain red pigment granules.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{interactions}} between close {{particles in the}} shear <b>thickening</b> of concentrated colloids is examined by using a Stokesian dynamics simulation of model systems. The interactions are repulsive thermodynamic forces and lubrication forces. Three different models are contrasted in their <b>thickening</b> behavior: Brownian spheres, polymer coated spheres, and Hookian spheres. Respectively, they show: a "mild" continuous <b>thickening,</b> a "strong" continuous <b>thickening,</b> and a strain <b>thickening</b> with loss of steady state. The relationship of order-disorder transitions and <b>thickening</b> is examined. Depending on the volume fraction and range of repulsive forces, <b>thickening</b> can be observed with or without an order-disorder transition at its onset. The different <b>thickening</b> responses arise from the dependence of the relaxation time of close particle contacts on interparticle gap. A time-scale based criterion for strong <b>thickening</b> is proposed {{and supported by the}} simulations. A simple theoretical model based the motion of a pair of particles leads to this criterion, but also predicts the mild <b>thickening</b> of Brownian spheres. It gives a simple fitting of flow curves which includes the details of the interparticle interactions. (C) 2004 The Society of Rheology. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective In {{this article}} we present a {{simplified}} algorithm-based approach to the <b>thickening</b> of the small and large bowel wall detected on routine computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen. Background <b>Thickening</b> of the small or large bowel wall {{may be caused by}} neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, or ischae-mic conditions. First, distinction should be made between focal and segmental or diffuse wall <b>thickening.</b> In cases of focal <b>thickening</b> further analysis of the wall symmetry and perienteric anomalies allows distinguishing between neo-plasms and inflammatory conditions. In cases of segmental or diffuse <b>thickening,</b> the pattern of attenuation in light of clinical findings helps narrowing the differential diagnosis. Conclusion Focal bowel wall <b>thickening</b> may be caused by tumours or inflammatory conditions. Bowel tumours may ap-pear as either regular and symmetric or irregular or asymmetric <b>thickening.</b> When fat stranding is disproportionatelymore severe than the degree of wall <b>thickening,</b> inflammatory conditions are more likely. With the exception of lymphoma, segmental or diffuse wall <b>thickening</b> is usually caused by benign conditions, such as ischaemic, infectious and inflammatory diseases. Key points • <b>Thickening</b> of the bowel wall may be focal ( 40 cm) in extension. • Focal, irregular and asymmetrical <b>thickening</b> of the bowel wall suggests a malignancy. • Perienteric fat stranding disproportionally more severe than the degree of wall <b>thickening</b> suggests an inflammatory condition. • Regular, symmetric and homogeneous wall <b>thickening</b> is more frequently due to benign conditions, but can also be caused by neoplasms such as well-differentiated adenocar-cinoma and lymphoma. • Segmental or diffuse bowel wall <b>thickening</b> is usually caused by ischaemic, inflammatory or infectious conditions and the attenuation pattern is helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis...|$|R
30|$|Encapsulating peritoneal {{sclerosis}} is {{a condition}} characterised by fibrotic <b>thickening</b> of the peritoneum, which can progress to the encasement or encapsulation of the small-bowel loops with a resultant bowel obstruction.

5|$|Adult Lepidoptera {{have two}} pairs of {{membranous}} wings covered, usually completely, by minute scales. A wing consists of an upper and lower membrane which are connected by minute fibres and strengthened by a system of <b>thickened</b> hollow ribs, popularly but incorrectly referred to as 'veins', as they may also contain tracheae, nerve fibres and blood vessels. The membranes are covered with minute scales which have jagged ends or hairs and are attached by hooks. The wings are moved by the rapid muscular contraction and expansion of the thorax.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes <b>thickened</b> and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} demonstrates close coevolution of {{host and}} parasite, {{for example in}} cuckoos. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay their eggs in nests of other species, ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong {{negative impact on the}} host's reproductive fitness. Their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as <b>thickened</b> eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.|$|E
30|$|Bowel wall <b>thickening</b> may be focal and {{segmental}} or diffuse. In {{cases of}} focal <b>thickening,</b> the degree and symmetry of <b>thickening</b> and perienteric abnormalities help narrow the differential diagnosis: while heterogeneous and asymmetric focal <b>thickening</b> is {{usually associated with}} malignancies, symmetric regular and homogeneous <b>thickening</b> {{may be caused by}} benign conditions but also well-differentiated tumours. Disproportionate fat stranding compared to the degree of wall <b>thickening</b> suggests inflammatory conditions. Segmental or diffuse bowel thickenings are usually caused by benign conditions, with the exception of lymphoma. Common causes include ischaemia, inflammatory and infectious conditions. The pattern of attenuation helps narrow the differential diagnosis of segmental or diffuse wall <b>thickening</b> but still there is a significant overlap on CT imaging findings of different non-neoplastic bowel conditions.|$|R

5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a <b>thickened,</b> rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects.

5|$|DDT {{pollution}} in the environment was {{a major cause of}} decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the northern anchovy. Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have <b>thickened</b> and their populations have largely recovered.|$|E
