40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} concept of a Morphing Upper Torso, an inno-vative pressure suit design that incorporates robotic elements to enable a resizable, highly mobile and easy to don/doff spacesuit. The torso is modeled as a system of interconnected, pressure-constrained, reduced-DOF, wire-actuated parallel ma-nipulators, that enable the dimensions of the suit to be reconfigured to match the wearer. The kinematics, dynamics and control of wire-actuated manipulators are de-rived and simulated, along with the Jacobian transforms, which relate the total twist vector of the system to the vector of actuator velocities. Tools are developed that allow calculation of the workspace for both single and interconnected reduced-DOF robots of this type, using knowledge of the link lengths. The forward kinematics and statics equations are combined and solved to produce the pose of the platforms along with the link <b>tensions.</b> These <b>tools</b> allow analysis of the full Morphing Upper Torso design, in which the back hatch of a rear-entry torso is interconnected with the waist ring, helmet ring and two scye bearings.

For realistic rendering, response of deformable soft tissue during cutting and suture process should be carefully analyzed and simulated. Therefore, different behaviors of tissue resistance need to be simulated respectively in different phases of tool tissue interaction. In {{the first phase of}} cutting and suture, we model resistance of the tissue as surface <b>tension</b> before the <b>tool</b> fractures the surface. Afterwards, friction between tool and soft tissue is modeled when the tool moves in the tissue. In addition, a hybrid elastic model of a mass-spring surface with a skeleton structure is employed to speed up calculation. In our research, an abstract blood vessel is used for case study...|$|R

It explains some terms and organisations producing systematic reviews. It also discusses controversies. The first concerns the criteria by which the quality of individual studies is assessed, the second the possible effects of the affiliation of some reviewers, and the third the value of formalisation of procedure (i. e. the <b>tensions</b> between formal <b>tools</b> and professional judgments). The article contrasts the evidence-based formalism with other formalisms as those by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Agency for Research on Cancer. It discusses systematic reviews in social science where interventions are complex, difficult to blind, and depend on context. Systematic reviews in working life research are often focusing on prevention. The formal evidence-based process may devaluate or disregard findings from mechanistic and observational studies. Hence such reviews may falsely conclude that existing knowledge {{about the risk of}} the factor is limited or nonexistent...|$|R
40|$|Cold Metal Forming {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} used sheet metal manufacturing processes because of high material efficiency, accuracy grade and surface quality as well as short cycle times of the produced parts. In order to reach the requirements for both quality of the components and process stability, minimizing tool wear {{is one of the}} main aims in this field. One of the most influential factors on wear development is the occurring process temperature. The dissipation of more than 80 % of the plastic work as well as frictional heating lead to a severe temperature rise in the forming zone, especially during processes with high <b>tension</b> between <b>tool</b> and workpiece respectively high strain rates like embossing and blanking. Beside the influence on the mechanical properties of the materials, the temperature rise causes thermoelec-tric voltages and currents. These thermoelectric phenomena in combination with the occurring temperature reinforce the wear mechanisms Adhesion and tribochemical reaction, which determine the tool wear development because they can appear right from the beginning. State of the art is the application of lubricants in order to minimize temperature and consequently wear by reducing friction, removing heat and building reaction layers due to the additives. However, in order to improve the understanding of the interactions between the surfaces of the tool and the sheet metal precise meas-urements of the temperature as well as the occurring thermoelectric voltages are essential. This report shows the measur-ing concept and the appearing thermoelectric voltage, current and temperature during blanking S 355 M...|$|R
40|$|Friction {{plays an}} {{important}} role in sheet metal forming (SMF) and the roughness of the surface of the sheet is a major factor that influences friction. In finite element method (FEM) models of metal forming, the roughness has usually been assumed to be constant; even though it is commonly observed that sheet drawn under <b>tension</b> over a <b>tool</b> radius results in the surface becoming shiny, indicating a major change in surface morphology. An elastic–plastic FEM model for micro-contact between a flat surface and a single roughness peak has been developed. The model was used to investigate the effect of the membrane stress in the sheet on the deformation of an artificial roughness peak. From the simulation results, the change in asperity, or deformation of the local peak, for a given nominal tool contact stress is significantly influenced by the local substrate stress. The height of the asperity decreases with increasing substrate stress and the local pressure is much higher than the nominal pressure. In addition, the local contact stress decreases with an increase in the substrate stress levels. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} a global phenomenon: mediated selfrepresentations by ‘ordinary people’, {{and focuses on}} public cultural institutions. In order to address how processes of mediation shape institutionally mediated self-representations, the article explores two UK projects, the Museum of London’s London’s Voices and BBC Wales’ Capture Wales. It is suggested that processes of institutional mediation are constituted through tensions in four key areas: {{the purposes of the}} projects; the construct of the ‘ordinary person’; the construct of ‘community’; and defining and achieving quality. I argue that critical analysis of the production processes shaping self-representations is crucial to examining the challenge to the power of media institutions implied by their inviting ‘ordinary people’ to represent themselves. The article concludes that, while institutional power is not fundamentally altered in the projects discussed, nevertheless empowerment of participants does have the potential to effect shifts in the role of public cultural institutions; and this is important at a time when that role is questioned, worldwide, as a result of technological, social and political developments. Finally, I suggest that the notion of mediation processes as constituted through <b>tensions,</b> provides analytic <b>tools</b> with which to critically examine the self-representation landscape...|$|R
40|$|Hypoxia is an {{important}} factor involved in the control of stem cells. To obtain a better insight into the phenotypical changes brought about by hypoxic preconditioning prior to chondrogenic differentiation; we have investigated growth, colony-forming and chondrogenic capacity, and global transcriptional responses of six adipose tissue-derived stem cell lines expanded at oxygen concentrations ranging from ambient to 1 %. The assessment of cell proliferation and colony-forming potential revealed that the hypoxic conditions corresponding to 1 % oxygen played a major role. The chondrogenic inducibility, examined by high-density pellet model, however, did not improve on hypoxic preconditioning. While the microarray analysis revealed a distinctive inter-donor variability, the exposure to 1 % hypoxia superseded the biological variability and produced a specific expression profile with 2581 significantly regulated genes and substantial functional enrichment in the pathways of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Additionally, exposure to 1 % oxygen resulted in upregulation of factors related to angiogenesis and cell growth. In particular, leptin (LEP), the key regulator of body weight and food intake was found to be highly upregulated. In conclusion, the results of this investigation demonstrate the significance of donor demographics and the importance of further studies into the use of regulated oxygen <b>tension</b> as a <b>tool</b> for preparation of ASCs in order to exploit their full potential...|$|R

We argue that nonperturbative dynamics of class S theories are described by 5 d maximal Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) twisted on the Riemann surface. In a sense, twisted 5 d SYM might {{be regarded as}} a “Lagrangian” for class S theories on R^ 1, 2 ×S^ 1. First, we show that twisted 5 d SYM gives generalized Hitchin’s equations which was proposed recently. Then, we discuss how to identify chiral operators with quantities in twisted 5 d SYM. Mesons, or holomorphic moment maps, are identified with operators at punctures which are realized as 3 d superconformal theories T ρ [G] coupled to twisted 5 d SYM. “Baryons” are identified qualitatively through a study of 4 d N [*]=[*] 2 Higgs branches.

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this project}} is to reconstruct the culture of New Zealanders serving in Bomber Command of the RAF during the Second World War. Similar work has emerged on the culture of British airmen but cultural histories looking specifically at New Zealand airmen are yet to emerge. In conducting a cultural history of this subject, this paper looks {{more closely at the}} airmens' behaviour, routines and emotions. To achieve this, it will focus on three main aspects of the New Zealanders' culture: rivalries, leisure and attitudes. Rivalries were commonplace and include sporting contests, which were encouraged as a morale boosting <b>tool,</b> <b>tensions</b> between members of aircrews, and also a bitter rivalry between Englishmen and New Zealanders which was caused by unpopular decision making by a handful of English commanders. Forms of leisure were particularly varied. Tourism was an activity New Zealanders commonly indulged in, as was visiting friends and extended family on leave, and frequenting the local concerts and stage shows. However it became clear that they had not quite grown out of their rebellious teenage selves as unsanctioned activities such as joy riding and pranks emerged. In the final chapter it is shown that the cheerful demeanour the men tried to present was the result of self-censorship to protect their families, and that once they began experiencing horrifying situations this demeanour became much harder to maintain...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{published}} papers, conference {{presentations and}} panels {{attest to the}} need and importance of teaching applications within mathematics courses. I will {{argue that there is}} benefit of teaching applications within any science discipline. By an “application” I mean any context (within science, or broader) which involves or requires some kind of quantitative thinking. For instance, arguments involving risk, chance, or uncertainty use probabilistic concepts. Every time we interpolate or extrapolate from a given set of data we employ functional relationships. In discussing dynamics of drug absorption we use exponential, or more complex mathematical models. Describing viruses infecting certain bacteria, or studying interactions between species in an ecosystem requires that we use mathematics tools. Mathematics is an abstract discipline, lot more so than other sciences – and hence the tensions I plan to discuss. Every time we discuss a scientific phenomenon, i. e., an application (say, a climate change) using quantitative <b>tools,</b> <b>tensions</b> inevitably show up. They are present in the ways we formulate the problem of our inquiry, in defining objects we study, in the assumptions we make, in the interpretations of results of experiments and mathematical calculations, and elsewhere. I will argue that, by contrasting the ways these tensions exist and function within each science discipline, we can create rich teaching and learning situations that will deepen our understanding of both math and sciences. Instead of being very abstract, I plan to discuss numerous examples to illustrate these situations...|$|R

Leadership development ininterprofessional settings is among the trends. This thesis examines how leadership development evolves in an interprofessional team. The interprofessional team was situated ina Norwegian context, and consisted of principals, administrators and researchers. The team was formed to support the principals in three schools in leading a local school improvement project aimed at increasing students’ expertise of approaching academic texts in different subjects with specific learning strategies. The study is based on artifacts, audio and video data. In particular the study examines how school data trigger and structure the departure point for professional development in an interprofessional team. The study also examines how and to what extent professionals from schools, a municipality, and a university develop a shared understanding of the collaboration. In addition the study examines how leadership development evolves when principals, administrators, and researchers jointly analyze different challenges in a school improvement project over two years of collaboration. Third generation Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) is chosen as a point of departure for creating an analytic framework for the study. The study includes three sub-studies. The overall findings suggest that how leadership development evolves can be characterized as: a struggle with ill-defined purposes of the collaboration; horizontal dynamics across professions and working contexts; explorative work, mediated and structured by tools. The findings also suggest that the dimensions of time and space influenced the boundary work in the team. The implication of the study is {{to pay attention to the}} role of <b>tools,</b> <b>tensions</b> and any ill-defined purposes when adjusting programs and designing opportunities for school leaders to develop their expertise in the futur...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe use {{of primary}} {{acoustic}} radiation forces {{has been shown}} to be a valid technique for the handling of micron sized suspended particles, such as beads or biological cells. These forces arise as a nonlinear effect when an acoustic wave or vibration, which is set up in the fluid by exciting to resonance the system containing the suspension, interacts with the particles. The typical frequencies (upper kHz - lower MHz range) and the periodicity (in the range of hundreds of micrometers) of the acoustic field make this technique particularly suited for the handling of particles within microfluidic systems. A variety of devices for separation, fractionation, trapping and positioning of beads or biological cells, working both in batch or fluid flow mode, have been proposed. With the exception of the ports used to inject or remove the sample or the carrier medium, these systems can be considered as closed systems. Nevertheless, access to the particles with external tools is sometimes needed after acoustic manipulation has been performed. For instance, particles or cells pre-positioned in a sequence along the centerline of a channel using acoustic radiation forces need to be removed from it using a microgripper for further handling. Furthermore, in the field of crystallography research protein crystals have to be placed one by one onto a nylon loop prior to X-ray analysis with synchrotron radiation. This is usually done using the loop to pick up the crystal from the solution where it has been growing with other ones. As this process is sometimes repeated for a large number of crystals there are efforts to automate it. To this purpose it would be advantageous to bring the crystals spatially separated into a known position where they than can be sequentially collected with the loop. Here strategies for single particle manipulation are presented combining the effects of acoustic fields, fluid flow, surface <b>tension</b> and external <b>tools.</b> They are discussed by means of numerical results from FE-simulations of both two and three dimensional models as well as corresponding experiments...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a qualitative study which examines teachers’ and pupils’ experiences of drama tasks in secondary school subject lessons other than Drama, where the tasks are incorporated {{in pursuit of}} curriculum-defined teaching and learning goals. I take a cultural-historical perspective in my analysis, interrogating the possibilities for meaningful appropriations of drama as a pedagogical toolkit by examining social interaction and communication within the cultural context {{of the classroom and}} how these practices may have developed over time. Set in four secondary school classrooms in the UK, the study focused on the experiences of teachers, (who are not trained drama specialists), and their pupils as they undertook drama tasks as part of curriculum lessons. I carried out a series of lesson observations, supplemented by interviews with participants. Using Cultural Historical Activity Theory (Cole 1996, Engeström 1987, Engeström 1999) as a heuristic tool, I created an analytical framework that explored the <b>tensions</b> between communicative <b>tools,</b> rules of the classroom space, and teacher-pupil and peer relations. This theoretical stance appreciates both the dynamic nature of classrooms and the possibilities for pedagogies of choice. The emphasis on tool-mediated action offers a fresh perspective in that it creates a structured and detailed framework for exploring the subtle and complex process of empathetic thought. This study reveals some {{of the ways in which}} tensions occur and existing and historically-embedded cultural practices are brought to the surface, and reinforced or challenged. I provide extracts from the data to illustrate a concern for an assessment-driven acquisition of curriculum content is a particular constraint, along with varying opportunities for both teacher and pupils to construct a framework for spontaneous in-role action within the dramatic form. The appropriation of communicative tools, although influential in achieving goals, does not always preclude emotional investment in the tasks. Although there are shifts from teacher authority to increased pupil decision-making, the way in which the teacher and pupils operate in these drama tasks reveals as much about the established and reinforced learning and social practices of the classroom, as the way these practices are changed. The research considers how drama as a pedagogical toolkit has developed historically, and it reveals implications for future study and practice relating to the understanding of drama-as-toolkit within formal educational settings.

40|$|The {{fields of}} static {{balancing}} and tensegrity structures {{are combined into}} statically balanced tensegrity mechanisms. This combination results in {{a new class of}} prestressed structures that behave like mechanisms: although member lengths and orientations change, they can be deformed into a wide range of positions, while continuously remaining in equilibrium; in other words, the structures have zero stiffness. The key to these structures is the use of zero-free-length springs as <b>tension</b> members. The <b>tools</b> of structural engineering were used to search for, and understand, zero-stiffness modes in the tangent stiffness matrix of prestressed pin-jointed bar frameworks. To this end the recently uncovered parallels between structural engineering and mathematical rigidity theory were exploited. Mathematical literature described that affine transformations preserve the equilibrium of a tensegrity structure; these findings gained value when translated from a mathematical concept into the engineering terms rigid-body motions, shear and dilation. Not only did these transformations prove to be instrumental for describing zero stiffness, but it also provided new insight in the form-finding methods for tensegrity structures: the minimum nullity requirement for the stress matrix is formed by the affine transformations. In this research it was shown that affine transformations of the structure that preserve the length of conventional members are zero-stiffness modes valid over finite displacements: these are statically balanced zero-stiffness modes. What is more, for prestress stable structures with a positive semi-definite stress matrix of maximal rank [...] meaning there are only affine transformations in its nullspace [...] those are the only possible zero-stiffness modes. The length-preserving affine transformations exist if and only if the directions of the conventional members lie on a conic at infinity. If all conventional member directions lie on a conic, the number of independent length-preserving affine transformations can then be found with a simple counting rule. A systematic analysis of the zero-stiffness modes in the tangent stiffness matrix of a prestressed pin-jointed bar framework yielded several interesting scenarios that warrant further attention, as they cannot be fully described within the currently developed framework. Finally, a demonstration prototype was designed and constructed to illustrate the properties of statically balanced tensegrity mechanisms; the prototype serves as a proof of concept, not as a practically applicable design. Prior to construction, the range of motion of the tensegrity used for the prototype was extensively analysed using the analytic equilibrium conditions. The results were instrumental in dimensioning the prototype. BioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|As {{many other}} ethno-cultural identities in Europe, the {{collective}} self perceptions of Scotland's Gaels and the Sorbs of Lusatia are undergoing considerable changes. Proceeding from the post-structuralist premise that discourse plays {{a crucial part}} in the generation of knowledge, power and social behaviour (Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard), the study addresses {{the ways in which}} the Gaelic and Sorbian elites incorporate the language aspect into narratives on cultural continuity and considers the implications of accelerated language shift towards English/German and the survivalist promotion of the ancestral medium for the maintenance of group boundaries. Its primary empirical data corpus comprises more than 100 interviews and a questionnaire survey (n= 201) conducted during the late 1990 s in peripheral parts of the Ghidhealtachd and bilingual territories of Lusatia, publications by Gaelic and Sorbian organisations, and relevant items from the local and national media. A brief exploration of {{the ways in which the}} two communities came to think of themselves as distinct reveals that a substantial legacy of cultural nationalism and pan-Slavism allowed the Sorbian intelligentsia to sustain a strong sense of ethnic difference throughout the 19 th and 20 th centuries, whereas Scotland's Gaels have never overtly embraced this paradigm in political terms. Their elite was confronted with its premises during their reinvention as Scotland's Celts and combined linguistic patriotism with calls for socioeconomic improvements during the 1880 s, but it has been rather reluctant to portray contemporary and future users of the ancestral language as a distinct nation or ethnic group. To the present day, Gaels are inclined to perceive themselves to be a key component, and arguably the kernel, of the Scottish nation. The most significant overlap between Gaelic- and Sorbian-related revival discourses has been the notion that a complete decline of the traditional medium would seal the fate of the associated culture, though the underlying rationales indicate a gradual shift from an essentialising agenda of preservation and exclusion to a more liberal and pluricentric approach. A desire to withstand the homogenising forces of capitalist globalisation fuels purist attitudes with regard to specific cultural forms, many of which are thought to depend on the traditional medium and put native speakers with heartland links into positions of authority. At the same time, the Gaelic and Sorbian heritage are treated as sources of alternative values and wisdom, in which context Gaelic/Sorbian language ability is primarily valued as an access <b>tool.</b> <b>Tensions</b> between essentialist and dynamic perspectives also occur over the development of the languages themselves. They are enhanced by the assumption that the 'survival' of Gaelic and Sorbian depends in part on individuals who acquire and transmit them outside the bilingual districts, where an ability in the minority medium is more likely to generate subcultural, regional and political identities than a radical ethno-cultural reorientation. According to this study's findings, the linguocentric agendas of many Gaelic and Sorbian organisations can neither be attributed to a naive belief in linguistic determinism nor be dismissed as an entirely symbolic ingredient for the restoration of justice and pride where historic circumstances inflicted marginalisation and oppression. They are based on a justified concern that the complete demise of a linguistic boundary would make it impossible to generate separate discursive spaces, to which Gaelic and Sorbian culture have in most locations become reduced and for which a separate literature and separate electronic media are indispensable...|$|R
