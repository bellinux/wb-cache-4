25|$|Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code covers Jon Spiro's {{theft of}} the fictional C Cube and its recovery. Jon Spiro is an {{extremely}} dangerous businessman who has his bodyguard injure Butler and steals Artemis's C Cube, which was a supercomputer that he made from stolen fairy technology. Butler, after almost dying, is cured by the elf fairy, Holly Short, but they are attacked by a gang that Jon Spiro hired multiple times. One {{member of the group}} was actually the dwarf Mulch Diggums, who upon hearing that they would attack Fowl Manor, decides to abandon the group and help Artemis. With the help of the dwarf and Butler's sister, Juliet, they raid Spiro Needle, the building and company of Jon, and retrieve the C Cube again. It ends with the fairies and Foaly mindwiping the 3 humans, and Artemis gives <b>to</b> <b>Mulch</b> Diggums, a medallion that Holly gave to Artemis in The Arctic Incident, while secretly there was a disk inside of the medallion that would bring back his memories of the fairies.|$|E

50|$|Plastic mulch is {{a product}} used, {{in a similar fashion}} <b>to</b> <b>mulch,</b> to {{suppress}} weeds and conserve water in crop production and landscaping. Certain plastic mulches also act as a barrier to keep methyl bromide, both a powerful fumigant and ozone depleter, in the soil. Crops grow through slits or holes in thin plastic sheeting. Plastic mulch is often used in conjunction with drip irrigation. Some research has been done using different colors of mulch to affect crop growth. This method is predominant in large-scale vegetable growing, with millions of acres cultivated under plastic mulch worldwide each year. Disposal of plastic mulch is cited as an environmental problem; however, technologies exist to provide for the recycling of used/disposed plastic mulch into viable plastic resins for re-use in the plastics manufacturing industry.|$|E
5000|$|Wood {{chips are}} a {{byproduct}} of the pruning of trees by arborists, utilities and parks; {{they are used to}} dispose of bulky waste. Tree branches and large stems are rather coarse after chipping and tend {{to be used as a}} mulch at least three inches thick. The chips are used to conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature and suppress weed growth. The decay of freshly produced chips from recently living woody plants, consumes nitrate; this is often off set with a light application of a high-nitrate fertilizer. Wood chips are most often used under trees and shrubs. When used around soft stemmed plants, an unmulched zone is left around the plant stems to prevent stem rot or other possible diseases. They are often used <b>to</b> <b>mulch</b> trails, because they are readily produced with little additional cost outside of the normal disposal cost of tree maintenance. Wood chips come in various colors.|$|E
40|$|Mulching in {{sugarcane}} agriculture involves retaining leaf residue on {{the ground}} after harvesting. Many sugarcane industries across the world support this agronomic practice because of its benefits as opposed to burning sugarcane at harvest. In the South African industry, however, there have been isolated reports of negative responses of certain cultivars <b>to</b> <b>mulching.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the cane yield and quality responses, population dynamics, and mulch yields of popular sugarcane cultivars <b>to</b> <b>mulching</b> in three major agronomic regions of South Africa. A field trial was established in each of the three major South African sugarcane production regions (Coastal rainfed, Northern irrigated, Midlands) in 2008. Each trial comprised eight of the most popular cultivars for the respective regions. Trials were planted as 2 x 8 factorial strip-plots with four replicates. Burning and mulching were the main plots (strips) and cultivar was sub-plot. In the coastal rainfed and the irrigated region cultivar responses <b>to</b> <b>mulching</b> were evaluated over a period of three summer crops (1 st, 2 nd, and 3 rd ratoon) and one winter crop (5 th ratoon), while the Midlands trial was harvested for one summer crop (1 st ratoon). The impact on stalk population, heights and soil water was evaluated during each growing season. Cane yields (TCANE), estimated recoverable crystal percentage (ERC) and ERC yields (TERC), as well as mulch yields were determined at each harvest.

40|$|In a 10 -year project, {{the authors}} tested the {{performance}} of complete tree harvesting as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>mulching</b> in the geometric first thinning of young Mediterranean pine, in flat, sandy soils. In 1998, a simple machine set-up was used to uproot removal trees, chip them, and extract the biomass to a roadside landing. Time study data were collected to obtain reliable estimates of processing productivity and were later turned into harvesting cost figures by applying current machine operating costs. In 2008, the same experimental plots were measured again for tree mortality and growth {{to determine if the}} seemingly traumatic process of uprooting had resulted in any major negative impacts. It was concluded that complete tree harvesting is a viable option for the geometric first thinning of young pine plantations: under the conditions of this study, it is preferable <b>to</b> <b>mulching</b> <b>to</b> waste whenever the delivered price of chips exceeds 30 Euro per ton (€f 1). Financial sustainability is reached for a chip price in the order of 40 €t- 1.

40|$|The {{perceived}} negative cultivar responses <b>to</b> <b>mulching</b> {{has limited}} {{the adoption of}} this practice in the South African sugarcane industry. This study was aimed at evaluating cane yield and quality responses and population dynamics of popular cultivars <b>to</b> <b>mulching</b> in the rainfed region of South Africa. A four-replicate field trial was established using a strip-plot design. Cane and tonnes estimated recoverable crystal yields (TERC) yields, and yield components were determined in three summer ratoons and one winter ratoon. In-season soil water and temperature were monitored. Mulching significantly improved cane and TERC of all cultivars across ratoons. The highest improvements in cane and TERC were 85 % (N 45) and 92 % (N 39), respectively. The improvements were attributed to the higher soil water content under the mulch blanket. Stalk height, mass and population (winter ratoon) were improved at harvest for most cultivars across ratoons with mulching. Mulching reduced emergence and tillering presumably due to lower soil temperatures under the mulch blanket. The highest mulch-yielding cultivars were N 47 and N 42, for which yield increased by 15 and 13 t ha− 1, respectively. Mulching was beneficial for sugarcane production, regardless of the cultivar and ratooning season, and can be recommended for all current cultivars in the coastal rainfed region.

40|$|The {{research}} in this chapter was motivated by the hypothesis that long-term improvement in banana production in Uganda will be achieved by simultaneously solving the problems of pests or diseases and soil fertility depletion.

Information about {{the factors that influence}} whether banana farmers invest in soil fertility management is scant.

A factor analysis is used to cluster a set of soil fertility management practices that are jointly applied into those related <b>to</b> <b>mulch</b> and manure application. The influence of household, farm, market, and social characteristics of farmers on decisions about soil fertility management is estimated using a probit regression, an ordinary least squares regression, and a two-step Heckman estimation procedure.

40|$|Soil {{fumigation}} with {{methyl bromide}} (MB) {{is a common}} practice for the control of many soilborne pathogens in Italy. However recent restrictions are stimulating the application of new fumigants in Italy, generally characterised by a narrower spectrum of activity. Among possible alternatives, 1, 3 dichloropropene (1, 3 D) has been taken into consideration: this fumigant, already registered in Italy for application in broadcast fumigation, is very active against nematodes in sandy soils (Tacconi and Ambrogioni, 1995) and only slightly effective against soil borne pathogens. In order to broaden its spectrum of activity, a mixture of 1, 3 D + chloropicrin [Telone C- 35 -Dow AgroSciences, chloropicrin (PIC) 35 % + 1, 3 D 61 %] is under registration in Italy.

Identifying critical source areas of sediment and phosphorus nonpoint pollutant loads under alternative land use scenarios is {{aided by the}} use of hydrologic models. We applied the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to the Willow River watershed in St. Croix County, Wisconsin, {{to examine the effects of}} possible future scenarios and best management practices. The model was calibrated and validated to water year (WY) 1999 and WY 2006 datasets, respectively, with land use configured for each year. The model performed well in calibration, but could not simulate conditions outside of the calibration conditions in the validation dataset. Sediment and phosphorus trapping was influenced by trapping between the landscape source and the watershed outlet in closed-drainage lakes, flow-through wetlands, and on-stream reservoirs. The relative contributions of pollutants were related to the landscape position of the source area and the number and trapping efficiency of the intermediate traps in the flow path. We simulated best management practices including lowered soil-test phosphorus, increased conservation tillage, lowered cattle dietary phosphorus, and changed agricultural crop rotations. Simulations demonstrated that conversion <b>to</b> <b>mulch</b> tillage and no-till from conventional tillage could reduce sediment yield on the converted lands by 3 % to 27 % and phosphorus yield by 5 % to 21 %. For the current mix of agricultural land management in the Willow Watershed, converting all cropland <b>to</b> <b>mulch</b> tillage would reduce watershed export of phosphorus by 1 % and sediment export by 1 %. Converting all of the agricultural land to no-till produced a modeled decrease in watershed export of sediment of 2 % and a decrease in phosphorus of 7 %. Simulations also demonstrated a 22 % reduction watershed phosphorus export by reducing average agricultural soil-test phosphorus to 20 ppm. Converting all farm land from a mixture of cash grain rotations to a dairy rotation that included two years of corn and three years of alfalfa caused a modeled reduction in watershed phosphorus export of 15 % and a modeled reduction in sediment export of iii 5 %. Continued conversion of agricultural land to rural residential land uses produced lower modeled loads of watershed sediment export up to 13 % and phosphorus export up to 27 % depending on the area developed and the average lot size. Changes in point source phosphorus because of better wastewater treatment caused a decrease in modeled phosphorus delivery of 13 % between the calibration and validation time periods. Alternative climate scenarios were also simulated, showing that evapotranspiration was the driver of the altered hydrologic cycle, and thus the driver of reduced sediment and phosphorus export...|$|E
