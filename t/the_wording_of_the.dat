40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many {{questions}} concerning <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Qur'an is whether their content and meaning were truly a divine revelation {{or they were}} revealed to the Prophet from God and then transferred into <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>words.</b> In this regard, there are two perspectives. First, as all Muslims believe, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> a divine revelation, where­as the second viewpoint is that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are written by a human and not God. According to this latter perspective, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are sayings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophet <b>of</b> which only <b>the</b> contents {{are based on a}} divine revelation. <b>The</b> theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an not being a divine revelation has been an abandoned and rejected one throughout the Islamic history. This is the reason it has not been <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> any pertinent discussions. How can <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an be created by Muhammad or Gabriel even though it is believed that the Qur'an is a miracle? This article first defines <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> revelation and then analyzes various viewpoints and opinions regarding this topic in order to conclude (with evidence) that <b>the</b> Qur'an is <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> God and not <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophet. If he had composed <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an and expressed <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revelation in his own <b>words,</b> then <b>the</b> Qur'an would not be <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> God. In this case, <b>the</b> term 'word <b>of</b> God' indicates that <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'word' should be considered. Thus, it is clear that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an are divine and they can be referred and attributed to God...|$|R

5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the {{resolution}} of independence, Congress turned its attention to the committee's draft of the declaration. Over several days of debate, they made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text and, on July 4, 1776, <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Declaration of Independence was approved and sent to the printer for publication.|$|E

5|$|After the {{conviction}} for manslaughter in 1967 of the Christian Scientist mother of five-year-old Lisa Sheridan, who died without medical care in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the church lobbied the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) {{to add a}} religious exemption to the Code of Federal Regulations. Added in 1974, this stated that parents who did not provide medical treatment for a child for religious reasons would not be considered negligent. States were thereafter obliged to include exemptions or lose funding; <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exemptions made clear that they referred to Christian Science.|$|E

5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read the letters (he only says {{that he has}} {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors. Whatever the case, <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of its significance. Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, actor James Garner claimed {{responsibility}} for <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slogan during an interview with Playboy magazine. Garner, who narrated the original commercial, stated that his first action ever to be captured on film was to misread the line that had been provided to him. However, as noted above, the advertisements first appeared in print before their debut on television, which cast doubt on Garner's claim.|$|E

5|$|Under the Royal Assent Act 1967, {{royal assent}} can be {{granted by the}} {{sovereign}} in writing, by means of letters patent, that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of parliament. Then, the presiding officer makes a formal, but simple statement to the house, acquainting each house that royal assent has been granted to the acts mentioned. Thus, unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by Royal Commissioners, the method created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly {{for the purpose of}} receiving the notice of royal assent. The standard text of the letters patent is set out in The Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992, with minor amendments in 2000. In practice this remains the standard method, a fact that is belied by <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> letters patent for the appointment of the Royal Commissioners and by <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> letters patent for the granting of royal assent in writing under the 1967 Act ("...

5|$|Hughes {{countered that}} he did not believe <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1957 {{document}} gave Rhodesia the right to devise its own representation overseas without first gaining assent from Britain. The Reedman appointment would probably be seen internationally as a major rise in Rhodesian diplomatic profile, he said, and might damage Britain's reputation, which would in turn make the ongoing negotiations for independence more difficult for both sides. He repeated Bottomley's previous offer of a consul on the British Embassy staff, adding that the official would not have to be physically located within the embassy, and could set up his own office elsewhere so long as he remained nominally affiliated to it.|$|E
5|$|The {{amendment}} defined pornography as a {{civil rights}} violation against women, and allowed women who claimed harm from pornography to sue the producers and distributors in civil court for damages. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council, but vetoed both times by Mayor Don Fraser, who considered <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinance to be too vague. Another version of the ordinance passed in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1984, but was overturned as unconstitutional under the First Amendment by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in the case American Booksellers v. Hudnut. Dworkin continued to support the civil rights approach in her writing and activism, and supported anti-pornography feminists who organized later campaigns in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1985) and Bellingham, Washington (1988) to pass versions of the ordinance by voter initiative.|$|E

5|$|The need {{to include}} the various {{elements}} of the British Empire in coronations was not considered until 1902, when it was attended by the prime ministers and governors-general of the British Dominions, by then almost completely autonomous, and also {{by many of the}} rulers of the Indian Princely States and the various British Protectorates. An Imperial Conference was held afterwards. In 1911, the procession inside Westminster Abbey included the banners of the dominions and the Indian Empire along with the traditional banners of the Home Nations. By 1937, the Statute of Westminster 1931 had made the dominions fully independent, and <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coronation oath was amended to include their names and confine the elements concerning religion to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|As {{minister}} {{in charge of}} the Four Year Plan, Göring became concerned with the lack of natural resources in Germany, and began pushing for Austria to be incorporated into the Reich. The province of Styria had rich iron ore deposits, and {{the country as a whole}} was home to many skilled labourers that would also be useful. Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met on 12 February 1938 with Austrian chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg, threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming. The Nazi party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March. When Hitler did not approve of <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plebiscite, Göring telephoned Schuschnigg and Austrian head of state Wilhelm Miklas to demand Schuschnigg's resignation, threatening invasion by German troops and civil unrest by the Austrian Nazi Party members. Schuschnigg resigned on 11 March and the plebiscite was cancelled. By 5:30 the next morning, German troops that had been massing on the border marched into Austria, meeting no resistance.|$|E
5|$|It {{was hoped}} by Stuart and Rainer that the Batavian {{governor}} Johan Van Angelbeek might {{be persuaded to}} allow a peaceful occupation of Ceylon by British forces, {{especially in light of}} the Kew Letters from William of Orange, which advocated cooperation with British forces. A Major Agnew was sent ashore at Colombo to negotiate and his attempts to persuade Van Angelbeek to allow 300 British troops to land at Fort Oostenberg, which overlooked Trincomalee, were successful. On arrival off the port on the eastern coast of Ceylon on 1 August however the commander of the defences refused to acknowledge the instruction, citing problems with <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instructions. For two days attempts were made to convince the Batavian commander, the British position partially undermined by the destruction of Diomede in Trincomalee harbour after striking an uncharted rock.
