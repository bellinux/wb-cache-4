5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of <b>those</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.|$|E
5|$|LGBT, or GLBT, is an initialism {{that stands}} for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. In use since the 1990s, {{the term is}} an {{adaptation}} of the initialism LGB, which was used to replace the term gay {{in reference to the}} LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s. Activists believed that the term gay community did not accurately represent all <b>those</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> it referred.|$|E

5|$|The first trade dollars {{were struck}} in 1873, and the {{majority}} of the coins were sent to China. Eventually, bullion producers began converting large amounts of silver into trade dollars, causing the coins to make their way into American commercial channels. This caused frustration among <b>those</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> they were given in payment, as the coins were largely maligned and traded for less than one dollar each. In response to their wide distribution in American commerce, the coins were officially demonetized in 1876, but continued to circulate. Production of business strikes ended in 1878, though the mintage of proof coins officially continued until 1883. The trade dollar was re-monetized when the Coinage Act of 1965 was signed into law.|$|E

Some products were shipped with plugs and internal wiring meant for the U.S. market, making them unusable in Britain (in a few cases, the company did provide a power converter, the FTC conceded). Even products usable in Britain turned out not to have been manufactured for sale there, or in the European Union (EU) generally, meaning they were not covered by manufacturers' warranties.|$|E

25|$|This United States Supreme Court case {{occurred}} over the argument of tribal water rights, {{and whether or not}} the water rights are passed along with the tribal land. When American Indian reservations would sell allotments of land to non-tribe members, <b>those</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> the land was sold would want the same proportion of the reservation's water that the previous American Indian land owner had received. The Supreme Court upheld the earlier ruling that water rights are passed along with the land, meaning that a person who purchases land from an American Indian reservation also purchases an allotment of the water source used on the reservation.|$|E
25|$|Justice White {{concluded}} that {{nothing in the}} record showed that the United States intended to withdraw the riparian water rights of the landholders when it built Water Street and cut the landholders off from the Potomac River. White also engaged in a lengthy discussion of the laying out of the city's boundaries, and the conveyance of private property to the federal government. There could be no doubt, White argued, that the private landowners intended to give all of their riparian rights to the federal government, {{and there could be}} no doubt that the federal government intended to give all riparian rights to <b>those</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> it sold the land. The majority's argument led to a tautology in which no riparian rights existed.|$|E

25|$|The metaphor {{illustrates}} {{the argument that}} free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through over-exploitation, temporarily or permanently. This occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups, each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it, while {{the costs of the}} exploitation are borne by all <b>those</b> <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> the resource is available (which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it). This, in turn, causes demand for the resource to increase, which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses (even if it retains a capacity to recover). The rate at which depletion of the resource is realized depends primarily on three factors: the number of users wanting to consume the common in question, the consumptiveness of their uses, and the relative robustness of the common.|$|E

Historians, like Zaki Muhammad, accused Uthman for allegation corruption particularly in the case of Waleed ibn Uqba. Muhammad Zaki also accused Walid for being one of the worst of Uthman's nepotistic relative as he points out the diminishing features of Walid's dishonesty and unpopularity among the peoples of caliphate. However modern Sunni historian regard Walid was not as bad. Dr. A.M.
