5|$|Bashō was {{introduced}} to poetry at a young age, and after integrating himself into the intellectual scene of Edo (modern Tokyo) he quickly became well known throughout Japan. He made {{a living as a}} teacher; but then renounced the social, urban life of the literary circles and was inclined <b>to</b> <b>wander</b> throughout the country, heading west, east, and far into the northern wilderness to gain inspiration for his writing. His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating the feeling of a scene in a few simple elements.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May 2008, Sabina was {{released}} from court without a full psychiatric evaluation having pleaded guilty to trespass on the motorway and hitting a police officer. The court sentenced her to one day in custody which she had been deemed to have served having spent a full night in police custody. Leaving court she began <b>to</b> <b>wander</b> the streets of Stoke-on-Trent, seemingly attempting to reach her sister in hospital, carrying her possessions in a clear plastic bag given to her by police.|$|E
5|$|The open {{nature of}} the New Forest means that ponies are able <b>to</b> <b>wander</b> onto roads. The ponies {{actually}} have right of way over vehicles and many wear reflective collars {{in an effort to}} reduce traffic fatalities, but despite this, many ponies, along with commoners' cattle, pigs, and donkeys are killed or injured in road traffic accidents every year. Human interaction with ponies is also a problem; well meaning but misguided visitors to the forest frequently feed them, which can create dietary problems and sickness (eg colic) and cause the ponies to adopt an aggressive attitude in order to obtain human food.|$|E

At the hospital, where Amir is being treated by Pardi, Tati learns the truth behind Amir's absence. On his deathbed, Amir asks Pardi to take care of Tati; the two are later married.|$|E
5|$|By the 1820s, {{visitors}} could {{purchase an}} early guidebook {{at the site}} outlining the castle's history, and Victorian tourists recorded being charged six-pence <b>to</b> <b>wander</b> around the castle. In the early 1820s, the antiquarian Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick attempted to purchase the site, {{with the aim of}} converting the castle back into a private dwelling, but was unable to convince the owners to sell. Instead, Meyrick built the neo-gothic Goodrich Court in a similar style next door, which greatly displeased Wordsworth when he returned to Goodrich in 1841 and found the view spoilt by the new building. The new bridge over the river Wye, built in 1828, and the 1873 railway line added to the number of visitors.|$|E
5|$|Castro {{was known}} for his busy working hours, often only going to bed at 3 or 4 a.m. He {{preferred}} to meet foreign diplomats in these early hours, believing that they would be tired and he could gain the upper hand in negotiations. He described Ernest Hemingway as his favorite writer, and enjoyed reading but was uninterested in music. A sports fan, he also spent much of his time trying to keep fit, undertaking regular exercise. He took a great interest in gastronomy, as well as wine and whisky, and as Cuban leader was known <b>to</b> <b>wander</b> into his kitchen to discuss cookery with his chefs. Castro had a lifelong love of guns, and a preference for life in the countryside over the city.|$|E

She has been cursed for centuries, unable to rest, because she saw Christ on the cross and laughed at His pains. Now she can never weep, only jeer, and she is enslaved to Klingsor as well. Parsifal rejects her again but then asks her to lead him to Amfortas. She begs him to stay with her for just one hour, and then she will take him to Amfortas.

5|$|Orwell wrote six novels: Burmese Days, A Clergyman's Daughter, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, Coming Up for Air, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Most {{of these}} were semi-autobiographical. Burmese Days was {{inspired}} by his period working as an imperial policeman and is fictionalized; A Clergyman's Daughter follows {{a young woman who}} passes out from overwork and wakes up an amnesiac, forced <b>to</b> <b>wander</b> the countryside as she finds herself, eventually losing her belief in God, despite being the daughter of a clergyman. Keep the Aspidistra Flying and Coming Up for Air are examinations of the British class system. Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four are his most famous novels: both are anti-totalitarian books which criticize the Soviet Union in particular.|$|E

5|$|Super Mario 64 DS is a 3D {{platformer}} {{in which}} the player controls four different characters through numerous levels to collect 150 Power Stars, 30 more than the original game. Each level is an enclosed world {{in which the}} player is free <b>to</b> <b>wander</b> in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are inhabited with enemies that attack the characters as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask for help. The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As the player collects stars, more areas of the castle become accessible.|$|E

5|$|After {{defeating}} Dong Zhuo, Liu Bei and his sworn brothers Zhang Fei and Guan Yu {{are forced}} <b>to</b> <b>wander</b> {{the land in}} search of a home. Since the people love Liu Bei, Cao Cao sets out to destroy him. In 200 AD, Guan Yu returns to Liu Bei after an escape ("Tales"), making it through many gates to ships on the river. At Ru Nan ("Tales"), Liu Bei is rejoined by Guan Yu and is now followed by Zhao Yun, who saves him from advancing infantry. Cao Cao is defeated, but Liu Bei must continue wandering. In 208 AD, Liu Bei finds talent in a strategist known as Zhuge Liang, who agreed to follow him after Liu Bei visited him three times. Zhuge Liang proves his worth by defeating Cao Cao's army in a series of ambushes at the Battle of Bo Wan Po and Liu Bei successfully manages to flee to Sun Jian in Wu after the Battle of Changban, where Zhao Yun saved his son. Sun Jian agrees to assist Liu Bei in his goal of defeating Cao Cao, and Wu strategist Zhou Yu teams up with Zhuge Liang to execute a fire attack that destroyed Cao Cao's fleet at the Battle of Chi Bi.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free <b>to</b> <b>wander</b> outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It {{is not unusual for}} a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves in order to be regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin went to Australia {{to learn}} more about Aboriginal culture, {{specifically}} the songlines or dreaming tracks. Each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map, and each Aboriginal Australian has their own songline. Chatwin thought the songlines could be a metaphor he could use to support his ideas about humans' need <b>to</b> <b>wander,</b> which he believed was genetic. However, he struggled to fully understand and describe the songlines and their place in Aboriginal culture. This was due to Chatwin's approach to learning about the songlines. He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia, during which he primarily relied on non-Aboriginal people for information. Chatwin was limited by his inability to speak the Aboriginal languages. He interviewed people involved in the Land Rights movement, and he alienated many of them because he was oblivious to the politics and also because he was an admirer of Strehlow's work.|$|E

5|$|In {{his article}} of 2002, Alan A. Stone, {{who as a}} member of team had {{examined}} Pyotr Grigorenko and found him mentally healthy in 1979, disregarded the findings of the World Psychiatric Association and the later avowal of Soviet psychiatrists themselves and put forward the academically revisionist theory that there was no political abuse of psychiatry as a tool against pacific dissidence in the former USSR. He asserted {{that it was time for}} psychiatry in the Western countries to reconsider the supposedly documented accounts of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR in the hope of discovering that Soviet psychiatrists were more deserving of sympathy than condemnation. In Stone's words, he believes that Snezhnevsky was wrongly condemned by critics. According to Stone, one of the first points the Soviet psychiatrists who have been condemned for unethical political abuse of psychiatry make is that the revolution is the greatest good for the greatest number, the greatest piece of social justice, and the greatest beneficence imaginable in the twentieth century. In the Western view, the ethical compass of the Soviet psychiatrists begins <b>to</b> <b>wander</b> when they act in the service of this greatest beneficence.|$|E
5|$|Many castles saw {{increased}} visitors by tourists, {{helped by}} better transport links {{and the growth}} of the railways. The armouries at the Tower of London opened for tourists in 1828 with 40,000 visitors in their first year; by 1858 the numbers had grown to over 100,000 a year. Attractions such as Warwick Castle received 6,000 visitors during 1825 to 1826, many of them travelling from the growing industrial towns in the nearby Midlands, while Victorian tourists recorded being charged six-pence <b>to</b> <b>wander</b> around the ruins of Goodrich Castle. The spread of the railway system across Wales and the Marches strongly influenced the flow of tourists to the region's castles. In Scotland tourist tours became increasingly popular during the 19th century, usually starting at Edinburgh complete with Edinburgh Castle, and then spending up to two weeks further north, taking advantage of the expanding rail and steamer network. Blair Castle remained popular, but additional castles joined the circuit – Cawdor Castle became popular once the railway line reached north to Fort William.|$|E
5|$|Maple noted that, unusually—given {{his role}} as a cunning man—Pickingill did not charge for his services, but did receive some money from visitors, and that his {{recorded}} roles included restoring lost property and curing minor ailments, both of which were common practices amongst British cunning folk. According to one account, he cured a woman of rheumatism by transferring the ailment to her father. Maple wrote that Pickingill was known to use cursing and malevolent magic on occasion, something that the folklorist contrasted with the activities of other contemporary cunning folk that he had studied, such as James Murrell. At harvest time, Maple recorded, Pickingill was known <b>to</b> <b>wander</b> around the field threatening to bewitch farm machinery, with many farmers thus offering him beer so that he would leave them alone. He was also recorded as coercing local people to obtain water for him from the village pump by threatening to set upon them white mice, a rodent which in local folklore was associated with misfortune. Another tale that Maple recorded also associated Pickingill with white mice; according to this, a visitor travelled to the cunning man's cottage only to find him lying in bed, with the mice suckling from his nipples.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGrowth of {{multicellular}} organisms proceeds {{through a}} series of precisely timed developmental events requiring coordination between gene expression, behavioral changes, and environmental conditions. In Drosophila melanogaster larvae, the essential midthird instar transition from foraging (feeding) <b>to</b> <b>wandering</b> (non-feeding) behavior occurs prior to pupariation and metamorphosis. The timing of this key transition is coordinated with larval growth and size, but physiological mechanisms regulating this process are poorly understood. Results presented here show that Drosophila larvae associate specific environmental conditions, such as temperature, with food in order to enact appropriate foraging strategies. The transition from foraging <b>to</b> <b>wandering</b> behavior is associated with a striking reversal in the behavioral responses to food-associated stimuli that begins early in the third instar, well before food exit. Genetic manipulations disrupting expression of the Degenerin/Epithelial Sodium Channel subunit, Pickpocket 1 (PPK 1) or function of PPK 1 peripheral sensory neurons caused defects in the timing of these behavioral transitions. Transient inactivation experiments demonstrated that sensory input from PPK 1 neurons is required during a critical period early in the third instar to influence this developmental transition. Results demonstrate a key role for the PPK 1 sensory neurons in regulation of important behavioral transitions associated with developmental progression of larvae from foraging <b>to</b> <b>wandering</b> stage...|$|R
