5|$|Despite being pinned {{against their}} own goal line, the Hokies {{initially}} had some success moving the ball. Taylor completed a two-yard pass, Evans ran for six yards, and Taylor ran for two yards on third down to earn a first down at the Tech 13-yard line. After a Tech timeout, Darren Evans ran for five yards. On <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> he broke free for a 32-yard run, advancing {{the ball to the}} 50-yard line. The Hokies were unable to capitalize on Evans' run, however, as on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> a pass from Taylor was intercepted by Cincinnati defender Brandon Underwood at the Cincinnati 28-yard line.|$|E
5|$|From the Tech 20-yard line, Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 13-yard pass to Still {{for a first}} down at the Tech 33-yard line.

On <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> Druckenmiller connected with Still for a nine-yard touchdown pass. The extra point was good, and Tennessee's lead was cut to 4523, but with only 4:13 remaining in the game, the game seemed out of reach for the Hokies.|$|E
5|$|The Baptists had {{sustained}} {{injuries in}} its opening {{game against the}} Georgia Bulldogs, and their practice schedule was hampered by rain. Near {{the end of the}} first quarter, Godchaux finally got off a good punt to Mercer's 10-yard line and Tom Ryan made the tackle. Godchaux returned Mercer's punt ten yards, beginning a drive gaining six yards off-tackle. On <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play</b> Doc Kuhn passed to Tot McCullough for twelve yards and first down on the nine-yard line. Rupert Smith ran to the five-yard line, and then to the two. Red Williams fumbled on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> but it was recovered by Alf Sharpe in the end zone.|$|E

5|$|The Clemson Tigers {{began the}} game with first possession. After Georgia Tech's kickoff and a short return, the Tigers' offense began work at their 33-yard line. Three short plays {{advanced}} {{the ball to the}} Clemson 41-yard line and gained the Tigers a first down. On <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> Clemson running back C. J. Spiller broke free for a 40-yard rush to the Georgia Tech 19-yard line. Two plays later, Clemson quarterback Kyle Parker completed a 15-yard pass to Jacoby Ford.

5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second-and-nine at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Druckenmiller completed a 20-yard pass to Oxendine for a first down at the Tech 40-yard line. Parker ran for three yards, but Tech was forced to call a timeout before <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play.</b> During the timeout, a light rain began to fall that would last through {{the remainder of the}} game. Coming out of the timeout, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass, but made it up on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play</b> by rushing for 16 yards, picking up a first down at the 41-yard line of Nebraska. This was followed by another rush by Druckenmiller, this time for nine yards. The two gains were negated on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> however, as Virginia Tech committed a penalty that pushed the Hokies back to their 41-yard line. Druckenmiller then threw two incomplete passes, and Tech was forced to punt.|$|E
5|$|After the post-score kickoff and return, Florida State {{began at}} its 22-yard line. Weinke {{completed}} a first-down pass to Warrick, but Warrick committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty in the process. On <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> Weinke attempted a long pass downfield, but Tech defender Anthony Midget intercepted {{the ball at}} the Tech 41-yard line. Trailing by five, Tech's offense began a drive to potentially further cut Florida State's lead or put the Hokies in the lead themselves. After slipping {{on the field and}} taking a loss, Vick completed a 20-yard pass to Hawkins, who picked up a first down and pushed Tech to the Florida State 39-yard line. After a short rush by Kendrick, Vick scrambled to the State 21-yard line for another first down. On <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> Vick was sacked for a seven-yard loss, but recovered the lost ground by running for 22yards on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play.</b> With a first down at the Seminoles' seven-yard line, Vick handed the ball to Kendrick, who ran seven yards straight ahead for a Tech touchdown, giving the Hokies the lead {{for the first time in}} the game. Again, Beamer ordered a two-point conversion attempt, but again, Florida State stopped the Hokies short. Despite that failure to pick up the two-point conversion, Tech took a 2928 lead with 2:13 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Following Virginia Tech's kickoff, NC State {{returned}} {{the ball to}} the 27-yard line, where the Wolfpack began the game's first play. That play was a short run to the right. On <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> NC State picked up the game's first first down with a rush up the middle by fullback Mal Crite. Crite picked up another first down on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> driving the Wolfpack inside Virginia Tech territory, but the Hokies' defense stiffened and forced the Wolfpack to punt after NC State failed to gain another first down. Tech {{returned the}} punt to its 21-yard line, where the Tech offense took over. On Virginia Tech's first offensive play, running back Maurice Williams broke free for a 77-yard run that took the Hokies inside the one-yard line of NC State. The run was the longest of Williams' career and is a Peach Bowl record for longest play from scrimmage. Two plays later, Virginia Tech's Eddie Hunter crossed the goal line and scored the game's first points. The touchdown and extra point made the score 70, Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|North Carolina's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Virginia Tech 25-yard line, and the Hokies prepared for their second possession of the game. Parker was stopped for no gain on a run attempt, and another attempt on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play</b> was stopped for a loss of a yard. Facing third down, Clark attempted to scramble for the first down, but was stopped after a gain of six yards. Having gone three and out, the Hokies punted again. The kick was downed at the 36-yard line, and North Carolina's offense returned for its second possession of the game. On the first play of the drive, Linton gained two yards on a run up {{the middle of the}} field. On <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> Keldorf completed a 62-yard pass to Octavus Barnes, who had broken free of the Virginia Tech defense.

5|$|The Gliders {{planned to}} {{dominate}} Mexico early, playing as aggressively against {{them as they}} had played against the Netherlands. Australia's first shots at goal were taken by Kean from the free-throw line, but she missed both. Mexico's Lucia Vazquez Delgadillo then opened the scoring to give Mexico a two-point lead, {{which turned out to}} be their biggest of the game. Gauci then put points on the scoreboard for the Gliders. Mexico turned the ball over, and Crispin got her first from the paint, assisted by Gauci, which was repeated on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> with Stewart providing the assist this time. Mexico scored, but the Gliders responded with another shot from Crispin. On <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> Gauci stole the ball and charged down the court, but failed to make the shot. Nott then took a defensive rebound, leading to Crispin scoring again. She was also fouled, but missed the resulting free throw. Shortly thereafter, Stewart drew another foul, and made both shots to bring the score to 14–4.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{opened the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball, facing a first down at the California 45-yard line.

5|$|Virginia Tech's first {{possession}} of the game began at its 15-yard line after the Florida State kickoff. Hokie quarterback Marcus Vick completed his first pass of the game, a nine-yard toss to Eddie Royal, and the Hokies picked up a first down on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play.</b> From there, however, things began to go downhill for the Virginia Tech offense. Vick was sacked on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>play,</b> running back Cedric Humes was tackled for a five-yard loss, and the Hokies committed a five-yard false start penalty. The miscues prevented Virginia Tech from gaining another first down, and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball away. Florida State recovered the kick at the 50-yard line and began its second offensive {{possession of}} the game. Although Weatherford completed his first pass of the drive, both subsequent passes fell incomplete. The Seminoles punted the ball back to Virginia Tech, and the kick rolled {{into the end zone}} for a touchback.|$|E
