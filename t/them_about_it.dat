5|$|According to Brackman, {{several days}} after the robbery the Okhrana agent Mukhtarov {{questioned}} Stalin in a secret apartment. The agents had heard rumors that Stalin had been seen watching passively during the robbery. Mukhtarov asked Stalin why he had not informed <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and Stalin stated that he had provided adequate information to the authorities to prevent the theft. The questioning escalated into a heated argument; Mukhtarov hit Stalin {{in the face and}} had to be restrained by other Okhrana officers. After this incident, Mukhtarov was suspended from the Okhrana, and Stalin was ordered to leave Tiflis and go to Baku to await a decision in the case. Stalin left Baku with 20,000rubles in stolen money in July 1907. While Brackman claims to have found evidence of this incident, whether Stalin cooperated with the Okhrana during his early life has been a subject of debate among historians for many decades and has yet to be resolved.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s and, indeed, {{consistently}} {{throughout his}} life, Seeger continued {{his support of}} civil and labor rights, racial equality, international understanding, and anti-militarism (all of which had characterized the Wallace campaign) and he continued to believe that songs could help people achieve these goals. With the ever-growing revelations of Joseph Stalin's atrocities and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, however, he became increasingly disillusioned with Soviet Communism. He left the CPUSA in 1949 but remained friends with some who did not leave it, though he argued with <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mrs Dashwood moves {{her family}} to Barton Cottage in Devonshire, near the home of her cousin, Sir John Middleton. Their new home is modest but they are warmly {{received}} by Sir John and welcomed into local society, meeting his wife, Lady Middleton, his mother-in-law, Mrs Jennings and his friend, Colonel Brandon. Colonel Brandon is attracted to Marianne, and Mrs Jennings teases <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Marianne is not pleased as she considers the thirty-five-year-old Colonel Brandon an old bachelor, incapable of falling in love or inspiring love in anyone.|$|E

25|$|In December 1968, Tilbrook {{left the}} band, so Wheatley moved to bass guitar. Soon after, Wheatley found {{a message from}} the cruise line Sitmar and {{returned}} the call, only to be roundly abused by Sitmar's furious entertainment manager; he then discovered that Sitmar had offered the band work on a London-bound cruise liner, which had left the previous week, while the band had been in Brisbane. Unable to locate them, the liner had been delayed for an entire day while Sitmar found a group to replace them. The band confronted Sambell, who denied any knowledge, but a further check with Sitmar confirmed that the deal had been arranged, but that Sambell had been caught up with Farnham's affairs and had forgotten to tell <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Walking Dead is {{a graphic}} adventure, played from a third-person {{perspective}} {{with a variety}} of cinematic camera angles, in which the player, as protagonist Lee Everett, works with a rag-tag group of survivors to stay alive {{in the midst of a}} zombie apocalypse. The player can examine and interact with characters and items, and must make use of inventory items and the environment. Throughout the game, the player is presented with the ability to interact with their surroundings, and options to determine the nature of that interaction. For example, the player may be able to look at a character, talk to that character, or if they are carrying an item, offer it to the character or ask <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> According to Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead game is focused more on developing characters and story, and less on the action tropes that tend to feature in other zombie-based games, such as Left 4 Dead.|$|E
500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E

5000|$|On 19 May 2015, the family’s MP Mary Creagh {{responded to}} the {{announcement}} of Thomas Cook’s charitable donation, saying that the children’s parents had not been consulted <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and that relatives and friends have been giving donations to another charity in Bobby and Christi’s memory. She said: [...] "Their feeling is that this once more is not <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>about</b> Thomas Cook".|$|R
500|$|That night, {{en route}} to her first visit to The Bronze, the cool hangout in Sunnydale, Buffy meets a mysterious, {{handsome}} stranger (David Boreanaz), who warns her that she is living on a Hellmouth that is about to open, and that [...] "The Harvest" [...] is coming. He also gives her a large silver cross pendant. In The Bronze, Buffy meets Willow and encourages her to seize the moment: [...] "Because tomorrow you might be dead." [...] She finds Giles and tells him about the stranger. Giles tells her to learn to hone her skills to sense vampires anywhere. Buffy uses her fashion sense to pick out a vampire (J. Patrick Lawlor) in the club and is alarmed to see Willow leave with him. She loses them and is surprised by Cordelia, nearly staking her. Cordelia immediately calls her friends to tell <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> While Buffy looks for Willow, Jesse chats up Darla at The Bronze. Buffy is stopped by Xander, whom she convinces to help search for Willow.|$|E
2500|$|Dan Tynan, Executive Editor of PC World {{and author}} of Computer Privacy Annoyances (2005), said: [...] "This is {{extremely}} creepy, and way beyond {{the purview of the}} school.... There's really no need to try to take a picture of someone—in fact, how can you prove the person in front of the laptop was the one who stole it?... And to install this stuff on anyone's computer and not notify <b>them</b> <b>about,</b> <b>it</b> is just begging for a world of pain." [...] Robert Richardson, Director of the Computer Security Institute, said: [...] "It's incredible that they didn't realize they were playing with fire." [...] Technology journalist Robert X. Cringely wrote in InfoWorld: [...] Is there any reason why you'd need to take two weeks' worth of photos to locate a missing laptop, especially when you already have other ways of tracking it? I don't think so.... Cafiero issued … the rather interesting statement that the 15-year-old Robbins had [...] "no reasonable expectation of privacy" [...] in his own home, because … his family hadn't paid the $55 insurance fee required by the school for home loaners. [...] In other words: If you don't pay your dues, we can watch you while you sleep. Did I say [...] "creepy" [...] already? ...|$|E
2500|$|Tatiana {{did have}} her {{concerns}} about the storyline. She {{did not want the}} show to do a gay stereotype. Riegel voiced the same concerns earlier on about the character; she clarified that she asked the show's writers and producers to make the character three-dimensional and not [...] "so heavily centered" [...] on the character's sexual orientation. Having grown up close to an out lesbian sister, who [...] "came out" [...] in her early 20s, Riegel was familiar with how Bianca should be if stereotypes were to be avoided. At the time of Tatiana's [...] "coming-out" [...] process, Riegel and brother Sam were children. Tatiana relayed that being gay was not an issue and that she could not remember having had a conversation with <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at that age. By the time Riegel and Sam were old enough to know what being gay meant, they had grown to love Tatiana's girlfriend and the family was closer than before. Riegel having acquired the role of Bianca led her and Tatiana to discuss certain specifics of the character. Riegel's mindset was centered on what it must have been like for Tatiana to grow up as gay. She said that she had never heard Tatiana's whole coming-out story before and that it was nice to talk about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes," [...] {{replied the}} captain {{with a chuckle}} that almost brought on a choking fit; [...] "I can't well avoid tellin' <b>them</b> somethin' <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> for they've a right to know, but--" ...|$|R

60|$|So {{the whole}} of the day they wavered and avoided contact, until evening. Then, laughing, saying he would be back in six months' time and would tell <b>them</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he shook hands with her mother and took his leave.|$|R
2500|$|Public {{hearings}} of the Gomery Commission {{inquiry into}} the sponsorship scandal involving alleged kickbacks and [...] "donations" [...] from Quebec advertising agencies and corporations to Liberal Party operatives led to {{a drop in the}} Liberal Party's popularity. The security of the minority government came under fire as the Conservatives threatened to force an election by use of their [...] "opposition day," [...] when they get to set the Parliament's agenda. The Conservatives would use this time to hold a vote of no confidence in order to topple Martin's government. To avoid this, Martin removed all opposition days from the schedule and made a televised appearance on April 21, 2005, to attempt to gain support from the Canadian people to let the inquiry run its course before an election is called. In the rebuttal speeches by the opposition party leaders, Layton offered his party's support provided that they were given major concessions in the budget such as canceling the proposed corporate tax cuts. Days later, the Liberals took the NDP up on their offer and negotiated tax cut deferments and new spending initiatives. Among the new commitments was aid for Sudan, which Sudan's officials turned down as Martin did not consult <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> beforehand. This aid was attacked as a perceived attempt to win the vote of a single independent MP, former Liberal David Kilgour. Kilgour nevertheless would vote against the government.|$|E
2500|$|With [...] "Somethings Weird," [...] Eisenstein played Wildrick {{the song}} and [...] "we got right to work". Wildrick felt the song [...] "represents an {{awakening}} within a relationship". According to Collier, [...] "Punishment" [...] was [...] "a [...] song, and I feel he always writes sad tunes." [...] Hrycenko found [...] "Not the First a challenge" [...] to [...] "get good enough with all the transitions that I felt confident tracking". He called it [...] "pretty heavy, and the little roll on the ride in the bridge is super tight". According to Eisenstein, the group used to call [...] "Headstone" [...] the [...] "H20 Song" [...] as they considered it [...] "super manly, fast and punk". Eisenstein composed the guitar riff in a hotel in Arizona, and wrote the lyrics {{in the back of}} the group's van. The group had forgotten about [...] "Spunn" [...] until Jimmy Dunn, a friend of the band, reminded <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Dunn had a copy of Eisenstein's demo of the song, which he dug out for the group. According to Hrycenko [...] "Picture Perfect" [...] went through 10 different names because of the lyric about a car. Wildrick claimed that [...] "Night Feelings" [...] bridge shows that Bruzzese and Eisenstein are fans of 311. According to Collier, people who heard the album's final track, [...] "Atlas," [...] called it [...] "a wild card of a song for this album". He felt the song did not have the same vibe as the rest of the songs on the album.|$|E

5000|$|During {{his time}} at Vale Park he made some unorthodox decisions; such as putting fifteen players on the {{transfer}} list at once, taking the team for a swim at Blackpool, and one time sending assistant manager John Rudge hundreds of miles on a scouting mission, only to rip up the report in the dressing room, declaring to his players that 'It's not <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> <b>it's</b> <b>about</b> us!' ...|$|R
