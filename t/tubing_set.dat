40|$|BACKGROUND: Immunomagnetic {{selection}} of CD 34 (+) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) using CliniMACS CD 34 selection technology {{is widely used}} to provide high-purity HPC grafts. However, the number of nucleated cells and CD 34 + cells recommended by the manufacturer for processing in a single procedure or with 1 vial of CD 34 reagent is limited. METHODS: In this retrospective evaluation of 643 CliniMACS CD 34 -selection procedures, we validated the capacity of CliniMACS <b>tubing</b> <b>sets</b> and CD 34 reagent. Endpoints {{of this study were}} the recovery and purity of CD 34 + cells, T-cell depletion efficiency and recovery of colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM). RESULTS: Overloading normal or large-scale <b>tubing</b> <b>sets</b> with excess numbers of total nucleated cells, without exceeding the maximum number of CD 34 + cells, had no significant effect on the recovery and purity of CD 34 + cells. In contrast, overloading normal or large-scale <b>tubing</b> <b>sets</b> with excess numbers of CD 34 + cells resulted in a significantly lower recovery of CD 34 + cells. Furthermore, the separation capacity of 1 vial of CD 34 reagent could be increased safely from 600 x 10 (6) CD 34 + cells to 1000 x 10 (6) CD 34 + cells with similar recovery of CD 34 (+) cells. Finally, T-cell depletion efficiency and the fraction of CD 34 + cells that formed CFU-GM colonies were not affected by out-of-specification procedures. DISCUSSION: Our validated increase of the capacity of CliniMACS <b>tubing</b> <b>sets</b> and CD 34 reagent will reduce the number of selection procedures and thereby processing time for large HPC products.

40|$|Multistate {{outbreak}} of hemolysis in hemodialysis patients traced to faulty blood <b>tubing</b> <b>sets.</b> BackgroundHemolysis associated with hemodialysis is rare. The most frequent causes of hemodialysis-associated hemolysis are chemical contamination, heat, or mechanical injury of erythrocytes from occluded or kinked hemodialysis blood lines. When patients {{in three states}} developed hemolysis while undergoing hemodialysis between May 13 and 23, 1998, an investigation was initiated. MethodsA case-patient was defined as any patient at healthcare facilities A (Nebraska), B (Maryland), or C (Massachusetts) during May 13 through 23, 1998 (epidemic period), who had hemolysis diagnosed ≥ 48 hours after undergoing hemodialysis. To identify case-patients and to determine background rates, the medical records of patients from facilities A, B, and C who were undergoing hemodialysis during the epidemic and pre-epidemic (that is, May 5 through 19, 1998) periods were reviewed. Experiments simulating hemodialysis with the same lot numbers of hemodialysis blood <b>tubing</b> cartridge <b>sets</b> used on case- and control-patients were conducted. ResultsThe rates of hemolysis among patients at facilities A, B, and C were significantly higher during the epidemic than the pre-epidemic period (13 out of 118 vs. 0 out of 118, P < 0. 001; 12 out of 298 vs. 0 out of 298, P = 0. 001; and 5 out of 62 vs. 0 / 65, P = 0. 03, respectively). All case-patients had hemolysis. Twenty (66 %) had hypertension. Eighteen (60 %) had abdominal pain, and 10 (36 %) were admitted to an intensive care unit. There were two deaths. The only commonality among the three outbreaks {{was the use of}} the same lot of disposable hemodialysis blood tubing from one manufacturer. Examination of the implicated hemodialysis blood <b>tubing</b> cartridge <b>sets</b> revealed narrowing of an aperture through which blood was pumped before entering the dialyzers. In vitro experiments with the hemodialysis blood tubing revealed that hemolysis was caused by increased pressure on erythrocytes as they passed through the partially occluded hemodialysis blood tubing.

30|$|The {{investigational product}} can be infused via {{peripheral}} or central venous access, though if administered through a peripheral intravenous access, {{it should be}} at least 20 -gauge, and ideally 18 -gauge. The protocol recommends against co-administration with a medication or dextrose-containing solution. The cells are administered through a standard blood filter <b>tubing</b> <b>set</b> with a 170 to 260 micron filter via gravity; droplet count is used to control the infusion rate. The rationale for this approach is that several of the laboratories in our group do not routinely infuse cell-based therapies via an infusion pump, which has the potential to cause mechanical disruption of the cells. The investigational product is infused over approximately 60  minutes. Ventilator management, including weaning, follows the modified ARDS Network lower tidal volume (6  ml/kg predicted body weight) protocol because using this ventilator management protocol will standardize the application of PEEP, which is a component of one of the respiratory efficacy endpoints, the LIS, thus reducing the potential for bias. Patients are managed with a conservative fluid management protocol. The fluid management strategy is held for four hours prior to and six hours after the MSC infusion to reduce the likelihood that the fluid management strategy impacts hemodynamic stability {{around the time of the}} study intervention.|$|E
40|$|CD 34 + cell dose in the transplanted {{product is}} still {{considered}} {{a measure of the}} engraftment potential in haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). CD 34 + selected products are characterised by their high purity and depleted T-cells. These characteristics have made them traditionally suitable to decrease the incidence of graft versus host disease, particularly in haploidentical HSCT. The CliniMACS is a state of the art cell sorting system based on magnetic particles conjugated to CD 34 antibodies. This study retrospectively evaluated the CliniMACS system performance in terms of CD 34 + purity and cell recovery, and T-cell depletion in the selected product.  The results were compared against target values fixed by the processing centre, as well as against published data. Factors affecting the CD 34 + cell recovery were also investigated and a pilot study was carried out to assess the effect of cryopreservation on the viability of the selected products. In total, 151 procedures were analysed. The mean recovery and purity were 64. 82 + 16. 19 and 88. 0 + 11. 0 % respectively. The mean T-cell depletion was 4. 7021 + 0. 5129 logs. Only purity was slightly below the specification (90 %), with the lowest values obtained from peripheral blood (PB) collections. Factors affecting the recoveries were the overall age of the product (p= 0. 001), overnight storage (p= 0. 002), and the use of a particular <b>tubing</b> <b>set</b> with the instrument (p= 0. 002). The mean CD 34 + viability was not significantly different to the value before cryopreservation (p= 0. 068). Results from this study were comparable with published data of the CliniMACS system performance. Local investigations regarding the purity of PB products should be performed. For the first time, using a magnetic separation method, factors affecting CD 34 + recovery were identified.

40|$|AbstractBackground aimsWith {{the rising}} use of {{umbilical}} cord blood (UCB) {{as an alternative}} source of hematopoietic stem cells, storage inventories of UCB have grown, giving rise to genetically diverse inventories globally. In the absence of reliable markers such as CD 34 or counts of colony-forming units, total nucleated cell (TNC) counts are often used {{as an indicator of}} potency, and transplant centers worldwide often select units with the largest counts of TNC. As a result, cord blood banks are driven to increase the quality of stored inventories by increasing the TNC count of products stored. However, these banks face challenges in recovering consistent levels of TNC {{with the use of the}} standard protocols of automated umbilical cord processing systems, particularly in the presence of input variation both of cord blood volume and TNC count, in which it is currently not possible to process larger but useable UCB units with consequent losses in TNC.

40|$|As {{an intern}} with Byrne Medical Inc., I {{took part in}} several {{development}} and validation projects for medical products. A design project for a medical irrigation pump for endoscopic procedure is the focus for my Doctor of Engineering degree. This project represents the scope and depth of a typical design project for a medical device. In this dissertation, a summary of motors used in current medical irrigation pumps available in the market, {{as well as their}} flow rates, is presented. A procedure of typical product design process is followed and a working prototype of endoscopic irrigation pump is designed and fabricated. The objective of the project was to design and fabricate a working prototype of a medical irrigation pump to be used for endoscopic procedures with standard videoscopes in the medical field. Currently there are no irrigation pumps that satisfy physicians?????? needs. By manufacturing their own pump, Byrne Medical would be able to select a host of the positive features noted on other pumps and combine those features into a single pump that fits both the technical and user needs. The author made improvements in the areas of appearance, size, usability, functionality, product life, and ability to vary motor speed, and therefore the flow rate. Flow rate of the prototype was tested by measuring the amount of water it was able to pump per minute (milliliter per minute). Each <b>tubing</b> <b>set</b> was attached and secured onto the prototype unit and adjust the speed control to the maximum flow. The power switch was turned on and the pump was running continuously for twenty seconds. Water was collected and weighted with a digital scale. The amount of water (in pounds) per twenty seconds was then converted to milliliter per minute. Physicians in the GI (Gastroenterology) suites prefer an irrigation pump that rotates backward when they turn the power off to prevent the sterile water from dripping. A Multi-function Timer (model H 3 DE-M 2) manufactured by Omron was selected for future improvement.

This study estimates the intravenous PCA hospital {{cost for the}} first 48 postoperative hours for three inpatient surgeries. Methods: Descriptive analyses using the Premier database (2010 – 2012) of more than 500 US hospitals were conducted on cost (direct acquisition and indirect cost for the hospital, such as overhead, labor, pharmacy services) of intravenous PCA after total knee/hip arthroplasty (TKA/THA) or open abdominal surgery. Weighted average cost of equipment and opioid drug and the literature-based cost of adverse events and complications were aggregated for total costs. Results: Of 11, 805, 513 patients, 272, 443 (2. 3 %), 139, 275 (1. 2 %), and 195, 062 (1. 7 %) had TKA, THA, and abdominal surgery, respectively, with approximately 20 % of orthopedic and 29 % of abdominal patients having specific intravenous PCA database cost entries. Morphine (57 %) and hydromorphone (44 %) were {{the most frequently used}} PCA drugs, with a mean cost per 30 cc syringe of $ 16 (30 mg) and $ 21 (6 mg), respectively. The mean number of syringes used for morphine and hydromorphone in the first 48 hours were 1. 9 and 3. 2 (TKA), 2. 0 and 4. 2 (THA), and 2. 5 and 3. 9 (abdominal surgery), respectively. Average costs of PCA pump, intravenous <b>tubing</b> <b>set,</b> and drug ranged from $ 46 to $ 48, from $ 20 to $ 22, and from $ 33 to $ 46, respectively. Pump, tubing, and saline required to maintain patency of the intravenous PCA catheter over 48 hours ranged from $ 9 to $ 13, from $ 8 to $ 9, and from $ 20 to $ 22, respectively. Supplemental non-PCA opioid use ranged from $ 56 for THA to $ 87 for abdominal surgery. Aggregated mean intravenous PCA equipment and opioid cost per patient were $ 196 (THA), $ 204 (TKA), and $ 243 (abdominal surgery). Total costs, including for adverse events, complications, and intravenous PCA errors, ranged from $ 647 to $ 694. Conclusion: Although there is variation between different types of surgery, the hospital cost of intravenous PCA after major surgery is substantial.

This report describes the procedure for separation of serum from adult cattle and its successful use, which gives an excellent mitotic index for chromosomes investigations. This procedure can be applied practically in all the laboratories requiring serum, particularly in the countries with limitations on cow slaughtering. In this process {{there is no need}} of extra care post collection and animals can be used for about a year. Then new animals are examined and selected, these can act as healthy donors like in humans. Supplementation with adult cattle serum has been found to give desired mitotic division of lymphocytes of several animal species for chromosome evaluation. The technique of in vitro cell, tissue and organ culture is of great importance to scientific research, medicine and industry. Tissue and cell culture techniques are applied usually for diagnostics and treatment purposes besides production of pharmaceuticals. Currently many diagnostic techniques with molecular biology approaches are developed for quick and early detection of diseases and defects. Nevertheless, still many traditional in vitro cell cultures applications are being practiced in medicine and reproduction besides newer upcoming uses. All the in vitro cell cultures methods require a medium containing various ingredients to induce division, support enhanced growth, and increase the number and quantity of cells. In this pursuit different kinds of synthetic media have been developed and are commercially available. These media contain amino acids, vitamins, co-enzymes, sources of energy as carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, mannose or others) and inorganic ions (specific salts) to maintain pH however, all these still need supplemental serum. In most of the techniques, media are supplementation fetal calf serum (FCS), which has specialty being free of antibodies. However, besides cost these days various ethical issues on its production procedure are cropping up in the society. In addition there are a few scientific drawbacks of the use of FCS as its components are largely undefined. Laboratories usually have to test each batch before use, due to the variability between batches, which can make it difficult for studies to be reproduced. Presently lymphocyte culture techniques usually using whole blood are applied for chromosomes preparations. Almost all these techniques recommend the use of FCS as supplement to the culture media. FCS serves the need of many different types of cell culture experiments both for diagnosis and treatment. FCS is a popular supplement for cell culture media as it provides essential components, such as growth factors, vitamins and hormones. Currently, the demand for FCS is so high that between 1 and 2 million calves per year are required for its production. Animal welfare concerns have been expressed on the methods employed in fetal bovine blood harvesting. It is likely that the bovine fetus is alive, and is expected that it experiences pain and/or suffering at the moment of heart puncture for blood collection and possibly for a period after that, until it actually dies. The bovine fetus experiences anoxia, acute lack of oxygen, since oxygen-rich blood supply to the placenta ceases upon death of the maternal animal. Lack of oxygen may interfere with neural processes such as transmission of stimuli, and eventually leads to death. In India most of the ingredients of tissue culture media are manufactured, however, fetal calf serum has to be imported. Its cost is a limiting factor for routine large-scale investigations, which require FCS. There is no possibility of collecting fetal calf serum in India as cow slaughtering is restrained by social norms. Besides, fetal calf serum is both costly and difficult to obtain in the developing countries. Moreover these days worldwide people are raising many ethical and other issues about curtailed use of FCS and stress to find its alternates. In routine cytogenetical investigations the use of FCS can be avoided and in its place adult cattle serum can be added. Usually 50 - 100 metaphase plates are required to be screened for normal individuals; the number can be a little higher in abnormal cases. In the laboratory of the author 10 % MI gives sufficiently large number of plates for chromosomal evaluations. In fact serum is blood without cells, platelets and clotting factors. Thus there is need for replacement or alternatives of FCS for in vitro techniques. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe a procedure used in blood collection, and separation of serum (the various items used are shown in the figure- 1) from adult animals with all the social, ethical and scientific views for tissue culture. ### Procedure of obtaining and storing the supplemental serum. **Selection of animal**: Serum donor animal is selected conducting an initial trial, in which normal healthy pubertal stage five heifers or young cows that are likely to be in the herd (of the institute/organization) are identified. Blood samples (about 15 ml per animal) are collected with the help of sterile Vacutainer needles in pre-evacuated closed glass tubes without any anticoagulant. Since the serum cannot be filtered for sterilization so all the precautions are followed to avoid any contamination. The serum from each sample/tube (individual animal) is separated and transferred in independent sterile tubes with all careful precautions. These tubes are centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 minutes to get rid of cells if any. The tubes containing sera are kept in a water bath already attained temperature at 56 °C for 20 minutes for decomplementation, to destroy antigen-antibodies. After cooling the sera are stored in deep freeze 20 °C till needed for supplementation in cultures. **Preliminary trial**: Initially 100 ml medium is prepared as per routine standard method used in a laboratory working on whole blood culture, and then supplemented with individual sera (as prepared above). The method used in the laboratory of author is described briefly as: In sterile HPLC grade water (100 ml) added lyophilized synthetic medium (Hams F 10, 0. 98 gm or TC- 199, 1. 09 gm), lectin (phytohaematoagglutinin (PHA), 1. 50 mg or pokeweed mitogen, 0. 10 mg), penicillin G (1. 50 mg), streptomycin sulphate (0. 03 mg) and adjusted pH at 7. 2 – 7. 4 with adding sodium bicarbonate (4. 4 % w/v) drop by drop. This medium is filtered through 0. 22 -micron membrane and distributed as 4 ml aliquot in 25 culture bottles, which are divided in five lots. The five lots (1 - 5) are supplemented with serum of five test animals (1 - 5) respectively (as described in animals selection step). In this process each bottle is supplemented with one ml serum. Then to each culture bottle 0. 5 ml whole blood (for lymphocytes multiplication) is added from sample of one animal only. The cultures are maintained at 37 ± 0. 5 °C in a general incubator for 67 - 72 hours and harvested with routine procedure (addition of colchicine/colcemid (1. 3 µg), treatment with hypotonic (0. 075 M KCl), fixation and washing with Carnoy’s fixative solution (3 : 1 methanol and glacial acetic acid). Chromosome preparations are made on glass slides and are examined to know mitotic index (MI), for each culture. The serum producing the highest average mitotic index is selected for future use. In other words the source animal is used for donor of serum, and about 300 - 400 ml blood can be collected after the interval of 30 - 40 days. Such selected donors are used for about a year and then new animals are identified. Animals do not need extra care post collection and can act as healthy donors like in humans. **Bulk serum**: A large volume (about 300 ml) is collected with the help of blood donor <b>tubing</b> <b>set</b> in closed sterile, pre-evacuated clean transfusion bottle without anticoagulant from the selected animal. The bottle is kept in slanting position and blood is allowed to clot without any disturbance for at least one hour at the place of collection. Generally, blood collection is done in the evening and is brought to the laboratory, and is kept in a refrigerator over-night. In the next morning before start of separation of the serum, the bottle is kept at room temperature for at least one hour in vertical position preferably in clean air Laminar -Flow hood. Serum oozes out of the clot, and is decanted in a sterile conical flask (250 ml capacity). The separated serum is transferred into sterile Oakridge tubes of 30 ml capacity and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 4000 rpm to make it free of cells. The centrifuged serum is transferred into sterile storage bottles in aliquots of 50 ml inside a clean air Laminar -Flow hood. The bottles containing serum are kept in a water bath already attained temperature at 56 °C for 20 minutes for decomplementation, to destroy antigen-antibodies. Absolute aseptic precautions are essential in the whole process since the serum is added directly to the filtered medium. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Showing various items used in collection of blood, separation and storage of serum Supplemental serum should be stored frozen after its preparation till before adding to media in order to prevent contamination and retain its potential. So the tubes containing serum are kept frozen at - 20 °C till needed for use. The serum stored at - 20 °C can be used for 6 - 8 months. However, in longer storage some of the constituents get precipitated rather coagulated hard and do not mix well during use. In the process of thawing serum, even though it might take longer, it should be warmed at room temperature and not in incubator or water bath. During preparation of culture media, the bottle of serum should be opened and closed in a biosafety cell culture hood with all the precautions to perform sterile manipulations. ### Conclusion The author {{has made a}} search for an alternate nutrient (serum supplement) source for lymphocyte cultures.

The perfusion with reduced systemic heparin dose (100 IE/kg) body weight) was performed with activated clotting time over 180 seconds. The perfusion began with a blood flow of 31 /min and was maintained during six hours. Clotting studies including blood platelet count, activated clotting time, fibrinogen (factor I), antithrombin III and fibrinopeptid A were performed before the operation and ten minutes, two hours and five and six hours after beginning of bypass. The venous and arterial saturation remained stable during the whole investigation. After ten minutes activated clotting time dropped from 619 +/- 114 s to 203 +/- 15 s after six hours (p < 0. 05). The antithrombin III level changed significantly from 109 +/- 11 % to 95 +/- 16 %.

As a result, cord blood banks are driven to increase the quality of stored inventories by increasing the TNC count of products stored. However, these banks face challenges in recovering consistent levels of TNC {{with the use of the}} standard protocols of automated umbilical cord processing systems, particularly in the presence of input variation both of cord blood volume and TNC count, in which it is currently not possible to process larger but useable UCB units with consequent losses in TNC. METHODS: This report addresses the challenge of recovering consistently high TNC yields in volume reduction by proposing and validating an alternative protocol capable of processing a larger range of units more reliably. RESULTS: This work demonstrates improvements in plastic ware and <b>tubing</b> <b>sets</b> and in the recovery process protocol with consequent productivity gains in TNC yield and a reduction in standard deviation. CONCLUSIONS: This work could pave the way for cord blood banks to improve UCB processing and increase efficiency through higher yields and lower costs...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate <b>tubing</b> <b>sets</b> with either polymeric phospholipids or ionically bound heparin in six bovine experiments (body weight, 70 +/- 5 kg). No heparin was given systemically. Left heart bypass was started with 300 ml of clear priming solution and maintained over 6 hours (50 ml/kg/min). Coagulation studies included platelet counts, activated coagulation time (ACT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (Factor I), antithrombin III (AT III), and fibrinopeptide A (FPA). Normalized platelet levels dropped from 100 +/- 12 % before to 86 +/- 13 % after 6 hours of left heart bypass for heparin, compared with 100 +/- 46 % to 90 +/- 44 % for phospholipid coating (NS). The ACT increased from 146 +/- 7 sec at 10 min to 159 +/- 16 sec after 6 hours for heparin, compared with 122 +/- 4 to 126 +/- 5 sec for phospholipid (p < 0. 05). Thrombin time changed from 18 +/- 0 sec before to 19 +/- 1 sec after 6 hours for heparin, as compared with 16 +/- 1 sec to 18 +/- 1 sec for phospholipid (NS). Factor I levels decreased from 1. 5 +/- 0. 3 g/L to 1. 3 +/- 0. 1 g/L for heparin, compared with 1. 5 +/- 0. 2 g/L to 1. 4 +/- 0. 3 g/L for phospholipid. Antithrombin III levels changed from 102 +/- 26 % to 91 +/- 7 % for heparin, compared with 123 +/- 12 % to 118 +/- 12 % for phospholipid. Fibrinopeptide A levels changed from 100 +/- 60 % to 130 +/- 13 % for heparin, compared with 100 +/- 11 % to 99 +/- 6 % for phospholipid (P < 0. 05).

40|$|A new pumpless, {{parallel}} flow hemodialyzer was first described by Lavender et al. in 1968. The design was modified {{and used for}} hemodialysis by Kokumai et al. in 1972. This improved disposable {{parallel flow}} hemodialyzer (FA- 11) was 33 × 6 × 6 cm in overall dimensions. The dry weight of the dialyzer was 480 g. A plastic screen mesh for membrane support was placed inside cuprophan dialysis tube (45 × 260 mm). Seventy layers of this <b>tubing</b> <b>sets</b> were stacked to construct a FA- 11 dialyzer with effective surface area of 11, 340 cm 2 • The priming volume was 50 ml at 0 mmHg transmembrane pressure. FA- 11 dialyzer was used for 47 hemodialysis on 15 patients with chronic renal failure and compared with the standard two layers Kiil and EX 03 dialyzer regarding those preformance. Performance of FA- 11 dialyzer was as follows. The average BUN dialysance in FA- 11 dialyzer was highest followed by EX 03, standard Kiil, and in uric acid dialysance F A- 11 dialyzer was more effective than standard Kiil. No significant difference of the extraction rate of various substance was found between FA-H and EX- 03, but they were better than those by standard Kiil. The average weight loss during dialysis at negative pressure 200 mmHg was 130 g/h in FA-H. In order to obtain {{the same amount of}} body weight reduction, negative pressure in dialysate had to be doubled in FA- 11 as compared with standard Kiil. FA- 11 dialyzer was compact, presterilized, disposable and simple for operation. The internal resistance to blood flow was quite low, which allows higher blood flow rates when used without a blood pump. The priming volume in dialyzer and residual blood volume at the end of dialysis were very small. If FA- 11 dialyzer should be manufactured in automation and become inexpensive this dialyzer will be more useful for clinical hemodialysis...|$|R

50|$|Ground {{glass joint}} (or ground glass stoppers) are {{commonly}} used with laboratory glassware, mainly because of their nonreactivity. Some stoppers used in labs have holes in them to allow the insertion of glass or rubber tubing. This is often used when a reaction {{is taking place in}} the flask or test tube and the byproduct or result of the reaction is desired to be collected. For instance, if one were to boil water in a test tube and wanted to collect the water vapor, one could seal the test tube with a stopper with holes in it. With tubing inserted into the hole(s), when the tube is heated, water vapor will rise through the hole, make its way through the tubing, and into the collection chamber of choice. The water vapor {{would not be able to}} escape into the air, because the stopper and the <b>tubing,</b> if <b>set</b> up correctly, would be airtight.|$|R

40|$|Perfusion during {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass with low-dose heparin (activated clotting time, > 180 sec) versus full-dose heparin (activated clotting time, > 480 sec) {{combined with}} high-dose aprotinin was evaluated prospectively. Fifteen patients undergoing elective myocardial revascularization {{were randomly assigned}} to 1 of 2 groups. No significant differences between the groups were found for age, sex, body surface area, preoperative hematocrit level, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamp time, mean number of bypasses per patient, or mean number of arterial grafts per patient. In all patients, heparin-coated cardiopulmonary bypass equipment was used, including heparinized hollow-fiber membrane oxygenators and <b>tubing</b> <b>sets.</b> In each group, protamine sulfate was given equivalent to the heparin loading dose; additional doses were administered according to the ACT. The mean total dosage of heparin was 9. 5 +/- 1. 4 x 10 (3) IU for the group given low systemic heparinization (Group 1) compared with 34. 6 +/- 3. 4 x 10 (3) IU for the group given full systemic heparinization in combination with high-dose aprotinin (Group 2) (p < 0. 0001). The mean amount of aprotinin administered in Group 2 was 5. 6 +/- 0. 3 x 10 (6) KIU; aprotinin was not used in Group 1. The mean protamine dosage necessary in Group 1, 7. 0 +/- 0. 9 x 10 (3) IU, was significantly less than the 22. 9 +/- 3. 2 x 10 (3) IU needed in Group 2 (p < 0. 0001). In Group 1, shed blood recovery was achieved by a red-cell spinning device; in Group 2, cardiotomy suction was used. The total chest tube drainage (i. e., postoperative blood loss) per patient in Group 1 totaled 432 +/- 162 mL/m 2; in Group 2, it was 311 +/- 111 mL/m 2 (difference not significant). Transfusion requirements comprised a mean volume of 143 +/- 165 mL/m 2 concentrated homologous red blood cells per patient in Group 1 and 416 +/- 128 mL/m 2 in Group 2 (p < 0. 01). Heparin-coated perfusion equipment allowed a significantly lower dosage of systemic heparin and protamine in Group 1 than that in Group 2, and a lower dosage in Group 2 than that in previous studies. Postoperative blood loss appeared to be similar between groups. The combination of heparin-coated perfusion equipment with low systemic heparinization and a red-cell spinning device provides promising results...|$|R

30|$|A {{large number}} of {{researchers}} have worked on the issue. Their works can be categorized in two groups: those who investigate a theoretical model to justify the complicated behavior of asphaltene, and those who plan, set up, and perform a series of lab tests to formulate the asphaltene deposition. Of course, among them, there are researchers who attempt to utilize both approaches to demonstrate the robustness of their models. Unfortunately, few field data are available which are gathered under controlled conditions. In the mid 1960 ’s, Haskett and Tartera (1965) presented these types of data for Hassi Messaoud field in Algeria. In 2005, Alkafeef et al.

50|$|It {{was built}} by Wilhelm Kress with the {{assistance}} of a 5,000-krone grant from Emperor Franz Josef in an attempt to create the first heavier-than-air flying machine. The aircraft was constructed as a large, open-truss structure of steel <b>tubing</b> with three <b>sets</b> of wire-braced monoplane wings placed in tandem along its length. The sets of wings were placed at uneven heights with respect to the major axis of the aircraft to prevent aerodynamic interference between them. The undercarriage consisted of two aluminium pontoons with hardened keels, intended to allow the Drachenflieger to take off from and land on water or ice. Three rudders were linked to a common control stick and were to provide steering on water and in the air. Power was provided by a Daimler petrol engine driving two large auger-style two-bladed propellers, the first attempt to use an internal combustion engine to power a heavier-than-air aircraft. The fabric-covered propellers were mounted pusher-fashion on pylons above and {{on either side of the}} main truss, between the second and third sets of wings, and were designed to counter-rotate.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of five plasticizer phthalates in bags and sets for intravenous administration and hemodialyzers (HD), {{which are made}} of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and of other polymeric materials, was investigated. Di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in PVC is the only authorized phthalate by regulatory agencies. Phthalate determination {{was carried out by}} high resolution liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with UV detection. The results showed that the infusion bags that are made of both PVC and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) contained only DEHP. In contrast, the <b>tubing</b> of infusion <b>sets</b> and of HD (as well as the cellulose capillaries of HD) contained not only DEHP but also dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Moreover, all five investigated phthalates were found in HD polysulfone capillaries. Migration of DEHP into the stored solutions (amino acids, glucose and saline) in bags occurred at different rates from one polymer to another. While DEHP from PVC bags was found in solutions within the first days of contact, the migration from EVA bags started only after approximately 6 months of solution storage. Since PVC and non-PVC devices (as well as capillaries of HD sets) contain DEHP and other phthalate-based plasticizers, the extent of the risk that they pose to patients remains a matter of concern...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{effective}} {{method of obtaining}} arterial blood and monitoring arterial pressure during paediatric surgery is described. No complications were noted in 600 consecutive patients. Percutaneous radial artery cannulation is recognized as an acceptable and necessary mode in adult inten-sive monitoring (Brown, Sweeney and Lumley, 1969; Dalton and Laver, 1971). Paediatric patients {{have been subject to}} capillary (Gandy et al., 1964) and central venous catheterization (Grosfeld et al., 1970) in attempting to accomplish the same standard of care in children. This report describes our experience with the use of percutaneous indwelling radial artery needles during surgery on infants and children. METHOD A 23 -gauge, thin wall, short bevel needle is pre-ferred. * A plastic three-way stopcock is attached to the <b>tubing.</b> The <b>set</b> is filled with 5 % heparinized saline prior to insertion into the artery. This solution is used for intermittent flushing. Once the patient is under general anaesthesia, both radial and ulnar arteries are palpated and Allen's test (1929) is performed to confirm the adequacy of collateral circulation. With the arm elevated, the radial artery is occluded. The thumb and first finger are com-pressed for a few seconds to drain blood, and the adequacy of the collateral circulation is noted. This test is then repeated occluding the ulnar artery. The wrist is immobilized in extension (fig. 1). The skin over the anterior aspect of the distal end of the radius between the tendons of flexor carpi radialis and abductor pollicis longus is cleansed. The skin is pierced and the needle is slowly directed under the skin towards the site of palpable pulsation, while the artery is palpated with the other hand (fig. 2). Bright red blood appears within the tubing immediately upon entering the artery. The needle is taped securely in place, gently flushed and the stopcock is closed. Blood samples are obtained when necessary. The needle is flushed after each sampling. Aspiration and flushing must be gentle to prevent arterial spasm. * Abbott Butterfly or Deseret Minicath. The needle is withdrawn from the artery prior to termination of anaesthesia. Firm pressure is applied at the site of puncture for 5 minutes...|$|R
40|$|Aerosol loss in {{air intake}} systems {{potentially}} hampers the application of one-filter systems for progeny-based atmospheric 222 radon (222 Rn) measurements. The artefacts are significant when air has to be collected via long sampling lines, e. g. from elevated heights at tall tower observatories. Here we present results from a study, determining 222 Rn progeny loss from ambient air sampled via 8. 2  mm inner diameter (ID) Decabon tubing in the laboratory and from pre-installed 10  mm ID tubing at the Cabauw meteorological tower in the Netherlands. Progeny loss increased steeply with length of the tubing, decreasing sampling efficiency to 66  % for 8. 2  mm ID rolled-up tubing of 200  m length at a flow rate of ca. 1  m 3  h − 1. Preliminary theoretical estimation of the loss yielded a sampling efficiency of 64  % for the same tubing, when taking into account turbulent inertial deposition of aerosol to the walls as well as loss due to gravitational settling. At Cabauw tower, theoretical estimates of the loss in vertical tubing with 10  mm ID and 200  m lengths with flow rate of 1. 1  m 3  h − 1 yielded a total efficiency of 73  %, the same value as observed. 222 Rn progeny loss increased strongly at activity concentrations below 1  Bq m − 3. Based on our experiments, an empirical correction function for 222 Rn progeny measurements when sampling through long Decabon tubing was developed, allowing correction of respective measurements for this particular experimental <b>setting</b> (<b>tubing</b> type and diameter, flow rate, aerosol size distribution) with an estimated uncertainty of 10 – 20  % for activity concentrations between 1 and 2  Bq m − 3 and less than 10  % for activity concentrations above 2  Bq m − 3...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} {{to demonstrate that}} oil and gas can be drilled and produced safely and economically from a fractured Monterey reservoir in the Santa Maria Basin of California by employing horizontal wellbores and underbalanced drilling technologies. Two vertical wells were previously drilled in this area by Temblor Petroleum with heavy mud and conventional completions; neither was commercially productive. A new well was drilled by the project team in 2004 {{with the objective of}} accessing an extended length of oil-bearing, high-resistivity Monterey shale via a horizontal wellbore, while implementing managed-pressure drilling (MPD) techniques to avoid formation damage. Initial project meetings were conducted in October 2003. The team confirmed that the demonstration well would be completed open-hole to minimize productivity impairment. Following an overview of the geologic setting and local field experience, critical aspects of the application were identified. At the pre-spud meeting in January 2004, the final well design was confirmed and the well programming/service company requirements assigned. Various design elements were reduced in scope due to significant budgetary constraints. Major alterations to the original plan included: (1) a VSP seismic survey was delayed to a later phase; (2) a new (larger) surface hole would be drilled rather than re-enter an existing well; (3) a 7 -in. liner would be placed into the top of the Monterey target as quickly as possible to avoid problems with hole stability; (4) evaluation activities were reduced in scope; (5) geosteering observations for fracture access would be deduced from penetration rate, cuttings description and hydrocarbon in-flow; and (6) rather than use nitrogen, a novel air-injection MPD system was to be implemented. Drilling operations, delayed from the original schedule by capital constraints and lack of rig availability, were conducted from September 12 to November 11, 2004. The vertical and upper curved sections were drilled and lined through the problematic shale member without major stability problems. The top of the targeted Monterey was thought to be seen at the expected TVD of 10, 000 ft where the 7 -in. liner was set at a 60 {sup o} hole angle. Significant oil and gas shows suggested the fractured interval anticipated at the heel location had been penetrated. A total of 2572 ft of 6. -in. near-horizontal interval was placed in the shale section, extending planned well length by approximately 470 ft. Very little hydrocarbon in-flow was observed from fractures along the productive interval. This may be a result of the well trajectory falling underneath the Monterey fractured zone. Hydrocarbon observations, cuttings analysis and gamma-ray response indicated additional fractured intervals were accessed along the last {+-} 900 ft of well length. The well was completed with a 2 7 / 8 -in. <b>tubing</b> string <b>set</b> in a production packer in preparation for flow and swab tests to be conducted later by a service rig. The planned well time was estimated as 39 days and overall cost as $ 2. 4 million. The actual results are 66 days at a total cost of $ 3. 4 million. Well productivity responses during subsequent flow and swabbing tests were negative. The well failed to inflow and only minor amounts (a few barrels) of light oil were recovered. The lack of production may suggest that actual sustainable reservoir pressure is far less than anticipated. Temblor is currently investigating the costs and operational viability of re-entering the well and conducting an FMI (fracture detection) log and/or an acid stimulation. No final decision or detailed plans have been made regarding these potential interventions at this time...|$|R
