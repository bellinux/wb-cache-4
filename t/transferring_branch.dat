30|$|Synchronous {{operation}} of the <b>transfer</b> <b>branch</b> in a hybrid HVDC breaker (HHB) [36] has been proposed to reduce the adverse effects on the VSC-based DC grid from a DCB reclosing operation under a permanent fault [37]. Specifically, all fully-controlled fast-power electronic switches in the <b>transfer</b> <b>branch</b> are energized {{to carry out the}} reclosing operation synchronously. Then the main branch is conducted if no fault is detected. Conversely, once a permanent fault is detected, all the fully-controlled fast-power electronic switches in the <b>transfer</b> <b>branch</b> will be immediately de-energized synchronously to interrupt the fault current. We call this the traditional sequential auto-reclosing strategy in this paper, and with its help, the fault current can be interrupted immediately if a permanent fault is detected. However, potential negative impacts such as erroneous protection, line-insulation failure, and even damage to power electronic devices will occur when the fault is temporary.|$|R

In particular, a continuous measurement of the population in a branch state in the Kobrak-Rice extended stimulated Raman adiabatic passage scheme is shown to provide a powerful means for controlling the population <b>transfer</b> <b>branching</b> ratio between two degenerate target states. It is demonstrated that a measurement with a large strength may be used to completely shut off the yield of one target state and that the same measurement with a weak strength can dramatically enhance the robustness of the controlled branching ratio against dephasing.

In this paper we examine the effects of neutral-ion interactions involving deuterium and hydrogen on the velocity distribution of neutral D. A two-center scattering approximation is used as the basis for calculations of the differential cross sections for charge transfer and elastic scatter in collision of H with D(+) and of D with H(+) for ionosphere-exosphere collision energies below 10 e V.

30|$|The use of {{overhead}} lines for power transmission {{in the future}} high-voltage and large-capacity voltage-source converter (VSC)-based direct current (DC) grid will significantly increase the probability of temporary faults. To eliminate potential adverse impacts such as erroneous protection, line-insulation failure, and even damage to power electronic devices resulting from a DC breaker reclosing operation with the traditional sequential auto-reclosing strategy, a novel sequential auto-reclosing strategy for hybrid HVDC breakers (HHBs) in VSC-based DC grids is proposed. This strategy {{is based on the}} step-by-step operation of the <b>transfer</b> <b>branch</b> in the HHB. As a result, du/dt resulting from the HHB reclosing operation is greatly reduced, and therefore those potential negative impacts can be eliminated. Several other advantages are also presented. The feasibility and validity of the proposed strategy are verified in a four-terminal annular VSC-based DC grid electromagnetic transient model.|$|R
