5|$|In {{the case}} of the United States, where a one-hour shift occurs at 02:00 local time, in spring the clock jumps forward from the last instant of 01:59 {{standard}} time to 03:00 DST and that day has 23hours, whereas in autumn the clock jumps backward from the last instant of 01:59 DST to 01:00 standard time, repeating that hour, and that day has 25hours. A digital display of local <b>time</b> <b>does</b> not read 02:00 exactly at the shift to summer time, but instead jumps from 01:59:59.9 forward to 03:00:00.0.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{findings}} in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by John Robinson's late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have {{four hours of}} leisure time each weekday, and more on weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays. Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children. However, the amount of free <b>time</b> <b>does</b> not significantly depend on an individual's wealth. People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest. During {{the second half of}} the twentieth century, watching television became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television. Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|The Final Fantasy Legend {{takes place}} on several worlds {{centered}} around a large tower, built by the Creator in ancient times (God in the Japanese version) to link worlds. There are four unique major worlds that make up different layers of the tower: the World of Continent at the base, the World of Ocean on the 5th floor, the World of Sky on the 10th, and the World of Ruins on the 16th. <b>Time</b> <b>does</b> not flow at a constant pace between levels of the tower, rendering some worlds more technologically advanced than others. Various monsters come forth from the tower into each world; many are hostile, {{but some of them}} are friendly to humans and willing to coexist. An offshoot of the human race (named mutants) also exists in each world; they are the magic-attuned descendants of a union between humans and the World of Continent's older races.|$|E

5|$|When {{disturbed}} while incubating, {{this bird}} usually (just under 50% of the time) partly covers its eggs with nest material when the disruption is not sudden, but a bird with an incomplete clutch usually does {{not attempt to}} cover the eggs. When the disruption is sudden, on the other hand, the black-necked grebe usually (just under 50% of the <b>time)</b> <b>does</b> not cover its eggs. In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest. Predation is usually not {{the primary cause of}} egg loss, with most nesting failures occurring after the chicks have hatched. A major cause of this is the chilling of the young.|$|E

25|$|The date {{estimated}} for {{the evolutionary}} divergence {{of a domestic}} lineage from a wild one does not necessarily indicate {{the start of the}} domestication process but it does provide an upper boundary. The divergence of the domestic horse from the lineage that lead to the modern Przewalski’s horse is estimated at 45,000 YBP but the archaeological record indicates 5,500 YBP. The variance could be due to the modern wild population not being the direct ancestor of the domestic one, or the impact of a split due to climate, topography, or other environmental changes. The divergence <b>time</b> <b>does</b> not imply domestication during this specific period.|$|E
25|$|A {{recurring}} {{plot device}} in The Chronicles is {{the interaction between}} the various worlds that make up the Narnian multiverse. A variety of methods are used to initiate these cross-overs which generally serve to introduce characters to the land of Narnia. The Cosmology of Narnia is not as internally consistent as that of Lewis's contemporary Tolkien's Middle-earth, but suffices given the more fairy tale atmosphere of the work. During the course of the series we learn in passing, that the world of Narnia is flat and geocentric and has different stars from those of Earth, and that the passage of <b>time</b> <b>does</b> not correspond directly to the passage of time in our world.|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{definition}} alone {{it is not}} obvious that NP-complete problems exist; however, a trivial and contrived NP-complete problem can be formulated as follows: given {{a description of a}} Turing machine M guaranteed to halt in polynomial <b>time,</b> <b>does</b> there exist a polynomial-size input that M will accept? It is in NP because (given an input) it is simple to check whether M accepts the input by simulating M; it is NP-complete because the verifier for any particular instance of a problem in NP can be encoded as a polynomial-time machine M that takes the solution to be verified as input. Then {{the question of whether the}} instance is a yes or no instance is determined by whether a valid input exists.|$|E

25|$|After the United States' early {{elimination}} in 1982 World Cup qualifying, American manager Walt Chyzowych {{stated the}} NASL {{had failed to}} offer much of a foundation for his team, since the league had largely failed to develop American players. On the other hand, Canada nearly qualified for the 1982 World Cup with a squad exclusively made up of NASL players. Although the NASL ultimately failed, it did introduce soccer to the North American sports scene {{on a large scale}} for the first time, and was a major contributing factor in soccer becoming {{one of the most popular}} sports among American youth. On July 4, 1988, FIFA awarded the hosting of the 1994 World Cup to the United States. NASL has also provided lessons for its successor Major League Soccer, which has taken precautions against such problems, particularly a philosophy of financial restraint (mainstream American sports, by the time of MLS' startup in 1996, had adopted financial restraint rules, which MLS adopted). American college and high school soccer still use some NASL-style rules (with shortened halves, although the <b>time</b> <b>does</b> stop for certain reasons).|$|E
500|$|As {{he had on}} his {{previous}} three albums, Dylan contributed his own writing to the back cover of Highway 61 Revisited, {{in the shape of}} freeform, surrealist prose: [...] "On the slow train <b>time</b> <b>does</b> not interfere & at the Arabian crossing waits White Heap, the man from the newspaper & behind him the hundred inevitables made of solid rock & stone." [...] One critic has pointed out the close similarity of these notes to the stream of consciousness, experimental novel Tarantula, which Dylan was writing during 1965 and 1966.|$|E
500|$|The plot is padded with a {{large amount}} of filler. [...] Films of this type were usually {{produced}} quickly and at minimal cost, and while filler was sometimes used to increase the production value, the usual motivation was to extend its running time to qualify for feature length status. [...] Eric Schaefer notes that the [...] "primary purpose" [...] of the plot of Mom and Dad [...] was to [...] "serve as the vehicle onto which the spectacle of the clinical reels can be grafted", such as the live birth scene. [...] The marketing materials suggest the latter reason also, and many posters for the film promised that [...] "You [...] actually SEE the birth of a baby!" [...] The dialogue is carefully worded, and uses period euphemisms rather than explicit terms that may have been controversial at the time. [...] In particular, at no <b>time</b> <b>does</b> the film specifically mention sexual intercourse or pregnancy.|$|E
