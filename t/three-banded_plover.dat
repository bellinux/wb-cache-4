50|$|This {{species is}} larger and {{darker than the}} <b>three-banded</b> <b>plover.</b> The latter species also has a white {{forehead}} and a white wingbar.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>three-banded</b> <b>plover</b> is 18 cm in length. It {{has long}} wings {{and a long}} tail, and {{therefore}} looks different from most other small plovers in flight, the exception being the closely related Forbes's plover that replaces it in west Africa.|$|E
50|$|The <b>three-banded</b> <b>plover,</b> or three-banded sandplover (Charadrius tricollaris), {{is a small}} wader. This plover is {{resident}} in much of eastern and southern Africa and Madagascar, mainly on inland rivers, pools, and lakes. Its nest is a bare scrape on shingle. This species is often seen as single individuals, but it will form small flocks. It hunts by sight for insects, worms and other invertebrates. Three-banded plovers have a sharp whistled weeet-weet call.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>three-banded</b> <b>plover</b> has medium brown upperparts, and the underparts {{are white}} {{except for the}} two black breast bands, {{separated}} by a white band, which give this species its common and scientific names. The head is strikingly patterned, with a black crown, white supercilia extending from the white forehead to meet {{on the back of}} the neck, and a grey face becoming brown on the neck. The eye ring and the base of the otherwise black bill are red.|$|E
40|$|We {{isolated}} 45 new Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) microsatellite loci. These {{were tested}} for polymorphism in 42 Kentish plovers breeding in the Cukurova Delta, Turkey. Thirty-six of the 45 loci were polymorphic with observed heterozygosity varying between 0. 22 and 0. 93. Genotypes of individuals of known sex indicated that two loci were sex-linked (Calex- 26 {{is located on}} the Z chromosome and Calex- 31 on the W chromosome). Additionally, we tested all loci for amplification in four other species of Charadridae (Kittlitz's plover, Madagascar plover, <b>three-banded</b> <b>plover</b> and white-fronted plover). On average 34 loci amplified per species (range 29 - 36) ...|$|E
40|$|Many small plovers Charadrius spp. have sexually {{monomorphic}} plumage and cryptic sexual size dimorphism. The {{objective of}} our study {{was to assess the}} variation in body sizes between male and female plovers breeding in Madagascar. We collected blood samples and data on adult body sizes of four small plovers (Madagascar Plover Charadrius thoracicus, Kittlitz's Plover C. pecuarius, White-fronted Plover C. marginatus and <b>Three-banded</b> <b>Plover</b> C. tricollaris), and used molecular genetic markers to sex the adults. We found significant differences in body size among the four species, and between sexes. Furthermore, individuals from the southern ecoregion tended to be larger than in the western ecoregion. The Madagascar Plover's body size was significantly more dimorphic than the Kittlitz's and White-fronted Plovers. Breeding Malagasy plovers' show significant sexual size dimorphism (SSD) : Madagascar Plover females were heavier and had longer wings than males, whereas the males had longer tarsi; in White-fronted Plover only wing length was different between the sexes. Taken together, our work reports SSD in small African plovers that exhibit monomorphic plumage, and we propose that SSD may be more common than currently acknowledged; we term this 'cryptic sexual size dimorphism'. Our results also suggest sexual selection and/or natural selection exert different pressures on body size in different Malagasy plover species...|$|E
40|$|Identifying the {{mechanisms}} driving {{the evolution of}} breeding systems {{is one of the}} central goals in behavioural and evolutionary ecology. Understanding the evolutionary history of species of interest is fundamental to this goal. The objectives of this PhD were, firstly, to investigate the role of sex biases in breeding system evolution among closely-related populations and, secondly, to explore the phylogeographic origins of the plovers, genus Charadrius. The plovers are characterised by extraordinary ecological and behavioural diversity and are therefore ideal study species for this work. Firstly, I investigated the role of sex biases among offspring in breeding system evolution at the population level across four populations of Kentish and snowy plover exhibiting differing levels of male and female care. Theoretical hypotheses link male-biased offspring sex ratios, mating opportunities and male parental care. I present modest support for this hypothesis: male offspring had higher survival levels than female offspring under particular conditions (Chapter 3), and also a tendency for faster growth (Chapter 4) in two populations with predominantly male parental care in contrast to two populations with more balanced parental care roles. Without a phylogenetic framework for the genus Charadrius, evolutionary studies on these diverse shorebirds have been limited in scope. Therefore, secondly, I present the first global, species-level molecular phylogeny of the genus Charadrius and outline their phylogeographic origins. I identified the Northern hemisphere (North America, Europe and Siberia) as the origin of the ancestral Charadrius species between 19. 2 and 36. 6 million years ago (Chapter 5). I suggest that early evolutionary diversification occurred due to shifts in the range of ancestral Northern hemisphere species in response to global cooling during the Miocene period, leading to colonisation of the Southern hemisphere (Chapter 5). Thirdly, I present the results of a more in-depth phylogeographic study on the Charadrius plovers of Africa. I identified the widespread Kittlitz’s plover (C. pecuarius) as the closest sister species to the ‘critically endangered’ St Helena plover (C. sanctaehelenae) and ‘vulnerable’ Madagascar plover (C. thoracicus; Chapter 6). Additionally, I identified genetic structure consistent with subspecies status among African populations of the white-fronted plover (C. marginatus), <b>three-banded</b> <b>plover</b> (C. tricollaris) and chestnut-banded plover (C. pallidus), but not the Kittlitz’s plover (Chapter 6), with implications for the influence of breeding systems on population-level genetic differentiation. Overall, this thesis both highlights and facilitates several promising new lines of investigation for future research, with the Charadrius plovers as ideal study species (Chapter 7) ...|$|E
