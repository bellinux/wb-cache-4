A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters.|$|E
5|$|Markov {{processes}} are stochastic processes, traditionally in discrete or continuous time, {{that have the}} Markov property, which means the next value of the Markov process depends on the current value, but it is conditionally independent of the previous values of the stochastic process.

5|$|Weather {{forecasting}} is {{the application}} {{of science and technology}} to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change.|$|E
5|$|Given its size, rock/ice {{composition}} {{and the possible}} presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water, Ariel's interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (372km) is about 64% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 56% of the moon's mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Ariel is about 0.3GPa (3kbar). <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E

5|$|Oberon may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (480km) is about 63% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 54% of the moon's mass—the proportions are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Oberon is about 0.5GPa (5kbar). <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> icy mantle is unclear. If the ice contains enough ammonia or other antifreeze, Oberon may possess a liquid ocean layer at the core–mantle boundary. The thickness of this ocean, if it exists, is up to 40km and its temperature is around 180K. However, the internal structure of Oberon depends heavily on its thermal history, which is poorly known at present.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{motor vehicle}} {{industry}} in Ohio is mixed and dotted. In 2002, the Ohio motor vehicle industry produced about $16 billion of items. This is about 14% {{of the automobile}} production of the United States, and Ohio outputs every state in production of motor vehicles except for Michigan. These $16 billion account for approximately 4.1% of Ohio's gross state product; however, the motor vehicle industry only accounts for 1.1% of the United States' output. In 2003, Ohio was able to produce about 1,885,000 motor vehicles, accounting for 15.6% of the United States' production, and, again, more than any state except for Michigan, in which 928,000 of these were automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (317km) is about 54% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 40% of the moon’s mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Umbriel is about 0.24GPa (2.4kbar). <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E

5|$|The {{cardinals}} hear two sermons {{before the}} election: one before actually entering the conclave, and one {{once they are}} settled in the Sistine Chapel. In both cases, the sermons are meant to lay out <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church, and to suggest the qualities necessary for a pope to possess in that specific time. The first preacher in the 2005 conclave was Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, the preacher of the papal household {{and a member of}} the Capuchin Franciscan order, who spoke at one of the meetings of the cardinals held before the actual day when the conclave began. Cardinal Tomáš Špidlík, a former professor at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and a non-voting member (due to age) of the College of Cardinals, spoke just before the doors were finally closed for the conclave.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, Valve {{created a}} formal process to allow purchasers to request full refunds on games they had {{purchased}} on Steam for any reason, with refunds guaranteed {{within the first}} two weeks as long as the player had not spent more than two hours in the game. Prior to June 2015, Valve had a no-refunds policy, but allowed them in certain circumstances, such as if third-party content had failed to work or improperly reports on certain features. For example, the Steam version of From Dust was originally stated to have a single, post-installation online DRM check with its publisher Ubisoft, but the released version of the game required a DRM check with Ubisoft's servers each time it was used. At the request of Ubisoft, Valve offered refunds to customers who bought the game while Ubisoft worked to release a patch that would remove the DRM check altogether. On The War Zs release, players found that the game was still in an alpha-build state and lacked many of the features advertised on its Steam store page. Though the developers Hammerpoint Interactive altered the description after launch to reflect <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game software, Valve removed the title from Steam and offered refunds to those who had bought it. Valve also removed Earth: Year 2066 from the Early Access program and offered refunds after discovering that the game's developers had reused assets from other games and used developer tools to erase negative complaints about the title. Valve stated it would continue to work on improving the discovery process for users, taking principles they learned in providing transparency for matchmaking in Dota 2 to make the process better, and using that towards Steam storefront procedures to help refine their algorithms with user feedback.|$|E
