5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
5|$|The four British ships fired {{more than}} 2,800 shells at Bismarck, and scored more than 400 hits, but {{were unable to}} sink Bismarck by gunfire. At around 10:20, running low on fuel, Tovey ordered the cruiser Dorsetshire to sink Bismarck with torpedoes and sent his battleships back to port. Dorsetshire fired a pair of torpedoes into Bismarcks {{starboard}} side, one of which hit. Dorsetshire then moved around to her port side and fired another torpedo, which also hit. By the time these torpedo attacks took place, the ship was already listing so badly that the deck was partly awash. It appears that the final torpedo may have detonated against Bismarcks port side superstructure, which was by then already underwater. Around 10:35, Bismarck capsized to port and slowly sank by the stern, disappearing from the surface at 10:40. Some survivors reported they saw Captain Lindemann standing at attention at <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> the ship as she sank.|$|E
50|$|In the past, {{the ending}} -ami {{has been most}} widely applied to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> {{feminine}} nouns. Since the 15th century {{it came to be}} applied to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> neuter nouns and in the 16th - 17th century, despite the resistance <b>of</b> grammarians, to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> masculine nouns.|$|R
50|$|The ending -mi {{was applied}} in Old Polish to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> {{masculine}} and neuter nouns, especially to soft-stem ones, {{and also to}} <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> some feminine nouns in the nominative ending with -0. In principle, today it is only applied to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> masculine and feminine nouns in the nominative ending with -0 and having a phonetically soft-stem.|$|R
50|$|In Old Polish -am prevailed as {{the ending}} applied to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> {{feminine}} nouns. In the 15th - 17th century it was applied also to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> masculine and neuter nouns.|$|R
5|$|The {{toxicity}} of Narcissus varies with species, N. poeticus being more toxic than N. pseudonarcissus, for instance. The distribution of toxins within the plant also varies, for instance {{there is a}} five times higher concentration of alkaloid in <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> N. papyraceus than in the bulb, making it dangerous to herbivores more likely to consume the stem than the bulb, and {{is part of the}} plant's defence mechanisms. The distribution of alkaloids within tissues may also reflect defence against parasites. The bulbs can also be toxic to other nearby plants, including roses, rice, and cabbages, inhibiting growth. For instance placing cut flowers in a vase alongside other flowers shortens the life of the latter.|$|E

25|$|Sayur nganten: an Indonesian soup {{made with}} <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> trubuk (Saccharum edule), {{a type of}} sugarcane.|$|E
50|$|The ending -em {{until the}} 17th century was {{sometimes}} applied instead <b>of</b> -om to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> masculine nouns. There are no traces of this ending being applied to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> neuter nouns.|$|R
50|$|Until the 15th {{century the}} ending -i {{was the most}} widely applied ending to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> {{masculine}} nouns. From the 16th century onwards it was not applied to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> inanimate nouns, and from the 18th century - to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> nouns referring to non-persons. Forms W≈Çoszy, mniszy (Italians, monks) {{have been replaced by}} W≈Çosi, mnisi with the phonetic softness introduced in the 17th century.|$|R
50|$|In the past, {{the ending}} -om {{has been widely}} applied to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> {{masculine}} and neuter nouns. Since the Middle Polish period it has started {{to be applied to}} <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> feminine nouns.|$|R
25|$|The letter appears {{frequently}} in the Romance languages, where {{it is the first}} letter of the second person plural pronoun and (in Italian) <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> the imperfect form of most verbs.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> a verb is {{obtained}} {{by removing the}} -aia suffix from the infinitive. Most verb stems end in a consonant, and are conjugated as follows (our sample verb is pulaia 'play').|$|E
25|$|Tremolo is {{the very}} rapid {{repetition}} (typically of a single note, but occasionally of multiple notes), usually played {{at the tip of}} the bow. Tremolo is marked with three short, slanted lines across <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> the note. Tremolo is often used as a sound effect in orchestral music, particularly in the Romantic music era (1800-1910) and in opera music.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> S. lacustris are {{round in}} cross-section, in {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> triquetrous (rounded-triangular) <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> other species in the genus, such as S. triqueter and S. pungens. <b>The</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> S. tabernaemontani are also round, but S. tabernaemontani is a smaller plant, less than 1.5 m tall, with only two stigmas per flower.|$|R
30|$|Even though, so far, {{there is}} no report demonstrating the {{anthelmintic}} activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> P. sylvaticum. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the anthelmintic activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> P. sylvaticum in experimental and computer aided models.|$|R
50|$|The ending -a {{is still}} applied to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> neuter nouns. Due to the {{influence}} of the Latin language, it has been applied since the 15th century to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> male nouns borrowed from Latin and German: akta, fundamenta, grunta, (files, foundations, grounds) and temporarily (and incorrectly) also to originally Polish nouns: okrƒôta, pociska (ships, bullets). Nowadays, the ending -a applied to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> <b>of</b> masculine nouns is in general considered as incorrect, however: akta (files)||akty (acts).|$|R
25|$|The female flower is {{a golden}} blossom {{on the end}} of each {{emergent}} zucchini. The male flower grows directly on <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> the zucchini plant in the leaf axils (where leaf petiole meets stem), on a long stalk, and is slightly smaller than the female. Both flowers are edible and are often used to dress a meal or to garnish the cooked fruit.|$|E
25|$|The Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway was {{the section}} of railway line between Glasgow Bridge Street railway station and Paisley, in the west of Scotland. It was {{constructed}} and operated jointly by two competing railway companies as <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> their lines to Greenock and Ayr respectively, and it opened in 1840. The Joint Committee, which controlled the line, built a branch to Govan and later to Cessnock Dock, and then Prince's Dock.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{standards}} for listing verbs in dictionaries. Most dictionaries follow {{the tradition of}} spelling out the infinitive form of the verb as the headword of the entry, but others such as the Redhouse Turkish-English Dictionary are more technical and spell out <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> the verb instead, that is, they spell out a string of letters that is useful for producing all other verb forms through morphological rules. Similar to the latter, this article follows the stem-as-citeword standard.|$|E

25|$|Development of {{the beetles}} to the adult state usually takes {{less than a}} year. Females bore up to 20 small holes {{close to each other}} in <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> the Acacia plant, {{immediately}} above the soil level, and lay a single egg into each hole. After hatching, the grubs bore deeper into one of the plant's main roots. The imagines (adults) emerge in the spring in the more southerly latitudes, but can emerge throughout the year in the subtropical parts. They bore {{their way out of the}} plant, leaving the empty pupal case behind.|$|E
25|$|Superficial fruit {{damage is}} common in apple {{varieties}} which form compact fruit clusters, though more significant damage may also occur such that crops are no longer commercially viable. Leaves are webbed to the fruit and feeding injury takes place {{under the protection of}} the leaf; or larvae spin up between fruits of a cluster. Internal damage to apple, pear, and citrus fruits is less common, but a young larva may enter the interior of an apple or pear fruit through the calyx or beneath <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> a citrus fruit. Excreta are usually ejected on to the outside of the fruit.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the main}} users of Kunrei-shiki are native {{speakers}} of Japanese, especially within Japan, and linguists studying Japanese. The main advantage of Kunrei-shiki {{is that it}} is better able to illustrate Japanese grammar, as Hepburn preserves the irregularity of certain conjugations (see table, right). The most serious problem of Hepburn in this context is that it may change <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> a verb, which is not reflected in the underlying morphology of the language. One notable introductory textbook for English-speakers, Eleanor Jorden's , uses her JSL romanization, a system strongly influenced by Kunrei-shiki in its adherence to Japanese phonology, but it is adapted to teaching proper pronunciation of Japanese phonemes.|$|E

25|$|There are, though, many {{variations}} on the theme and many surprising aspects. For one thing, salticids do not necessarily follow a straight path in approaching prey. They may follow a circuitous course, sometimes even a course that takes the hunter through regions from which the prey is not visible. Such complex adaptive behaviour is hard to reconcile with an organism that has such a tiny brain, but some jumping spiders, in particular some species of Portia, can negotiate long detours from one bush down to the ground, then up <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> another bush to capture a prey item on a particular leaf. Such behaviour still {{is the subject of}} research.|$|E
25|$|A {{passenger}} train travels between stations where passengers may embark and disembark. The {{oversight of the}} train {{is the duty of}} a guard/train manager/conductor. Passenger trains are part of public transport and often make up <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> the service, with buses feeding to stations. Passenger trains provide long-distance intercity travel, daily commuter trips, or local urban transit services. They even include a diversity of vehicles, operating speeds, right-of-way requirements, and service frequency. Passenger trains usually can be divided into two operations: intercity railway and intracity transit. Whereas as intercity railway involve higher speeds, longer routes, and lower frequency (usually scheduled), intracity transit involves lower speeds, shorter routes, and higher frequency (especially during peak hours).|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, x denotes two sounds, {{but it is}} not {{separated}} at the boundary of two syllables (e.g. ta-xi rather than *tak-szi, based on phonetics). Long double consonants are separated and their original forms are restored if they are at the boundary of two syllables (e.g. meggyes ‚Äòcherry-flavoured‚Äô > megy-gyes). Although not incorrect, it is not recommended to leave a single vowel at the end or the beginning of a line (e.g. √Å-ron, Le-a). Double vowels can be separated (e.g. v√°ku-um ‚Äòvacuum‚Äô), and long consonants can also be separated (e.g. ton-na ‚Äòton‚Äô). Inflectional suffixes are not considered elements on their own (e.g. although <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> p√©nz√©rt ‚Äòfor money‚Äô is p√©nz, its hyphenation is p√©n-z√©rt rather than *p√©nz-√©rt).|$|E
