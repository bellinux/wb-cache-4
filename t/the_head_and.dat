5|$|Between <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> thorax is the {{membranous}} neck or cervix. It comprises {{a pair of}} lateral cervical sclerites and {{is composed}} of both cephalic and thoracic elements. Between <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> the thorax is a tufted scale called the pronotum. On either side is a shield-like scale called a scapula. In the Noctuoidea, the metathorax is modified {{with a pair of}} tympanal organs.|$|E
5|$|In the holotype specimen, a female, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{body length}} was 310mm (12.2in), the tail length was 210mm (8.3in), the {{hindfoot}} length was 66.8mm (2.63in), the ear length was 17.5mm (0.69in), {{and the body}} mass was 675g (24oz). In another specimen, a male which was captured and released, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> body length was about 330mm (13in), the tail length was about 175mm (6.9in), and the body mass was 600g (21oz). Based on these limited data, S.durrelli may be slightly smaller than the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E

5|$|The adult plumage is {{a uniform}} black, with the {{exception}} of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large patches or bands of white on the wings which do not appear until the completion of the bird's first moulting. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck are red to blackish-red and have few feathers. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck are meticulously kept clean by the bird, and their baldness is an adaptation for hygiene, allowing the skin to be exposed to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and ultraviolet light at high altitudes. The crown of the head is flattened. In the male, the head is crowned with a dark red caruncle or comb, while the skin of his neck lies in folds, forming a wattle. The skin of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, which serves to communicate between individuals. Juveniles have a grayish-brown general coloration, blackish head and neck skin, and a brown ruff.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{hands are}} {{coloured}} using {{a blend of}} oil, water and acrylic colour. From the mould, the body is cast in fibreglass, and <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> hands are fitted to the fiberglass body and dressed in clothes that are often donated by the celebrity. The pose, clothes and expression on the face all contribute to making the figure as realistic as possible. The whole process usually takes {{up to six months}} by a team of 20 people to create and cost about HK$1 million each.|$|E
5|$|The mantis thorax {{consists}} of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> forelegs, is much longer {{than the other two}} thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing {{for a wide range of}} movements of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.|$|E

5|$|Around noon, General Henry Abbot {{arrived at}} President Street with a {{battalion}} of 99 to 114 engineers. As the group advanced toward the armory of the 6th Regiment where {{they were to be}} quartered, they were met by a crowd of 500. Jeers from the crowd turned to missiles until one soldier, Private Corcoran, was struck in <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> wounded. Abbot gave orders that his men were to halt and fix bayonets, at which point the crowd scattered.|$|E

50|$|Dual capstans, {{where one}} is {{on each side}} of <b>the</b> <b>heads,</b> are claimed to provide even {{smoother}} tape travel across <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> result in less variance in the recorded/playback signal.|$|R

Their role is also to oversee all deputies.

5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively small head and a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are on the underside of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E

5|$|Excepting for the head, snakes have imbricate scales, {{overlapping}} {{like the}} tiles on a roof.
