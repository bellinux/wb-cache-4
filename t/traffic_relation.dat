Traditional {{approaches}} to optimal design andplanning of packet networks {{focus on the}} network-layer infrastructure, In this paper, we propose a new packet networkdesign and planning approach {{that is based on}} user-layer QoS parameters. Our proposed approach maps the end-user perfor-mance constrains into transport-layer performance constraints first, and then into network-layer performance constraints. Thelatter are then considered together with a realistic representation of traffic patterns at the network layer to design theIP network. Examples of application of the proposed design methodology to different networking configurations show theeffectiveness of our approach. 1 Introduction The pioneering works of Kleinrock [1] spurred many researchactivities in the field of design and planning of packet networks, and a vast literature is available on this subject. Al-most invariably, however, packet network design focused on the network-layer infrastructure, so that the designer is facedwith a tradeoff between total cost and network average performance (expressed in terms of average network-wide packetdelay, average packet loss probability, average link utilization, network reliability, etc.). This approach adopts the viewpointof network operators, who quite naturally aim at the optimization of some aggregate performance measures, that describethe general behavior of their network, averaging over all <b>traffic</b> <b>relations.</b> Of course, this approach is subject to the risk thata few <b>traffic</b> <b>relations</b> suffer unacceptable performance levels...|$|R
40|$|Environment, {{economics}} and emancipation: a problematic transport and <b>traffic</b> <b>relation</b> The environment {{is the most}} important constraint for life on earth. To manage the environment and to sustain economic and social developments are {{two sides of the same}} medal, which is called 'sustainable environment'. In this article the consequences for mobility of the developments on the labour market and the emancipation of women in society are investigated. The environment imposes limitations on these mobility needs. The development of a labour market of high quality results in larger commuter distances by car and in a lesser degree by public transport. This is harmful to the environment. In general, dual earners and employed singles work closer to their homes than traditional households with only one wage-earner, which is in contradiction with the interests of the economy. Two strategic alternative solutions of the tensions between the mobility interests of the environment, dual-earning households and working singles and the labour market are elaborated. These alternatives differ in the scale on which relationships between companies, offices and households take place. What scale of physical planning meets best the needs of a 'substainable environment', is the question under discussion...|$|E

40|$|Maintaining the <b>traffic</b> {{connectivity}} <b>relations</b> between road features {{has always}} been a time consuming task for in-vehicle navigation, map website, and other traveling service related applications. Such a task has been commonly conducted artificially and inevitably inefficient, yet makes data quality control difficult. Considering the intrinsic rules of traffic connectivity formed by the geometrical structures, spatial and semantic relationships between road features in city road networks, an intelligent processing model is set forward in this paper for traffic connectivity automation. It is argued that traffic connectivity automation between road features is fundamentally a production system composed of the spatial and semantic relations between road features, connectivity rules and control system. With the implementation of an extendable connectivity rule set, the <b>traffic</b> connectivity <b>relations</b> between road network features are built automatically based on the spatial and semantic information of road network. The trigger concept is adopted to monitor and respond the changes in geometrical network and connectivity rules, and then dynamically updates the traffic connectivity between road network features in logical network so as to guarantee the consistence between geometrical network, connectivity rules and logical network. A series of control strategies and a conducting engine are developed to maintain the <b>traffic</b> connectivity <b>relations.</b> A case study conducted on a real road network verifies the effects of the proposed intelligent model...|$|R

Then, the non coincidence of traffic peaks along the day or the week can be exploited. This paper investigates {{the application of the}} <b>traffic</b> domination <b>relation</b> between sets of traffic matrices to multi-hour network planning. Two problem variants are considered: a network with a static, and with a dynamic traffic routing. We derive a set of techniques for, given a multi-hour traffic demand potentially composed of hundreds of matrices, obtaining a traffic series with a smaller number of matrices. The <b>traffic</b> domination <b>relation</b> guarantees that the network designed for the simplified series is suitable for the original one. Also, we apply the domination relation to derive lower bounds to the network cost, and upper bounds to the suboptimality incurred by simplifying the traffic demand. The algorithms proposed are tested in a case of study with the Abilene network. In our tests, a long traffic series could be reduced to a small number of traffic matrices, and be effective for network planning.

PT planning requires traffic-related data (e. g. source-target relationships) which is not available in many cases. Therefore Austrian nationwide mobile network data is used for analysis of large-scale transport relations. The research project SOMOBIL deals with the derivation of methods that enable the development of user-orientated planning solutions on the basis of floating-phone data in coordination with other available transport and mobility data for a defined area of interest. Traffic relationships of the users of public transport are analysed. Within the project, the different data sources are merged. This approach allows the visualisation of <b>traffic</b> <b>relations</b> for different modes of transport. An essential task is the development of algorithms for the identification of PT passengers. With these data, planning solutions are developed according to defined requirements, differentiated by both traffic hours and user-groups. In doing so, traffic modelling as part of at least three different planning scenarios is carried out to calculate the impacts of measures in terms of shifting users between different modes of transport. Positive impacts due to this planning process can be produced in terms of optimized travel times. Recommendations are given for the planning of public transport with floating-phone data and the use of transport modelling...|$|R

Illegal trades in Mainland Southeast Asia are numerous, highly diverse, and most likely increasingly complex. Of course, two of the most prominent illegal trades defining the area are human trafficking and drug trafficking, human <b>trafficking</b> in <b>relation</b> to the extensive regional prostitution market it feeds, with Thailand being infamous the world over for that reason; and drug <b>trafficking</b> in <b>relation</b> to opium and heroin produced in bulk within the similarly ill-famed Golden Triangle. Complexity arises from the fact that human trafficking and drug trafficking can be said to be linked in some places and to some extent, whether drug consumption by prostitutes―and by many of their clients―is concerned or whether economic havoc created by excessively brutal and rapid eradication of illicit crops pushes women into prostitution. However, as we will see, complexity is likewise increased by the fact that many other illegal trades feed off these two major trafficking activities and their existing, and sometimes congruous, networks. Some of these trades may, at some point, contribute to one another; they may also proceed, to some extent, from propitious specific regional dynamics (trafficking in drugs and arms in the context of armed conflicts for example). It is this great diversity and complexity of illegal trading across Mainland Southeast Asia that this book deals with, focusing on five of its most pervasive phenomenon: drug trafficking, human trafficking, arms trafficking, wildlife trafficking and illegal logging, and the trade in counterfeit goods and contraband...|$|R
