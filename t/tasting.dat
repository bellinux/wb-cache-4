40|$|Multiple {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from molecular {{studies indicate that}} individual <b>taste</b> qualities are encoded by distinct <b>taste</b> receptor cells. In contrast, many physiological {{studies have found that}} a significant proportion of <b>taste</b> cells respond to multiple <b>taste</b> qualities. To reconcile this apparent discrepancy and to identify <b>taste</b> cells that underlie each <b>taste</b> quality, we investigated <b>taste</b> responses of individual mouse fungiform <b>taste</b> cells that express gustducin or GAD 67, markers for specific types of <b>taste</b> cells. Type II <b>taste</b> cells respond to sweet, bitter or umami tastants, express <b>taste</b> receptors, gustducin and other transduction components. Type III cells possess putative sour <b>taste</b> receptors, and have well elaborated conventional synapses. Consistent with these findings we found that gustducin-expressing Type II <b>taste</b> cells responded best to sweet (25 / 49), bitter (20 / 49) or umami (4 / 49) stimuli, while all GAD 67 (Type III) <b>taste</b> cells examined (44 / 44) responded to sour stimuli and a portion of them showed multiple <b>taste</b> sensitivities, suggesting discrimination of each <b>taste</b> quality among <b>taste</b> bud cells. These results were largely consistent with those previously reported with circumvallate papillae <b>taste</b> cells. Bitter-best <b>taste</b> cells responded to multiple bitter compounds such as quinine, denatonium and cyclohexamide. Three sour compounds, HCl, acetic acid and citric acid, elicited responses in sour-best <b>taste</b> cells. These results suggest that <b>taste</b> cells may be capable of recognizing multiple <b>taste</b> compounds that elicit similar <b>taste</b> sensation. We did not find any NaCl-best cells among the gustducin and GAD 67 <b>taste</b> cells, raising the possibility that salt sensitive <b>taste</b> cells comprise a different population...|$|R

40|$|Unilateral {{interruption}} of the chorda-lingual nerve {{led to a}} loss of most epithelial axons and to the deterioration of fungiform <b>taste</b> buds in the anterior portion of the tongue of albino rats, mongolian gerbils, and golden hamsters. By three weeks after surgery the following percentages of fungiform <b>taste</b> buds had completely disappeared: 71 % in gerbils, 28 % in rats, and 26 % in hamsters. Residual <b>taste</b> buds were classified into two groups: atrophic <b>taste</b> buds and <b>taste</b> bud remnants. Atrophic <b>taste</b> buds were smaller than normal and typically had no visible <b>taste</b> pore, although they retained the characteristic oval shape of a <b>taste</b> bud and numerous elongated cells. <b>Taste</b> bud remnants were non-oval fragments of <b>taste</b> buds with few elongated cells. Specific markers for elongated <b>taste</b> cells (monoclonal antibodies to keratin 19) confirmed that atrophic <b>taste</b> buds, as well as some <b>taste</b> bud remnants, had elongated <b>taste</b> cells. By 180 days after chorda-lingual nerve transection, 44 % of rat fungiform <b>taste</b> buds had disappeared; morphometric analysis of the 311 residual <b>taste</b> buds established that 241 atrophic <b>taste</b> buds and 69 <b>taste</b> bud remnants were, respectively, 50 % and 75 % smaller than the average volume of 480 normal <b>taste</b> buds. The aggregate loss of gustatory tissue, calculated from the shrinkage of residual <b>taste</b> buds and the volume lost by the outright disappearance of many <b>taste</b> buds, was 88 % for gerbils, 72 % for rats, and 65 % for hamsters. Evaluation in gerbils of the co-occurrence of <b>taste</b> buds and axons suggests residual <b>taste</b> buds were neurotrophically supported. Every gerbil fungiform papilla that lacked axons lacked a <b>taste</b> bud. Every fungiform papillae that had a residual <b>taste</b> bud had axons; axons were absent from 22 % of empty fungiform papillae. Diminished numbers of gustatory neurotrophic axons could account for both the loss of fungiform <b>taste</b> buds and the reduced volume of residual <b>taste</b> buds. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} <b>taste</b> bud is an onion-shaped epithelial {{structure with}} 50 – 100 tightly packed cells, including <b>taste</b> receptor cells, supporting cells, and basal cells. <b>Taste</b> receptor cells detect nutrients and toxins {{in the oral}} cavity and transmit the sen-sory information to gustatory nerve endings in the buds. Supporting cells {{may play a role}} in the clearance of excess neuro-transmitters after their release from <b>taste</b> receptor cells. Basal cells are precursor cells that differentiate into mature <b>taste</b> cells. Similar to other epithelial cells, <b>taste</b> cells turn over continuously, with an average life span of about 8 – 12  days. To maintain structural homeostasis in <b>taste</b> buds, new cells are generated to replace dying cells. Several recent studies using genetic lineage tracing methods have identified populations of progenitor/stem cells for <b>taste</b> buds, although contributions of these progenitor/stem cell populations to <b>taste</b> bud homeostasis have yet to be fully determined.

40|$|Sensory {{organs are}} {{specialized}} {{to detect and}} decode stimuli in terms of intensity and quality.

Here, using an inducible Cre-lox fate mapping approach with the ShhcreERT 2 mouse line, we demonstrate that Shh-expressing embryonic <b>taste</b> placodes are <b>taste</b> bud progenitors, which give rise to at least two different adult <b>taste</b> cell types, but do not contribute to <b>taste</b> papillae. Strikingly, placodally descendant <b>taste</b> cells disappear early in adult life.
