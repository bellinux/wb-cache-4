5000|$|The {{history of}} Pilar do Sul city began in 1850, when drovers, hunters and miners {{passed through the}} region to search {{precious}} metals. The place name may derive {{from the fact that}} many families from the state of Minas Gerais came to the locality to acquire stones that they used to make pestles <b>to</b> <b>tenderize</b> <b>meat.</b> In Portuguese the word [...] "Pilar" [...] means “to pestle.” The local stone was also used for tanning leather of hunted animals. Another possible source of the city’s name may stem from the religiosity of those Minas Gerais’ families, who had great devotion to Our Lady of Pilar, a Spanish Saint.|$|E
50|$|Fluoride's effects {{depend on}} the total daily intake of {{fluoride}} from all sources. About 70-90% of ingested fluoride is absorbed into the blood, where it distributes throughout the body. In infants 80-90% of absorbed fluoride is retained, with the rest excreted, mostly via urine; in adults about 60% is retained. About 99% of retained fluoride is stored in bone, teeth, and other calcium-rich areas, where excess quantities can cause fluorosis. Drinking water is typically the largest source of fluoride. In many industrialized countries swallowed toothpaste is {{the main source of}} fluoride exposure in unfluoridated communities. Other sources include dental products other than toothpaste; air pollution from fluoride-containing coal or from phosphate fertilizers; trona, used <b>to</b> <b>tenderize</b> <b>meat</b> in Tanzania; and tea leaves, particularly the tea bricks favored in parts of China. High fluoride levels have been found in other foods, including barley, cassava, corn, rice, taro, yams, and fish protein concentrate. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has established Dietary Reference Intakes for fluoride: Adequate Intake values range from 0.01 mg/day for infants aged 6 months or less, to 4 mg/day for men aged 19 years and up; and the Tolerable Upper Intake Level is 0.10 mg/kg/day for infants and children through age 8 years, and 10 mg/day thereafter. A rough estimate is that an adult in a temperate climate consumes 0.6 mg/day of fluoride without fluoridation, and 2 mg/day with fluoridation. However, these values differ greatly among the world's regions: for example, in Sichuan, China the average daily fluoride intake is only 0.1 mg/day in drinking water but 8.9 mg/day in food and 0.7 mg/day directly from the air due to the use of high-fluoride soft coal for cooking and drying foodstuffs indoors.|$|E

25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{was sometimes}} used in cooking green vegetables, as {{it gives them}} a bright green colour—which has been described as artificial-looking—due to its reacting with chlorophyll to produce chlorophyllin. However, this tends to affect taste, texture and nutritional content, and is no longer common. Baking soda is still used, though, in the traditional British mushy peas recipe for soaking the peas. It is also used in Asian and Latin American cuisine <b>to</b> <b>tenderize</b> <b>meats.</b> Baking soda may react with acids in food, including vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid). It is also used in breading such as for fried foods to enhance crispness and allow passages for steam to escape, so the breading is not blown off during cooking.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of different aging times on the meat characteristics from young Murrah buffaloes slaughtered at 20 – 24 months of age (experiment I; n= 10) and Murrah buffalo heifers slaughtered at 32 - 36 months of age (experiment II; n= 10), with the purpose of determining the best aging time <b>to</b> <b>tenderize</b> <b>meat</b> from both experiments. Samples of the longissimus thoracis muscle from buffaloes slaughtered at each age were aged for 7, 14, and 21 days (0 ± 1 °C). After this period, analysis of cholesterol, pH, cooking loss, shear force, myofibrillar fragmentation index, meat color, and fatty acid profile was performed. Aging greatly improved the tenderness (p 0. 05), was considered very noticeable to the human eye. Furthermore, aging reduced the polyunsaturated fatty acids (p 0. 05) in the meat of young buffalo and buffalo heifers of advanced age. Based on the evaluated meat characteristics, concludes that seven days of aging are sufficient for older buffalo heifers, but 21 days of aging are required for the younger male group...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Papain, a {{proteolytic}} enzyme, {{is found}} in the dried and purified latex from the fruits of Carica papaya L. (Caricaceae). Papain is used in medicine as a digestive and in the debridement of necrotic tissues. It is used in pharmaceutics as a spreading agent for drugs, supplied as an ointment (10 %) with urea which denatures nonviable protein matter present in lesions. Large amounts of papain are used industrially <b>to</b> <b>tenderize</b> <b>meat.</b> Materials and Methods: In this research, crude latex was collected from Sarbaz region of Sistan-o-Baluchestan province. The full-grown but unriped fruit was subjected to shallow incisions on several sides (depth of incision was important). After collection, the coagulated lumps were shredded and dried by the use of heat (30 °C). Extraction and sedimentation procedures were used for extraction of papain. In this method, cystein hydrochloride at adjusted pH was used for extraction and sodium chloride for sedimentation. The extracted papain was identified by the use of electrophoresis method and also by comparing its IR spectrum with the standard papain. Results: The activity of extracted papain was determined by USP procedure. In this research, 1. 2 g papain was obtained from 100 g latex. Electrophoresis pattern and IR spectrum of extracted papain were identical with the satndard papain. Conclusion: The extracted papain from Iranian Carica papaya (c = 1 mg/ml) showed 5800 U/ml activity...|$|E
40|$|In {{our country}} {{pineapple}} can be processed to be many kind of foods like cake, jelly {{and variety of}} beverages too. Most of producer usually just use flesh of pineapple and throw away it’s peel. Whereas peel of pineapple {{can be used as}} a meat tenderizer because in the pineapple, both in flesh and peel contain Bromelain enzyme <b>to</b> <b>tenderize</b> <b>meat.</b> The tenderness of meat is one of the most determining pharameters of meat quality. Based on that background, this thesis presents the the influence of waste of pineapple’s peel (Ananas Comosus (L) Merr) as the source of bromelain enzyme to increase meat (local beef) quality. The primary purpose of this research is to know the influence of pineapple’s peel (Ananas Comosus (L) Merr) as the source of Bromelain enzyme to increase meat quality. This research uses experimental method. This research had been conducted in the chemistry laboratory of Education and Teacher Training Faculty of Walisongo State Institute for Islamic Studies and in the laboratory of technology of Agriculture faculty,Gadjah Mada University Yogyakarta on April 2013. The subjects of this research are waste of pinepple’s peel (Ananas Comosus (L) Merr) and local beef that were gotten from Jrakah traditional market, Ngaliyan-Semarang. The data technique analysis of this research is descriptive statistics. The result of this research shows that there is influence of waste of pineapple’s peel as source of bromelain emzyme to increase meat quality, especially tenderness. The higher the bromelain enzyme concentration used, the more tender the meat, although will be may increase the score of cooking loss. The meat that is submerged with the highest concentration (40...|$|E

The meat near the bone will cook more slowly {{than the rest of the}} steak, and the tenderloin will tend to reach the desired temperature before the strip.|$|R
50|$|Unpreserved meat {{has only}} a {{relatively}} short life in storage. Perishable meats should be refrigerated, frozen, dried promptly or cured. Storage of fresh meats is a complex discipline that affects the costs, storage life and eating quality of the meat, and the appropriate techniques vary {{with the kind of}} meat and the particular requirements. For example, dry ageing techniques are sometimes used <b>to</b> <b>tenderize</b> gourmet <b>meats</b> by hanging them in carefully controlled environments for up to 21 days, while game animals of various kinds may be hung after shooting.

Modern techniques of preparing meat for storage vary with the type of meat and special requirements of tenderness, flavour, hygiene, and economy.|$|R
40|$|The {{fact that}} {{tenderness}} {{plays a major}} role in consumer acceptance of meat has been known for many years. After appearance and tenderness, flavour is another important component influencing meat palatability. Although proteases are widely used in the meat industry <b>to</b> <b>tenderize</b> <b>meat,</b> they can also contribute to the formation of amino acids that act as precursors for volatile flavour formation in cooked meat. This research was carried out to determine the effects of pre-rigor injection of beef with nine proteases from plant and microbial sources, after 1 day and 21 days post-mortem storage, on the volatile profile of cooked beef using solid phase microextraction (SPME) in combination with gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The topside of beef was injected with papain (PA), bromelain (BA), actinidin (Ac), zingibain (ZI), Fungal 31 protease (F 31), Fungal 60 protease (F 60), bacterial protease (BA), kiwi fruit juice (KJ), and Asparagus protease (ASP). A non-injected control (C) treatment was also included. In this study, a total of 56 key volatile compounds were found in cooked pre-rigor beef meat injected with proteases at 1 day and 21 days post mortem storage. This included 23 aldehydes, 5 ketones, 3 furans, 8 nitrogen and sulphur compounds, 4 alkanes, 7 alcohols and 6 terpenes. Eleven volatile compounds including camphene, 1, 8 -cineole, terpineol, citronellol, citral, geraniol, geranial, α-curcumene, zingiberene, α-farnesene, and β-sesquiphellandrene, were only detected in meat treated with ZI at 1 day and 21 days post-mortem storage. 3 -methylbutanal and benzaldehyde were significantly increased (p< 0. 05) in the KJ 21 days treated sample. Aldehydes were the main chemical compounds that significantly changed with protease treatments and post mortem storage. Benzaldehyde was significantly increased (p< 0. 05) only in F 31 and ASP treated samples from 1 day to 21 days post-mortem storage. A significant increase (p< 0. 05) in 3 -methylbutanal was observed in KJ, BA, BR and F 31 treated samples at 21 days post-mortem storage. Treatments with BR, PA, ASP, AC, and KJ (except KJ 21 days) proteases underwent fewer changes in the volatile compounds leading to a flavour profile closer to that of the control beef sample...|$|E
5000|$|A round steak is a beef steak {{from the}} [...] "round", the rear {{leg of the}} cow. The round is divided into cuts {{including}} the eye (of) round, bottom round, and top round, {{with or without the}} [...] "round" [...] bone (femur), and may include the knuckle (sirloin tip), depending on how the round is separated from the loin. This is a lean cut and it is moderately tough. Lack of fat and marbling makes round dry out when cooked with dry-heat cooking methods like roasting or grilling. Round steak is commonly prepared with slow moist-heat methods including braising, <b>to</b> <b>tenderize</b> the <b>meat</b> and maintain moisture.

5000|$|Seasonings include {{herbs and}} spices, which are {{themselves}} frequently {{referred to as}} [...] "seasonings". However, Larousse Gastronomique states that [...] "to season and to flavour {{are not the same}} thing", insisting that seasoning includes a large or small amount of salt being added to a preparation. Salt may be used to draw out water, or to magnify a natural flavor of a food making it richer or more delicate, depending on the dish. This type of procedure is akin to curing. For instance, sea salt (a coarser-grained salt) is rubbed into chicken, lamb, and beef <b>to</b> <b>tenderize</b> the <b>meat</b> and improve flavor. Other seasonings like black pepper and basil transfer some of their flavor to the food. A well designed dish may combine seasonings that complement each other.|$|R
25|$|The Puritans passed animal {{protection}} {{legislation in}} England too.

Cromwell disliked blood sports, which included cockfighting, cock throwing, dog fighting, bull baiting and bull running, said <b>to</b> <b>tenderize</b> the <b>meat.</b> These could be seen in villages and fairgrounds, and became associated with idleness, drunkenness, and gambling. Kete writes that the Puritans interpreted the biblical dominion of man over animals to mean responsible stewardship, rather than ownership. The opposition to blood sports became part of what was seen as Puritan interference in people's lives, and the animal protection laws were overturned during the Restoration, when Charles II was returned to the throne in 1660.|$|R

40|$|Beef {{tenderness}} {{is one of}} {{the highest}} ranked beef quality concerns among beef packers, purveyors, restaurateurs, and retailers according to recent surveys (Smith et al.). Tenderness has been demonstrated as beef’s most important palatability attribute (Huffman et al.). Unfortunately, current USDA quality grading standards inadequately identify meat tenderness (Savell et al.). However, recent technological improvements have made it possible to effectively segregate carcasses into tenderness categories and <b>to</b> <b>tenderize</b> less tender <b>meat</b> (Shackelford et al.). Widespread adoption of these technologies would enable the beef industry to better provide consumers with the quality products they desire. Prior to implementing an alternative grading (or tenderization) system, more information is needed regarding the value consumers place on tenderness. This study investigated consumer willingness to pay for a guaranteed tender steak and quantified the impact various economic and demographic factors have on consumer willingness to pay for steak with varying tenderness levels. Results demonstrate several points about consumer preferences for beef that should be considered prior to adoption of a beef production/ marketing system based upon tenderness. First, most consumers prefer tender steaks in a blind taste test. Second, providing consumers information regarding tenderness via labeling has value. Third, some consumers are willing to pay large premiums to obtain a “guaranteed tender ” steak instead of a “prob...|$|R

40|$|Mechanically <b>tenderized</b> <b>meat</b> is a {{relatively}} small, although persistent, food-safety problem {{in terms of the}} number of individuals affected by foodborne illness. However, the regulatory history of mechanically <b>tenderized</b> <b>meat</b> is a window into a much larger issue, that of regulatory inertia and the inadequacy of existing mechanisms to counter this stasis. This regulatory inertia does not have a simple cause, nor is it amendable to a simple solution. It cannot be reduced to a problem of agency capture, or a problem with agency incompetence, and although I will propose a couple of fixes, all of them have flaws. Telling the story of the ongoing conversation of mechanically <b>tenderized</b> <b>meat</b> among the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the meat production industry, and interest groups representing the consuming public is important for at least two reasons. First, the focus on a food safety problem that is not well known to the public illustrates the commonplace nature of regulatory inertia, demonstrating that such cases are not confined to high-profile issues with elusive solutions. It is striking that this story of delay and dysfunction takes place in the context of a politically uncontroversial issue that is amenable to a simple regulatory solution and that is particularly well suited to national regulation. Although regulatory inertia is not easily fixed, the problem with mechanically tenderized beef is. Second, this story demonstrates the ineffectual nature of private enforcement. Private enforcement, in the form of agency-forcing suits, should act as a counterpoint to agency delay and dysfunction, by subjecting agency action to judicial review. We expect the judiciary to oversee the process of regulatory fermentation, and to ensure that an agency makes its decisions in a timely, appropriate manner. If an agency acts contrary to its statutory mandate, or bows excessively to political pressure, then oversight by the neutral judiciary should get it back on track. Here, however, government, industry, and advocacy groups representing the consuming public have been discussing this issue for a decade while individuals continue to get sick. Judicial review of this, of course, unavailable until a party bring suit. No parties have done so here, although regulatory inaction has persisted for over a decade...|$|R
