5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis of depression {{is complicated by the}} fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a generalized anxiety disorder to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. <b>They</b> <b>contribute</b> to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, {{the worker}} shares {{half of her}} genes with her sons and only a quarter with her brothers. Furthermore, the workers in colonies with a single once-mated queen are related to their nephews by three eighths, higher than they are related to brothers. This results in a {{conflict}} where the queen and worker females are at odds over the proportion of male offspring <b>they</b> <b>contribute,</b> since each side tries to maximize its reproductive fitness. Queens favor production of their own sons while workers favor production of their own sons, and do not stop their sisters from laying because of the favorable relatedness to nephews.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{preparations}} of acquacotta may use stale, fresh, or toasted bread, and {{can include}} additional ingredients such as vegetable broth, eggs, cheeses such as Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Toscano, celery, garlic, basil, beans such as cannellini beans, cabbage, kale, lemon juice, salt, pepper, potatoes and others. Some versions may use edible mushrooms such as porcini, wild herbs, and leaf vegetables/greens such as arugula, endive, mint, chard, chicory, dandelion greens, watercress, valerian and others. As the greens boil down, <b>they</b> <b>contribute</b> to the broth's flavor. The dish may be {{topped with a}} poached egg. Contemporary versions may be prepared in advance from {{a few hours to}} a day, stored in a cold place or refrigerated, and then reheated prior to serving. It can also be preserved by freezing.|$|E

5|$|Dirac's second-order {{perturbation}} theory can involve virtual photons, transient intermediate {{states of the}} electromagnetic field; the static electric and magnetic interactions are mediated by such virtual photons. In such quantum field theories, the probability amplitude of observable events is calculated by summing over all possible intermediate steps, even ones that are unphysical; hence, virtual photons are not constrained to satisfy , and may have extra polarization states; depending on the gauge used, virtual photons may {{have three or four}} polarization states, instead of the two states of real photons. Although these transient virtual photons can never be observed, <b>they</b> <b>contribute</b> measurably to the probabilities of observable events. Indeed, such second-order and higher-order perturbation calculations can give apparently infinite contributions to the sum. Such unphysical results are corrected for using the technique of renormalization.|$|E
5|$|From early on, ascetics {{have played}} a major role in the Swaminarayan sect. <b>They</b> <b>contribute</b> towards growth and {{development}} of the movement, encouraging people to follow a pious and religious life. Tradition maintains that Swaminarayan initiated 500 ascetics as paramhansas in a single night. Paramhansa is a title of honour sometimes applied to Hindu spiritual teachers who are regarded as having attained enlightenment. Paramhansas were the highest order of sannyasi in the sect. Prominent paramhansas included Muktanand Swami, Gopalanand Swami, Brahmanand Swami, Gunatitanand Swami, Premanand Swami, Nishkulanand Swami, and Nityanand Swami.|$|E
5|$|Questions {{were asked}} in the House of Commons {{about the cost of}} {{policing}} the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of £700 a year. London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council to ask that <b>they</b> <b>contribute</b> to it. Councillor John Archer, later Mayor of Battersea and the first black mayor in London, told the Daily Mail that he was amazed by the request, considering Battersea was already paying £22,000 a year in police rates. The Canine Defence League wondered whether, if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories would be asked to pay the policing costs themselves.|$|E

5|$|Stereotypical and {{historically}} inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views {{of indigenous peoples}} and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, <b>they</b> <b>contribute</b> {{to the development of}} cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E
5|$|The cluster {{contains}} many brown dwarfs, which are objects {{with less than}} about 8% of the Sun's mass, not heavy enough for nuclear fusion reactions to start in their cores and become proper stars. They may constitute up to 25% {{of the total population}} of the cluster, although <b>they</b> <b>contribute</b> less than 2% of the total mass. Astronomers have made great efforts to find and analyse brown dwarfs in the Pleiades and other young clusters, because they are still relatively bright and observable, while brown dwarfs in older clusters have faded and are much more difficult to study.|$|E
5|$|The {{identities of}} only a few {{proteins}} synthesized during L-LTP are known. Regardless of their identities, it is thought that <b>they</b> <b>contribute</b> to the increase in dendritic spine number, surface area, and postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter associated with L-LTP expression. The latter may be brought about in part by the enhanced synthesis of AMPA receptors during L-LTP. Late LTP is also associated with the presynaptic synthesis of synaptotagmin and an increase in synaptic vesicle number, suggesting that L-LTP induces protein synthesis not only in postsynaptic cells, but in presynaptic cells as well. As mentioned previously, for postsynaptic LTP induction to result in presynaptic protein synthesis, there must be communication from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell. This may occur via the synthesis of a retrograde messenger, discussed later.|$|E
