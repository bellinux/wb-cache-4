Further developments to the infrastructure of the site are planned, including a sixth sound stage.|$|R
5|$|By {{the same}} token, the {{viability}} of the benshi system facilitated a gradual transition <b>to</b> sound—allowing <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> <b>to</b> spread out <b>the</b> capital costs of conversion and their directors and technical crews time to become familiar with the new technology.|$|R

5|$|Originally {{intended}} just {{to convince}} Fox to fund some shooting in Paris, Frankel's sizzle reel led <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>to</b> put a stronger marketing push behind the movie. It moved the release date from February to summer, scheduling it as a lighter alternative audiences could consider to Superman Returns {{at the end}} of June 2006, and began to position it as an event movie in and of itself.|$|E
5|$|The Greencards {{announced}} on their website in August 2008 {{that they had}} returned to <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>to</b> record their fourth album with producer Jay Joyce.

50|$|The {{production}} company was plagued with bankruptcy issues, so the main sponsors forced <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> <b>to</b> reuse footage from old episodes to patch newer episodes without redrawing new animation. The final episode {{was merely a}} complete recap of the series.|$|R
50|$|Voicst {{went back}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> <b>to</b> record their second album A Tale of Two Devils in early 2007. They partnered with Peter Katis (producer for Interpol and The National among others), and Rutger Hoedemaeker from the Dutch band About.|$|R
5|$|The Who's {{first attempt}} to record the song was at the Record Plant on W 44 Street, New York City, on 16 March 1971.

This take featured Pappalardi's Mountain band mate, Leslie West, on lead guitar.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the album brought the band touring offers with {{mainstream}} bands such as Blink-182 and The Offspring. The band spent much of 2001 touring; the group played over 300 concerts that year before returning to <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> <b>to</b> record another album.|$|E
5|$|Wagner filmed the {{explosion}} scenes {{at the factory}} on location during nighttime.

The film crew had three weeks to prepare for the factory scene by clearing trees and bringing in some artificial trees to match Lang's idea for the scene. The explosion was triggered by Lang himself.|$|E

5000|$|In December 2009 however, ITV plc {{announced}} plans <b>to</b> renovate <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> <b>to</b> high definition standard, moving production of Emmerdale {{to the main}} Kirkstall Road building.
