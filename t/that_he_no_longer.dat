5|$|After the surrender, Alexander briefly {{considered}} {{joining the}} Brazilian Army. Finding <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> desired the Georgia plantation {{life of his}} youth, he taught mathematics at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, and then served in executive positions with the Charlotte, Columbia, and Augusta Railroad (executive superintendent), the Savannah and Memphis Railroad (president), the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (president), and in the late 1880s the Central Rail Road and Banking Company of Georgia until 1891.|$|E
5|$|The Binding of Isaac was {{developed}} following {{the release of}} Super Meat Boy, which McMillen considered a significant risk and a large time effort. When Super Meat Boy was released to both critical praise and strong sales, he felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> {{had to worry about}} the consequences of taking risks with his finances supported by its sales. He also considered he could take further risk with the concept.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislature}} {{largely ignored}} the governor's message {{in favor of}} partisan concerns. A pure food and drug law was enacted without his signature. His veto of controversial legislation regulating railroad rates, however, was sustained. Both houses passed a resolution calling for the resignation of Senator William Lindsay, a Gold Democrat who did not support William Jennings Bryan's presidential bid, on grounds <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> represented the interests of his party. Lindsay responded that he represented the people of Kentucky and refused to resign his seat.|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "The Wall", Peter and Sylar end up {{trapped in}} Sylar's mind for {{what seems like}} five years to them. Sylar has absorbed Nathan's {{memories}} and seems to have some trouble differentiating between Nathan's and his own, resulting in Peter hitting him. At {{the end of the}} five years, Peter admits <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> so angry at Sylar, but can't forgive him as he feels he won't be doing right by Nathan. Sylar realizes that Peter believes he'll lose Nathan if he forgives Sylar. Sylar gets Peter to realize <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> the way <b>he</b> was and Peter finally accepts it and seems to forgive him for Nathan's death.|$|R
5|$|When Andy {{returns from}} camp, he accepts Jessie, Bullseye, and the Aliens as his new toys, {{thinking}} {{that his mother}} bought them. He then repairs Woody's torn arm while Wheezy's squeaker has also been fixed. Meanwhile, Al's business has suffered due to him failing to sell the Roundup gang. Woody tells Buzz <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> worried about Andy outgrowing him because, when he eventually does, they will still have each other for company.|$|E
5|$|While Silva had an {{impending}} fight with Franklin, {{he was still}} asked about his future with Jackson.

He also said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> has problems with Jackson outside of the cage. Silva ended by saying that he spoke with Jackson at UFC 95 in London, England, and the two shook hands.|$|E
5|$|About 19:45, the 1st Army Group held {{a conference}} in Zagreb, just as German tanks were {{entering}} the city. Nedeljković told Petrović that {{he could no longer}} hold his positions, but despite this, Petrović ordered him to hold for at least 2–3 days to enable the withdrawal of the 7th Army to the Kupa river. Nedeljković replied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> had an army, and suggested that all Serb officers and men be ordered back to form a defensive line along the Sava and Una rivers. Petrović refused to consider this, but ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to form a defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb.|$|E

5|$|Hygeberht had {{resigned}} his see before Lichfield was demoted {{back to a}} bishopric. He was still named as archbishop in 799, but evidence suggests <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> controlled all of the suffragan bishops that he once had. Possibly, he was replaced at Lichfield; his successor Ealdwulf attended a council in 801, and was named bishop in the council's records. By the time that Æthelhard held another council at Clovesho in 803, Hygeberht was no longer even named as a bishop, and appears at that council as an abbot. Which abbey he was abbot of, and his exact date of death, are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, NBC {{has hired}} {{recently}} laid off investment bankers (Patrick Heusinger, Greg Tuculescu, and Doug Mand) from Lehman Brothers as interns on TGS with Tracy Jordan. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{is invited to}} go out on the town with them, but finds that he is incapable of keeping up with their lifestyle. Tracy fears that if the public were to learn <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> lives a fast lifestyle, his image would be severely compromised and he would be forced to change from a comedic actor to a dramatic actor. Tracy refuses to allow this to happen, so he buys out Lehman Brothers and sends the interns back to their old jobs on Wall Street.|$|E
5|$|Shulgin's {{professional}} activities {{continued to}} lean {{in the direction}} of psychopharmacology, furthered by his personal experiences with psychedelics. But during this period he was unable to do much independent research. His opportunity for further research came in 1961 after his development of Zectran, the first biodegradable pesticide, a highly profitable product. In his book PIHKAL, Shulgin limits his pesticide days at Dow Chemical to one sentence in 978 pages. Dow Chemical Company, in return for Zectran's valuable patent, gave Shulgin great freedom. During this time, he created and patented drugs when Dow asked, and published findings on other drugs in journals such as Nature and the Journal of Organic Chemistry. Eventually, Dow Chemical requested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> use their name on his publications.|$|E

5|$|The Brabant Revolution {{broke out}} on 24 October 1789 when the émigré patriot army under Van der Mersch {{crossed over the}} Dutch border into the Austrian Netherlands. The army, which {{numbered}} 2,800 men, crossed into the Kempen region south of Breda. The army arrived {{in the town of}} Hoogstraten where a specially prepared document, the Manifesto of the People of Brabant (Manifeste du peuple brabançon), was read in the city hall. The document denounced Joseph II's rule and declared <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> held legitimacy. The text of the speech itself was an embellished version of the 1581 declaration (the Verlatinge) by the Dutch States-General denouncing Philip II's rule in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{night before}} school starts, Spider-Man, alter ego of Peter Parker (Josh Keaton), foils an {{attempted}} bank robbery; in the background, a shadowed figure (Keith David) tells his henchman Hammerhead (John DiMaggio) {{to summon the}} Enforcers to kill Spider-Man. The next day, an aerodynamic engineer named Adrian Toomes (Robert Englund) is outraged at OsCorp for stealing his anti-gravity project, viciously berating Dr. Otto Octavius (Peter MacNicol) until Norman Osborn (Alan Rachins) arrives. Osborn dismisses Toomes, calling him a failure and a buzzard before he has him escorted out by security. Toomes turns to Octavius and declares <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> blames him for the theft of his work.|$|E

The XLVI Motorised Corps encountered little resistance from the 4th Army, particularly from the 27th Infantry Division Savska and 40th Infantry Division Slavonska on its right, and by the evening of 10 April the whole 4th Army was disintegrating. Petrović wanted to dismiss Marić as commander of the 27th Infantry Division Savska due to suspicions that he was an Ustaše sympathiser, but could not identify a suitable replacement.|$|E

5|$|After a bloodless {{skirmish}} between Serb {{insurgents and}} Croatian special police in March, the JNA itself, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the Federal Presidency {{to give it}} wartime authorities and declare a state of emergency. The request was denied on 15 March, and the JNA came {{under the control of}} Serbian President Slobodan Milošević. Milošević, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> recognized the authority of the Federal Presidency. By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents, and preventing Croatian police from intervening. In early April, the leaders of the Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control, known as SAO Krajina, with Serbia. The Government of Croatia viewed this declaration as an attempt to secede.|$|E

5|$|For {{several years}} on the series, a {{defining}} characteristic of Todd's personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy, which were due to his mistreatment by others, especially his adoptive father, who may have raped {{him when he was}} fourteen. It was also due to his horrific past misdeeds, including his rape of Marty and dysfunctional aspects of his relationship with Blair. Surviving a near-death experience and being presumed dead in 1995 and, upon his return in 1996, finding Blair having sex with Patrick made Todd bitter; seeing Blair with another man sexually, soon after his presumed death, caused him to shut down emotionally. The writers made Todd's fear of intimacy into a prominent obstacle for his relationship with his second wife, Téa. When she at one point attempts to seduce Todd by stripping down naked {{in front of him and}} pleading with him to make love to her, he rejects her, explaining <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> trusts himself to be intimate in that way; he subsequently throws her out, practically naked, into the middle of a snowstorm.|$|E
5|$|However, between March 14 and 15, the ARVN 2nd Infantry Regiment {{was forced}} to turn back from Tam Kỳ {{to deal with an}} attack on Thang Binh, by the Viet Cong 70th and 72nd Local Force Battalions. In {{southern}} Quảng Ngãi, the Viet Cong 94th Local Force Regiment attacked Binh Son, cut off a section of National Highway 1 near Chau O, and the ARVN 4th Infantry Regiment (2nd Infantry Division) was pinned down trying to deal with Viet Cong attacks. Thus, South Vietnamese attempts to stage an effective counter-attack were quickly blunted by the combined Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces in Quảng Ngãi Province. Recognising <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> has the manpower to mount a counter-attack, General Nhut ordered his troops to abandon Tra Bong and Son Ha, and concentrate his units in Tam Kỳ and Chu Lai instead.|$|E

He promises that as proof of his feelings he will defy Armida's wrath and secure Almirena's freedom. Meanwhile, Rinaldo is brought before the triumphant Armida. As he demands that Almirena be set free, Armida finds herself drawn to his noble spirit, and declares her love. When he angrily rejects her she uses her powers to assume Almirena's form, but Rinaldo suspects trickery, and departs. Armida, resuming her own appearance, is furious at her rejection yet retains feelings of tender love. She decides on another attempt to ensnare Rinaldo, and transforms herself back into Almirena's shape, but then encounters Argante. Believing her to be Almirena, Argante repeats his earlier promises of love and freedom. Swiftly resuming her own form, Armida denounces his infidelity and vows vengeance. Argante defiantly confirms his love for Almirena and declares <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> needs Armida's help. She departs in a fury.|$|E
