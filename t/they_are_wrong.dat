5|$|Each episode {{consists}} of three rounds. A team of four contestants starts the game; one player is eliminated after two rounds of play. For each question, the team has 60 seconds to unanimously agree on an answer; the available money decreases the longer it takes. Each contestant must enter the same response on their respective panel and then everyone must simultaneously lock in an answer and stop the clock. If the team answers the question correctly, they bank whatever money is left on the clock; if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> or if time runs out, their bank is reduced by half.|$|E
5|$|After soccer practice, Bart {{waits for}} Homer {{to pick him}} up, though his father has forgotten. When Homer finally remembers, he reasons to an angered Bart that they should just both admit <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong</b> and try to put the issue behind them. Later, Bart views a {{commercial}} for a mentor program called The Bigger Brothers, which pairs up fatherless boys with positive male role models. Still angry at Homer, Bart goes to the agency {{pretending to be a}} young boy whose father was a drunken gambler who abandoned him. Bart's story is so sad that the receptionist pairs him up with their best Bigger Brother, a military test pilot named Tom. The two spend time together doing a variety of activities, though Bart begins to feel guilty over taking up Tom's time despite not actually being fatherless. Eventually, Homer finds out about Bart's Bigger Brother and confronts Bart for it. Homer then decides to go to the Bigger Brothers Agency to get revenge by being assigned with a replacement son; a young poor boy named Pepi. Just like Tom and Bart, Homer and Pepi spend time together doing activities.|$|E
25|$|People {{often say}} that {{machines}} enslave man and that technology dehumanises society, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong!</b> It is the manufacturer that enslaves man. It {{is to the}} manufacturer that man is condemned to a life sentence of forced labour. The manufacturer enslaves man, but robots free us. The only reason that technology is dehumanising society is because humans still {{have to work with}} the machines used for forced labour, or because they must clock in to where the forced labour takes place. That is the problem, humans and machines should not be mixed together. Humans are designed to spend their time in places of fulfilment, while machines are designed to function in the workplace, under the supervision of robots and computers.|$|E

500|$|It {{has also}} been claimed that certain former pieces of {{evidence}} for evolution which are now considered out-of-date and erroneous, such as Ernst Haeckel's 19th-century comparative drawings of embryos, used to illustrate his recapitulation theory ("ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"), were not merely errors but frauds. Molecular biologist Jonathan Wells [...] criticizes biology textbooks by alleging that they continue to reproduce such evidence {{after it has been}} debunked. In response, the National Center for Science Education notes that none of the textbooks reviewed by Wells makes the claimed error, as Haeckel's drawings are shown in a historical context with discussion about why <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong,</b> and the accurate modern drawings and photos used in the textbooks are misrepresented by Wells.|$|E

The spokesman of the Corsican nationalist party Party of the Corsican Nation, François Alfonsi, said: [...] "The organisers must be afraid of terrorist attacks. If they are really thinking of a possible terrorist action, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> Our movement, which is nationalist and in favour of self-government, would be delighted if the Tour came to Corsica."

2500|$|Mortimer J. Adler {{wrote the}} {{following}} about Kierkegaard in 1962: [...] For Kierkegaard, man {{is essentially an}} individual, {{not a member of}} a species or race; and ethical and religious truth is known through individual existence and decision-through subjectivity, not objectivity. Systems of thought and a dialectic such as Hegel’s are matters merely of thought, which cannot comprise individual existence and decision. Such systems leave out, said Kierkegaard, the unique and essential “spermatic point, the individual, ethically and religiously conceived, and existentially accentuated.” Similarly in the works of the American author Henry David Thoureau, writing {{at the same time as}} Kierkegaard, there is an emphasis on the solitary individual as the bearer of ethical responsibility, who, when he is right, carries the preponderant ethical weight against the state, government, and a united public opinion, when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>wrong.</b> The solitary individual with right on his side is always “a majority of one.” Ethics, the study of moral values, by Mortimer J. Adler and Seymour Cain. Pref. by William Ernest Hocking. 1962 p. 252 ...|$|E

40|$|We {{know that}} {{stochastic}} feedback impairs children’s associative stimulus–response (S–R) learning (Crone et al., 2004 a; Eppinger et al., 2009), but {{the impact of}} stochastic feedback on sequence learning that involves deductive reasoning has not been not tested so far. In the current study, 8 - to 11 -year-old children (N[*]=[*] 171) learned a sequence of four left and right button presses, LLRR, RRLL, LRLR, RLRL, LRRL, and RLLR, which needed to be deduced from feedback because no directional cues were given. One group of children experienced consistent feedback only (deterministic feedback, 100 % correct). In this condition, green feedback on the screen indicated that the children had <b>been</b> right when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> right, and red feedback indicated that the children had <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong.</b> Another group of children experienced inconsistent feedback (stochastic feedback, 85 % correct, 15 % false), where in some trials, green feedback on the screen could signal that children were right when in fact <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong,</b> and red feedback could indicate that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> when in fact <b>they</b> had <b>been</b> right. Independently of age, children’s sequence learning in the stochastic condition was initially much lower than in the deterministic condition, but increased gradually and improved with practice. Responses toward positive vs. negative feedback varied with age. Children were increasingly able to understand that <b>they</b> could have <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> when feedback indicated <b>they</b> <b>were</b> right (self-reflection), but they remained unable to understand that <b>they</b> could have <b>been</b> right when feedback indicated <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> (self-assertion) ...|$|R
