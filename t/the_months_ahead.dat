30|$|For the {{conventional}} method, the forecasting accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>month</b> <b>ahead</b> daily load profile and fuel price {{of each day}} is relatively low. However, the electricity price is strongly sensitive to the load and fuel prices. Forecasting errors of these input factors may result in non-negligible errors of the forecasted electricity price. For the proposed method, the forecasting accuracy of <b>month</b> <b>ahead</b> average daily load profile and <b>month</b> <b>ahead</b> average fuel price is relatively high. In other words, the forecasting errors of the input factors are small, and the forecasting error of the proposed method mainly originates from the modeling error.|$|R
30|$|Reference [22] {{forecasts}} the mid-term UK baseload {{electricity prices}} by forecasting {{the prices of}} each day and averaging the forecasts afterwards. As is known, block transaction is adopted in the UK spot market. The UK baseload electricity price has a lower price fluctuation. Therefore, it is less sensitive to load variation and fuel price fluctuation. However, the day-ahead price in Electric reliability council of Texas (ERCOT) varies {{from time to time}} and day to day. It is highly sensitive to load variations and fuel price fluctuations. <b>Month</b> <b>ahead</b> daily load forecasting and daily fuel price forecasting is not accurate enough, which may result in low accuracy of hourly day-ahead price forecasting if we forecast the daily electricity prices of ERCOT and average the forecasts afterward. <b>The</b> <b>month</b> <b>ahead</b> monthly load forecasting accuracy is approximately 98 %. <b>The</b> <b>month</b> <b>ahead</b> fuel price forecasting can learn from the future price, which usually has good results [23]. Hence, the advantage of forecasting the average daily electricity price profile directly instead of forecasting the hourly electricity prices and average the forecasts afterwards is clear due to the higher accuracy of monthly load forecasting and average fuel price forecasting.|$|R
