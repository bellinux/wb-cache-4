5|$|According to the police, the {{passengers}} behaved very calmly, given the circumstances. Keč allowed several of {{the passengers}} to use their mobile telephones, allowing {{one of them to}} communicate with the police and keep Sheriff Jan Bergen updated on the situation. Anti-terror police had been called to the scene, and there were plans to storm the aircraft if the situation escalated. After the incident, the police refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>if</b> they would have stormed the aircraft if Keč followed through his threats to depart to another airport. During the last stages of the incident, another aircraft was parked beside the MD-82, which the police confirmed played a role {{towards the end of the}} hijacking. All communication towards the central government was made to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice, and neither the prime minister of the minister of foreign affairs was ever contacted. No weapons were found on either the aircraft nor on the hijacker.|$|E
5|$|A large {{quantity}} of funerary urns have been excavated from {{the bases of}} buildings; the deceased were cremated and their ashes collected in the urns. The sides of the urns were perforated with three holes, perhaps to represent the eyes and mouth of the deceased. The urns were decorated with polychrome motifs {{in the form of}} highly stylised serpent decorations painted in black, red and cream; this style of Maya ceramics has been labelled as Chinautla Polychrome after the site where it was first identified. The Postclassic Maya custom of interring the cremated remains of the deceased in urns was restricted to the elite; commoners where buried in simple tombs outside the city centre. In Jilotepeque Viejo urns were usually buried under the front of platform bases or under the sides of pyramids and altars. This was not a general practice among the highland Maya in the Postclassic and represents a tradition unique to the city. Funerary urns have been found interred under all the principal plazas of the city. Approximately equal proportions of urns were interred under platforms and under the ceremonial architecture represented by pyramids and altars, although it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>if</b> those individuals buried under religious architecture had differing roles than those buried under secular architecture.|$|E

25|$|It is {{unlikely}} that hominins populated Eurasia after a one-off event getting a few hominins across a strait (such as a Homo erectus family drifting on flood debris and landing on a Eurasian bank). There are biological constraints to the minimum size a population must maintain to avoid extinction.

25|$|For their part, Frankfurt School theorists quickly came {{to realize}} that a dialectical method could only be adopted if it could be applied to itself—that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>if</b> they adopted a self-correcting method—a dialectical method that would enable them to correct {{previous}} false dialectical interpretations. Accordingly, critical theory rejected the historicism and materialism of orthodox Marxism. Indeed, the material tensions and class struggles of which Marx spoke were no longer seen by Frankfurt School theorists as having the same revolutionary potential within contemporary Western societies—an observation that indicated that Marx's dialectical interpretations and predictions were either incomplete or incorrect.|$|E

Carbon in the sediment suggests the forest was cleared by slash and burn. This period corresponds to the settlement of the Carians in the area, who apparently moved in from southern Anatolia. There is a semi-legendary tradition that they subdued another Pre-Hellenic people, the Leleges, but the evidence is not precise enough <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>if</b> the indigenes were all or partly Leleges.

On the 3rd of February 2002 Jagland announced that he wouldn't seek a new term as party leader in November.|$|E
25|$|Bissell {{and other}} project {{officials}} believed that surviving a U-2 accident from above 70,000feet was impossible, so {{they used the}} preexisting cover story.

By remaining silent, Khrushchev lured the Americans into reinforcing the cover story until he revealed on 7 May that Powers was alive and had confessed to spying on the Soviet Union. Eisenhower turned down Dulles' offer to resign and publicly took full responsibility for the incident on 11 May; by then all overflights were canceled. The Paris Summit collapsed after Khrushchev, as the first speaker, demanded an apology from the U.S., which Eisenhower refused.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{biology is}} an {{emerging}} science that regards natural cognition as a biological function. It {{is based on}} the theoretical assumption that every organism—whether a single cell or multicellular—is continually engaged in systematic acts of cognition coupled with intentional behaviors, i.e., a sensory-motor coupling. That is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>if</b> an organism can sense stimuli in its environment and respond accordingly, it is cognitive. Any explanation of how natural cognition may manifest in an organism is constrained by the biological conditions in which its genes survives {{from one generation to the}} next. And since by Darwinian theory the species of every organism is evolving from a common root, three further elements of cognitive biology are required: (i) the study of cognition in one species of organism is useful, through contrast and comparison, to the study of another species’ cognitive abilities; (ii) it is useful to proceed from organisms with simpler to those with more complex cognitive systems, and (iii) the greater the number and variety of species studied in this regard, the more we understand the nature of cognition.|$|E

25|$|During the Battle Phase of each turn, {{the player}} {{may choose to}} attack their {{opponent}} once with each monster in Attack Position (face-up in a vertical orientation), targeting one of the opponent's monsters or, if the opponent has no defending monsters, attacking them directly. When an attack is declared, the ATK points of the attacking monster is compared with the ATK or DEF points of the defending monster, depending on which position it is in. If both the attacking and defending monsters are in Attack Position, then the monster with the lowest ATK points is destroyed {{and sent to the}} Graveyard, with its owner losing Life Points based on {{the difference between the two}} monsters' ATK points. For example, if a monster with 1400 ATK destroys a monster with 1000 ATK, the owner of the losing monster will lose 400 Life Points. If both monsters have the same number of ATK Points, both monsters are destroyed and neither player takes damage. Monsters with 0 ATK cannot destroy anything, that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>if</b> two monsters with 0 ATK battle, neither monster will be destroyed.|$|E

The orders were later modified <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>if</b> his diversion could {{be made into a}} successful attack, then Steedman should do so. On December 16, Thomas ordered an attack by the corps of Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Wood (along with Steedman's men) against the right of the Army of Tennessee, now held by Maj. Gen. Stephen D. Lee's corps. At noon the attack was begun, but initially was without success. Steedman's men took heavy losses in the first assaults this day, including one of his regiments, the 13th USCT Infantry, losing 221 men, the most of any regiment that day, Union or Confederate. When the rest of Thomas' force finally broke through Cheatham's men on the left as well as the Confederate center at 4 p.m., Wood and Steedman renewed their attack and helped the rest of Thomas' army overwhelmed Lee's corps, driving it from the field.|$|E
