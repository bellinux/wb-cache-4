5|$|The large {{figure of}} Jonah {{is of great}} {{significance}} to the total composition, both pictorially and theologically, being symbolic of <b>the</b> <b>Risen</b> Christ. The figure occupies the pendentive which rises from the altar wall to support the vault, and strains backward, his eyes turned towards God. The foreshortening described by Vasari was innovative and highly influential to later painters. The cleaning of this significant figure has left a few remnants of black shadow visible to the extreme {{left side of the}} painting. All the other, less intense, black lines and washes have been removed, lessening the impact of the radical foreshortening, and also robbing the great fish, the genii behind Jonah, and the architectural figures of much detail.|$|E
5|$|Oxbow {{was moved}} {{with the rest}} of Lukas' horses to winter {{headquarters}} at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He started his Triple Crown prep season on January 19, 2013, with a win at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans in the mile and 70-yard (1,672 m) Grade III Lecomte Stakes. Ridden for the second time by Jon Court, he went off as the fourth choice at 5–1 and had a favorable number four post position. He came out of the gate quickly and was the front-runner throughout the race. At the top of the homestretch, he was only a half length in front of the field, but then he drew away and won by more than eleven and a half lengths. Horses he beat that day included Golden Soul, who later placed second in the Kentucky Derby, and I've Struck a Nerve, who Oxbow faced again later in <b>the</b> <b>Risen</b> Star Stakes. He earned a speed figure of 94 and an additional ten points towards qualification for the Derby. That month, Lukas also contacted veteran Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens, who had just returned to racing after a seven-year retirement, and discussed having Stevens ride Oxbow in future races.|$|E

30|$|The right {{panel of}} Fig.  4 shows the {{relationship}} between the amplitude and <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time of <b>the</b> PI. The vertical axis indicates the magnetic field amplitude of the PI. The horizontal axis indicates <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time of <b>the</b> PI. <b>The</b> <b>rise</b> times in <b>the</b> speed jump simulations are shorter than those in the density jump simulations. <b>The</b> <b>rise</b> time is determined by the time in which the solar wind discontinuity passes through the effective length of the magnetosphere. The solar wind velocity in the speed jump simulations is higher than that in the density jump simulations. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> times in <b>the</b> speed jump simulations are shorter than those in the density jump simulations. In both the speed jump and density jump simulations, the PI amplitude increases as <b>the</b> PI <b>rise</b> time decreases. This tendency {{is the same as the}} relation between <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time and <b>the</b> amplitude of the DL investigated by Araki et al. (2004). On the other hand, a difference is that <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time of <b>the</b> PI is shorter than that of <b>the</b> DL. <b>The</b> <b>rise</b> time of <b>the</b> PI is at most 90 s, while <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time of <b>the</b> DL is at least 1.5 – 9 min. We can estimate the effective length of the PI from the product of the solar wind velocity and <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time in our simulation results, which is ~ 3.5 Re from the speed jump simulations. This indicates that the effective region of the PI is more localized than that of the DL, which has an effective length of 30 Re. The reason for <b>the</b> short PI <b>rise</b> time is that the dynamo generating the FAC is localized in the dayside magnetosphere. We next discuss the mechanism by which the dynamo generates the magnetic field disturbance on the ground via the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system.|$|R

40|$|After {{violence}} has been stopped in conflicts {{the international community}} has attempted to build durable peace in the conflict regions. Previous research focused on the success of and the criticism on UN-led peacebuilding while not considering unilateral peacebuilding in detail. This thesis hypothesizes that peacebuilding by the US before <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of <b>the</b> UN is more successful than unilateral peacebuilding thereafter. Furthermore, a US peacebuilding mission before <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of <b>the</b> UN will be more expansive with regard to the instruments used than a mission after <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of <b>the</b> UN. 15 cases that took place before and after <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of <b>the</b> UN confirm that US peacebuilding efforts were indeed more successful before <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of <b>the</b> UN. These cases reveal that peacebuilding not necessarily became less expansive after <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of <b>the</b> UN but that the nature of peacebuilding shifted towards democratization and financial aid, for instance...|$|R
