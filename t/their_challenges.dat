25|$|Colin Dann's {{illustrated}} novel, The Animals of Farthing Wood (1979), originated {{a multimedia}} franchise comprising the original children's book, a prequel book, six sequel books, and an animated Animals of Farthing Wood television series {{based on the}} books, which {{tell the story of}} a group of woodland animals whose home has been paved over by developers, their journey to the White Deer Park nature reserve, where they will be safe, their Oath, promising to protect one another and overcome their natural instincts until they reach their destination, and their adventures once they've reached White Deer Park. <b>Their</b> <b>challenges</b> include hunters and poachers.|$|E
25|$|A stroke {{can affect}} the ability to live {{independently}} and with quality. Self-management programs are a special training that educates stroke survivors about stroke and its consequences, helps them acquire skills to cope with <b>their</b> <b>challenges,</b> and helps them set and meet their own goals during their recovery process. These programs are tailored to the target audience, and lead by someone trained and expert in stroke and its consequences (most commonly professionals, but also stroke survivors and peers). A 2016 review reported that these programs {{improve the quality of}} life after stroke, without negative effects. People with stroke felt more empowered, happy and satisfied with life after participating in this training.|$|E
25|$|Some of the United Monroe poll watchers {{claimed that}} Langdon Chapman, an {{attorney}} for the Monroe town board, which they believe is controlled by members deferential to Kiryas Joel and its interests, {{was one of those who}} intimidated them. Coleman told the Record that while he had been at the banquet hall in question, he had only insisted that poll watchers state the reason for <b>their</b> <b>challenges,</b> as legally required, and had left after two hours. He was subsequently appointed county attorney (the lawyer who represents the county in civil matters) by new county executive Steve Neuhaus, whose margin of victory included all but 20 of the votes from the village.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the many}} values of {{dialogue}} journals is the opportunity {{for the teacher to}} provide informal counseling in a non-threatening, private context for individual students on <b>their</b> <b>challenges</b> and problems, whether about instructional or personal concerns. This use is closest to the goal and practice of Mrs. Reed, the original 6th grade teacher who had taken training with Dr. William Glasser on Reality Therapy for classroom teachers. The training led her to use the private written conversations to model the pragmatic, problem-solving perspective of Reality Therapy and to encourage students to think through issues and problems with her guidance. Of her writing with the students, she said, “I cannot think of any better way to learn so much about my students, myself, and my own teaching”.|$|E

[...] Pryce reported that since The Wiggles' audience changed every few years, {{the transition to}} the new group was easier for their young audience than it was for their parents. [...] One of <b>their</b> <b>challenges,</b> especially for their early tours, was learning The Wiggles' catalogue of 1400 songs. [...] In early 2016, Pryce described The Wiggles' competitive culture of fitness, especially among the male cast, by citing the group's grueling performance schedule, saying, [...] "Sometimes it feels like it's an extreme sport".|$|E
500|$|The Greektown and Maxwell Street residents, {{along with}} the {{remnants}} of other immigrant groups living on the outer fringes of the Hull House Neighborhood, disappeared long before the physical demise of Hull House. [...] The exodus of most ethnic groups began shortly {{after the turn of}} the twentieth century. Their businesses, e.g. Greektown and Maxwell Street, however, remained. [...] Italian Americans were the only immigrant group that endured as a vibrant on-going community. That community came to be known as [...] "Little Italy". [...] Taylor Street's Little Italy, the inner core of Addams' [...] "Hull House Neighborhood", remained as the laboratory upon which the social and philanthropic groups of Hull House elitists had tested their theories and formulated <b>their</b> <b>challenges</b> to the establishment.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was also}} positively received; critics praised its level design and replay value. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com appreciated the variation between each level and <b>their</b> <b>challenges</b> {{and letting the}} player choose the levels {{they would like to}} play. DeVries and Altano considered the [...] "classic"-style gameplay to be a successful revival of the 1990s Sonic titles and the [...] "modern"-style to be similarly enjoyable, though they offered minor criticism of the former's floaty physics and the latter's reliance on speed. Justin Towell of GamesRadar praised the level design to be among the best, claiming the Chemical Plant level gets [...] "more fun with every play". Bramwell found the 3D levels surprisingly enjoyable. Famitsu favorably compared the sense of speed to that of racing games and praised the [...] "nimble" [...] camerawork, describing the overall experience as addictive.|$|E
500|$|The royal {{government}} and Parliament began to re-establish the normal processes of government after the revolt; as the historian Michael Postan describes, the uprising {{was in many}} ways a [...] "passing episode". On 30 June, the King ordered England's serfs to return to their previous conditions of service, and on 2 July the royal charters signed under duress during the rising were formally revoked. Parliament met in November to discuss the events of the year and how best to respond to <b>their</b> <b>challenges.</b> The revolt was blamed on the misconduct of royal officials, who, it was argued, had been excessively greedy and overbearing. The Commons stood behind the existing labour laws, but requested changes in the royal council, which Richard granted. Richard also granted general pardons to those who had executed rebels without due process, to all men who had remained loyal, and to all those who had rebelled– {{with the exception of the}} men of Bury St Edmunds, any men who had been involved in the killing of the King's advisers, and those who were still on the run from prison.|$|E

2500|$|With {{three black}} defendants, {{the lawyers for}} the Charlotte Three {{requested}} that since the grand jury [...] "excludes blacks from participation since it is derived from voter registration laws", the case should be dropped. Judge Snepp however refuted that point, as he claimed that blacks could register to vote as they pleased. The defendants' lawyers saw this as a systematic attempt to stop blacks {{from being able to}} register to vote. At the time, black voters had to take voter tests, unlike their white counterparts, implying an unfair situation. Similarly, the prosecutor's office decided to appoint no black or Jewish jurors, with a near deaf old black lady as the lone exception. Since the defense had to waste all <b>their</b> <b>challenges</b> and objections that they are legally allowed to have by removing clearly incompetent jury members, they were left at a considerable disadvantage in the courtroom.|$|E
2500|$|In most {{editions of}} The Mole, however, players are usually {{given the chance}} at [...] "exemptions" [...] or [...] "free passes". Should a player earn an exemption, {{he or she is}} not {{required}} to take the quiz and thus safe from elimination. Traditionally, an exemption must be earned by preventing the team from winning <b>their</b> <b>challenges</b> (such as being successful in evading identification by the other contestants in a photo hunt). Seasons 2 and 5 of The Mole in the US saw the most prevalent use of exemptions, with nearly one every episode, and multiple exemptions on occasion. In the 2009 edition in the Netherlands, the [...] "super exemption" [...] was introduced. In the episode the contestants were able to find two regular exemptions. If, during the quiz, only one exemption was used, it counted as an exemption for the person who used it. He or she could take someone with him or her to stay another round. If, however, both exemptions were to be used none of the players would have to leave, hence the [...] "super exemption". In the fifth season of the Australian version, its host Tom Williams referred to them frequently as [...] "immunity" [...] rather than [...] "exemptions" [...] or [...] "free passes".|$|E
2500|$|... "This {{monument}} {{symbolizes the}} pinnacle of successful {{for the construction of}} the North–South Expressway that connects Bukit Kayu Hitam bordering with Thailand in the North to Johor Bahru in the Causeway bordering with Singapore in the South. The construction of the 848km expressway, across the peat swamps and forests and hill untapped granite hills, is an amazing achievement. Also impressive is the pragmatic way in which the combined efforts between {{the public and private sectors}} has resulted in this achievement. The expressways is the result of joint efforts of the Malaysian Highway Authority, a statutory body, which has been planned early and begin construction, with the Projek Lebuhraya Utara-Selatan Berhad (PLUS) (North–South Expressway Project), a private company that was awarded concessions to finance, design, construct, operate and maintain the expressways. Such efforts shows an improvement visions into a reality after across a variety of challenges that threaten to stop. It acknowledged the success of the Government and represents a national effort funded and operated successfully by Malaysians. This monument also commemorates the efforts of leaders of the Government, public services, businesses, financial institutions, consultants, engineers and consultants, as well as contractors and labours, which has played an important role in facing <b>their</b> <b>challenges</b> and bring this project to a level of success. Those who use this expressway will be expected not only to enjoy the various parties in the construction efforts, but also can even appreciate this expressway contribution towards national development." ...|$|E

60|$|The spice {{of life is}} battle; the friendliest {{relations}} are still a kind of contest; and if we would not forego all that is valuable in our lot, we must continually face some other person, eye to eye, and wrestle a fall whether in love or enmity. It is still by force of body, or power of character or intellect, that we attain to worthy pleasures. Men and women contend for {{each other in the}} lists of love, like rival mesmerists; the active and adroit decide <b>their</b> <b>challenges</b> in the sports of the body; and the sedentary sit down to chess or conversation. All sluggish and pacific pleasures are, to the same degree, solitary and selfish; and every durable bond between human beings is founded in or heightened by some element of competition. Now, the relation that has the least root in matter is undoubtedly that airy one of friendship; and hence, I suppose, it is that good talk most commonly arises among friends. Talk is, indeed, both the scene and instrument of friendship. It is in talk alone that the friends can measure strength, and enjoy that amicable counter-assertion of personality which is the gauge of relations and the sport of life.|$|E
6000|$|It {{appears to}} have jaundiced my view of the whole cathedral, which I did not find at all {{comparable}} to that of Siena, whereas in 1908 I thought it all beautiful. This may have been because I was so newly from the ugliness of the Eoman churches; though I felt, as I had felt before, that the whole group of sacred edifices at Pisa was too suggestive of decorative pastry and confectionery. No more than at the second view of it did I now attempt the ascent of the Leaning Tower; I had discharged this duty for life when I first saw it; with my seventy-one years upon me, I was not willing to climb its winding stairs, and I doubted if I could keep it from falling, as I then did, by inclining myself the other way. I resolved that I would leave this to the new-comer; but I gladly followed our cicerone across the daisied green from the cathedral to the baptistery, where I found the famous echo waiting to welcome me back, and greet me with its angelic sweetness, when the custodian who has it in charge appealed to it; though its voice seemed to have been weakened and coarsened in its forced replies to some rude Americans there, who shouted out to it and mocked at it. One wished to ask them if they did not know that this echo was sacred, and that <b>their</b> <b>challenges</b> of it were a species of sacrilege. But doubtless that would not have availed to silence them. By-and-by they went away, and then we were aware of an interesting group of people by the font near the lovely Lombardic pulpit of Nicola Pisano. They were peasants, by their dress--a young father and mother and a little girl or two, and then a gentle, elderly woman, with a baby in her arms, at which she looked proudly down. They were in their simple best, and they had good Tuscan faces, full of kindness. I ventured some propitiatory coppers with the children, and, when the old woman made them thank me, I thought I could not be mistaken and I ventured further: [...] "You are the grandmother?" ...|$|E
