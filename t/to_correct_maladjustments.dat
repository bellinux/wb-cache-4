Here, we will show an application of these approaches {{in the case of}} the machining of mechanical workpieces using a cutting tool. When a cutting tool in machining impacts different manufactured dimensions of the workpiece, there is a correlation between these parameters when the cutting tool has maladjustment due to bad settings. Thanks to Total Inertial Steering, the correlation structure is known. This paper shows how T² charts allow one to take this correlation into account when detecting the maladjustment of the cutting tool. Then the Total Inertial Steering approach allows one to calculate the value of tool offsets in order <b>to</b> <b>correct</b> this <b>maladjustment.</b> We will present this approach using a simple theoretical example for ease of explanation...|$|R

He then tries to separate this from social technology saying that social technology also [...] "includes administration as well as the determination of the norms which are to be applied in the administration". In 1935 he wrote an article called [...] "The Place of Social Sciences in Modern Education". In this article, he writes about the nature of an effective education in the social sciences to reach effective education by the willing masses. It would be of three types: Firstly, [...] "a description of present conditions and trends in society". Secondly, [...] "the teaching of desirable social ends and ideals necessary <b>to</b> <b>correct</b> such social <b>maladjustments</b> as we now have". Thirdly, [...] "a system of social technology which, if applied, might be expected to remedy existing maladjustments and realize valid social ends". The aspects of social technology which lags behind are the technologies involved in the [...] "less material forms of human welfare". These are the applied sciences of [...] "the control of crime, abolition of poverty, the raising of every normal person to economic, political, and personal competency, the art of good government, or city, rural, and national planning". On the other hand, [...] "the best developed social technologies, such as advertising, finance, and 'practical' politics, are used in the main for antisocial rather than for proper humanitarian ends".|$|R
