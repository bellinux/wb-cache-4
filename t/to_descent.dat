25|$|Barotrauma {{of descent}} {{is caused by}} {{pressure}} differences between the increasing ambient pressure and the internal pressure of gas filled spaces of the diver's body and equipment. The skills of equalization are simple but essential to avoid injury. More complex, but also more straightforward in practice, is buoyancy control and the associated control of descent rate. The diver {{is expected to be}} competent to control, and particularly, limit, the descent rate by adjustment of buoyancy of the buoyancy compensator, and when applicable, the dry suit. The diver must be able to limit descent rate to match the ability to equalize, particularly the ears, and to stop the descent quickly without going into an uncontrolled ascent if there is a problem, or when the desired depth has been reached. In most cases the bottom provides a physical limit <b>to</b> <b>descent,</b> but this is not always the case, and it is generally considered bad form to hit the bottom at speed. A skilled diver will stop at the desired distance above the bottom and stay at that depth, neutrally buoyant, and ready to proceed with the dive. These skills require practice, and are not usually fully developed after typical entry level recreational certification.|$|E

It {{is well known}} that Galois descent is a special case of Grothendieck descent, and that under mild additional conditions the category of Grothendieck descent data coincides with the Eilenberg-Moore category of algebras over a suitable monad.

2500|$|The {{fall of the}} Berlin Wall in 1989, and {{the reunification}} of East and West Germany, was {{followed}} by intense public debate around the articulations of national identity and citizenship, including the place of Germany’s Turkish minority {{in the future of}} a united Germany. These debates about citizenship were accompanied by expressions of xenophobia and ethnic violence that targeted the Turkish population. Anti-immigrant sentiment was especially strong in the former eastern states of Germany, which underwent profound social and economic transformations during the reunification process. Turkish communities experienced considerable fear for their safety throughout Germany, with some 1,500 reported cases of right wing violence, and 2,200 cases the year after. The political rhetoric calling for foreigner-free zones (Ausländer-freie Zonen) and the rise of neo-Nazi groups sharpened public awareness of integration issues and generated intensified support among liberal Germans for the competing idea of Germany as a [...] "multicultural" [...] society.

His theory on [...] "dehumanization" [...] postulated: [...] "the spiritual evolution of mankind has proceeded <b>to</b> <b>descent</b> just as mankind is progressing in material terms." [...] As a reversal of this trend, Relgis proposed {{a return to the}} roots of Judaism, in whose monotheism and Messianism he decoded the basic representation of moral responsibility, and the immediate precursors of Christianity. The Romanian writer was interested in those aspects of Jewish ethics which anticipated humanitarianism or pacifism, citing the Bible as [...] "that most humane book", and identifying himself with the lament of Malachi 2:10 ("Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?"). He later wrote that Jews, and Israelis in particular, were entrusted with keeping alive [...] "the ancient wisdom, poetry and faith", with creating [...] "new values from the old ones". Defining in his own terms the relationship between Biblical proto-universalism and 20th century humanitarianism, Relgis wrote: [...] "Judaism is comprised into modern humanitarianism like a flame within a crystal globe." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Matthew 8:5–13 and Luke 7:1–10, Jesus heals a centurion's servant who is dying. According to James Neill, the Greek term [...] "pais" [...] {{used for}} the servant in Matthew's account almost always had a sexual connotation. In support of this view, he remarks that the word pais, along with the word [...] "erasthai" [...] (to love) {{is the root of}} the English word [...] "pederasty". He sees in the fact that, in Luke's {{parallel}} account, the centurion's servant is described as [...] "valued highly" [...] by the centurion an indication of a homosexual relationship between the two, and says that the Greek word [...] "doulos" [...] (a slave) used of him in Luke's account suggests he may have been a sex slave. Daniel A. Helminiak writes that the word pais was sometimes given a sexual meaning. Donald Wold states that its normal meaning is [...] "boy", [...] "child" [...] or [...] "slave" [...] and its application to a boy lover escapes notice in the standard lexica of Liddell and Scott and Bauer. The Greek-English Lexicon of Liddell and Scott registers three meanings of the word παῖς (pais): a child in relation <b>to</b> <b>descent</b> (son or daughter); a child in relation to age (boy or girl); a slave or servant (male or female). In her detailed study of the episode in Matthew and Luke, Wendy Cotter dismisses as very unlikely the idea that the use of the Greek word [...] "pais" [...] indicated a sexual relationship between the centurion and the young slave. Neill himself compares the meanings of Greek [...] "pais" [...] to those of French [...] "garçon", which [...] "most commonly means 'boy'" [...] even though it {{can also be used to}} mean [...] "waiter".|$|E

60|$|The {{question}} of single or multiple centres of creation differs from another though allied question, namely, whether all the individuals {{of the same}} species are descended from a single pair, or single hermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from many individuals simultaneously created. With organic beings which never intercross, if such exist, each species, must be descended from a succession of modified varieties, that have supplanted each other, but have never blended with other individuals or varieties {{of the same species}}, so that, at each successive stage of modification, all the individuals of the same form will be descended from a single parent. But in the great majority of cases, namely, with all organisms which habitually unite for each birth, or which occasionally intercross, the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same area will be kept nearly uniform by intercrossing; so that many individuals will go on simultaneously changing, and the whole amount of modification at each stage will not be due <b>to</b> <b>descent</b> from a single parent. To illustrate what I mean: our English race-horses differ from the horses of every other breed; but they do not owe their difference and superiority <b>to</b> <b>descent</b> from any single pair, but to continued care in the selecting and training of many individuals during each generation.|$|E

60|$|Returning to {{the several}} British breeds, the {{conspicuous}} difference in general appearance between Shorthorns, Longhorns (now rarely seen), Herefords, Highland cattle, Alderneys, etc., must {{be familiar to}} every one. A part of this difference may be attributed <b>to</b> <b>descent</b> from primordially distinct species; but we may feel sure {{that there has been}} a considerable amount of variation. Even during the Neolithic period, the domestic cattle were to a certain extent variable. Within recent times most of the breeds have been modified by careful and methodical selection. How strongly the characters thus acquired are inherited, may be inferred from the prices realised by the improved breeds; even at the first sale of Colling's Shorthorns, eleven bulls reached an average of 214 pounds, and lately Shorthorn bulls have been sold for a thousand guineas, and have been exported to all quarters of the world.|$|E
60|$|We {{have seen}} that distant {{countries}} possess distinct domestic races of the cat. The differences may be in part due <b>to</b> <b>descent</b> from several aboriginal species, {{or at least to}} crosses with them. In some cases, as in Paraguay, Mombas, and Antigua, the differences seem due to the direct action of different conditions of life. In other cases some slight effect may possibly be attributed to natural selection, as cats in many cases have largely to support themselves and to escape diverse dangers. But man, owing to the difficulty of pairing cats, has done nothing by methodical selection; and probably very little by unintentional selection; though in each litter he generally saves the prettiest, and values most a good breed of mouse- or rat-catchers. Those cats which have a strong tendency to prowl after game, generally get destroyed by traps. As cats are so much petted, a breed bearing the same relation to other cats, that lapdogs bear to larger dogs, would have been much valued; and if selection could have been applied, we should certainly have had many breeds in each long-civilised country, for there is plenty of variability to work upon.|$|E
