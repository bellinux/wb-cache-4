The claim has been met with scepticism by Cambridge historian Mary Beard.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{had formed}} a number of factions. The Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in {{gratitude}} for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic {{about the idea of}} African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.|$|E
50|$|Perceptual {{dialectology}} is {{the study}} of how nonlinguists perceive variation in languageâ€”where <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> it exists, where <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> it comes from, and how <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> it functions.|$|R
25|$|The 9/11 Family Steering Committee {{produced}} a website summarizing {{the questions they}} had raised to the Commission, indicating which <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> had been answered satisfactorily, which <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> had been addressed but not answered satisfactorily, and which <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> had been generally ignored in or omitted from the Report.|$|R

5|$|Following the album's December 1990 release, {{critical}} reviews {{were not}} favourable; critics noted Burke to be a poor replacement for McCulloch, who <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> was an indispensable {{aspect of the}} band.

5|$|In 1953 Lakota {{family members}} exhumed what <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> to be Sitting Bull's remains, {{transporting}} them for reinterment near Mobridge, South Dakota, his birthplace. A monument {{to him was}} erected there.|$|E
50|$|Children {{believe what}} we tell them. They have {{complete}} faith in us. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> that a rose plucked from a garden can plunge a family into conflict. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> that {{the hands of}} a human beast will smoke when he slays a victim, and that this will cause him shame when a young maiden takes up residence in his home. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> a thousand other simple things.|$|R
50|$|The {{plot of the}} {{original}} Escape Velocity involves disputes between the Confederation government and a Rebellion against it. As noted earlier, the player may choose sides (or not) based on who <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> is right, who <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> is stronger, who <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> it is more profitable to support, or any other criteria. The player begins with a shuttlecraft resembling those from Star Trek.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding whether non-Witnesses will be [...] "saved", <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that Jesus has the {{responsibility}} of judging such ones, and that no human can judge for themselves who will be saved. Based on their interpretation of Acts 24:15, <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> {{there will be a}} resurrection of righteous and unrighteous people. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> that non-Witnesses alive now may attain salvation if they [...] "begin to serve God".|$|R
5|$|The Dutch {{public was}} furious at what <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> a hostile German act, which caused German diplomats to spread rumors of an {{impending}} British {{invasion of the}} Netherlands to divert the unwanted attention.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{arguments of}} the protesters were their concern about making wildlife species, such as the Chalkhill Blue butterfly, extinct, putting a highly visible scar on the landscape, and that <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the new motorway would not adequately resolve traffic problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{assessment of}} both sides was radically different. Bomber Command believed the attack was a failure {{as a result of}} poor formation flying and leadership. It was also maintained that better beam defensive armament and self-sealing fuel tanks were needed. These tactical considerations might, <b>they</b> <b>believed,</b> still salvage the day-bomber concept.|$|E

5000|$|Jehovah's Witnesses {{believe that}} sin is inherited, like a disease, {{and has been}} passed on from {{generation}} to generation of humans, beginning with Adam and Eve, whom Witnesses believe are real historical characters. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> that it began with the Devil, and then with humans wanting to decide for themselves what was [...] "Good and Bad." [...] <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> that at that very moment they lost perfection and began to die. Jehovah's Witnesses consider human beings to be souls, and so when a human dies due to sin, <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> that his soul dies as well. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> that Jesus is the only human ever to have lived and died sinless.|$|R
5|$|The website was {{inaccessible}} to visitors {{for a week}} until the host server upgraded the security system, and filtered traffic through anti-DDoS software.

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Kriegsmarine planned Operation Wikinger in {{cooperation}} with the Luftwaffe in the erroneous belief that the British fishing trawlers off the Dogger Bank were cooperating with submarines. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> that sinking or capturing the trawlers would force the British to spread themselves thin to defend the fishing fleet and might result in some useful auxiliary ships for the Kriegsmarine. The Luftwaffe promised fighter cover for the ships engaged in the operation as well as bomber support.|$|E
5|$|Alchemists {{thought of}} mercury as the First Matter {{from which all}} metals were formed. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> that {{different}} metals could be produced by varying {{the quality and quantity}} of sulfur contained within the mercury. The purest of these was gold, and mercury was called for in attempts at the transmutation of base (or impure) metals into gold, which was the goal of many alchemists.|$|E

5|$|At other times, Krichell {{collected}} some of {{the best}} prospects in an area, normally 300 or more, and put them through a four-day workout. It normally consisted of practice in the morning and a full game in the afternoon. There, Krichell and his staff sorted though players <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> could become useful in the organization, and dropped those they thought lacked motivation. The few players who survived the workout were assigned by Krichell to the Yankees Minor League hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Gerald Ford {{moves into}} the house across the street after Bush leaves. When {{originally}} conceived, Richard Nixon was going to move in instead, though this was changed to Bob Dole following Nixon's death. The writers then decided it would be funnier if it were Ford since <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> he was the politician who best represented Homer. Keeler's first draft also included a musical number in the style of Tom Lehrer's satirical recordings, although this ended up being cut.|$|E
5|$|C. L. R. James {{believes}} that St Hill planned to play professional cricket in England around this point, but his {{failure in the}} trial matches meant {{that he was not}} selected to tour England with the West Indies team in 1923. James records how upset St Hill's supporters were by his omission and <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> the West Indian selectors feared a black batsman being successful in England. He also describes St Hill became more single-minded and less willing to moderate his approach after this decision.|$|E

50|$|<b>They</b> <b>believe</b> that {{socialism}} {{cannot be}} introduced through parliament {{or through a}} coup, but through mass democratic movements of the working class. While <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> elections matter and call for a vote for the Greens followed by Labor, <b>they</b> do not <b>believe</b> the make up of parliament is what brings change.|$|R
5|$|During the night, the {{electrical}} power suddenly turned {{off and the}} radios went silent. Just before 11:30pm, a huge stream of water swept through Armero; it was powerful enough to flip cars and pick up people.

5|$|Fighting {{was still}} {{going on in the}} area around Dongo. Fearing that Mussolini and Petacci might be rescued by fascist supporters, the partisans drove them, {{in the middle of the}} night, to a nearby farm of a peasant family named De Maria; <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> this would be a safe place to hold them. Mussolini and Petacci spent the rest of the night and most of the {{following}} day there.|$|E
