Therefore, I complement the land distribution analysis by decomposing the Gini coefficient of inequality between urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. In this study, I decompose the Gini coefficient into three components, namely a within-group inequality term, a between-group inequality term, and an overlap term. The within-group inequality term is a weighted sum of the inequalities calculated for each area (urban, peri-urban, rural), whereas weights depend on the population and land share of each area. The between-group inequality term is calculated on the total population where the land size of each person in the area is replaced by the average land size {{in the area where}} he lives. This component of inequality thus indicates the mean difference across areas. The overlap term is a residual term that arises because the areas’ land size ranges overlap.

30|$|Several {{experimental}} design models could {{be employed to}} reduce the number of experiments under different conditions. Plackett–Burman and Box–Behnken designs are among the most widely used statistical techniques for optimization of biological processes. The Plackett–Burman {{experimental design}} is a two-level factorial design, which identifies the critical physicochemical parameters by screening N variables in N +  1 experiments (Plackett and Burman 1946), but it does not consider <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> variables. The variables that are found significant in this initial screening can be further optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) which is a collection of statistical techniques that uses design of experiments (DoE) for building models, evaluating the effects of factors and predicting optimum conditions (Abdel-Nabi et al. 1998). Now it is extensively applied in the optimization of medium composition, conditions of enzymatic hydrolysis, fermentation and food manufacturing processes. RSM which results from using Box–Behnken design was used for further study of the influences of major factors and interaction between them on the response value, which is based on the results of sole-experiment and Plackett–Burman (PB) design.|$|R

40|$|Improving {{organizational}} {{creativity is}} not an easy task. According to the interactionist perspective drawn by Woodman et al. (1993), it requires several aspects to be taken into account, such as the creative process, the creative product, the creative person, and the creative situation, as all of them interact with each other in determining creativity. Extant research offers some evidence highlighting the inherent complexity of organizational creativity, by investigating the importance of a knowledge-sharing culture (Chen et al., 2014) as well as of contextual factors, such as organizational (Baer and Oldham, 2006) and technological factors (Lindič et al., 2011). However, results reported are fragmented. In an attempt to extend prior research, we found that while intra-organizational knowledge-sharing processes are vital to organizational creativity, contextual influences may be detrimental. Over the years companies’ memes have switched from “if only we knew what we know” (e. g. O’Dell and Grayson, 1998) to “if only we shared what we know” (e. g. Majchrzak et al., 2012). Our investigation acknowledges the importance of understanding the relationship between collecting knowledge from others and organizational creativity, as interpersonal dynamics are often the ultimate mechanisms essential to producing new ideas (Brown and Duguid, 1991; He et al., 2014; West, 2002). Despite the abundance of studies, little is yet known with regard to <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> <b>among</b> knowledge collecting, contextual influences and organization-level creativity. Accordingly, our aim is to address the following research question: “What is the relationship between knowledge collecting, ICT use and top-management support in determining organizational creativity?” To test our hypotheses, we analyze survey data of 362 employees operating in the subsidiaries of five multinational corporations (MNCs) located in Italy. The relevance of this empirical setting to our study is consistent with the idea that MNCs’ subsidiaries generally embed both the technical and the social elements for analyzing knowledge sharing, its effects, and contextual influences (e. g. Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000; Zaidman and Brock, 2009). Our data show that while knowledge collecting is strongly and positively associated with organizational creativity, high ICT use surprisingly negatively moderates the relationship between knowledge collecting and the dependent variable, while top-management support does not show a significant moderating effect on the association between knowledge collecting and organizational creativity. In so doing, this paper attempts to extend prior research on organizational creativity (e. g. Gumusluoglu and Ilsev, 2009; Woodman et al., 1993) by combining the joint effect of internal circulation of ideas and knowledge with contextual influences. Therefore, it contributes by providing more empirical evidence likely to capture the inherent complexity of organizational creativity, by conceiving of it {{as a function of the}} creative results of individuals interacting and sharing their knowledge with others while being exposed to both hard and soft contextual factors...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we have used}} {{structural}} equation modelling to examine the inter-relationships among specific intangible resources - product, operations, and marketing sources of ideas - {{as they relate to}} innovation and firm performance. Prior studies founded upon the Resource Based View (RBV) of the firm, have focused on the relationship between innovation and firm performance or resources and firm performance, but have not examined both simultaneously. Our study reveals how the sources of ideas, as valuable strategic firm resources, directly, and/or indirectly via innovation activities, contribute to firm performance. We find that marketing sources of ideas directly influences firm performance and that product and operations sources of ideas do not. Indirectly, however, all three sources of idea resources (marketing, operational, and product) contribute to firm performance via the innovation construct. Thus, ideas, and where they come from, are crucial to understanding innovation and firm performance. Innovation is a key component in the structural model because it partially mediates the marketing idea sources-performance relationship. It also provides <b>the</b> basis for <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> <b>among</b> operations and product resources and firm performance.

With a 311 -A optimized saturation design, field experiments were conducted between 2006 and 2009 to examine the yield response of spring maize (Zhengdan 958, Zea mays L) to irrigation (I), nitrogen fertilization (total nitrogen, urea- 46 % nitrogen,) and phosphorus fertilization (P 2 O 5, calcium superphosphate- 13 % P 2 O 5) in a semi-arid area environment of Northeast China. According to our estimated yield function, the results showed that N is the dominant factor in determining maize grain yield followed by I, while P plays a relatively minor role. <b>The</b> strength of <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> <b>among</b> I, N and P on maize grain yield follows the sequence N+I >P+I>N+P. Individually, <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> of N+I and N+P on maize grain yield are positive, whereas that of P+I is negative. To achieve maximum grain yield (10506. 0 kg · ha(- 1)) for spring maize in the study area, the optimum application rates of I, N and P are 930. 4 m(3) · ha(- 1), 304. 9 kg · ha(- 1) and 133. 2 kg · ha(- 1) respectively that leads to a possible economic profit (EP) of 10548. 4 CNY · ha(- 1) (CNY, Chinese Yuan). Alternately, to obtain the best EP (10827. 3 CNY · ha(- 1)), the optimum application rates of I, N and P are 682. 4 m(3) · ha(- 1), 241. 0 kg · ha(- 1) and 111. 7 kg · ha(- 1) respectively that produces a potential grain yield of 10289. 5 kg · ha(- 1) ...|$|R
30|$|Formative {{assessment}} represents effective {{strategies for}} improving student motivation and learning, yet key methodological issues exist {{with the evidence}} that underpins claims of effectiveness (e.g., Bennett, 2011). First there are the difficulties with establishing the causal effect of formative assessments on student achievement and the expanded research focus; different meta-analyses have shown varying effect sizes that are often attributed to learning content, feedback procedures, or learner characteristics (Black & Wiliam, 1998; Kingston & Nash, 2011). Calls for research exploring <b>the</b> holistic <b>interaction</b> (and <b>effects)</b> <b>among</b> learners and the learning environment afforded by TEFA remain unanswered (Kay & LeSage, 2009). Second, the validity and reliability of many studies have been limited in their measurement of only students’ perceptions of engagement and learning {{by the use of}} only one or two quantitative items (Offerdahl & Tomanek, 2011) and because they rely on anecdotal data which draws strong criticism (Ha & Finkelstein, 2013). A more rigorous approach is necessary to capture educational benefits and challenges reflective of all involved in TEFA. The purpose of the research reported in this paper was to generate a comprehensive understanding of influences to and effects of involvement in two TEFA strategies within a higher education learning environment through the integration of multiple perspectives. Specifically related to their involvement in the two TEFA strategies across three terms, students were asked directly, classroom interactions were observed, and instructor viewpoints were sought.|$|R
40|$|A binary {{performance}} measure (high school graduation) is examined {{as a function}} of motivation (educational goal), ability (scores in an intelligence test), and their <b>interaction.</b> <b>The</b> <b>interaction</b> was positive when a logistic model was used and negative when a linear probability model was used. The reason for the difference in the results of the two models is examined, and the conditions under which this difference occurs are discussed. Many of the important dependent variables in organizational research are binary. For example, between 1995 and 1997 about 5 % of the articles in the Journal of Applied Psychology and about 8 % of the articles in the Academy of Management Journal used binary dependent variables. Nevertheless, methodological issues associated with the modeling of such variables, and, in particular, <b>the</b> modeling of <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> <b>among</b> their determinants, have received little attention in the literature. The {{purpose of this article is}} to examine issues associated with <b>the</b> modeling of <b>interaction</b> when <b>the</b> dependent variable is binary within the context of an important, yet little researched, substantive issue: The relationship between motivation and ability in the determination of performance. A binary {{performance measure}} (high school graduation) is examined. Scores in a cognitive ability test are used as a measure of ability, and educational goal is used as a measure of motivation. The article is organized as follows. We first review the relevant literature regarding (a) the modeling of binary dependent variables using linear and logistic models, and (b) the relationship between motivation, ability, and performance. We then present data showing that modeling performance {{as a function of}} motivation and ability by a linear probability model and modeling it by a logistic model lead to diametrically opposite conclusions about <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> between motivation and ability.
