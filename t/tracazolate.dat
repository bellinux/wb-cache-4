50|$|ICI-190,622 is an {{anxiolytic}} drug used {{in scientific}} research. It is a pyrazolopyridine derivative, related to other anxiolytic compounds such as <b>tracazolate,</b> and more distantly to zaleplon. It has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct {{and so is}} classed as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tracazolate</b> (ICI-136,753) is an {{anxiolytic}} drug {{which is}} used in scientific research. It is a pyrazolopyridine derivative, most closely related to pyrazolopyrimidine drugs such as zaleplon, {{and is one of}} a structurally diverse group of drugs known as the nonbenzodiazepines which act at the same receptor targets as benzodiazepines but have distinct chemical structures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tracazolate</b> has {{primarily}} anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects, with sedative {{and muscle}} relaxant effects only appearing at higher doses. It {{has a unique}} receptor binding profile involving allosteric modulation of several GABAA receptor subtypes, being selective for GABAA receptors containing α1 and β3 subunits, but exhibiting different effects depending on the third type of subunit making up the receptor complex.|$|E
40|$|GABAA {{receptor}} (R) positive allosteric modulators that selec-tively modulate GABAARs containing 2 - and/or 3 - over 1 -subunits {{have been}} reported across diverse chemotypes. Ex-amples include loreclezole, mefenamic acid, <b>tracazolate,</b> and etifoxine. In general,“ 2 / 3 -selective ” GABAAR positive allosteric modulators are nonbenzodiazepines (nonBZs), do not show -subunit isoform selectivity, yet have anxiolytic efficacy with reduced ataxic/sedative effects in animal models and humans. Here, we report on an enantiomeric pair of nonBZ GABAAR positive allosteric modulators that demonstrate differential -subunit isoform selectivity. We have tested this enantiomeric pair along {{with a series of}} other 2 / 3 -subunit selective, -sub-unit isoform-selective, BZ and nonBZ GABAA positive allosteric modulators using electrophysiological, pharmacokinetic, an...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} of zopiclone and suriclone, representatives of nonbenzodiazepine cyclo-pyrrolone anxiolytics, with central-type benzodiazepine receptors have been characterized in rat and bovine brain. While zopiclone potently (IC 50 nM) inhibits [3 H]Ro- 15 - 1788 binding {{in an apparent}} mass action fashion, suriclone and its metabolite 35, 489 RP are extremely potent (IC. t) 350 pM and 1 nM, respectively) and display Hill coefficients of approximately 2. 0. Like classical benzodiazepines, none of the cyclopyrrolones studied display selectivity for type I or type II benzodiazepine receptors. Using [3 H]suriclone, saturable high affinity sites for cyclopyrrolone anxiolytics were directly labeled in rat and bovine brain. The regional distribution and pharmacologic specificity of [3 H]suriclone and [3 H]Ro- 15 - 1788 binding sites are similar, suggesting that [3 H]suriclone recognition sites reside on the benzodiazepine receptor complex. Unlike classical benzodiazepine agonists, such as diazepam, the binding of [3 Hjsuriclone is not modulated by GABA, Cl, pentobartibal, or <b>tracazolate.</b> Unlike those of [3 H]diazepam, [3 H]suriclone-binding sites are only minimally affected by photoaffinity labeling with flunitrazepam. Whereas the binding affinities of [3 H]Ro- 15 - 1788, [3 H]flunitrazepam, and [3 Hjethyl fl-carboline 3...|$|E
40|$|Gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABAA) receptors are ligandgated {{chloride}} channels {{essential for}} regulating signal transmission within the mammalian {{central nervous system}} (CNS). The chloride currents due to these pentameric receptors can be positively modulated (potentiated) {{by a variety of}} molecules including barbiturates, diazepams, and endogenous neurosteroids, some of which are used as therapeutics. Molecules that selectively modulate GABAA receptors of specific subunit compositions are scarce but would be valuable tools for elucidating the function of GABAA receptor subtypes within the CNS and may aid in developing therapeutics with greater target specificity. Described here is the discovery of several dihydropyrimidinone (DHPM) small molecules that preferentially potentiate GABA induced whole-cell currents from [delta] subunit-containing GABAA receptors. Some of the DHPMs, such as JM-II- 43 A, had potentiation efficacies comparable to those of non-subtype selective modulators phenobarbital and <b>tracazolate,</b> but the DHPMs did not directly induce receptor currents. JM-II- 43 A was further tested with [alpha] 1 [beta] 2 [delta] GABAA receptors using flash-photolysis transient kinetic techniques as well as single-channel and multi-channel current recording patch-clamp techniques to determine how DHPMs modulate these receptors. The results lead to the proposal of a novel mechanism of receptor function involving an equilibrium of GABAA receptors between an active and inactive state before the presence of agonist. This equilibrium is shifted by potentiating compounds, such as DHPMs, towards the active state to increase the total number of receptors that reach an open-channel (ion conducting) state. This hypothesis also explains the characteristic lack of desensitization and low peak current amplitudes associated with [delta] subunit-containing receptors. Also discussed is the purification and characterization of several photo labile GABA derivatives containing a coumarin-based caging group for their quantum yield, rate of photolysis, solubility, thermal stability and sensitivity to visible light in the 350 - to 450 -nm region. These compounds were intended for transient kinetic investigations of the modulation of GABAA receptors by DHPMs discussed above. One of these compounds was determined to have a quantum yield of 0. 1, however the rate of photolysis was not suitable for transient kinetic measurements in the microto milli-second time region...|$|E
