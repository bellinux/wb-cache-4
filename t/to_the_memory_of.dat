5|$|Despite the {{violence}} of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> the revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E
40|$|What {{does it mean}} to {{bear witness}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> {{previous}} generations’ trauma victims? What lessons should we learn from those who came before us to ensure a happier future? This thesis explores <b>the</b> trauma and <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased or older generation found in J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series. I intend <b>to</b> analyze <b>the</b> character of Harry Potter as he interacts with <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous generation, which he is able to resurrect in embodied forms through the use of magic. By testifying <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous generations’ trauma, Harry is able <b>to</b> break <b>the</b> cycle of violence and create a seemingly happy ending to his life’s story. Through critically studying Harry Potter as a transgenerational narrative, readers are able to learn how to bear witness <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> those with whom they associate in their own live and create a more empathetically inclined world...|$|R

5|$|After {{his time}} on the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Hines {{returned}} to practicing law in Frankfort, Kentucky. In 1886, Hines began writing a series of four articles discussing the Northwest Conspiracy for Basil W. Duke's Southern Bivouac magazine. The magazine was dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, but was less adversarial than similar Southern magazines, gaining a larger Northern readership than similar journals. The first of the articles was printed in the December 1886 issue. However, after consulting with former Confederate president Jefferson Davis at Davis' home in Mississippi, Hines did not name anybody on the Northern side who assisted in the conspiracy. After writing the first article, Hines was attacked for not being more forthcoming regarding all the participants from both newspapers' reviewers (particularly from the Louisville Times) and Southern readers, which discouraged Hines from publishing any more accounts of the Northwest Conspiracy.|$|E
