5000|$|... at 2600 rpm, {{dry weight}} 415 lb, {{identical}} to the 0-470-13 but with an additional <b>tachometer</b> <b>drive</b> through the camshaft gear and one fifth and one sixth order crankshaft damper. Certified 19 January 1951.|$|E
50|$|The {{speedometer}} drive mechanism operated {{from the rear}} wheel, with a long cable to the speedometer. This drive mechanism wore out very quickly, as did any replacement, leading to no speedometer reading (never resolved). The early <b>tachometer</b> <b>drive</b> jutted from {{the right side of}} the engine, and was vulnerable to being struck and snapped off (relocated to front of engine). The primary chain tensioning bolt tended to loosen at inconvenient times. The rear chain adjusting bolts pushed, rather than pulled, the rear axle, and would bend, making them difficult to turn. Nor were there index marks to allow equal axle positioning on the right and left side of the swing arm. The ignition switch mount would break from vibration (later relocated).|$|E
5000|$|In older vehicles, the <b>tachometer</b> is <b>driven</b> by the RMS voltage {{waves from}} the low tension (LT) side of the {{ignition}} coil, while on others (and nearly all diesel engines, which have no ignition system) engine speed {{is determined by the}} frequency from the alternator tachometer output. This is from a special connection called an [...] "AC tap" [...] which is a connection to one of the stator's coil output, before the rectifier. <b>Tachometers</b> <b>driven</b> by a rotating cable from a drive unit fitted to the engine (usually on the camshaft) exist - usually on simple diesel-engined machinery with basic or no electrical systems. On recent EMS found on modern vehicles, the signal for the tachometer is usually generated from an ECU which derives the information from either the crankshaft or camshaft speed sensor.|$|R
50|$|The VX4/90 was {{available}} only in saloon form with 4-speed (GM Opel) all-synchro gearbox, Lockheed front disc brakes, 14 inch wheels, front individual / bucket seats, full instrumentation including mechanically <b>driven</b> <b>tachometer</b> and heater. The VX4/90 engine also was upgraded to 1595 cc (97 cubic inches) and with a change in rear axle ratio from 4.125 to 3.9, the VX 4/90 could now easily exceed 90 mph.|$|R
50|$|The XS400 {{had with}} a 6-speed transmission, wet plate, 6 {{friction}} disk clutch, chain <b>drive,</b> <b>tachometer,</b> self-canceling turn signals, both electric and kick starters, adjustable rear shock absorbers, center stand, and an automatic fuel petcock. Early and economy models came with spoked wheels and drum brakes, while later and upgraded models received cast alloy wheels and hydraulic disc brakes. Later models also upgraded the early mechanical points ignition system to a modern solid state electronic system.|$|R
40|$|A {{permanent}} magnet DC motor {{may be used}} as a <b>tachometer.</b> When <b>driven</b> mechanically, this motor generates an output voltage that is proportional to shaft speed (see Fig. 4. 1). The other main requirements for a tachometer are that the output voltage should be smooth over the operating range and that the output should be stabilized against temperature variations. Small {{permanent magnet}} DC “motors ” are frequently used in servo systems as speed sensing devices. These systems usually incorporate thermistor temperature compensation and make use of a silver commutator and silver loaded brushes to improve commutation reliability at low speeds and at the low currents, which are typical of this application. To combine high performance and low cost, DCservo motor designs often incorporate a tachometer mounted on the motor shaft and enclosed within the motor housing (Fig. 4. 1) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{suspended}} anemometer {{system for}} calibrating pitot-static systems {{on low speed}} research airplanes is described. The anemometer measures true airspeed when suspended beneath the airplane on a long cable in regions of undisturbed air. The electrical output of the propeller <b>driven</b> <b>tachometer</b> is a sine wave, the frequency of which is proportional to true airspeed. The anemometer measures true airspeed over a range from 20 to 60 m/sec at altitudes to 3000 m, with an accuracy of + or - 0. 5 percent of full scale range. This accuracy is exclusive of errors in the recording system. The stability of the suspended system was investigated and was found adequate in the airspeed range. For the purpose of determining {{the location of the}} anemometer relative to the airplane, a method is given for calculating the shape assumed by the deployed cable...|$|R
2500|$|The 1975 {{model was}} advertised as [...] "a more {{efficient}} Corvette," [...] as service intervals were extended and electronic ignition and the federally mandated catalytic converter were introduced with [...] "unleaded fuel only" [...] warnings on the fuel gauge and filler door. Dual exhaust pipes were routed {{to a single}} converter, then split again leading to dual mufflers and tailpipes. Starting this year, <b>tachometers</b> were electronically <b>driven.</b> The Corvette began {{to be influenced by}} the metric system as speedometers now displayed small subfaces indicating kilometers-per-hour. 75's featured revised inner bumper systems with molded front and rear simulated bumper guards. The urethane rear bumper, now in its second year, reappeared as a one-piece seamless unit. This was the final year for Astro Ventilation. Power bottomed out this year — the base engine produced only [...] and the only remaining optional motor, the L-82, dropped an astonishing , managing to deliver [...] With no larger engine available, L-82 hood emblems began to appear on cars so equipped. Unchanged was the standard rear axle ratio for the base engine, which remained at 3.08 with automatic and 3.36 with manual transmission. This was the last convertible for the 1968-82 third-generation and only 12% of the cars were ordered as such. As in previous years, a folding top came standard with roadsters and a body color or vinyl covered hardtop was optional at additional cost. Anticipating further federal safety restrictions, Chevrolet believed it would be Corvette's last soft-top model ever but the convertible returned in 1986. Due to the state’s strict emissions standards, this was the last year Chevrolet installed the L-82 engine in a Corvette destined for California.|$|R
