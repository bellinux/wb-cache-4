5|$|Almost all the {{surviving}} source material is of questionable reliability. The two witnesses who gave evidence, Robert Stubbs and James Kelsall, were strongly motivated to exonerate <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> blame. It {{is possible that}} the figures concerning the number of slaves killed, the amount of water that remained on the ship, and the distance beyond Jamaica that Zong had mistakenly sailed are inaccurate.|$|E

5|$|Although ministers are {{entitled}} to obtain views from other departments or ministries when making decisions, they must consider objections and not disable <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> exercising their discretion. In H. Lavender and Son Ltd. v. Minister of Housing and Local Government (1969), the Housing Minister's decision was quashed because he had, by his stated policy, delegated to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food the effective decision on any appeal where the latter had an objection.|$|E

After Aqil's victory at Hattin, the Ottoman authorities distanced <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> the incident in their correspondence with Aqil, but he accepted their explanations {{with a grain of}} salt. In September 1858, Aqil was residing in Nazareth and decided not to intervene and put a stop to tribal clashes in the Jezreel Valley.|$|E
5|$|As bikinis leave most of {{the body}} exposed to {{potentially}} dangerous UV radiation, overexposure can cause sunburn, skin cancer, {{as well as other}} acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes, and immune system. As a result, medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> UV radiation by using broad-spectrum sunscreen, which has been shown to protect against sunburn, skin cancer, wrinkling and sagging skin. Certain sunscreen ingredients can cause harm if they penetrate the skin over time.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E

5|$|Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick {{is based}} on a true story about a sperm whale that {{attacked}} and sank the whaleship Essex. Melville associated the sperm whale with the Bible's Leviathan. The fearsome reputation perpetuated by Melville was based on bull whales' ability to fiercely defend <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> attacks by early whalers, occasionally resulting in the destruction of the whaling ships.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, {{during the}} Tokugawa shogunate, Japanese ships {{were ordered to}} hoist the Hinomaru to {{distinguish}} <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> foreign ships. Before then, different types of Hinomaru flags were used on vessels that were trading with the U.S. and Russia. The Hinomaru was decreed the merchant flag of Japan in 1870 and was the legal national flag from 1870 to 1885, making it the first national flag Japan adopted.|$|E

The tribute dinner was to be held in conjunction with the leadership convention that would swear Dunderdale in as PC leader. Following this, Williams announced that Premier Dunderdale and her staff were distancing <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> him.|$|E

5|$|Many {{currently}} available pharmaceuticals {{are derived from}} the secondary metabolites plants use to protect <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> herbivores, including opium, aspirin, cocaine, and atropine. These chemicals have evolved to affect the biochemistry of insects in very specific ways. However, many of these biochemical pathways are conserved in vertebrates, including humans, and the chemicals act on human biochemistry in ways {{similar to that of}} insects. It has therefore been suggested that the study of plant-insect interactions may help in bioprospecting.|$|E
