5|$|Software <b>transactional</b> {{memory is}} a common type of {{consistency}} model. Software <b>transactional</b> memory borrows from database theory the concept of atomic transactions and applies them to memory accesses.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{academic}} {{suggestions to}} the contrary, in Salinas v. United States (1997), the Supreme Court {{held that the}} transaction itself need not involve federal funds. The $5,000 <b>transactional</b> amount may be satisfied by the value of intangible goods or services.|$|E
5|$|PyPy is a fast, {{compliant}} {{interpreter of}} Python 2.7 and 3.5. Its just-in-time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over CPython. A version {{taking advantage of}} multi-core processors using software <b>transactional</b> memory is being created.|$|E
5|$|When Ladislaus of Naples {{sold his}} {{rights to the}} Kingdom of Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice and retreated from the Balkans in 1409, many local nobles allied {{themselves}} with the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund and accepted Ostoja as the King of Bosnia. This seriously weakened the position of Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, a Grand Duke of Bosnia, whose niece Katarina was a second wife of Sandalj Hranić, a Grand Duke of Hum. In such circumstances Sandalj decided to ally with emperor Sigismund in mid 1411 and to establish closer connections with Sigismund's important ally Stefan Lazarević. In December 1411 Sandalj divorced his wife Katarina and married Stefan's sister Jelena {{at the end of}} the same year. Jelena married Sandalj because she wanted to strengthen the position of her son. With this marriage Sandalj, the most dangerous enemy of Balša III, became his stepfather and protector. Although it spoiled Sandalj's relations with Hrvoje, it also strengthened traditionally close relations with the Lazarević family. Although Jelena was in her forties, Sandalj hoped they would have children and in 1413 deposited some money at a <b>transactional</b> account with the city of Dubrovnik for the child they would eventually have.|$|E

25|$|Heterogeneity: Global {{serializability}} {{is achieved}} across multiple <b>transactional</b> objects (e.g., database management systems) with different (any) concurrency control mechanisms, without {{interfering with the}} mechanisms' operations.|$|E
25|$|Autonomy of <b>transactional</b> objects: No need of {{conflict}} or equivalent information distribution (e.g., local precedence relations, locks, timestamps, or tickets; no object needs other object's information).|$|E
25|$|In {{concurrency}} control of databases, transaction processing (transaction management), and other <b>transactional</b> distributed applications, Global serializability (or Modular serializability) is a property {{of a global}} schedule of transactions. A global schedule is the unified schedule of all the individual database (and other <b>transactional</b> object) schedules in a multidatabase environment (e.g., federated database). Complying with global serializability means that the global schedule is serializable, has the serializability property, while each component database (module) has a serializable schedule as well. In other words, a collection of serializable components provides overall system serializability, which is usually incorrect. A need in correctness across databases in multidatabase systems makes global serializability a major goal for global {{concurrency control}} (or modular concurrency control). With the proliferation of the Internet, Cloud computing, Grid computing, and small, portable, powerful computing devices (e.g., smartphones), as well as increase in systems management sophistication, the need for atomic distributed transactions and thus effective global serializability techniques, to ensure correctness in and among distributed <b>transactional</b> applications, seems to increase.|$|E

25|$|Event-driven {{strategies}} concern {{situations in}} which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event. An event-driven investment strategy finds investment opportunities in corporate <b>transactional</b> events such as consolidations, acquisitions, recapitalizations, bankruptcies, and liquidations. Managers employing such a strategy capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events, and take a position based on the predicted movement of the security or securities in question. Large institutional investors such as hedge funds {{are more likely to}} pursue event-driven investing strategies than traditional equity investors because they have the expertise and resources to analyze corporate <b>transactional</b> events for investment opportunities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transactional</b> NTFS allows {{multiple}} file/folder {{operations to}} be treated as a single operation, so that a crash or power failure won't result in half-completed file writes. Transactions can also be extended to multiple machines.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista also {{incorporates}} Microsoft Message Queuing 4.0 (MSMQ) {{that supports}} subqueues, poison messages (messages which continually fail {{to be processed}} correctly by the receiver), and <b>transactional</b> receives of messages from a remote queue.|$|E

25|$|Afshar {{claims that}} his {{experiment}} invalidates the complementarity principle and has far-reaching {{implications for the}} understanding of quantum mechanics, challenging the Copenhagen interpretation. According to Cramer, Afshar's results support Cramer's own <b>transactional</b> interpretation of quantum mechanics and challenge the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. This claim has not been published in a peer reviewed journal.|$|E
25|$|Copenhagenists {{claim that}} interpretations of quantum {{mechanics}} where the wave function is regarded as real have problems with EPR-type effects, since they imply that {{the laws of physics}} allow for influences to propagate at speeds greater than the speed of light. However, proponents of many worlds and the <b>transactional</b> interpretation (TI) maintain that Copenhagen interpretation is fatally non-local.|$|E

25|$|Windows Update {{makes use}} of <b>Transactional</b> NTFS, a file system feature {{introduced}} with Windows Vista, when performing updates to Windows system files. This feature helps Windows recover cleanly {{in the event of}} an unexpected shut-down during an update, as the transactioning system will ensure that changes are committed to the file system (in particular, to the persistent files of the registry) in an atomic fashion.|$|E
25|$|RAID-Z is a data/parity {{distribution}} scheme like RAID-5, but uses dynamic stripe width: every {{block is}} its own RAID stripe, regardless of blocksize, resulting in every RAID-Z write being a full-stripe write. This, when combined with the copy-on-write <b>transactional</b> semantics of ZFS, eliminates the write hole error. RAID-Z is also faster than traditional RAID5 {{because it does not}} need to perform the usual read-modify-write sequence.|$|E
25|$|Again {{inspired}} by the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory, the <b>transactional</b> interpretation of quantum mechanics (TIQM) first proposed in 1986 by John G. Cramer, describes quantum interactions {{in terms of a}} standing wave formed by retarded (forward-in-time) and advanced (backward-in-time) waves. Cramer claims it avoids the philosophical problems with the Copenhagen interpretation {{and the role of the}} observer, and resolves various quantum paradoxes, such as quantum nonlocality, quantum entanglement and retrocausality.|$|E
