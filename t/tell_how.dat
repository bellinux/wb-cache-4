5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific body part, {{the more likely it}} is for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now the only way to <b>tell</b> <b>how</b> damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, {{the more likely it is}} for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{is usually}} {{confirmed}} by the microscopic examination of blood films or by antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). In some areas, RDTs {{need to be able}} to distinguish whether the malaria symptoms are caused by Plasmodium falciparum or by other species of parasites since treatment strategies could differ for non-P. falciparum infections. Microscopy is the most commonly used method to detect the malarial parasite—about 165 million blood films were examined for malaria in 2010. Despite its widespread usage, diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks: many settings (especially rural) are not equipped to perform the test, and the accuracy of the results depends on both the skill of the person examining the blood film and the levels of the parasite in the blood. The sensitivity of blood films ranges from 75–90% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%. Commercially available RDTs are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites, but they are widely variable in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depending on manufacturer, and are unable to <b>tell</b> <b>how</b> many parasites are present.|$|E
5|$|The Just So Stories each <b>tell</b> <b>how</b> a {{particular}} animal was modified from an original form {{to its current}} form by the acts of man, or some magical being. For example, the Whale has a tiny throat because he swallowed a mariner, who tied a raft inside to block the whale from swallowing other men. The Camel has a hump {{given to him by}} a djinn as punishment for the camel's refusing to work (the hump allows the camel to work longer between times of eating). The Leopard's spots were painted by an Ethiopian (after the Ethiopian painted himself black). The Kangaroo gets its powerful hind legs, long tail, and hopping gait after being chased all day by a dingo, sent by a minor god responding to the Kangaroo's request to be made different from all other animals.|$|E

50|$|Verna LaVaughn: LaVaughn is {{the protagonist}} of the story. She is named after her two grand aunts, Verna and LaVaughn, but {{goes by the name}} LaVaughn. LaVaughn is fifteen years old, telling what her life is like through that age. She <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> she falls in love with Jody, only to find him kissing another guy. LaVaughn briefly <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> her father dies, (he was an {{innocent}} bystander of a tragic shooting.) She <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> her mom is raising her in a slightly destitute type neighborhood, and also a little about her past.|$|R
50|$|A {{descriptive}} {{theory is}} one that <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> things are, while a normative theory <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> things ought to be. Expressed in practical terms, a normative theory, more properly called a policy, <b>tells</b> agents <b>how</b> they ought to act. A policy can be an absolute imperative, <b>telling</b> agents <b>how</b> they ought to act in any case, {{or it can be}} a contingent directive, <b>telling</b> agents <b>how</b> they ought to act if they want to achieve a particular goal. A policy is frequently stated {{in the form of a}} piece of advice called a heuristic, a maxim, a norm, a rule, a slogan, and so on. Other names for a policy are a recommendation and a regulative principle.|$|R
5|$|The see, if such {{it may be}} called, {{appears to}} have existed for a century, if indeed it didn't come into {{existence}} {{in the years after}} Padarn himself. There is note of a bishop of Llanbadarn in the minutes of a synod held at Abberley, Worcestershire, in about the year 603, though this is an unreliable source. Reportedly, at this meeting, there was an unsuccessful attempt by the Archbishop of Canterbury, St Augustine of Canterbury, to persuade Celtic bishops – Llanbadarn Fawr was one of seven present – to submit to his authority. Certainly the reputation of Padarn and the wealth and influence of his clas, ensured that the developing cultus of David did not prevail in northern Ceredigion, possibly in large part due to the extensive lands possessed by the clas, apparently from the river Clarach to the river Rheidol. In some cases, as in the Life of Saint Padarn, the Lives <b>tell</b> <b>how</b> the saint gains lands which as the time of writing were claimed by the saint’s foundation as its endowment.|$|E
5|$|Æthelberht was put {{to death}} by Offa of Mercia under unclear circumstances; the site of his murder was {{apparently}} the royal vill at Sutton Walls. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he was beheaded. Mediaeval sources <b>tell</b> <b>how</b> he was taken captive whilst visiting his future Mercian bride Ælfthyth and was then murdered and buried. In Richard of Cirencester's account of the murder, which cannot be substantiated, Offa's evil queen Cynethryth poisoned her husband's mind until he agreed to have his guest killed. Æthelberht was then bound and beheaded by a certain Grimbert and his body was unceremoniously disposed of. The mediaeval historian John Brompton's Chronicon describes how the king's detached head fell off a cart into a ditch where it was found, before it restored a blind man's sight. According to the Chronicon, Ælfthyth subsequently became a recluse at Crowland and her remorseful father founded monasteries, gave land to the Church and travelled {{on a pilgrimage to}} Rome.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{locations}} {{reflect the}} dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena, such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and unexplained noises are present, and, {{for the most}} part, the player has to rely on their lighter and rechargeable flashlight to navigate the darkness. Locations will often have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map or objective marker, leaving the player to try finding their objectives with only a compass. The surface is more lethal than the metro system. Featuring a day-night cycle, and a dynamic weather system, these sections are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times because of the toxic air. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask. These last several minutes each, and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. Players are also tasked to wipe off the dirt and blood splatter that collects on the gas mask. There is no head up display indicator to <b>tell</b> <b>how</b> long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail — rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The watch also serves to indicate to a player {{if they have been}} exposed to enemy attention. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammunition and they have to reload. Instead of head up display the game makes use of audio and visual cues to present information to players.|$|E

25|$|A water clock uses a flow {{of water}} to measure time. If {{viscosity}} is neglected, the physical principle required to study such clocks is Torricelli's law. There {{are two types of}} water clocks: inflow and outflow. In an outflow water clock, a container is filled with water, and the water is drained slowly and evenly out of the container. This container has markings that are used to show the passage of time. As the water leaves the container, an observer can see where the water is level with the lines and <b>tell</b> <b>how</b> much time has passed. An inflow water clock works in basically the same way, except instead of flowing out of the container, the water is filling up the marked container. As the container fills, the observer can see where the water meets the lines and <b>tell</b> <b>how</b> much time has passed.|$|E

25|$|An anti-Soviet guerrilla {{movement}} {{known as}} the Metsavennad ("Forest Brothers") developed in the countryside, reaching its zenith in 1946–48. It is hard to <b>tell</b> <b>how</b> many people were {{in the ranks of}} the Metsavennad; however, it is estimated that at different times there could have been about 30,000–35,000 people. Probably the last Forest Brother was caught in September 1978, and killed himself during his apprehension.|$|E
25|$|The Historia Brittonum recounts {{many details}} about Vortigern and his sons. Chapters 31–49 <b>tell</b> <b>how</b> Vortigern (Guorthigirn) {{deals with the}} Saxons and Saint Germanus of Auxerre. Chapters 50–55 deal with Saint Patrick. Chapter 56 tells about King Arthur and his battles. Chapters 57–65 mention English genealogies, mingled with English and Welsh history. Chapter 66 gives {{important}} chronological calculations, mostly on Vortigern and the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.|$|E

Replicas of the original huts provide a glimpse of daily life. Conditions during the winter were poor, so the stories are also told how more than 2,000 soldiers died from typhus, dysentery, typhoid and pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the ballot}} marking is more complex, {{there can be}} an {{increase}} in spoiled ballots. In Australia, voters are required to write a number beside every candidate, and error rates can be five times higher than plurality voting elections Since Australia has compulsory voting, however, it is difficult to <b>tell</b> <b>how</b> many ballots are deliberately spoiled. Most jurisdictions with IRV do not require complete rankings and may use columns to indicate preference instead of numbers. In American elections with IRV, more than 99% of voters typically cast a valid ballot.|$|E
