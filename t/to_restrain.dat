It {{has been found that}} numerical results accord well with experimental results in terms of cracking ages for both circular and elliptical concrete rings, indicating that the proposed fracture mechanics-based numerical approach is reliable for analyzing cracking in concrete ring specimens subject <b>to</b> <b>restrained</b> shrinkage...|$|R

5|$|A {{study on}} the {{carpenter}} ant Camponotus floridanus found a special surface hydrocarbon on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups {{that did not have}} queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is still unknown as to how the decision <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce worker reproduction.|$|E

Justin's successor, Tiberius II, {{choosing}} between his enemies, awarded subsidies to the Avars while taking military action against the Persians. Though Tiberius' general, Maurice, led an effective campaign on the eastern frontier, subsidies failed <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> the Avars.

The practice spread to Scotland, where James reigned as well as resided before the Union of the Crowns; the Scots started believing that their king, now also king of England, possessed the ability to heal them.

5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of 1778, Brant {{achieved}} an undeserved reputation for brutality. He {{was not present}} at Wyoming — although many thought he was — and he actively sought to minimize the atrocities that took place at Cherry Valley. Diaries belonging to British soldiers during the campaign state the regiment as being the butchers and given that Butler was the overall commander of the expedition, there is controversy with whom actually ordered or failed <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> the killings. The massacre contributed to calls for reprisals, leading to the 1779 Sullivan Expedition which drove the Iroquois out of western New York.|$|E

Dunderdale received a score of 71.4 {{out of a possible}} 100.0, though the report did mention that her strong performance with regards to government spending was in part due to the province’s significant economic growth and not her ability <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> growth in spending.|$|E
40|$|The {{concrete}} repair {{industry is}} driven by deterioration of, damage to, and defects in concrete structures. The impact of deterioration or damage is {{a reduction in the}} service life of the concrete structure. One of the common methods used to repair and rehabilitate damaged concrete structures is the bonded overlay technique. However, bonded overlays are prone <b>to</b> <b>restrained</b> shrinkage cracking which impairs their performance. The mechanism leading <b>to</b> <b>restrained</b> shrinkage cracking of bonded concrete overlays is complex and depends on material properties, such as shrinkage, tensile strength, elastic modulus, and tensile relaxation. In order {{to reduce the risk of}} cracking in bonded concrete overlays, one or a combination of the following is required: lower shrinkage strains, higher tensile strength, lower elastic modulus, and increased stress relaxation. The development of these material properties depends on the degree of hydration of the binder material. Fly ash (FA) and slag (GGBS) are known to influence the hydration reaction when added to the binder material. This change in hydration reactions affects the development of the mechanical properties of the concrete, which ultimately affects the outcome of restrained shrinkage. An increase in age at cracking with the use of fly ash and slag in bonded concrete overlays was hypothesised. The research aimed at investigating the influence of fly ash and slag on the performance of bonded concrete overlays with regards <b>to</b> <b>restrained</b> shrinkage cracking. The research also aimed at using the influence of fly ash and slag on the specific material properties governing <b>restrained</b> shrinkage <b>to</b> analyse and predict the performance of the overlay material...|$|R

40|$|The rodent {{model of}} hindlimb {{unloading}} {{has been successfully}} used to simulate some {{of the effects of}} space flight conditions. Previous studies have indicated that mice exposed to hindlimb-unloading conditions have decreased resistance to infections compared <b>to</b> <b>restrained</b> and normally housed control mice. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to clarify the mechanisms involved in resistance to infection in this model by examining the effects of hindlimb unloading on the function of the immune system and its impact on the production of catecholamines. METHODS: Female Swiss Webster mice were hindlimb-unloaded during 48 h and the function of the immune system was assessed in spleen and peritoneal cells immediately after this period. In addition, the kinetics of catecholamine production was measured throughout the hindlimb-unloading period. RESULTS: The function of the immune system was significantly suppressed in the hindlimb-unloaded group compared <b>to</b> <b>restrained</b> and normally housed control mice. Levels of catecholamines were increased in the hindlimb-unloaded group and peaked at 12 h following the commencement of unloading. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that physiological responses of mice are altered early after hindlimb unloading and that catecholamines may play a critical role in the modulation of the immune system. These changes may affect the ability of mice to resist infections. Copyright (c) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1340s {{relations}} with the Byzantine Empire temporarily deteriorated. Ivan Alexander demanded the extradition of his cousin Šišman, one of the sons of Michael Asen III, threatening the Byzantine government with war. Ivan Alexander's show of force backfired, as the Byzantines managed to see through his intentions and sent against him the fleet of their ally, the Turkish emir of Smyrna Umur Beg. Landing in the Danube Delta, they pillaged the countryside and attacked nearby Bulgarian cities. Forced <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> his demands, Ivan Alexander invaded the Byzantine Empire again {{at the end of}} 1341, claiming that he was summoned by the people of Adrianople. However, Ivan Alexander's troops were defeated twice by Turkish allies of the Byzantines near the city.|$|E

5|$|Lenin never {{witnessed}} {{this violence}} or {{participated in it}} first-hand, and publicly distanced himself from it.

The Party tried <b>to</b> <b>restrain</b> its activities in February 1919, stripping it of its powers of tribunal and execution in those areas not under official martial law, but the Cheka continued as before in swathes of the country. By 1920, the Cheka had become the most powerful institution in Soviet Russia, exerting influence over all other state apparatus.|$|E
