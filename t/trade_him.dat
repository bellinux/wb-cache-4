5|$|On November 1, 2017, Okafor {{revealed}} that he would welcome a trade or buyout from the 76ers, after the team decided to not pick up the fourth-year, $6.3 million option on Okafor's rookie deal, after having tried to <b>trade</b> <b>him</b> for some time.|$|E
5|$|By June 1992, the Nordiques {{announced}} that they were moving towards trading Lindros, and were engaged in trade discussions with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Calgary Flames, New Jersey Devils, Philadelphia Flyers, and Detroit Red Wings. The Red Wings were reported {{to be willing to}} trade Steve Yzerman, Steve Chiasson, and numerous draft picks to the Nordiques for Lindros. Yzerman indicated that he would also hold out from the Nordiques, should Detroit <b>trade</b> <b>him</b> to Quebec.|$|E
5|$|The Nordiques {{selected}} Lindros {{despite the}} warning. He {{asked for a}} $3million annual salary with the hopes that Quebec would <b>trade</b> <b>him.</b> Rather than sign with Quebec, he returned to Oshawa for the 1991–92 season and represented Canada in the 1992 Winter Olympics. Meanwhile, Lindros reportedly rejected a 10-year contract offer worth at least $50million from the Nordiques in March 1992. Quebec denied making the offer.|$|E
50|$|On January 11, 1968, the Reds <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> to the Cardinals for Alex Johnson.|$|R
50|$|On August 6, 2017, the Mariners <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> {{back to the}} Oakland Athletics for Yonder Alonso.|$|R
50|$|The Cubs <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> to the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 2, 2009 {{for future}} considerations.|$|R
5|$|In early , Koufax asked Dodgers GM Buzzie Bavasi to <b>trade</b> <b>him</b> {{because he}} wasn't getting enough playing time. By {{the end of}} 1960, after going 8–13, Koufax was {{thinking}} about quitting baseball to devote himself to an electronics business that he'd invested in. After the last game of the season, he threw his gloves and spikes into the trash. Nobe Kawano, the clubhouse supervisor, retrieved the equipment to return to Koufax the following year (or to somebody else if Koufax {{did not return to}} play).|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} adapted as the 1993 movie Schindler's List by Steven Spielberg. After {{acquiring}} the rights in 1983, Spielberg {{felt he was}} not ready emotionally or professionally to tackle the project, and he offered the rights to several other directors. After he read a script for the project prepared by Steven Zaillian for Martin Scorsese, he decided to <b>trade</b> <b>him</b> Cape Fear {{for the opportunity to}} do the Schindler biography. In the film, the character of Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) is a composite of Stern, Bankier, and Pemper. Liam Neeson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Schindler in the film, which won seven Oscars, including Best Picture.|$|E
5|$|Though {{he was the}} team's second leading scorer, Tanguay {{continued}} {{to be the subject}} of trade talks throughout the season. Set to become a restricted free agent in July 2006, the Avalanche chose to trade his negotiating rights to the Calgary Flames at the 2006 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for defenceman Jordan Leopold and two second round draft picks. Tanguay felt that the team chose to <b>trade</b> <b>him</b> after he {{failed to live up to}} the team's expectations in the playoffs even though he {{continued to}} struggle with his knee injury. The Flames quickly signed Tanguay to a three-year contract worth US$15.75 million.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, Ledée was batting only [...]241 for the Yankees {{when they}} <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> with {{pitchers}} Jake Westbrook and Zach Day to the Cleveland Indians {{in exchange for}} David Justice. He played just 17 games for the Indians before they <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> to the Texas Rangers for first baseman David Segui. He finished the 2000 season with the Rangers and was a reserve for the club in 2001. He signed with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2002. On July 30, 2004, the Phillies <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> with Alfredo Simón to the San Francisco Giants for Félix Rodríguez. He signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and was claimed off of waivers by the New York Mets on August 8, 2006.|$|R
50|$|The Cardinals <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> with Hal Gilson to the Astros for Ron Davis on June 15, 1968.|$|R
50|$|On July 22, 2012, the Colts <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> to the Philadelphia Eagles for cornerback D. J. Johnson.|$|R
5|$|After winning 15 {{games again}} in 1927, Aldridge {{expected}} a raise, but instead Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss traded {{him to the}} New York Giants on February 11, 1928, for Burleigh Grimes, citing Aldridge's 4.25 ERA in 1927 as a reason not {{to give him a}} raise. He held out for much of the year; by the time he returned, he was out of shape and pitched poorly. During the time Aldridge refused to report, Giants manager John McGraw threatened Aldridge with less pay, and at one point tried to <b>trade</b> <b>him</b> to the Cincinnati Reds. After the season, in which Aldridge's record was four wins and seven losses with a 4.83 earned run average after 119 innings pitched, he was sent to the Brooklyn Dodgers. However, Aldridge refused to report and retired from baseball instead. His final game was on August 29, 1928.|$|E
5|$|Bonneau was {{selected}} in the sixth round of the 2012 NBA Development League Draft with the 94th overall pick by the Springfield Armor, before being traded to the Austin Toros. Bonneau had his rookie season for the Windsor Express in the 2012–13 season. He won the slam-dunk contest of the 2013 NBL Canada All-Star game. Bonneau appeared in 29 regular season games, averaging 7.1 points, 1.6 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game. On September 28, 2013 the Brampton A's signed him, only to <b>trade</b> <b>him</b> a month later to the Windsor Express. Bonneau had a season high 34 points against the Ottawa SkyHawks. He started 33 of 38 regular season games, averaging 22.6 points, 5.0 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 1.5 steals per game. Bonneau was named NBL Canada Finals MVP and first-team All-NBL Canada for the 2013–14 season. On October 31, 2014 the Express traded his rights to the London Lightning for Tony Bennett.|$|E
5|$|McCrimmon {{recorded}} only 22 {{points in}} 1988–89 – his lowest in seven seasons – but led all NHL defencemen with a +43 rating. He appeared in all 22 playoff {{games for the}} Flames as the team defeated the Montreal Canadiens to win the first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history. McCrimmon was named the 10th captain in Flames history on November 3, 1989, succeeding Lanny McDonald and Jim Peplinski, who both retired following the Stanley Cup win. He scored 4 goals and 19 points during the 1989–90 season, but fell out of favour with head coach Terry Crisp as the two disagreed over how the team's defencemen were used. The Flames chose to <b>trade</b> <b>him</b> following the season, sending him to the Detroit Red Wings on June 15, 1990, {{in exchange for a}} second round draft pick.|$|E
50|$|On May 31, 2010, the Red Sox <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> to the Pirates for {{catching}} prospect Josue Peley.|$|R
50|$|Port {{eventually}} <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> and {{he returned}} to Western Australia {{at the beginning of}} the 2005 season.|$|R
50|$|Upon Stubbs' {{reassignment}} by the Sharks, the Lions <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> to the Knoxville NightHawks {{for future}} considerations.|$|R
5|$|Roberts did {{not last}} much longer in Florida as, {{following}} a 40-point season in 2005–06, the Panthers sought to <b>trade</b> <b>him</b> to the Pittsburgh Penguins late in the 2006–07 season. Several members of the Penguins, including Mario Lemieux and general manager Ray Shero, sought to convince Roberts {{to agree to the}} deal as he was initially unsure about leaving Florida but ultimately agreed to the trade. The deal was completed at the February 27, 2007, trade deadline as Pittsburgh sent prospect Noah Welch to Florida in exchange for Roberts. He was brought in to add a leadership presence to a young Penguins team. He finished the regular season with 13 points in 19 games in Pittsburgh and helped the Penguins reach the playoffs {{for the first time in}} six years.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the season}} started, however, Orr {{underwent}} another surgery on September 20, 1975. The Bruins' contract talks with Orr and Eagleson became difficult. The Bruins' insurer would not insure {{a contract with}} Orr and doctors advised the Bruins that Orr {{would not be able}} to play much longer. Orr returned to the lineup on November 8, 1975, the day after the Bruins traded Esposito to the New York Rangers. Orr was able to play the next ten games for the team but had to stop on November 28 due to pain in his knee. The next day, he underwent another knee surgery. Originally expected to only be out for seven to eight weeks, his knee did not respond to therapy and he returned home to Parry Sound. His season was over after ten games and he would not play again for the Bruins. His impending free agency led to speculation that the Bruins would <b>trade</b> <b>him,</b> but despite his injury, they were negotiating to keep him until the end.|$|E
5|$|Coach Perkins met {{for several}} hours with Oklahoma linebacker Brian Bosworth, who entered a {{supplemental}} draft after being kicked off of the Oklahoma team. Perkins and Bosworth were impressed with each other, but the rights to select were awarded lottery-style, and the first selection went to the Seattle Seahawks. The Seahawks drafted Bosworth despite his having sent them a letter telling them not to bother. He expressed a preference {{to play for the}} Buccaneers. When the Indianapolis Colts failed to sign linebacker Cornelius Bennett, the second player selected in the draft (directly after Testaverde), they attempted to <b>trade</b> <b>him</b> to Tampa Bay. Perkins had previously coached Bennett at Alabama, but the Colts, looking for extra draft picks to trade to the Los Angeles Rams to get running back Eric Dickerson, wanted two draft picks in return for Bennett. Perkins felt that this price was too steep. Perkins also attempted to persuade Bo Jackson, their first-overall pick from the 1986 NFL Draft who had refused to sign with the Buccaneers, to change his mind and join the team.|$|E
50|$|The Pirates <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> to the Texas Rangers on July 17, , for Todd Van Poppel and Warren Morris.|$|R
50|$|On January 28, 2009, the Mariners <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> to the Chicago Cubs for Ronny Cedeño and Garrett Olson.|$|R
50|$|On July 31, , the Mariners <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> to the Florida Marlins in {{exchange}} for pitching prospect Gaby Hernandez.|$|R
5|$|Pierce {{was sent}} back to Buffalo for the 1946 season, now with Gabby Hartnett as his manager (Harris having moved to the team's front office), but missed most of the year with a back injury which was {{attributed}} to overwork. After the 1947 season in Buffalo, where Richards was now his manager, he returned to Detroit in 1948, spending most of the season in the bullpen but making five starts and posting a 3–0 record; he had yet added very little weight since his high school days, being still at 148 pounds. He made his first start, and earned his first major league victory, on August 8 against the Washington Senators, pitching 7⅔ innings and striking out six in a 6–5 victory in which he also drove in a run with a triple and scored. However, Pierce also issued 51 walks in 55⅓ innings that year, and concerns about his pitching control led the Tigers to <b>trade</b> <b>him</b> to the White Sox on November 10 for catcher Aaron Robinson and $10,000, in what most baseball historians consider {{to be one of the}} most one-sided trades in baseball history. Talks had initially centered on Chicago acquiring Pierce's high school teammate Ted Gray, although sources differ as to whether it was White Sox general manager Frank Lane or his Detroit counterpart Billy Evans who switched the focus to Pierce; the Tigers tried to call off the deal one day after it was completed upon fully realizing what they had given up, even offering $50,000 to get Pierce back, but Lane had no intention of giving up the steal he had accomplished in his first trade as general manager.|$|E
25|$|On March 12, 2014, the Bucs {{released}} Revis {{after several}} failed attempts to <b>trade</b> <b>him,</b> making him an unrestricted free {{agent for the}} first time of his career.|$|E
25|$|The next season, Rhodes {{was shipped}} to the {{expansion}} Atlanta Thrashers, giving Tugnutt sole possession of the starting job. However, {{he was unable to}} match his previous season and Ottawa decided to <b>trade</b> <b>him</b> to the Pittsburgh Penguins in favor of an experienced playoff performer, Tom Barrasso.|$|E

50|$|On December 8, 2016, Haley was {{selected}} by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the 2016 Rule 5 draft. The Angels <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> to the San Diego Padres for cash, and the Padres <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> with cash or a player to be named later to the Minnesota Twins for Miguel Díaz. Haley made the Twins' Opening Day roster. He was returned to the Red Sox on July 24.|$|R
5000|$|Gillespie {{then found}} {{his way to the}} Arizona Sting. In October 2004, the Sting <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> to the Calgary Roughnecks who signed him to a one-year contract. [...] In 2005, the Roughnecks re-signed him to a two-year contract. In July, 2008, the Boston Blazers traded for Gillespie and then, as part of a three-team deal, <b>traded</b> <b>him</b> to the San Jose Stealth. The Stealth then signed him to a one-year contract.|$|R
25|$|Eric Lindros {{was drafted}} by the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, but refused to play for them, forcing the Greyhounds to <b>trade</b> <b>him.</b> After {{arriving}} in Oshawa, Lindros {{turned out to be}} the player the Generals needed to reach the Memorial Cup, in addition to the existing core of players captained by Iain Fraser.|$|E
25|$|In February, the Chiefs {{released}} WR Eddie Kennison, OT John Welbourn, RB Gilbert Harris, DE Khreem Smith, CB Ty Law, LB Kendrell Bell, TE Jason Dunn, DT James Reed, and OT Chris Bober. After {{attempting to}} <b>trade</b> <b>him</b> {{for the second}} consecutive year, the Chiefs released FS Greg Wesley in July. In October, Kansas City released LB Napoleon Harris, and K Nick Novak.|$|E
25|$|In {{the offseason}} {{prior to the}} 1995 season, the Blue Bombers {{considered}} signing free agent receiver Jock Climie, a Canadian who could replace Alphin while having a favorable effect on the Blue Bombers' import ratio. This signing did not occur, however. After Alphin struggled with dropped passes in the early season, the Blue Bombers looked to <b>trade</b> <b>him</b> and eventually released him in mid-September. Alphin finished his partial season with the Blue Bombers with 417 yards on 32 catches.|$|E
