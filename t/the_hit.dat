Even though these albums could be seen as an extension of other Telstar Hit themed compilations (such as 100% Hits) these albums are categorized under <b>the</b> <b>Hits</b> brand in <b>the</b> Complete Book Of British Charts, which is probably due to BMG's former and Telstar's subsequent involvement in <b>the</b> series. <b>The</b> <b>Hits</b> '93 series ran for four volumes during 1993, and one volume of <b>Hits</b> '94 with <b>the</b> concept eventually being replaced by the resurrection of Telstar and BMG's short-lived single-CD version of <b>The</b> <b>Hits</b> Album later in the year, which also lasted one volume.|$|R
