Let me tell you something, Mister – I've worked since I was ten years old, and all my life I've known you superior bastards. I knew you people when I was a kid in Boston and I worked in eating-places and you ordered me around … [...] "Oh bus-boy! My friend here seems to have thrown up on the table. Clean it up, please!"

Please keep out of my way as much as possible!" [...] Well, I took that crap! I took that for years from pimple-faced bastards who weren't good enough to wipe my nose!

[...] According to Benaud, Greg Chappell [...] "got his sums wrong" [...] and instead of using Dennis Lillee for the last over, he was forced to use his brother Trevor, a considerably less talented bowler. (In limited-overs cricket, a bowler can only bowl 10 out of 50 overs in an innings, and in this match, Lillee had already bowled his maximum number of allotted overs.) ...|$|R

5000|$|Most others disagreed.

5000|$|The albums {{unconventional}} nature often alienates new listeners. Cartoonist {{and writer}} Matt Groening tells {{of listening to}} Trout Mask Replica {{at the age of}} 15: [...] "I thought it was <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>Id</b> ever heard. I said to myself, theyre not even trying! It was just a sloppy cacophony. Then I listened to it a couple more times, because I couldnt believe Frank Zappa could do this to me - and because a double album cost a lot of money. About the third time, I realised they were doing it on purpose; they meant it to sound exactly this way. About the sixth or seventh time, it clicked in, and I thought it was the greatest album Id ever heard". John Harris of The Guardian later discussed the idea that the album requires several listens to [...] "get it", concluding it still sounded [...] "awful" [...] after six listens. Filmmaker David Lynch has called Trout Mask Replica his favorite album of all time, and John Lydon has also listed the album as one of his favourites, noting, [...] "The first time I played that album, I laughed all the way through." ...|$|R
6000|$|BARBARA. Why not! Do {{you know}} what my father is? Have you {{forgotten}} that Lord Saxmundham is Bodger the whisky man? Do you remember how we implored the County Council {{to stop him from}} writing Bodger's Whisky in letters of fire against the sky; so that the poor drinkruined creatures on the embankment could not wake up from their snatches of sleep without being reminded of their deadly thirst by that wicked sky sign? Do you know that <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> have had to fight here is not the devil, but Bodger, Bodger, Bodger, with his whisky, his distilleries, and his tied houses? Are you going to make our shelter another tied house for him, and ask me to keep it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Moreover, if I {{took the}} {{brigantine}} I should only cut off Carthew's escape in that direction. His power over Miss Greendale {{would be just}} as great, if he had her up among those mountains among the blacks, as it was when he had her on board. I can see that I have made a horrible mess of the whole business, and that {{is the only thing that}} I can see. Yesterday I thought it was the best thing to start on a direct chase, as it seemed absolutely certain to me that we should overhaul and capture her. Now I see that it was <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could have done, and that I ought to have waited until I could take her in the bay." ...|$|E
6000|$|But <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> had {{to undergo}} in my {{managerial}} career was patronage. Oh, sir, {{of all things}} deliver me from the patronage of the great people of a country town. It was my ruin. You must know that this town, though small, was filled with feuds, and parties, and great folks; being a busy little trading and manufacturing town. The mischief was that their greatness was of a kind not to be settled by reference to the court calendar, or college of heraldry. It was therefore the most quarrelsome kind of greatness in existence. You smile, sir, {{but let me tell}} you there are no feuds more furious than the frontier feuds, which take place on these [...] "debatable lands" [...] of gentility. The most violent dispute that I ever knew in high life, was one that occurred at a country town, on a question of precedence between the ladies of a manufacturer of pins and a manufacturer of needles.|$|E
60|$|The whole Court {{was a great}} flaunting {{crowd of}} debauched men and shameless women; and Catherine's merry husband insulted and outraged her in every {{possible}} way, until she consented to receive those worthless creatures as her very good friends, and to degrade herself by their companionship. A MRS. PALMER, whom the King made LADY CASTLEMAINE, and afterwards DUCHESS OF CLEVELAND, {{was one of the}} most powerful of the bad women about the Court, and had great influence with the King nearly all through his reign. Another merry lady named MOLL DAVIES, a dancer at the theatre, was afterwards her rival. So was NELL GWYN, first an orange girl and then an actress, who really had good in her, and of whom one of <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> know is, that actually she does seem to have been fond of the King. The first DUKE OF ST. ALBANS was this orange girl's child. In like manner the son of a merry waiting-lady, whom the King created DUCHESS OF PORTSMOUTH, became the DUKE OF RICHMOND. Upon the whole it is not so bad a thing to be a commoner.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well! I {{have been}} thinking! Our {{marriage}} was <b>the</b> best and <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> ever did. It was unjust to you, and {{as bad as}} possible towards them; {{but that is what}} I can't be as sorry for as it deserves,' and he looked up with a sweet smile, fading at once--'except when I look at you and the children, and think what is to become of you.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Under Casolaro's body, paramedics {{found an}} empty Milwaukee beer can, two white plastic liner-trash bags, {{and a single}} edge razor blade. There was also a half-empty wine bottle nearby. Ridgeway and Vaughan write that nothing {{was placed in the}} bathtub drain to prevent debris from {{draining}} away, and none of the bathwater was saved. Other than the gruesome scene, the hotel room was clean and orderly. There was a legal pad and a pen present on the desk; a single page had been torn from the pad, and a message written on it: [...] "To those who I love the most: Please forgive me for <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> possible <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could have done. Most of all I'm sorry to my son. I know deep down inside that God will let me in." ...|$|R
6000|$|And last of {{all there}} was the {{subterranean}} and gloomy kitchen, in which there had lived that long succession of serving-maids of whom we gain shadowy glimpses in the Letters and in the Journal. Poor souls, dwellers in the gloom, working so hard for others, so bitterly reviled when by chance some weakness of humanity comes to break, for an instant, the routine of their constant labour, so limited in their hopes and in their pleasures, they are of all folk upon this planet those for whom a man's heart may most justly soften. So said Frank as he gazed around him in the dark-cornered room. 'And never one word of sympathy for them, or of anything save scorn in all his letters. His pen upholding human dignity, but where was the dignity of these poor girls for whom he has usually one bitter line of biography in his notes to his wife's letters? It's <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> have against him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I now felt drearily dismal. I {{began to}} realise {{the fact that}} we had {{actually}} pledged ourselves to work without intermission for the next eighteen or twenty hours, of which two only had run, and I felt sensations akin to what must have been those of the galley-slaves of old. In the midst of many deep thoughts and cogitations, during that silent morning hour, when all were asleep around me save the three mechanical-looking boatmen, and when the only sounds that met my ears were the dip of the oars and the deep breathing, (to give it no other name), of the slumberers--in the midst of many deep thoughts, I say, I came to the conclusion that in my present circumstances <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could do was to think! I remembered the fable of the pendulum that became so horrified at the thought of the number of ticks it had to perform in a lengthened period of time, that it stopped in despair; and I determined to [...] "shut down" [...] my intellect.|$|E
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS: [...] "Yes, I {{understand}} that, perfectly. I am now asking {{merely for}} general information. I {{do not expect}} you to relent, and, in fact, I should consider it rather frivolous if you did. No. What I have always admired in your character, Lucy, is a firm, logical consistency; a clearness of mental vision that leaves no side of a subject unsearched; and an unwavering constancy of purpose. You may say that these traits are characteristic of ALL women; but they are pre-eminently characteristic of you, Lucy." [...] Miss Galbraith looks askance at him, to make out whether he is in earnest or not; he continues, with a perfectly serious air. [...] "And I know now that if you're offended with me, it's for no trivial cause." [...] She stirs uncomfortably in her chair. [...] What I have done I can't imagine, {{but it must be}} something monstrous, since it has made life with me appear so impossible that you are ready to fling away your own happiness-- for I know you DID love me, Lucy--and destroy mine. I will begin with <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can think of. Was it because I danced so much with Fanny Watervliet?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Drummer Don Bolles {{described}} {{the experience of}} his introduction to [...] "Forming" [...] soon after it came out:I was transfixed; this was either <b>the</b> best or <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> had ever heard. The A-side was this amazingly low-tech approach to [...] "stereo"—vocals in one channel, music (or three-chord sludge, as it were) in the other, with the singer matter-of-factly pointing out that [...] "whoever would buy this shit is a fucking jerk". ... ending was punctuated by the thunk sound of the mic hitting the floor! Now THIS, I thought to myself, is PUNK!"In early 1978, Bolles would become the Germs' permanent drummer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{ask your}} attention. First, I must show you <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of <b>things,</b> as <b>I</b> learned {{it on the}} spot in Canada. The mine is {{threatened}} with inundation, which can be prevented only {{by the use of}} powerful pumping machinery; the rock is unusually broken up and faulty, which necessitates expensive timbering and impedes the work. These difficulties, however, need not be enlarged upon, because, if the quality of the ore justified it, they could be overcome. Instead, I will tell you roughly how much capital we have expended, the quantity of ore raised, the cost of its extraction, and the value of the yield in refined metal." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The singles were stupid little pop songs," [...] Mellencamp told Record Magazine in 1983. [...] "I take {{no credit}} for that record.

Me and {{the guys in the}} band thought we were finished, anyway. It was the most expensive record I ever made. It cost $280,000, do you believe that? <b>The</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> was that <b>I</b> could have gone on making records like that for hundreds of years. Hell, as long as you sell a few records and the record company isn't putting a lot of money into promotion, you're making money for 'em and that's all they care about. PolyGram loved Nothin' Matters. They thought I was going to turn into the next Neil Diamond." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{night at}} Pfaff's {{must have been}} the last of the Bohemians for me, and it was the last of New York authorship too, for the time. I do not know why I should not have {{imagined}} trying to see Curtis, whom I knew so much by heart, and whom I adored, but I may not have had the courage, or I may have heard that he was out of town; Bryant, I believe, was then out of the country; but at any rate I did not attempt him either. The Bohemians were {{the beginning and the end}} of the story for me, and to tell the truth I did not like the story. I remember that as I sat at that table under the pavement, in Pfaff's beer-cellar, and listened to the wit that did not seem very funny, I thought of the dinner with Lowell, the breakfast with Fields, the supper at the Autocrat's, and felt that I had fallen very far. In fact it can do no harm at this distance of time to confess that it seemed to me then, and for a good while afterwards, that a person who had seen the men and had the things said before him that I had in Boston, could not keep himself too carefully in cotton; and this was what I did all the following winter, though of course it was a secret between me and me. I dare say it was not <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could have done, in some respects.|$|E
6000|$|Were I {{to choose}} one {{character}} out of Dr. Holmes's creations as my favourite, it would be [...] "a frequent correspondent of his," [...] and of mine--the immortal Gifted Hopkins. Never was minor poet more kindly and genially portrayed. And if one had to pick out three of his books, as the best worth reading, they would be [...] "The Professor," [...] "Elsie Venner," [...] and [...] "The Guardian Angel." [...] They have not the impeccable art and distinction of [...] "The House of the Seven Gables" [...] and [...] "The Scarlet Letter," [...] but they combine fantasy with living human interest, and with humour. With Sir Thomas Browne, and Dr. John Brown, and--may we not add Dr. Weir Mitchell?--Dr. Holmes excellently represents the physician in humane letters. He has left a blameless and most amiable memory, unspotted by the world. His works are full of the savour of his native soil, naturally, without straining after [...] "Americanism;" [...] and they are national, not local or provincial. He crossed the great gulf of years, between the central age of American literary production--the time of Hawthorne and Poe--to our own time, and, like Nestor, he reigned among the third generation. As far as the world knows, {{the shadow of a}} literary quarrel never fell on him; he was without envy or jealousy, incurious of his own place, never vain, petulant, or severe. He was even too good-humoured, and <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> have heard of him is that he could never say [...] "no" [...] to an autograph hunter.|$|E
6000|$|Once your friend, Longfellow {{was always}} your friend; {{he would not}} think evil of you, and if he knew evil of you, {{he would be the}} last of all that knew it to judge you for it. This may have been from the impersonal habit of his mind, but I believe it was also the effect of principle, for he would do what he could to arrest the {{delivery}} of judgment from others, and would soften the sentences passed in his presence. Naturally this brought him under some condemnation with those of a severer cast; and I have heard him criticised for his benevolence towards all, and his constancy to some who were not quite so true to themselves, perhaps. But this leniency of Longfellow's was what constituted him great as well as good, for it is not our wisdom that censures others. As for his goodness, I never saw a fault in him. I do not mean to say that he had no faults, or that there were no better men, but only to give the witness of my knowledge concerning him. I claim in no wise to have been his intimate; such a thing was not possible in my case for quite apparent reasons; and I doubt if Longfellow was capable of intimacy in the sense we mostly attach to the word. Something more of egotism than I ever found in him must go to the making of any intimacy which did not come from the tenderest affections of his heart. But as a man shows himself to those often with him, and in his noted relations with other men, he showed himself without blame. All men that I have known, besides, have had some foible (it often endeared them the more), or some meanness, or pettiness, or bitterness; but Longfellow had none, nor the suggestion of any. No breath of evil ever touched his name; he went in and out among his fellow-men without the reproach that follows wrong; <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> ever heard said of him was that he had 'gene', and this was said by one of those difficult Cambridge men who would have found 'gene' in a celestial angel. Something that Bjornstjerne Bjornson wrote to me when he was leaving America after a winter in Cambridge, comes nearer suggesting Longfellow than all my talk. The Norsemen, in the days of their stormy and reluctant conversion, used always to speak of Christ as the White Christ, and Bjornson said in his letter, [...] "Give my love to the White Mr. Longfellow." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{went out}} of the house and took a long walk, as far as the Piazza, where my restlessness {{declined}} to quit me. I was unable to sit down (it was very late now but there were people still at the little tables in front of the cafes); I could only walk round and round, and I did so half a dozen times. I was uncomfortable, but it gave me a certain pleasure to have told Miss Tita who I really was. At last I took my way home again, slowly getting all but inextricably lost, as I did whenever I went out in Venice: so that it was considerably past midnight when I reached my door. The sala, upstairs, was as dark as usual and my lamp as I crossed it found nothing satisfactory to show me. I was disappointed, for I had notified Miss Tita that I would come back for a report, and I thought she might have left a light there as a sign. The door of the ladies' apartment was closed; which seemed an intimation that my faltering friend had gone to bed, tired of waiting for me. I stood in the middle of the place, considering, hoping she would hear me and perhaps peep out, saying to myself too that she would never go to bed with her aunt in a state so critical; she would sit up and watch--she would be in a chair, in her dressing gown. I went nearer the door; I stopped there and listened. I heard nothing at all and at last I tapped gently. No answer came and after another minute I turned the handle. There was no light in the room; this ought to have prevented me from going in, but it had no such effect. If I have candidly narrated the importunities, the indelicacies, of which my desire to possess myself of Jeffrey Aspern's papers had rendered me capable I need not shrink from confessing this last indiscretion. I think it was <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> did; yet there were extenuating circumstances. I was deeply though doubtless not disinterestedly anxious for more news of the old lady, and Miss Tita had accepted from me, as it were, a rendezvous which it might have been a point of honor with me to keep. It may be said that her leaving the place dark was a positive sign that she released me, and to this I can only reply that I desired not to be released.|$|E
