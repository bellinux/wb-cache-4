The choice of the topic proceeds from a widely known fact involving the problematic common life of those too much different groups. Many members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> do not have any awareness of Gipsies being a specific group of inhabitants, having their own culture and traditions. On the other hand, the traditional life of the Gipsies has changed at all,rather has declined, especially in the field of language. Both these points of view may {{play an important role in}} one another understanding of the Gipsies and <b>the</b> <b>majority.</b> <b>The</b> target <b>of</b> <b>my</b> work was to map the knowledge of the Gipsy culture and traditions by the Gipsy commune and, as well, to map <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority.</b> Within <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> this, two main hypothesises were determined.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relevance of modern moral philosophy to education, with particular reference to special educational needs. Where moral philosophers explore the tension between utilitarian and deontological reasoning, they often consider the balance between {{the rights of the}} individual and the benefits or costs for <b>the</b> <b>majority.</b> I argue that the debate is predicated on a false dichotomy between minority and majority which is best overcome by a return to virtue ethics. In exploring this ethical debate, I draw on a case study from Australia of a student excluded from mainstream education on the basis that inclusion will not serve the greater good <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> students. <b>My</b> intention here is not to offer practical guidance in the complex day-to-day deliberations of educators dealing with issues of inclusion, but to elaborate the structure of the present thinking about inclusion. It is hoped that an appreciation of the deeper basis of ethical reasoning will itself lead to a greater recognition of the need for exploring the ethical grounds of teaching and learning. I will argue that any dichotomy between the utilitarian happiness of the many and the deontological commitment to the rights of the individual is based on a misconception of human identity. The false choice between the many and the one rests upon the assumption that morality is fundamentally about restricting personal preferences in favour of <b>the</b> good <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority,</b> that there exists a fundamental conflict between what is good for the individual and what is good for society as a whole.
