5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>is</b> to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E

5|$|The Faculty of Medicine is {{affiliated}} with a network of ten teaching hospitals, providing medical treatment, research and advisory services to patients and clients from Canada and abroad. A core member of <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>is</b> University Health Network, itself a specialized federation of Toronto General Hospital, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Western Hospital, and Toronto Rehabilitation Institute. Physicians in the medical institutes have cross-appointments to faculty and supervisory positions in university departments. The Rotman School of Management developed the discipline and methodology of integrative thinking, upon which the school bases its curriculum. Founded in 1887, the Faculty of Law's emphasis on formal teachings of liberal arts and legal theory was then considered unconventional, but gradually helped shift the country's legal education system away from the apprenticeship model that prevailed until the mid-20th century. The Ontario Institute for Studies in Education is the teachers college of the university, {{affiliated with}} its two laboratory schools, the Institute of Child Study and the University of Toronto Schools. Autonomous institutes at the university include the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies and the Fields Institute.|$|E
5|$|The Saint Francis Health System owns several {{hospitals}} with {{a central}} location at Saint Francis Hospital {{in the southern part}} of the city. The facility contains 700 doctors and 918 beds, and with more than 7,000 employees, <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>is</b> the second largest healthcare employer in the state. The health system also operates a heart hospital, which was named by General Electric in 2004 one of the most advanced heart hospitals in the nation. St. John Medical Center, located in an 11-story midtown center, employs nearly 700 doctors. Other networks, such as Hillcrest Health System, operate a number of facilities in varying sizes. Beginning in 2007, the city elected to renew a five-year contract with EMSA for ambulance service after a period of consideration to switch to the Tulsa Fire Department for providing such services.|$|E
5|$|The Terrestrial Trunked Radio {{network has}} three {{components:}} the core net, {{which is a}} centralized computer center based on an Internet Protocol structure; the transmission net, which connects the core net, the radio net and other connection points with high-capacity lines; and the radio net, which consists of base stations with antennas in masts, on buildings and in some tunnels. <b>The</b> <b>network</b> <b>is</b> controlled by Motorola. In case a base station no longer can communicate with the core net, the base station can still relay communication within its range. Should the base station fall out or operations occur in areas without coverage, the terminals can communicate directly with each other.|$|E

5|$|The {{controller}} {{is central}} to the correct function of an Xgrid, as this node is responsible for the distribution, supervision and coordination of tasks on agents. The program running on the controller can assign and reassign tasks to handle individual agent failures on demand. The number of tasks assigned to an agent depend on two factors: the number of agents on an Xgrid and the number of processors in each node. The number of agents on an Xgrid determines how the controller will assign tasks. The tasks may be assigned simultaneously for a large number of agents, or queued for a small number of agents. When a node with more than one processor is detected on an Xgrid, the controller may assign one task per processor; this only occurs if the number of agents on <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>is</b> lower than the number of tasks the controller has to complete.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{constructing}} {{the network has}} been covered by the ministry. The costs of operating and maintaining the network are covered by the users, who also purchase their own terminals. Payment to the directorate is by an annual subscription fee per terminal, based on the terminal's use. For a terminal only used for stand-by, the annual subscription cost is NOK1,700 per year (2016), while that for a terminal in a control room is NOK45,000 (2016). As the cost of running <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>is</b> fixed independently {{of the amount of}} traffic, there is no cost for using the network. As additional users start implementing the system, the costs per subscriber will be reduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{first four}} {{sections}} (Beavers to Explorers) {{are led by}} a Section Leader and aided by Assistant Leaders, Sectional Assistants, Occasional Helpers and Young Leaders, who are Explorer Scouts trained in leadership techniques. Scout Networks are mainly member led, but are assisted by a Network Leader who ensures that <b>the</b> <b>Network</b> <b>is</b> working within {{the rules of the}} association. In addition to adult leadership, the association encourages its members themselves to take on positions of responsibility for their section meetings. This can be through responsibility for a group of members, such as the Patrol Leader and Assistant Patrol Leader in Scouts and Sixers and Seconders in Cubs, or through sectional forums to feedback on programmes. The Scout section also have the role of Senior Patrol Leader, usually someone about to move on to Explorers who overlooks all the patrols, {{and the members of the}} Explorer section are openly encouraged to run evenings and to plan their own meetings.|$|E

5|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows data packets to be {{used for}} {{synchronous}} voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking {{place at the same time}} and <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>is</b> enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.|$|E

40|$|Two sets {{of studies}} {{examined}} {{the viability of}} using bat-like sonar input for artificial neural networks in complex pattern recognition tasks. In {{the first set of}} studies, a sonar neural <b>network</b> <b>was</b> required to perform two face recognition tasks.

Following training, <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>was</b> tested on its ability to generalize and correctly recognize faces using echoes of novel facial expressions that {{were not included in the}} training set. <b>The</b> neural <b>network</b> <b>was</b> able to recognize novel echoes of faces almost perfectly (above 96 % accuracy) when it was required to recognize up to five faces. In the second face recognition task, a sonar neural <b>network</b> <b>was</b> trained to recognize the sex of 16 faces (eight males and eight females). After training, <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>was</b> able to correctly recognize novel echoes of those faces as 'male' or as 'female' faces with accuracy levels of 88 %. However, <b>the</b> <b>network</b> <b>was</b> not able to recognize novel faces as 'male' or 'female' faces. In the second set of studies, a sonar neural <b>network</b> <b>was</b> required to learn to recognize the speed of a target that was moving towards the viewer. During training, the target was presented in a variety of orientations, and <b>the</b> <b>network's</b> performance <b>was</b> evaluated when the target was presented in novel orientations that were not included in the training set.
