5|$|In cladistics, a homoplasy is a trait {{shared by}} two or more taxa for any reason other than that they share a common ancestry. Taxa which do share ancestry {{are part of the}} same clade; cladistics seeks to arrange them {{according}} to <b>their</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> relatedness to describe their phylogeny. Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, {{from the point of view}} of cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an incorrect analysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{best known}} {{cleaning}} symbioses are among marine fishes, where {{several species of}} small fish, notably of wrasse, are specialised in colour, pattern and behaviour as cleaners, providing a cleaning and ectoparasite removal service to larger, often predatory fish. Cleaner species, {{as shown in the}} table, vary widely in <b>their</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> dependence on their clients. Some are essentially pure obligate symbionts like the cleaner wrasse; some are opportunistic or facultative symbionts, like the orange chromide or some cleaner shrimps; and some, like the oxpeckers, combine a little eating of parasites (beneficial to client) with taking of blood (harmful to client), their favoured food.|$|E

5|$|Presociality is when animals exhibit {{more than}} just sexual {{interactions}} {{with members of the}} same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labor, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) are unique among primates in <b>their</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> cooperative care of young. Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; the results from this study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually.|$|E
5|$|The kōata, {{the growing}} {{tip of the}} plant, was eaten raw as medicine. When cooked, {{it was called the}} kōuka. If the spike of unopened leaves and a few outer leaves is gripped firmly at the base and bent, it will snap off. The leaves can be removed, and what remains is like a small {{artichoke}} heart that can be steamed, roasted or boiled to make kōuka, a bitter vegetable available at any time of the year. Kōuka is delicious as a relish with fatty foods like eel, muttonbirds, or pigeons, or in modern times, pork, mutton and beef. Different trees were selected for <b>their</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> bitterness, which should be strong for medicinal use, but less so when used as a vegetable.|$|E
5|$|From 1805 to 1867, Egypt {{remained}} legally {{a nominal}} Ottoman province {{governed by a}} Wāli {{on behalf of the}} Ottoman Sultan, although it was de facto virtually independent, with its wālis styling themselves as Khedives. Despite their legally subservient status, Egypt's wālis enjoyed far more political power than their descendants, who were to rule the country as nominally independent sultans and kings decades later. Throughout the 19th century, the legal fiction of Ottoman suzerainty was nonetheless symbolically maintained through Egypt's payment of an annual tribute. Moreover, although the Muhammad Ali Dynasty became a hereditary monarchy in 1840, each new ruler had to receive a firman (Arabic word for decree) from the Ottoman Sultan appointing him as Wāli in order to be formally invested with his office. Until 1866, Egypt's laws of succession followed the principle of agnatic seniority, which means that the reigning wāli always had to be the eldest male member of the dynasty. Rulers thus inherited the throne based on their age, not on <b>their</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> proximity. This explains why none of Ibrahim Pasha's successors was directly succeeded by his own son.|$|E

25|$|Oocytes are {{carefully}} denudated from the cumulus cells, as these cells {{can be a}} source of contamination during the PGD if PCR-based technology is used. In the majority of the reported cycles, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is used instead of IVF. The main reasons are to prevent contamination with residual sperm adhered to the zona pellucida and to avoid unexpected fertilization failure. The ICSI procedure is carried out on mature metaphase-II oocytes and fertilization is assessed 16–18 hours after. The embryo development is further evaluated every day prior to biopsy and until transfer to the woman’s uterus. During the cleavage stage, embryo evaluation is performed daily {{on the basis of the}} number, size, cell-shape and fragmentation rate of the blastomeres. On day 4, embryos were scored in function of <b>their</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> compaction and blastocysts were evaluated according to the quality of the throphectoderm and inner cell mass, and <b>their</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> expansion.|$|E
