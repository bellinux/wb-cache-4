The live album also featured a studio re-recording of the 1968 hit [...] "Hush" [...] with Gillan on vocals, to commemorate Deep Purple's 20th anniversary. [...] (The original 1968 release had been sung by Rod Evans). Gillan later remarked that the album was [...] "the embodiment of all the <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> with Purple." ...|$|E

Dwight finds a variety of <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> with the condominium, and, {{at the very end}} of the deal, Michael gets cold feet but relents when he learns that backing out of the deal will cost him a substantial amount of money. When Michael and Dwight return, the coffee cup race quickly dissolves, and the office returns to normal. Michael isolates himself in his office, still upset over the closure of his condo.|$|E
500|$|In a {{day where}} {{half of the}} week's top-10 teams were defeated, USC escaped {{becoming}} the sixth in a messy, mistake-prone 27–24 victory in a wet, windy game in Seattle. [...] Although USC had a 460–190 edge in total yards, their errors helped the Huskies significantly: They committed threeturnovers and 16penalties—their most in more than twoseasons—for 161yards, missed a field goal and had a punt blocked. [...] A disappointed Pete Carroll noted [...] "We just couldn't do more <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> in the game [...] I thought Washington was there for it. They were there to take it. All they needed was onemore chance." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Tim Sendra of AllMusic {{gave it a}} {{negative}} analysis, [...] "is a pretty cheesy rocker, suffering from clichéd lyrics and production." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian went on to analyze some verses and gave them a harsh review, [...] "Mars compares his penis to a carrot", which could not only lead to speculation regarding its meaning, but also [...] "it's an image that haunts {{the rest of the}} song." [...] He continued criticizing as the lyrics tell that [...] "the object of his affections" [...] should not try to connected Mars which could be related to his [...] "carrot-like penis". musicOMHs Jamie Milton felt that the recording was one of the <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> with the album as at its core [...] "involves throwing everything into the fire", mainly due to its [...] "bad-boy pop-punkrealms".|$|E
500|$|Josh Wolk of Entertainment Weekly {{felt that}} Britney and Kevin: Chaotic was Spears' [...] "career suicide by videocam", commenting, [...] "the truth {{is not only}} that she's vapid, but that she's self-obsessed to a {{dangerous}} degree". Wolk also noted [...] "many intersecting <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> on this show and with Britney that I can't possibly prioritize them". Laura Fries of Variety perceived the series as [...] "a visual assault of nauseating camera angles, likely to upset even the most desensitized TV viewer". Hayley Butler of Jam! gave the final episode of the series a mixed review, saying it [...] "was full of tear-jerking moments" [...] and [...] "the only episode not full of stupid jokes, childish behaviour and Britney's thoughts on life", commenting that Spears and Federline wedding scenes [...] "looked {{to be a very}} emotional and touching event". Butler also wondered [...] "if they feel their show served its purpose".|$|E
500|$|In a more {{critical}} vein, The New York Times chief music critic Donal Henahan {{alluded to the}} publicity buildup for the opera by opening his column, headed [...] "That was it?", by calling the work [...] "fluff" [...] and [...] "a Peter Sellars variety show, worth a few giggles but hardly a strong candidate for the standard repertory". New York magazine Peter G. Davis admired Maddalena's portrayal of the president, calling him [...] "positively eerie. The tilt of his head, the jerky walk, the nervous hand movements, even the way he sits and crosses his legs are Nixon to the life". [...] However, Davis felt the opera had little chance of survival once the initial public attention ended. St. Louis Post-Dispatch critic James Wierzbicki called the opera [...] "more interesting than good... a novelty, not much more." [...] Television critic Marvin Kitman, {{just prior to the}} telecast of the original Houston production in April 1988, stated [...] "There are only three <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> with Nixon in China. One, the libretto; two, the music; three, the direction. Outside of that, it's perfect." ...|$|E

500|$|With Ralph Korngold's 1955 {{biography}} of Stevens, the neoabolitionist school of historians began {{to consider the}} former congressman. These professors rejected the earlier view that those who had gone South to aid the African-American after the war were [...] "rapscallion carpetbaggers" [...] defeated by [...] "saintly redeemers.” [...] Instead, they applauded those who had sought to end slavery and forward civil rights, and castigated Johnson for obstructionism. [...] They took {{the view that the}} African-American was central to Reconstruction, and the only <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> with the congressional program were that it did not go far enough and that it stopped too soon. [...] Brodie's 1959 {{biography of}} Stevens was of this school. [...] Controversial in its conclusions for being a psychobiography, it found that Stevens was a [...] "consummate underdog who identified with the oppressed” and whose intelligence won him success, while his consciousness of his clubfoot retarded his social development. According to Brodie, this also made him unwilling to marry a woman of his own social standing.|$|E
500|$|The Orange County Registers {{film critic}} Michael Sragow gave the film grade [...] "A" [...] and commented on three lead characters, [...] "A trio of terrific {{performers}} imbues a riveting AIDS drama with {{heart and mind}} as well as pertinence." [...] Film critic Ty Burr reviewed the film for The Boston Globe and criticized, [...] "The movie's often touching and very watchable, but what gets you past the script's sincere calculation is the growing sense of rage toward a medical-industrial complex that saw AIDS sufferers as guinea pigs and sources of profit." [...] The Chicago Tribunes film critic Michael Phillips talked about [...] "How Woodroof became his own brand of AIDS activist {{is the stuff of}} Dallas Buyers Club, which does a few <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> but a lot right, starting right at the top with McConaughey." [...] Bob Mondello criticized the film's character for the NPR in these words: [...] "Dallas Buyers Club is just about a selfish boor who arguably gets a pass in terms of posterity, because while looking out for No. 1, he paved the way for change for everyone else." [...] Dana Stevens of Slate magazine praised McConaughey's performance, highlighting that the movie [...] "traffics in deep hindbrain emotions: fear and rage and lust and, above all, the pure animal drive to go on living." ...|$|E
2500|$|Australia {{therefore}} {{approached the}} first Test as clear favourites. Martin Johnson of The Independent {{wrote that the}} English team [...] "had only three <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> with them - can't bat, can't bowl, can't field". Australia selected two left-arm fast bowlers - Bruce Reid and Chris Matthews (both from Western Australia) - {{to take advantage of}} the clear problem the English batsmen had with this sort of bowling.|$|E

[...] God's custom has wisdom but human custom does not, and yet both humans and God are childish (inexperienced): [...] "human opinions are children's toys" [...] and [...] "Eternity is a child moving counters in a game; the kingly power is a child's." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 Lieutenant Colonel Derek Wilford {{expressed}} his anger at Tony Blair's intention {{of setting up}} the Saville inquiry, stating that {{he was proud of}} his actions on Bloody Sunday. Two years later in 2000 during an interview with the BBC, Wilford said: [...] "There might have been <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> in the sense that some innocent people, people who were not carrying a weapon, were wounded or even killed. But that was not done as a deliberate malicious act. It was done as an act of war." ...|$|E
2500|$|At a Q in August 2013, Cameron {{described}} himself as a practising Christian and {{an active member of the}} Church of England. On religious faith in general he has said: [...] "I do think that organised religion can get <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> but the Church of England and the other churches do play a very important role in society." [...] He says he considers the Bible [...] "a sort of handy guide" [...] on morality. He views Britain as a [...] "Christian country" [...] and aims to put faith back into politics.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was still experiencing extensive teething troubles {{as well as}} being victimized by [...] "urban legends", mostly involving inapplicable twin engine factors which had been designed out of the aircraft by Lockheed. In addition to these, the early versions had a reputation as a [...] "widow maker" [...] as it could enter an unrecoverable dive due to a sonic surface effect at high sub-sonic speeds. [...] The 527 P-38Fs were heavier, with more powerful engines that used more fuel, and were unpopular in the air war in Northern Europe. Since the heavier engines were having reliability problems and with them, without external fuel tanks, the range of the P-38F was reduced, and since drop tanks themselves were in short supply as the fortunes in the Battle of the Atlantic had not yet swung the Allies' way, the aircraft became relatively unpopular in minds of the bomber command planning staffs despite being the longest ranged fighter first available to the 8th Air Force in sufficient numbers for long range escort duties. Nonetheless, General Spaatz, then commander of the 8th Air Force in the UK, said of the P-38F: [...] "I'd rather have an airplane that goes like hell and has a few <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> with it, than one that won't go like hell and has a few <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his travels, Louis {{was the focus of}} a media recruitment campaign encouraging African-American men to enlist in the Armed Services, despite the military's racial segregation. When he was asked about his decision to enter the racially segregated U.S. Army, his explanation was simple: [...] "Lots of <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> with America, but Hitler ain't going to fix them." [...] In 1943, Louis made an appearance in the wartime Hollywood musical This Is the Army, directed by Michael Curtiz. He appeared as himself in a musical number, [...] "The Well-Dressed Man in Harlem," [...] which emphasized the importance of African-American soldiers and promoted their enlistment.|$|E

Similarly, see Professor Fred Rodell's [...] "Goodbye to Law Reviews," [...] whose opening lines contain the classic statement of the problem: [...] "There are two <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> with almost all legal writing.

2500|$|Louis went on {{to become}} a major celebrity in the United States and, moreover, is {{considered}} the first true African American national hero. When other prominent blacks questioned whether African Americans should serve against the Axis nations in the segregated U.S. Armed Forces, Louis disagreed, saying, [...] "There are a lot of <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> with America, but Hitler ain't gonna fix them." [...] He would go on and serve the United States Army during World War II, but he did not engage in battle while the war was going on. He mostly visited soldiers in Europe to provide them with motivational speeches and with boxing exhibitions. He kept defending the world heavyweight title until 1949, making twenty five consecutive title defenses – still a world record among all weight divisions.|$|E
2500|$|The tests {{demonstrated}} {{that the type of}} engine [...] "could be developed into an automotive power train for passenger vehicles and that it could produce favorable results." [...] However, progress was achieved with equal-power spark-ignition engines since 1977, and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) achieved by automobiles in the U.S. did not stand still. The Stirling engine still showed a shortfall in fuel efficiency and concerns about the ability to mass-produce it. There were also two <b>things</b> <b>wrong</b> with Stirling engine power: first was the time needed to warm up (because most drivers do not like to wait to start driving), and second was the difficulty in changing the engine's speed (thus limiting flexibility when driving). A 1980 AMC Concord was also fitted with a P-40 engine and used to inform the public about the Stirling engine and the ASE program.|$|E
2500|$|Critics have disputed Ehrlich's main thesis about {{overpopulation}} and {{its effects}} on the environment and human society, and his solutions, {{as well as some of}} his specific predictions made since the late 1960s.

Ronald Bailey of Reason Magazine has termed him an [...] "irrepressible doomster... who, as far as I can tell, has never been right in any of his forecasts of imminent catastrophe." [...] On the first Earth Day in 1970, he warned that [...] "n ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish." [...] In a 1971 speech, he predicted that: [...] "By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people." [...] "If I were a gambler," [...] Professor Ehrlich concluded before boarding an airplane, [...] " [...] I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000." [...] When this scenario did not occur, he responded that [...] "When you predict the future, you get <b>things</b> <b>wrong.</b> How wrong is another question. I would have lost if I had had taken the bet. However, if you look closely at England, what can I tell you? They're having all kinds of problems, just like everybody else."
