500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, <b>tawny</b> <b>pipit,</b> Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E
500|$|A {{subcommittee}} {{was set up}} in 1997 {{to undertake}} a review of rare bird records from the years immediately prior to BBRC's establishment. The purpose of the review was to ensure that all records from 1950 onwards (the cut-off date for Category A of the BOU British List of birds) have been subjected to a similar level of scrutiny. Not all of the 1,100 records of species considered to be rarities at that time were assessed, but only those related to species not recorded more than 100 times by 1997, as well as a few records of less rare species under particularly unusual circumstances, which were termed [...] "sore thumbs". Much of the original documentation was unavailable for the review, as it had been lost, and so for many records, the review was based solely on published accounts of the birds. The most notable outcome of this review was the reidentification of a frigatebird record from Tiree in 1953. Previously identified as a magnificent frigatebird, the BBRC review concluded that the bird was in fact an Ascension frigatebird, the only individual of this species ever identified in Europe (Walbridge, Small & McGowan 2003). The full results of the review were published in 2006. Of the 126 records reviewed, 37 were rejected as unacceptable. These included a claimed white-tailed eagle, which broke into a chicken-run in a garden and stole a chicken, three little crakes, three European scops owls, the only late December record of <b>tawny</b> <b>pipit,</b> three black-eared wheatears, a record of two White's thrushes together in April, a spring lanceolated warbler, two moustached warblers and a pine grosbeak. Furthermore, issues were found with the identification of Britain's first western sandpiper, on Fair Isle in 1956, and these led the BOURC to reject this record. The western sandpiper has been recorded several times subsequently in Britain however, and remains on the national list. The subcommittee's final report also hints at the prospect that some records from immediately prior to 1950 may be incorrect; because these fell outside the timeframes of the review they were not reassessed.|$|E

40|$|Background]: Parasites play pivotal {{roles in}} host {{population}} dynamics and can have strong ecological impacts on hosts. Knowledge {{of the effects}} of parasites on hosts is often limited by the general observation of a fraction of individuals (mostly adults) within a population. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the prevalence of malaria parasites in adult (≥ 1 year old) and nestling (7 - 11 day old) <b>Tawny</b> <b>pipits</b> Anthus campestris, to evaluate the influence of the host sex on parasite prevalence in both groups of age, and explore the association between infections and body condition (adults) and growth (nestlings). [Methods]: Two hundred <b>Tawny</b> <b>pipits</b> (105 adults and 95 nestlings) from one Spanish population were screened for avian malaria parasites (Haemoproteus and Plasmodium) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based methods. Body condition (body mass against a linear measure of size) was measured in adults and growth rate (daily mass gain) was calculated for nestlings. [Results]: The overall prevalence of infection was 46 %. Sixteen different mitochondrial cytochrome b haplotypes of Plasmodium spp. and one Haemoproteus spp. haplotype were found. Malaria parasites were equally prevalent in nestlings and adults (45 and 46 %, respectively). Males were more likely to be infected by parasites than females, and this sex-bias parasitism was evident in both adults and nestlings. Furthermore, a lower daily mass gain during nestling growth in males than in females following infections were found, whereas the effect of infections on body condition of adults was detrimental for females but not for males. [Conclusions]: Age-specific differences in physiological trade-offs and ecological factors, such as nest predation would explain, at least in part, the observed host sex and age-related patterns in <b>Tawny</b> <b>pipits.</b> The authors acknowledge the infrastructural support of the Institute of Research in Game Resources (IREC), the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), and the University of Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM).

40|$|Afforestation often causes direct habitat {{losses for}} {{farmland}} birds of conservation concern, {{but it is}} uncertain whether negative effects also extend significantly into adjacent open land. Information is thus required on how these species react to wooded edges, and how their responses are affected by edge and landscape characteristics. These issues were examined in Mediterranean arable farmland, using bird counts at 0, 100, 200, 300 and > 300 m from oak, pine and eucalyptus edges, embedded in landscapes with variable amounts and spatial configurations of forest plantations. Bird diversity declined away from edges, including that of woodland, farmland and ground-nesting birds. Positive edge responses were also found for overall and woodland bird abundances, and for five of the nine most widespread and abundant species (Galerida larks, stonechat, linnet, goldfinch and corn bunting). Strong negative edge effects were only recorded for steppe birds, with reduced abundances near edges of calandra larks and short-toed larks, but not of little bustards and <b>tawny</b> <b>pipits.</b> Edge contrast affected the magnitude of edge effects, with a tendency for stronger responses to old and tall eucalyptus plantations (hard edges) than to young and short oak plantations (soft edges). There were also species-specific interactions between edge and fragmentation effects, with positive edge responses tending to be strongest in less fragmented landscapes, whereas steppe birds tended to increase faster away from edges and to reach the highest species richness and abundances in large arable patches. Results suggest that forest plantations may increase overall bird diversity and abundance in adjacent farmland, at the expenses of steppe birds of conservation concern. Clustering forest plantations in a few large patches and thus reducing the density of wooded edges at the landscape-scale might reduce such negative impacts. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Genes of {{the major}} {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) code for receptors that {{are central to the}} adaptive immune response of vertebrates. These genes are therefore important genetic markers with which to study adaptive ge-netic variation in the wild. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has increasingly been used in the last decade to genotype the MHC. However, NGS methods are highly prone to sequenc-ing errors, and although several methodologies have been proposed to deal with this, until recently there have been no standard guidelines for the validation of putativeMHC alleles. In this study, we used the 454 NGS platform to screen MHC class I exon 3 variation in a population of the island endemic Berthelot’s pipit (Anthus berthelotii). We were able to charac-terise MHC genotypes across 309 individuals with high levels of repeatability. We were also able to determine alleles that had low amplification efficiencies, whose identification with-in individuals may thus be less reliable. At the population level we found lower levels of MHC diversity in Berthelot’s pipit than in its widespread continental sister species the <b>tawny</b> <b>pipit</b> (Anthus campestris), and observed trans-species polymorphism. Using the sequence data, we identified signa-tures of gene conversion and evidence of maintenance of functionally divergent alleles in Berthelot’s pipit. We also detected positive selection at 10 codons. The present study therefore shows that we have an efficient method for screening individual MHC variation across large datasets in Berthelot’s pipit, and provides data {{that can be used in}} future studies investigating spatio-temporal patterns and scales of selection on the MHC...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{relative}} role of different evolutionary forces {{in shaping the}} level and distribution of functional genetic diversity among natural populations is a key issue in evolutionary and conservation biology. To do so accurately genetic data must be analyzed in conjunction with an unambiguous understanding of the historical processes that have acted upon the populations. Here we focused on diversity at toll-like receptor (TLR) loci, which {{play a key role}} in the vertebrate innate immune system and, therefore, are expected to be under pathogen-mediated selection. We assessed TLR variation within and among 13 island populations (grouped into three archipelagos) of Berthelot's pipit, Anthus berthelotii, for which detailed population history has previously been ascertained. We also compared the variation observed with that found in its widespread sister species, the <b>tawny</b> <b>pipit,</b> Anthus campestris. We found strong evidence for positive selection at specific codons in TLR 1 LA, TLR 3 and TLR 4. Despite this, we found that at the allele frequency level, demographic history has played the major role in shaping patterns of TLR variation in Berthelot's pipit. Levels of diversity and differentiation within and across archipelagos at all TLR loci corresponded very closely with neutral microsatellite variation, and with the severity of the bottlenecks that occurred during colonization. Our study shows that despite the importance of TLRs in combating pathogens, demography can be the main driver of immune gene variation within and across populations, resulting in patterns of functional variation that can persist over evolutionary timescales.

40|$|In the Netherlands {{the total}} active inland drift-sand {{area has been}} declining rapidly during the last 50 years. To {{preserve}} the inland drift sands, {{it is necessary to}} understand its origin and development and the role of human activity in this semi-natural ecotype. The objective of this literature review is to describe the development of the drift-sand ecotopes, to explain the rapid decline of the active drift sands, and to develop a management strategy for the remaining active drift sands. Inland drift-sand landscapes are relatively young landscapes of Holocene age. They often occur as oval-shaped cells with a length of 1. 5 to over 6 km {{in the direction of the}} prevailing wind. These cells presumably represent reactivated deposits of Younger Cover Sands. Large-scale erosion events in combination with human activity suppressed the development of vegetation. After the change in land use in the first half of the 20 th century in which most of the drift sands were re-afforested, the vegetation succession started to show a progressive development. In this stage inland drift-sand ecotopes developed in most of the remaining drift sands with all forms of the typical succession stages from bare sand to forest. The rate at which this development took place mainly depended on the geomorphological development stage of the area, the area size and human activity. Since the 1960 s the increased nitrogen deposition has accelerated the vegetation succession, not only resulting in a further decline of the drift sands, but also in a loss of the fragile balance between the different ecotopes and loss of its typical habitants like the Tree Grayling and <b>Tawny</b> <b>Pipit.</b> Most drift-sand vegetation and fauna need the presence of bare sand nearby and a certain level of erosion activity to survive. To preserve the drift-sand ecotype, it is therefore recommended to keep the area affected by erosion sufficiently large (process management). In the meantime one should also `maintain' or increase the wind force in the drift-sand area by suppressing the growth of high vegetation and removing trees, which form a wind barrier. In areas which are less suitable for reactivation, one could restore the mosaic vegetation by removing the vegetation on a limited scale (pattern management). More research is needed to develop a more balanced management strategy and to develop a management tool for the managers of inland drift sands. Also the role of the increased nitrogen deposition in the regeneration process needs further investigation in order to find an effective way to suppress its effect. The development of management strategies for the Dutch inland drift sands might be of great value to drift-sand areas in Western Europe where nature conservationists start to show more interest in the restoration of former drift-sand areas...|$|E
