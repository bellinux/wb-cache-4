5|$|As neither Lussin or {{the earlier}} Zara-class cruisers met the {{requirements}} of the Marinesektion, Vice Admiral Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck, who had replaced Pöck in November 1883, decided <b>that</b> <b>further</b> torpedo cruisers would be ordered from more experienced, foreign shipyards. The first of these new vessels, the , were ordered from the British firm Armstrong Whitworth in 1884.|$|E
5|$|British {{intelligence}} assessed that Tirpitz {{could be}} repaired within six months, and the Admiralty ordered further carrier-borne strikes against the battleship. First Sea Lord Andrew Cunningham {{did not believe}} that Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz, but he hoped <b>that</b> <b>further</b> attacks would increase the period the battleship was out of service and harm her crew's morale. The commander of the Home Fleet, Vice Admiral Bruce Fraser, initially resisted this order on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>further</b> carrier raids on Kaafjord were unlikely to be successful as Tirpitzs defences would have been reinforced and weather conditions were likely to be worse than those encountered during Operation Tungsten. Following an argument with Cunningham, Fraser eventually agreed to attack Kaafjord again. Despite the decision to make further attacks on Kaafjord, many of the Home Fleet's airmen were posted to other units following Operation Tungsten. This hindered subsequent operations against German forces in Norway as the new aircrew were less experienced than the men they replaced.|$|E

5|$|In February 1835, Ohio passed {{legislation}} {{that set up}} county governments in the Strip. The county in which Toledo sat would, later in 1835, be named after incumbent Governor Robert Lucas, a move <b>that</b> <b>further</b> exacerbated the growing tensions with Michigan. Also, during this period, Ohio attempted to use its power in Congress to revive a previously rejected boundary bill that would formally set the state border to be the Harris Line.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, Franciscan missionaries argued <b>that</b> <b>further</b> {{attempts}} at peaceful pacification of the Ch'ol were useless and argued for armed intervention against the Manche Ch'ol and their Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours. The Manche were forcibly relocated in the Guatemalan Highlands, {{where they did}} not prosper. By 1770, most of the Manche Ch'ol were extinct. The few survivors were soon absorbed into the surrounding Q'eqch'i Maya population.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1995, Paul Upchurch {{published}} {{a paper on}} early sauropods, finding Patagosaurus as a cetiosaurid again. He found that although earlier works had distinguished two groups, the shunosaurines and cetiosaurines, in the family, but that Shunosaurus and relatives were actually closer to Euhelopus, and cetiosaurines (Cetiosaurus, Patagosaurus and Amygdalodon) were the only true cetiosaurids. Upchurch noted however <b>that</b> <b>further</b> work on the group might reveal different conclusions.|$|E

After this was rejected, Goebbels decided <b>that</b> <b>further</b> efforts were futile.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} {{of resistance to}} batrachotoxins {{and the use of}} those toxins as chemical defences by several bird families have led to competing theories as to its evolutionary history.

5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the upper deck, but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised <b>that</b> <b>further</b> raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E
5|$|A {{second wave}} set off from Singapore at 16:15, {{consisting}} of seven Vildebeests and three Albacores of No. 36 Squadron and two Vildebeests of No. 100 Squadron. They arrived over Endau at 17:30, but their escort of seven Hurricanes and four Buffalos were late and the British biplanes were set upon by ten Ki-27s and two Ki-44s before their escorts could reach them. Five Vildebeests, two Albacores and one Hurricane were lost from this wave. Of the 72 aircrew from Nos. 36 and 100 Squadrons {{who participated in}} the raids, 27 were killed, seven were wounded and two were captured.
