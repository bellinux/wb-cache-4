5000|$|Because of the {{limitations}} on <b>tooling</b> <b>design</b> imposed {{by the fact that}} the workpiece mostly surrounds the tool, boring is inherently somewhat more challenging than turning, in terms of decreased toolholding rigidity, increased clearance angle requirements (limiting the amount of support that can be given to the cutting edge), and difficulty of inspection of the resulting surface (size, form, surface roughness). These are the reasons why boring is viewed as an area of machining practice in its own right, separate from turning, with its own tips, tricks, challenges, and body of expertise, despite the fact that they are in some ways identical.|$|E
50|$|Creo Elements/Pro {{can be used}} {{to create}} a {{complete}} 3D digital model of manufactured goods. The models consist of 2D and 3D solid model data which can also be used downstream in finite element analysis, rapid prototyping, <b>tooling</b> <b>design,</b> and CNC manufacturing. All data are associative and interchangeable between the CAD, CAE and CAM modules without conversion. A product and its entire bill of materials (BOM) can be modeled accurately with fully associative engineering drawings, and revision control information. The associativity functionality in Creo Elements/Pro enables users to make changes in the design {{at any time during the}} product development process and automatically update downstream deliverables. This capability enables concurrent engineering - design, analysis and manufacturing engineers working in parallel - and streamlines product development processes.|$|E
5000|$|Pro/ENGINEER was the industry's first {{rule-based}} constraint (sometimes called [...] "parametric" [...] or [...] "variational") 3D CAD modeling system.

This design approach is used by companies whose product strategy is family-based or platform-driven, where a prescriptive design strategy is fundamental {{to the success of}} the design process by embedding engineering constraints and relationships to quickly optimize the design, or where the resulting geometry may be complex or based upon equations. Creo Elements/Pro provides a complete set of design, analysis and manufacturing capabilities on one, integral, scalable platform.

5000|$|A British company, Safir Engineering, who {{continued}} to produce {{a limited number of}} GT40s (the MkV) in the 1980s under an agreement with Walter Hayes of Ford and John Wilment of J.W. Automotive Engineering, owned the GT40 trademark at that time, and when they completed production, they sold the excess parts, <b>tooling,</b> <b>design,</b> and trademark to a small American company called Safir GT40 Spares, Limited based in Ohio. Safir GT40 Spares licensed the use of the GT40 trademark to Ford for the initial 2002 show car, but when Ford decided to make the production vehicle, negotiations between the two failed, and as a result the new Ford GT does not wear the badge GT40. Bob Wood, one of three partners who own Safir GT40 Spares, said: [...] "When we talked with Ford, they asked what we wanted. We said that Ford owns Beanstalk in New York, the company that licenses the Blue Oval for Ford on such things as T-shirts. Since Beanstalk gets 7.5 percent of the retail cost of the item for licensing the name, we suggested 7.5 percent on each GT40 sold." [...] In this instance, Ford wished to purchase, not just license the GT40 trademark. At the then-estimated $125,000 per copy, 7.5% of 4,500 vehicles would have totalled approximately $42,187,500. It was widely and erroneously reported following an Automotive News Weekly story that Safir [...] "demanded" [...] the $40 million for the sale of the trademark. Discussions between Safir and Ford ensued. However, in fact, the Ford Motor Company never made an offer in writing to purchase the famed GT40 trademark. Later models or prototypes have also been called the Ford GT but have had different numbering on them such as the Ford GT90 or the Ford GT70. The GT40 name and trademark is currently licensed to Superformance in the USA.|$|E
40|$|Lean Manufacturing (LM) {{has been}} used in {{production}} processes to help manufacturing companies maintain competitive advantages for decades. However, with the increasingly fierce competition and pressure to sustain survival and long-term growth, enterprises cannot be satisfied with just improving the performance of a single process. Therefore, adoption of lean to the whole product development processes has become a necessity. There is evidence that lean thinking and some lean manufacturing tools are able to improve Product Development (PD) processes. Thus, terms of Lean Product Development (Lean PD) and Lean Product and Process Development (Lean PPD) are becoming popular in engineering fields. In this project, the research aimed to improve the <b>tooling</b> <b>design</b> situation in Chinese aerospace by implementing lean techniques to the design process. Tooling is an indispensible part of aircraft manufacturing and assembly. The quality and development time can influence aircraft quality and delivery time. However, there is little research about the lean techniques implementation based on aircraft <b>tooling</b> <b>design</b> characteristics and there are few lean frameworks for aircraft <b>tooling</b> <b>design</b> process. Therefore, this research will be conducted to fill this gap. The research comprised four phases. In the first phase, a comprehensive literature review about lean (lean thinking and lean manufacturing), Lean PD and Lean PPD, <b>tooling</b> <b>design,</b> lean models/frameworks and the relationship between lean and organisational culture was conducted. In the second phase, data and information from three Chinese aircraft manufacturing companies (Company A, B and C) and literature were collected and analysed, aiming to discover the current lean implementation status in <b>tooling</b> <b>design</b> process and find improvement opportunities. In the third stage, a lean framework for <b>tooling</b> <b>design</b> process was synthesised. Finally, the proposed framework was validated by academic and industry experts. Finally, the research can contribute to companies which need a lean transformation. Moreover, the lean framework also {{could be used as a}} reference for research in lean and <b>tooling</b> <b>design</b> field...|$|E
