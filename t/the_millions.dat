5|$|Amman is the 4th most visited Arab {{city and}} the ninth highest {{recipient}} of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8 million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3 billion in the city.

5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} imagery, the {{asteroid}} belt is mostly empty.

Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100km, and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that {{the asteroid belt}} has 0.7–1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1km or more. The apparent magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are 11–19, with the median at about 16.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the war, veterans, the {{bereaved}} {{and the rest of}} society focused, to the point of obsession, with the problem of death. There was tremendous interest in creating war memorials that celebrated the themes of glory, heroism and loss. In part, there was a rupture or dislocation with the pre-war norms of how memorials should look and feel; communities sought to find new, radical ways to mourn <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> of dead, killed in an essentially modern conflict. In other ways, the building of memorials drew on traditional forms and ideas, drawing on existing religious and architectural themes to explore loss and grief.|$|E

5|$|Large fruitings of {{the fungus}} are often {{associated}} with damage to the host tree, such as that which occurs with burning. A field study conducted in Norway demonstrated that fruit bodies {{were more likely to}} be found in areas that were heavily burned, compared to locations with light to moderate burning where the trees remained viable, or in clearcut areas. Fruiting was much denser in spruce forests—with up to 700–1000 fruitbodies per square meter—than in pine forests, where fruitbodies were sporadic. Fruitbodies grew by <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> in the year following the Yellowstone fires of 1988.|$|E
5|$|Nutria were {{introduced}} into coastal marshes from South America in the mid-1900s, and their population has since exploded into <b>the</b> <b>millions.</b> They cause serious damage to coastal marshes and may dig burrows in levees. Hence, Louisiana {{has had a}} bounty to try to reduce nutria numbers. Large American alligators, however, feed heavily on nutria, so American alligators may not only control nutria populations in Louisiana, but also prevent them spreading east into the Everglades. Since hunting and trapping preferentially take the large American alligators that {{are the most important}} in eating nutria, some changes in harvesting may be needed to capitalize on their ability to control nutria.|$|E

5|$|Phil England {{writes in}} The Ecologist that the {{strength}} of the book is the rigour of the research and the detailed focus on key incidents.

England also said that there is little coverage about <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> of dollars which Exxon Mobil has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting climate change denial and doubt.|$|E
