She {{continued}} recording, but made no more films, moving more towards light classical music as popular tastes changed, often adopting a religious theme. She {{continued into the}} new medium of LP records, and recorded new takes of her old favourite songs, {{as well as new}} and recent tracks to 'liven <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> bit'.|$|E
500|$|Rumors that Slipknot {{would be}} {{recording}} and touring All Hope Is Gone without their trademark masks circulated after band members appeared unmasked during performances with various side-projects. However, Shawn Crahan dismissed these rumors {{in an interview}} on The Sauce. Bassist Paul Gray elaborated that the band would return with a new image; [...] "It'll still be Slipknot," [...] he stated, [...] "but we're gonna upgrade, step <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> little." [...] Beginning April 1, 2008, Slipknot's website displayed ten teasers to promote All Hope Is Gone. The first nine displayed the band in their purgatory masks, however, the final teaser featured a darkened photograph of the band with their new masks. Slipknot premiered their new masks on July 1, 2008 on Spinner.com; eight million people visited the website to view the masks on the first day.|$|E
500|$|Biance Gracie from Idolator gave a {{positive}} review to the performance, saying that [...] "Instead of doing her usual bit of either singing 'Living for Love' or the current single 'Ghosttown', the entertainer decided to switch <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> bit—and we're so glad [...] did! Madge did {{a wild and}} super-fun version of 'Bitch I'm Madonna'." [...] The Hollywood Reporter listed the performance {{as one of the}} top five shocking moments by Madonna in 2015. Stereogums Caitlin White was amazed by Madonna's performance, saying that [...] "the fact that she can dance like... this at 56 is practically a superhuman feat, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the performance." [...] Bradley Stern also wrote a similar review for MuuMuse, describing the performance as [...] "one of the most all-out insane television performances of the entire Rebel Heart era... This was no basic stage performance: Instead, Madonna brought her noisy, bratty and utterly #Unapologetic banger to life." ...|$|E

5000|$|Critics {{noted that}} Didion's {{distinct}} literary voice, highlighted by John Leonard's introduction, is apparent throughout the collection. The Chicago Tribune review stated [...] "even the slightest her work tends {{to have at}} least a moment when her prose somehow modulates ... transfigures ... kicks the whole <b>thing</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> level." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have found}} it {{necessary}} to touch the <b>thing</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> little here and there, for writers in those days were weak in construction. Their idea of telling a story was to take a long breath and start droning away without any stops or dialogue till the thing was over.|$|R
500|$|Anime News Network's Casey Brienza {{stressed}} Mello's {{presence as}} a narrator {{in the light}} novel [...] "makes things a bit too breathless in places and a bit too self-conscious in others". A. E. Sparrow from IGN praised how the introduction of Mello, [...] "a man of action", [...] "spiced <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> bit" [...] as he brought [...] "actually" [...] action to the series. Manga News said Mello is [...] "an interesting character" [...] as he is [...] "unpredictable" [...] and also praised the action scenes he brings. As such, they criticized his almost total absence in volume 10 as he is [...] "one of the few to bring some new blood to the series". After Mello's death, Pepirium wrote [...] "Mello deserved more." [...] On the other hand, Mello is [...] "an unhinged character that only offers unpredictability", according to Chris Beveridge of Mania.com. AnimeLand and Manga News presented opposite opinions if whether or not Mello is charismatic character, with the former declaring he does not replace L as he lacks charisma.|$|E
500|$|Badler had {{a four-month}} guest {{contract}} with the show and she began filming her first scenes in April which were due to air in June 2010. Badler admitted that filming her first scenes were hard and she [...] "could not get it together". She said [...] "I noticed {{a few of the}} other new people. They all went through the same thing, where you have a day where you just go, 'Wow, I can't seem to function!'". Badler also said that occasionally there were no rehearsals and that it was [...] "very daunting" [...] and challenging. She added that the cast were [...] "really nice" [...] and that she got used to the quick pace of filming. Badler's debut episode aired on 22 June 2010. When Badler was asked if the door would be left open for Diana to return, she said [...] "Oh yes, absolutely. I was contracted for four months and the way that it ended is very {{up in the air and}} I'm sure that they will use me whenever they need to shake <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> bit, you know".|$|E
500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|Eva Simpson and Caroline Hedley of the Daily Mirror {{said that}} the group [...] "put on {{one hell of a}} show." [...] James McNair of The Independent gave the gig a five star rating, saying: [...] "The superb new single 'Rock Steady' shifts <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> gear, All Saints nailing their dancehall {{influences}} to the mast and engaging in some neat, microphone-swapping choreography. [...] Watch out, Pussycat Dolls." ...|$|E
2500|$|The PC {{release of}} the game {{received}} similar praise as the 360 version, with reviewers noting various {{differences between the two}} versions. IGN commented that [...] "The mouse and keyboard allow for more precise control, and the graphics have been improved as well;" [...] however, 1UP stated that [...] "the control scheme's a very central obstacle" [...] to the game. GameSpot noted that the additional chapter felt out of place as [...] "it changes <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> bit in ways that betray the difficulty progression of the game." [...] Hypers Cam Shea commends the game for its [...] "visual, solid gameplay, killer multiplayer and reload mechanics". However, he criticised it for [...] "potential frustration, pointless squad commands and chainsaw mechanics".|$|E
2500|$|Originally, the {{character}} appeared in an unpublished comic book titled Travis. Murray tried selling {{the comic book}} in the late 1980s, between illustrating jobs, and did not find success in getting it into production. Many other characters appeared in various sketchbooks. He described the early 1990s animation atmosphere as [...] "ripe {{for this kind of}} project. We took some chances that would be hard to do in these current times (the 1990s)". Murray wanted funding for his independent film My Dog Zero, so he wanted Nickelodeon to pre-buy television rights for the series. He presented a pencil test to Nickelodeon, which afterward became interested in buying and financing the show. Murray had never worked in television before. The industry was coming out of a [...] "rough period" [...] and Murray wanted to [...] "shake <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> bit".|$|E
