25|$|Under the <b>Torrens</b> <b>title</b> {{system of}} land {{ownership}} registration, easements and mortgages are recorded on the titles {{kept in the}} central land registry or cadastre. Any unrecorded easement is not recognised and no easement by prescription or implication may be claimed. However, in Australia, easements may be created by prescription or implication and enforced if an exception to indefeasibility is established, but they cannot be recorded on the title.|$|E
25|$|Some {{other states}} were also divided into land {{divisions}} and land districts; {{in the nineteenth}} century land districts sometimes served as the region name for parts of the state where counties had not been proclaimed yet. Below these are groups of land parcels known as deposited plans, registered plans or title plans (depending on the state). Queensland has registered plans; New South Wales and Western Australia have deposited plans; while Victoria has certified plans. Land can be identified using the number of this plan of subdivision held with the lands department, rather than with a named unit such as a parish (or both can be used); it is becoming increasingly common to use only the plan number. Within these are individual land parcels such as lots; in total there are estimated to be about 10.2 million of these in Australia. The various cadastral units appear on certificates of title, which are given volume and folio numbers; these numbers by themselves are sometimes used to identify land parcels, or in combination with the other units. Detailed maps of these divisions have been required since the introduction of the <b>Torrens</b> <b>title</b> system of a central register of land holdings in South Australia in 1858, which spread to the other colonies. While cadastral data since the 1980s has been digitalised, there remain many old maps showing these divisions held in collections of Australian libraries such as the National Library of Australia, as well as in state libraries.|$|E

2500|$|At least 20 U.S. {{states have}} experimented with <b>Torrens</b> <b>title</b> or other title {{registration}} systems {{at one time}} or another, but most have retreated to title recording under pressure from title insurers or from lack of interest. [...] According to Karl Llewellyn, one <b>Torrens</b> <b>title</b> on one lot in New York City can render the entire block unavailable for large-scale improvement (i.e., skyscrapers); no lender will finance the purchase of such a lot because no New York title insurer will guarantee a <b>Torrens</b> <b>title.</b> The U.S. title insurance industry has successfully opposed land registration systems by saying that they are vulnerable to fraud (a severe problem in most land registration jurisdictions) and that an inherently contingent property system more effectively protects property rights. While it is possible to fortify land registration systems to prevent the registration of forged deeds, the necessary countermeasures are complex and expensive. [...] A 2007 book attacking the American title insurance [...] "cartel" [...] stated that [...] "ore extensive use of Torrens certification would require setting up a special judicially supervised bureaucracy." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{traditional}} English common law, it was {{not possible}} to obtain title to property of the Crown by means of adverse possession. [...] This principle was embodied by the Latin maxim nullum tempus occurrit regi ("no time runs against the king"). [...] In the United States, this privilege was carried over to the federal and state governments; government land is immune from loss by adverse possession. [...] Land with registered title in some <b>Torrens</b> <b>title</b> systems is also immune, for example, land that has been registered in the Hawaii Land Court system.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the industrialized}} world uses land {{registration}} systems for the transfer of land titles or interests in them. Under these systems, the government determines title ownership and encumbrances using its land registration; {{with only a few}} exceptions, the government's determination is conclusive. Governmental errors lead to monetary compensation to the person damaged by the error but that aggrieved party usually cannot recover the property. [...] The <b>Torrens</b> <b>title</b> system is the basis for land registration systems in several common law countries. [...] Nineteen jurisdictions in the United States, such as Minnesota and Massachusetts, adopted a form of this system between 1896 and 1917, however it fell out of favor after single judgement in Imperial County, CA, bankrupted the state's title indemnification fund, {{and the vast majority of}} U.S. states have opted for a system of document recording in which no governmental official makes any determination of who owns the title or whether the instruments transferring it are valid.|$|E

50|$|In Australia, a {{semi-detached house}} is a {{different}} form of real property title from a townhouse. A semi-detached home is generally held as a <b>Torrens</b> <b>Titled</b> property, whilst a town{{house is a}} Strata Titled unit. A semi-detached house sits on a single property, owned in its entirety by {{the owner of the}} semi-detached house; a townhouse has a strata title or more recently known as a community title in South Australia. Semi-detached houses come only in pairs, whereas townhouses may number more than two, attached together.

50|$|Ireland {{first began}} to operate a <b>Torrens</b> <b>Title</b> system in 1892. So-called {{registered}} land (i.e. land held under a <b>Torrens</b> <b>title)</b> is recorded in the Republic of Ireland using a system of numbered county-level folios. The land registry is operated by the Property Registration Authority, a government agency, and records both freehold and leasehold titles, along with easements/profits-a-prendre, mortgages, and any other charges over land. It is compulsory to create a folio in the land registry if land is sold/transferred/subdivided, multi-storey buildings are erected, or a new lease (over five years) is created. The vast majority of land in Ireland (by acreage) is held under <b>Torrens</b> <b>title</b> as compulsory registration in the land registry upon sale has been a requirement in rural areas for many years. Compulsory registration was extended to the (more urban) counties of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford in the last decade, thus extending mandatory <b>Torrens</b> <b>title</b> to {{every part of the}} Republic of Ireland.|$|E

40|$|Systems for {{recording}} interests in land {{are not the}} subject of much public interest or concern in Canada. Occasionally a sympathetic victim of egregious fraud receives some media attention, but generally the land system operates quietly in the background. This has not always been so, and Greg Taylor 2 ̆ 7 s history of <b>Torrens</b> or <b>title</b> registration in Canada reveals a nineteenth century during which the merits and limitations of the common law, deeds registration, and title registration systems were vigorously and publicly debated. Eventually, title registration based on a model first developed in South Australia would prevail in the provinces and territories from British Columbia to Ontario. The civil law jurisdiction of Quebec remains an outlier, and the conversion of the Maritime Provinces to title registration is occurring unevenly, but otherwise Canada, unlike its neighbour to the south which opted for deeds registration systems and title insurance, is a collection of title registration jurisdictions. Taylor’s book, {{one of only a handful}} of single-authored national legal histories in Canada, reveals how this came to be so...|$|R
40|$|Beginning {{with some}} {{reflections}} on the audit-driven nature of contemporary academe, this chapter aims to explore forms of marginalisation and exclusion that modern methods of evaluation both produce and obscure. Here, I explore concepts of value and methods of evaluation that were utilised to create property interests in land and life insurance in the mid- to late nineteenth-century {{in the context of}} the British Empire. The <b>Torrens</b> system of <b>title</b> by registration, and the creation of the first state-wide system of registration for life insurance policies by Elizur Wright both emerge in 1858. While the commodification of land and life may seem to bear no relation to one another, I argue that they share a conceptual logic. While commodity-visions of land and life appear to be disaggregated by the 19 th century, the methods of valuation employed in the propertisation of land and life both rely on techniques of valuation rooted in a turn to ‘scientific’ methods, and furthermore, reflect a racialist humanism that persists in producing and valuing whiteness over the lives of people of colour...|$|R

The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe the Australian Cadastral System with an emphasis on cadastral surveying and mapping and the role of the professional land surveyor. First an overview of the Australian land market is presented, followed by a discussion of the difference between European cadastres and cadastral systems developed under English Common Law. Next the historical development and current status of both the <b>Torrens</b> System of <b>title</b> registration and the cadastral surveying system is given. The trend for Australian cadastral systems to move from cadastral surveying of individual parcels to an integrated cadastral mapping system is highlighted together with the development of the associated digital cadastral databases. The paper describes the professional qualifications required of a land surveyor as well as the institutions supporting the survey system. The relationship of the cadastral system to the development of state-wide land information systems is discussed. The paper concludes by highlighting future trends in the Australian cadastral system. 1 July 1994 Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the land administration and management (LAM) issues on CARP and determine the necessary institutional reforms on LAM in view of CARP expiration in 2008. The paper discussed the adverse effects brought about by weak land policy and poor land administration on attaining the objectives of CARP. The poor land records, the lack of information sharing among government land agencies, the tedious land titling and registration process, the unclear land policies have resulted not only in prolonged implementation of the program but also flawed land redistribution and incomplete transfers of property rights. These outcomes evolved second-generation issues as “unperfected” titles are traded despite the restrictions imposed by the land reform law. The current LAM in the country showed that the system cannot handle the land transactions that evolve and continue to evolve from hundreds and thousands of transactions involving CARP awarded lands. There is a need to restore not only the confidence on <b>Torrens</b> system of <b>titling</b> on agriculture lands but also to restore the functioning of the rural land market. This is a key challenge on LAM since it would require reconciling information from key land agencies and including that of the Land Bank. It will also require legislative actions on land market regulations, land use policy and land administration in the country. land reform, land ownership and tenure, land...|$|R
