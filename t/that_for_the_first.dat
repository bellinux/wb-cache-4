5|$|During {{the late}} summer of 1855, Gray made his third trip to Europe. This was an {{emergency}} trip to bring home his ill brother-in-law from Paris. Gray spent only three weeks in London and Paris, {{and on the way}} back he read the newly published Géographie botanique raisonnée by Alphonse deCandolle. This was a ground-breaking book <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time brought together the large mass of data being collected by the expeditions of the time. The natural sciences had become highly specialized, yet this book synthesized them to explain living organisms within their environment and why plants were distributed the way they were, all upon a geologic scale. Gray instantly saw that this brought taxonomic botany into focus.|$|E

5|$|One {{point of}} {{concern has been}} the {{standard}} of radiation emission from 10,000 years to 1,000,000 years into the future. On August 9, 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed a limit of 350millirem per year for that period. In October 2007, the DOE issued {{a draft of the}} Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement in which it shows <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> 10,000years mean public dose would be 0.24mrem/year and that thereafter to 1,000,000 years the median public dose would be 0.98mrem/year, both of which are substantially below the proposed EPA limit. For comparison, a hip x-ray results in a dose around 83 mrem and a CT head or chest scan results in around 1,110 mrem. Annually, in the United States, an individual's doses from background radiation is about 350 mrem, although some places get more than twice that.|$|E

40|$|Abstract : This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to provide support}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> prediction <b>that</b> familiarity of words in contexts affects the degree of hyper/hypo-articulation of vowels in these words. Results from the present analysis show that the repetition of words in a story causes hypoarticulation of vowels in these words. Among the eight types of vowels whose F 1 and F 2 values are measured, two types of vowels in words <b>that</b> come <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second time in a context show hypoarticulation to a much higher degree than those in words <b>that</b> come <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time. One type of vowel in <b>the</b> words <b>that</b> come <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second time shows more partial hypoarticulation than that in <b>the</b> words <b>that</b> come <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time. Three types of vowels show almost the same F 1 and F 2 values in both cases. A vowel space with four corner vowels in <b>the</b> words <b>that</b> come <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second time is smaller than that in words <b>that</b> come <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, which also indicates a tendency toward hypoarticulation for vowels in words repeated after their first introduction. 　　Keywords: formant, hypoarticulation, repetition, space, vowe...|$|R

5|$|Victoria settled an annuity on Louise {{shortly before}} her marriage. The {{ceremony}} {{was conducted at}} St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on 21 March 1871, and the crowd outside was so large <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, policemen had to form chain barriers to keep control. Louise wore a wedding veil of Honiton lace that she designed herself, and was escorted into the Chapel by her mother, and her two eldest brothers, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh. On this occasion, the usually severe black of the Queen's mourning dress was relieved by the crimson rubies and blues of the Garter star. Following the ceremony, the Queen kissed Louise, and Lorne – {{now a member of}} the royal family, but still a subject – kissed the Queen's hand.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{establishment}} of the boards of commissioners in Hanley and Burslem, no further changes occurred until the 1830s when passing of the Reform Act 1832 (2 & 3 Will. IV. c.45) sparked renewed interest in incorporation. The act created the parliamentary borough of Stoke-upon-Trent, which would elect two members to Parliament. Together with Stoke-upon-Trent itself, the parliamentary borough also comprised Hanley, Shelton, Lane End, Fenton, Burslem, Tunstall, Rushton Grange, and the hamlet of Sneyd. The significance of the act was <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time and for one important reason only, through the election of Members of Parliament, the townships of the Potteries effectively became one. Shortly after the Reform Act came into effect, a Municipal Corporations Bill was introduced which proposed that the new parliamentary boroughs should be granted charters of incorporation. The bill failed with the prorogation of that Parliament, while the Potteries were excluded from the reforms of the later Municipal Corporations Act 1835 (5 & 6 Wm. IV. c.76). Interest in incorporation was sufficient for several meetings on the subject to take place; the Staffordshire Advertiser reported after one meeting in Burslem that incorporation would lead to one town having undue influence over the others, a theme that was to recur for many years. The same meeting revisited a topic raised pre–1820, the promotion of law and order in the Potteries, and called for the appointment of a stipendiary magistrate.|$|E

Smooth continued to increase its audience share in the second quarter of 2011, with an average weekly total of 3.2 million, which rose once again in the third quarter to 3.328 million, meaning <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time Smooth's figures overtook those of one of its national rivals, talkSPORT.

The third quarter of 2012 saw another small drop to 3.19 million, but in the same period Smooth 70s recorded its first audience figures of 749,000. Collectively 3.7 million listeners were tuning into Smooth-branded stations. That figure rose to 3.8 million in the final quarter of the year. The first quarter of 2013 saw an average weekly audience of 3.6 million, which fell to 3.1 million for the second quarter.

5|$|The aquatics {{events at}} the 2015 Pan American Games were {{scheduled}} to be held roughly {{around the same time}} as the 2015 World Aquatics Championships scheduled in Kazan, Russia. In order to maintain the quality of its fields, the schedule of the five aquatics disciplines had to be changed to accommodate athletes. The synchronized swimming competition was moved to the day before the opening ceremony, diving events began on the day of the opening ceremony (when events are traditionally not held on the day of the ceremony), open water swimming was moved to the first weekend of the games, swimming was reduced to a five-day schedule (down from seven in 2011), and water polo competitions began three days before the opening ceremony. All events were scheduled to be completed by July 24, six days before the opening ceremonies of the World Championships, which in itself was moved back a week to accommodate the games. The change in schedule meant <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, events were held before the opening ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The {{recruitment}} shortfall {{caused by}} the crisis seems to have led to recruitment of barbarians to the auxilia on a much greater scale than previously. By the 4th century, {{it has been estimated}} that some 25% of regular army recruits were barbarian-born. In the elite palatini regiments anywhere between a third and a half of recruits may have been barbarian. This is likely a much greater proportion of foreigners than joined the auxilia in the 1st and 2nd centuries. In the 3rd century, a small number of regular auxiliary units appear in the record <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, bear the names of barbarian tribes from outside the empire e.g. the ala I Sarmatarum attested in 3rd-century Britain. This was probably an offshoot of the 5,500 surrendered Sarmatian horsemen posted on Hadrian's Wall by emperor Marcus Aurelius in c. 175. This unit may be an early example of a novel process whereby irregular units of barbari (foederati) were transformed into regular auxilia. This process intensified in the 4th century: the Notitia Dignitatum, a key document on the late Roman army, lists a large number of regular units with barbarian names.|$|E
