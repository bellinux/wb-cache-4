5|$|The Mysore Zoo, {{established}} in 1892, the Karanji, Kukkarahalli and the Blue Lagoon Lake are popular recreational destinations. Blue Lagoon {{which is a}} lake with a mini island is located behind KRS water Dam {{and it is very}} mesmerising to be <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> the sunset and sunrise. The colour of the water and the sky is Blue and there is a mini island in the middle due to which it was named as Blue Lagoon. Mysuru has the Regional Museum of Natural History, the Folk Lore Museum, the Railway Museum and the Oriental Research Institute. The city is a centre for yoga-related health tourism that attracts domestic and foreign visitors, particularly those who, for years, came to study with the late ashtanga yoga guru K. Pattabhi Jois.|$|E
500|$|Leonard Nimoy as Kashekim Nedakh, the King of Atlantis and Kida's father. Michael Cedeno, supervising {{animator}} for King Nedakh, {{was astounded}} at Nimoy's voice talent, stating {{that he had}} [...] "so much rich character" [...] in his performance. As he spoke his lines, Cadeno said the crew would sit <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> Nimoy in astonishment.|$|E
500|$|Greil Marcus {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} disregarding one's initial reading of the song. [...] "The first impression is that Bob Dylan is setting up the usual private scene: 'I'll sit here and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything James Taylor has ever written". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is {{coming to terms with}} unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because [...] "the time has passed when people are interested in hearing Bob Dylan say he'll just sit <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> the river flow... even though that's not quite what he's saying". For Marcus, [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is a compelling work, but the subtlety of the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience.|$|E

60|$|We sat <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> Dick <b>and</b> Aunt Tommy for an hour. I {{thought they}} were awfully prim and stiff. If I'd been Dick I'd have gone over and hugged her. I said so to Jill and Jill was shocked. She said it wouldn't be proper when they weren't even engaged.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, Aynesworth {{covered the}} siege of the Branch Davidian {{compound}} in Waco, Texas, once referring to it as [...] "the Branch Davidian massacre". Commenting on the event in an interview, he said: [...] "I couldn’t believe I stood <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> people burn in that. I couldn’t believe what was happening.” ...|$|R
500|$|A {{writer for}} Rap-Up {{considered}} the video realistic, as [...] "art imitates life". Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic {{called it an}} inaccurate portrayal of domestic violence due to insufficient violence, {{as evidenced by the}} lack of injuries after punching through a wall. Mariel Concepcion of Billboard suggested the video was inspired by the lyric, [...] "Just gonna stand <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> me burn, but that's alright because I like the way it hurts." [...] Rihanna's appearance was criticized. Writing for Rolling Stone magazine, Daniel Kreps called it [...] "especially striking" [...] and noted her relationship with Brown. An editor from The Boston Globe commented that although the video is realistic, it hinders Rihanna's ability to set an example for women in abusive relationships. Billy Johnson Jr. from Yahoo! Music wrote that Fox's character alternated between vulnerable and confrontational personalities, while Monaghan's character is similar to Eminem. Kahn, who understood why viewers thought Eminem's and Rihanna's relationships influenced the video, asked that they realize this is untrue. He said the team had been conscious of such personal matters and Fox's and Monaghan's characters are only significant to each other.|$|E
2500|$|Before Fapla, every cricket {{tournament in}} Dhangadhi was played in Dhangadi Rangashala. But the Rangashala was {{built into a}} {{football}} stadium for 6th national games. [...] So cricket in Dhangadhi was shifted to Zonal Police Ground. Zonal Police Ground is {{in the heart of}} Dhangadhi] and although was easier for the spectators to come <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> the game but the ground, being [...] in police territory-the permission to host tournaments did not come easy.|$|E
2500|$|Spitz felt snubbed by {{not being}} asked to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics to watch Michael Phelps attempt to break his seven gold medal record. [...] In an article, he is quoted as saying, [...] "I never got invited. [...] You don't go to the Olympics just to say, I am going to go. Especially because of who I am[...] [...] [...] [...] I am going to sit <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> Michael Phelps break my record anonymously? [...] That's almost demeaning to me. [...] It is not almost—it is." ...|$|E
5000|$|Taura {{syndrome}} {{can spread}} rapidly when introduced in new areas. A shrimp farmer described the 1995 outbreak in Texas as, [...] "This thing spread like a forest fire...

5000|$|The group {{recorded}} many {{of their}} songs at the Sugar Hill Records (formerly All Platinum) studio in Englewood, which was gutted by a fire in 2002 that destroyed many of the master tapes of their recordings. Goodman said the fire cost him $500,000 saying [...] "I just stood <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> 30 or 40 {{years of my life}} go by".|$|R
2500|$|Scates {{was highly}} {{competitive}} {{both as a}} player and a coach, and he designed his practices to underscore competition and intensity. Practices moved at a high pace, with high repetitions and little time between drills. [...] "I ran shorter drills and quicker, and I didn’t stop the drills to explain things very much. I just tried to coach and keep things going at the same time." [...] John Wooden was a major influence on Scates and eventually a lifelong friend. [...] "I used to sit up <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> him when we weren’t practicing. I learned a lot from that. I liked how he changed drills very quickly. He didn’t have any down time. And then I read a book he wrote in 1965 called 'Practical Modern Basketball.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Chorvinsky, {{editor of}} Strange magazine, {{promoted}} Wallace's {{claim that he}} tipped off Patterson exactly {{where to look for}} a Bigfoot. Chorvinsky wrote, [...] "'Roger Patterson came [...] dozens of times pumping me on this Bigfoot,' Ray Wallace explained to researcher Dennis Pilchis in 1982. 'I felt sorry for Roger Patterson. He told me he had cancer of the lymph glands and he was desperately broke and he wanted to try to get something where he could have a little income. Well, he went down there exactly where I told him. I told him, 'You go down there and hang around on that bank. Stay up <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> that spot.'" [...] David Daegling summarized Chorvinsky's argument and concluded that Wallace [...] "had a degree of involvement" [...] with the Patterson–Gimlin film, and that this gave grounds for suspicion of it.|$|E
2500|$|The deferent-and-epicycle model {{had been}} used by Greek astronomers for centuries along {{with the idea of}} the {{eccentric}} (a deferent which is slightly off-center from the Earth), which was even older. In the illustration, the center of the deferent is not the Earth but the spot marked X, making it eccentric (from the Greek ἐκ ec- meaning [...] "from," [...] and κέντρον kentron meaning [...] "center"), from which the spot takes its name. Unfortunately, the system that was available in Ptolemy's time did not quite match observations, even though it was considerably improved over Hipparchus' system. Most noticeably the size of a planet's retrograde loop (especially that of Mars) would be smaller, and sometimes larger, than expected, resulting in positional errors of as much as 30 degrees. To alleviate the problem, Ptolemy developed the equant. The equant was a point near the center of a planet's orbit which, if you were to stand <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch,</b> the center of the planet's epicycle would always appear to move at uniform speed; all other locations would see non-uniform speed, like on the Earth. By using an equant, Ptolemy claimed to keep motion which was uniform and circular, although it departed from the Platonic ideal of uniform circular motion. [...] The resultant system, which eventually came to be widely accepted in the west, seems unwieldy to modern astronomers; each planet required an epicycle revolving on a deferent, offset by an equant which was different for each planet. It predicted various celestial motions, including {{the beginning and end of}} retrograde motion, to within a maximum error of 10 degrees, considerably better than without the equant.|$|E

60|$|The {{professor}} followed him--they stood <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> her depart with Annie Legarde. The {{two girls}} {{got into a}} taxicab together, and Tavernake {{breathed a sigh of}} relief, a relief for which he was wholly unable to account, when he saw that Grier made no effort to follow them. As soon as the taxi had rolled away, they descended and passed into the street. Then the professor suddenly changed his tone.|$|R
60|$|He waved us away, himself {{taking a}} seat at the table. I led Eve to a divan at the farther corner of the room. We sat <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> the people. <b>There</b> were many whose faces I knew--a {{sprinkling}} of stock-brokers, one or two actresses, and half a dozen or so men about town of a dubious type. On the whole the company was scarcely reputable. I looked at Eve and sighed.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well! You can't {{get down}} the main track to the coast, because the police will reckon on your going <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> the stations. I'd make for the plains and then shove south for Montana." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{supervisor}} in another building 300 yards away heard the fire alarm and walked outside. He {{had served in}} Vietnam, but said the explosion was worse than anything encountered in his war experience: [...] "I watched B-52s drop 500-pound bombs. This is the biggest explosion I ever saw and I saw some pretty good-sized ones. When it blew, the explosion kept rolling out, rolling out. We sat <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> the ball of fire coming toward us." ...|$|R
60|$|In a way, if {{you shut}} {{your eyes to}} the white tiles and the {{thermometer}} and the brass knobs and the shower-bath, it was a peaceful scene; and Steve, as he sat <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> Mamie sew, was stirred by it. Remove the white tiles, the thermometer the brass knobs, and the shower-bath, and this was precisely the sort of scene his imagination conjured up when the business of life slackened sufficiently {{to allow him to}} dream dreams.|$|R
50|$|When all is clear, the Mayor sneaks in, {{calling for}} Hanna; from the side, Levko notices {{that someone is}} <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>watches.</b> The Mayor, who has his eyes on marrying Hanna, tries to impress her with his oft-repeated story about being a guide for Catherine the Great, but Hanna rebuffs him, sends him off, and goes inside.

25|$|One {{death was}} reported. Protestor Baharuddin Ahmad accidentally inhaled tear gas fired by police. He was later arrested, {{but when he}} started to black out police didn't do {{anything}} <b>and</b> just stood <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watched.</b> He was restrained by handcuffs which made the matters worse and he wasn't released because police lost the keys. After 15 minutes, an ambulance was called but never arrived. Finally, a volunteer took Baharuddin to a nearby hospital but it was already too late. Police said he died of heart complications.|$|R
60|$|Gibbering and cursing, M. de Rivarol stood <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> this action, so presumptuously {{undertaken}} by Blood {{on his own}} responsibility.

60|$|My dear lady, I couldn't stand it.

He had just the look of a hunted beast, and his face was grey with terror.|$|E

60|$|This {{author was}} the first to stretch his legs before Erlcort's fire from his seat on one of the reproductions.
