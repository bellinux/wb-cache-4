500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} was {{described}} by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", where Carey remembers both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. [...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept me alive / I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes / And its more than saying 'I miss you' / But I'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it, you never let it show". Then, the pre-chorus continues describing Carey's emotions in the present, [...] "And everyday life goes on / I wish I could talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while", and how the loss of her father still affects her day-to-day life.|$|E
2500|$|The next verse, [...] "And I {{will bring}} you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; I will give it <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> possession. I am the Lord." [...] (...) was not {{fulfilled}} until the generation following the Passover story, and the rabbis could not decide whether this verse counted {{as part of the}} Passover celebration (thus deserving of another serving of wine). Thus, a cup was left for the arrival of Elijah.|$|E
2500|$|However, the Fu Zi gave a {{completely}} different account of Guo's advice to Cao Cao {{on how to handle}} Liu Bei. Guo Jia told Cao Cao, [...] "Liu Bei has great ambitions and has won the hearts of many people. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu are formidable fighters and they have pledged to serve him with their lives. From what I observe, Liu Bei will never truly submit to anyone, and his intentions are unclear. The people in the past once said, 'If you let the enemy off today, they will become a threat <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time.' You should settle (Liu Bei) soon." [...] At the time, Cao Cao was using Emperor Xian as a figurehead to command respect and had attracted many heroes to serve under him so he did not heed Guo Jia's advice. When Cao Cao later sent Liu Bei with an army to attack Yuan Shu, Guo Jia and Cheng Yu warned Cao, [...] "Liu Bei will rebel if you let him go!" [...] By then, Liu Bei had already left and he really did rebel against Cao Cao as he later seized control of Xu Province from Che Zhou, the provincial governor appointed by Cao Cao. Cao Cao regretted not following Guo Jia's advice.|$|E
