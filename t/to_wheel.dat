5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was a Stretcher match between Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam, {{in which the}} object is to place your {{opponent}} on a stretcher and wheel the stretcher across a finish line. The match went back and forth before Van Dam attempted to perform a Somersault Plancha onto Orton, but Orton moved out of the way. Orton put Van Dam on the stretcher and tried <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> him across the finishing line. Van Dam, however, managed to kick Orton in the head and put him onto the stretcher. Van Dam wheeled the stretcher over the line for the win. After the match, Orton attacked Van Dam, executing an Elevated DDT off the barricade onto the arena floor. Van Dam was then carried out of the arena on the stretcher.|$|E
25|$|Lacking proper maps, {{the leading}} British column became lost. Seizing the opportunity, the Ottoman units began <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> around from a north-south {{orientation}} to an east-west, {{to face the}} British flanking manoeuvre. The resulting frontal attack by the 28th Brigade was repulsed with heavy casualties.|$|E
25|$|In {{a vehicle}} format, propane autogas can be {{retrofitted}} {{to almost any}} engine and provide fuel cost savings and lowered emissions while being more efficient as an overall system due to the large, pre-existing propane fueling infrastructure that does not require compressors and the resultant waste of other alternative fuels in well <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> lifecycles.|$|E

Compared <b>to</b> <b>wheeled</b> vehicles, half-tracks {{are more difficult to}} maintain, they often suffer track breakages, and are slower on roads. However, they have better off-road mobility compared <b>to</b> <b>wheeled</b> vehicles.|$|R

25|$|Pit bikes {{also have}} their own {{separate}} competitions held with classes generally corresponding <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> size. This is a notable difference from Motocross and Supercross competition, where classes are separated by engine displacement. Pit bike racing {{is a relatively new}} niche of motocross, and as such, there is no official governing body similar to the AMA.|$|E
25|$|Propane as an {{automotive}} fuel shares {{many of the}} physical attributes of gasoline while reducing tailpipe emissions and well <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> emissions overall. Propane {{is the number one}} alternative fuel in the world and offers an abundance of supply, liquid storage at low pressure, an excellent safety record and large cost savings when compared to traditional fuels.|$|E

25|$|Leading {{men into}} {{battle for the}} first time ever, Scarlett ordered his brigade to form two columns. The left column {{contained}} a squadron of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, followed by the two squadrons of the Scots Greys. As they trotted to the assistance of the Campell's Highlanders, Scarlett was informed of additional Russian cavalry threatening his flank. Ordering the brigade <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> about, the Scots Greys ended up in line with the Inniskilling Dragoons in the front row supported by the 5th Dragoon Guards. Even with the Russian cavalry approaching, Scarlett waited patiently for his dragoons to be brought into formation rather than move in a disorganised formation.|$|E
25|$|Merle, however, {{continuing}} his march along its original axis, was now drawing his division upon the right {{flank of the}} second Spanish line; sensing this opportunity, Bessières ordered Merle <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> right and plunge into the Spanish flank à la baïonnette. Mouton's chasseurs appeared on the Spanish left, and under the combined pressure the Spanish line, overlapped and plunged into disorder, ruptured. The leading Spanish grenadier battalions struck their last determined blows against the French centre before being caught in this crossfire and brusquely forced off the ridge, convincing Cuesta to sound the retreat. As with Blake's retreat, a rearguard of regular battalions held off the French while the other formations flew north to Medina.|$|E

30|$|A {{conventional}} differential {{does not}} usefully distribute the torque <b>to</b> the <b>wheels</b> when a wheel is skidding. All {{the power is}} applied <b>to</b> the skidding <b>wheel</b> and not <b>to</b> the <b>wheel</b> that has more traction. An electronic traction control system prevents a wheel from skidding by applying a brake <b>to</b> that <b>wheel,</b> enabling the differential to apply power <b>to</b> the other <b>wheel.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{constellation}} {{is named}} after Cassiopeia, the queen of Aethiopia. Cassiopeia was the wife of King Cepheus of Aethiopia and mother of Princess Andromeda. Cepheus and Cassiopeia were placed {{next to each other}} among the stars, along with Andromeda. She was placed in the sky as a punishment after enraging Poseidon with the boast that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids or, alternatively, that she herself was more beautiful than the sea nymphs. She was forced <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> around the North Celestial Pole on her throne, spending half of her time clinging to it so she does not fall off, and Poseidon decreed that Andromeda should be bound to a rock as prey for the monster Cetus. Andromeda was then rescued by the hero Perseus, whom she later married.|$|E
25|$|After Ayres's {{division}} {{had captured}} the return, Warren again went {{to search for}} Crawford. He found Crawford's division in good order {{on the east side}} of the Boisseau farm, facing west. Unfortunately for Warren, Sheridan asked for Warren at about this time and no one could say where he was. Sheridan then ordered Griffin to take command of the corps. Meanwhile, Warren ordered Crawford <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> to the left and drive south against Five Forks because Warren perceived that the Confederates still held the crossroads because of artillery fire coming from that direction. Coulter's brigade led the attack on the left of Ford's Road with Kellogg's and Baxter's brigades and four of Bartlett's separated regiments coming up on the right. From woods on the south of the Boisseau farm, the Confederates fired steadily on the Union battle line. Three companies of the 1st Maine Veteran Infantry Regiment routed a patrol of Rosser's cavalry across Hatcher's Run before rejoining their regiment. Warren assigned the 1st Maine Veteran Infantry Regiment and the 118th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment to watch the ford across Hatcher's Run.|$|E
25|$|The seventh {{match was}} the street fight between Shane McMahon and Vince McMahon with Mick Foley as the special guest referee. Shane {{dominated}} his father during the earlier {{part of the}} match by attacking him with various weapons such as a kendo stick and monitors from the Spanish broadcast table. Shane laid Vince on said table, and performed a diving elbow drop off the top rope but his sister, Stephanie, pulled Vince out of the way, causing Shane to crash through it. Trish Stratus came towards the ring, pushing Linda McMahon out in a wheelchair, and then slapped Vince, causing her and Stephanie {{to get into a}} fight that led them out of the stadium. As referee Foley tried <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> Linda out to safety, Vince hit him with a steel chair, and then pulled Linda into the ring to make her watch as he beat down Shane with a garbage can. However, Linda stood up and low blowed Vince, allowing Foley to recover and attack him. With Vince prone in the corner, Shane placed a garbage can in front of Vince's face and hit a Coast-to-Coast dropkick, pinning his father to win the match.|$|E

500|$|Lambert's corpse rapidly {{began to}} putrefy. There was no {{question}} of his body being returned to Leicester, and so on 22 June, it was placed inside an elm coffin, 6feet 4inches long, 4feet 4inches wide and 2feet 4inches deep (193cm× 132cm× 71cm), built on wheels {{to allow it to}} be moved. [...] The coffin was so large that <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> it out of the inn and to the newly opened burial ground at the rear of St Martin's Church, the window and wall of his apartment were demolished. A suitably sized grave had been dug, with a sloping approach to avoid the need to lower the coffin from above, but on 23 June, it nonetheless took almost half an hour for twenty men to pull Lambert's enormous coffin into the grave.|$|E
500|$|Mawhood {{ordered his}} light troops to delay Mercer, while {{he brought up}} the other detachments. Mercer was walking through William Clark's orchard when the British light troops appeared. The British light troops' volley went high which gave time for Mercer <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> his troops around into battle line. Mercer's troops advanced, pushing back the British light troops. The Americans took up a {{position}} behind a fence at {{the upper end of}} the orchard. However, Mawhood had brought up his troops and his artillery. The American gunners opened fire first and for about ten minutes, the outnumbered American infantry exchanged fire with the British. However, many of the Americans had rifles which took longer to load than muskets. Mawhood ordered a bayonet charge and because many of the Americans had rifles, which could not be equipped with bayonets, they were overrun. Both of the Americans' cannons were captured, and the British turned them on the fleeing troops. Mercer was surrounded by British soldiers and they shouted at him [...] "Surrender you damn rebel!". Declining to ask for quarter, Mercer chose to resist instead. The British, thinking they had caught Washington, bayoneted him, and then left him for dead. Mercer's second in command, Colonel John Haslet, was shot through the head and killed.|$|E

500|$|Quinn's storyline {{received}} widely divergent commentary. Hankinson {{thought the}} writers had missed {{an opportunity to}} [...] "do something hugely daring" [...] and also {{reduce the size of}} the cast. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal characterized their message as [...] "Move on, folks, nothing to see here", added that [...] "there wasn’t even a scratch on her face" [...] and concluded that it was [...] "nice to know that touches of irony haven’t left the show". Strecker called Quinn [...] "a walking wheeling PSA about texting dangers in general". Dodge said that one of his [...] "favorite scenes" [...] of the episode was [...] "when Artie tries to get Quinn <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> herself up a steep ramp outside McKinley". VanDerWerff noted the pair's [...] "chemistry" [...] as friends, and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman described [...] "Quinn's kids-in-wheelchairs bonding scenes with Artie" [...] as the [...] "second best thing about the episode". Michael Slezak of TVLine expressed the wish that the extras in the scene in the skateboard park [...] "had actually gotten a chance to, um, speak like real humans, not just like props for a kicky musical number". VanDerWerff's summation was that the episode [...] "gave Dianna Agron more shades to play than she’s usually asked to, and that was a good thing".|$|E
500|$|Fire lance: The fire lance was a proto-gun {{developed}} in the 10th century with a tube of first bamboo and later on metal that shot a weak gunpowder blast of flame and shrapnel; its earliest representation comes from [...] at Dunhuang. The earliest confirmed employment of the fire lance in warfare was by Song dynasty forces against the Jin in 1132 during the siege of De'an (modern Anlu, Hubei Province), where {{they were used to}} great effect against wooden siege towers called [...] "sky bridges": [...] "As the sky bridges became stuck fast, more than ten feet from the walls and unable to get any closer, [...] were ready. From below and above the defensive structures they emerged and attacked with fire lances, striking lances, and hooked sickles, each in turn. The people [...] {{at the base of the}} sky bridges were repulsed. Pulling their bamboo ropes, they [...] ended up drawing the sky bridge back in an anxious and urgent rush, going about fifty paces before stopping." [...] The surviving porters then tried once again <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> the sky bridges into place but Song soldiers emerged from the walls in force and made a direct attack on the sky bridge soldiers while defenders on the walls threw bricks and shot arrows in conjunction with trebuchets hurling bombs and rocks. The sky bridges were also set fire to with incendiary bundles of grass and firewood. Li Heng, the Jin commander, decided to lift the siege and Jin forces were driven back with severe casualties.|$|E
500|$|... "Gerald {{receives}} {{a letter from}} his father announcing the death of Claude and calling him home to assume his position as the heir of the estates of Sir James. Gerald places the letter in his pocket together with the newspaper account of the marriage of Claude and decides not to return to England but to remain {{and care for the}} lawful wife of his brother, whom he has grown to love fondly. Some time afterward he goes to his mine, wheeling the girl along with him. He wheels her to the mouth of the shaft and leaves her, after throwing his coat over the arm of her chair. His devotion has caused her to love him. She tries to change her position and the coat falls to the ground. She picks it up and the letter from England and the paper falls out. She reads the announcement of the marriage of Claude and then, feeling justified, she reads the letter announcing the death of Claude and of Gerald being heir to the estates and a gentleman. She reflects and then draws the forged letter from her bosom and sees that it was written after the announcement of the marriage. It is all revealed to her. The sacrifice of Gerald — the double duty, love and a desire to uphold the honor of the proud English family. She cries to Gerald but cannot make him hear. In her desperation she tries <b>to</b> <b>wheel</b> her chair down the slope and it is overturned. Her cries bring Gerald and when he comes she shows him the newspaper and the letter. He is silent. He cannot explain. She reaches out her arms to him and is clasped to his heart." ...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} used rats {{to examine}} the effect of a single bout of voluntary activity (wheel running) on the acquisition, extinction, and reconsolidation of context conditioned fear. In Experiment 1, rats provided with access <b>to</b> a <b>wheel</b> for 3 h immediately before or after a shocked exposure to a context froze more when tested in that context than rats provided with access <b>to</b> the <b>wheels</b> 6 h after the shocked exposure or rats not provided with access <b>to</b> the <b>wheels.</b> In Experiment 2, rats provided with access <b>to</b> the <b>wheels</b> immediately before or after a nonshocked exposure to the conditioned context froze less when tested in that context than rats provided with access <b>to</b> the <b>wheels</b> 6 h after the nonshocked exposure or rats not provided with access <b>to</b> the <b>wheels.</b> In Experiment 3, rats provided with access <b>to</b> <b>wheels</b> immediately after an extended nonshocked exposure to the conditioned context again froze less, whereas rats provided with access <b>to</b> the <b>wheels</b> after a brief nonshocked exposure froze more on the subsequent test than sedentary controls. These results show that a single bout of running can enhance acquisition, extinction, and reconsolidation of context conditioned fear. © 2014 Siette et al...|$|R
