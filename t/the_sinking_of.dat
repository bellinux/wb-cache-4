50|$|The series {{composition}} Sc = Sc(X,Y) of two TTGs X and Y is a TTG {{created from}} the disjoint union of graphs X and Y by merging <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> X with <b>the</b> source of Y.

5|$|During World War I the South Arklow Lightvessel Guillemot, {{operated}} by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, had given warning of a U-boat.

Once the U-boat had left Kiel on 16 November, she headed out into the North Sea. After traveling around the British Isles into the Bay of Biscay and the English Channel, U-47 sank a further three vessels, Navasota on 5 December, the Norwegian steamer MV Britta on 6 December and Tajandoen on 7 December. Following <b>the</b> <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> Navasota, British destroyers briefly fired depth charges at the U-boat but she managed to safely evade the attack without any damage.|$|E

50|$|Within the drawing, each face of {{the graph}} must have the same structure: there is one vertex that acts {{as the source of}} the face, one vertex that acts as <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face, and all edges within the face are {{directed}} along two paths from the source to <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> If one draws an additional edge from <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> <b>of</b> an st-planar graph back to the source, through the outer face, and then constructs the dual graph (oriented each dual edge clockwise with respect to its primal edge) then the result is again an st-planar graph, augmented with an extra edge in the same way.|$|R

50|$|Several dye trace {{studies have}} shown that the {{drainage}} basin of Harrison Spring is, by Indiana standards, very large. Indian Creek is a major infeeder to the Harrison Springs drainage system as the entire summer flow of Indian Creek can disappear at <b>the</b> <b>Sinks</b> <b>of</b> Indian Creek and re-emerge at Harrison Springs in low-flow conditions, in about one hour. Given that Big Indian Creek - upstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sinks</b> <b>of</b> Indian Creek - drains an area between Corydon and Georgetown, as well as Little Indian Creek (an infeeder to Big Indian) drains an area that runs east of Lanesville, the Indian Creek portion of the Harrison Spring drainage basin alone drains an area of at least 200 sq mi.|$|R
