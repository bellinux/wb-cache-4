40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the performance of}} alternative mortgage instruments {{in an environment of}} stochastic price fluctuations. The two most widely discussed contracts that deal with inflation are the adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) and the price level-adjusted mortgage (PLAM). The former compensates for inflation by paying the nominal interest rate, which contains a component reflecting the rate of inflation. Nonetheless, even without explicit nominal amortization, this results in real amortization and hence a <b>tilting</b> <b>effect.</b> In addition, the inflation component of the nominal interest rate is shown to reflect only anticipated and not actual inflation, and so the real value of an ARM fluctuates due to unanticipated inflation. A PLAM suffers from none of these defects. To the extent that one is interested in a mortgage whose properties reflect the underlying real environment, the price level-adjusted mortgage is the ideal instrument.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a Modified Two-Scale Microwave (MTSM) {{scattering}} model to describe the scattering coefficient of naturally rough surfaces. The surface roughness {{is assumed to be}} Gaussian in the proposed model so that the surface height z(x, y) can be split into large- and small-scale components by the wavelet packet transform according to electromagnetic wavelength. We used the Kirchhoff Model(KM) and Small Perturbation Method (SPM) to estimate the backscattering coefficient of large- and small-scale roughness, respectively. The <b>tilting</b> <b>effect</b> caused by the slope of large-scale roughness was corrected when calculating the contribution of backscattering to small-scale roughness. The backscattering coefficient of the MTSM comprised the total backscattering contributions of surfaces with both scales of roughness. The MTSM was tested and validated using the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) for dielectric randomly rough surfaces. The accuracy of the MTSM showed favorable agreement with AIEM, both when the incident angle was less than 30 ° (θi< 30 °) and when the surface roughness was small (ks= 0. 354) ...|$|E

The upper Miocene non-marine Mint Canyon formation is successively overlain by the uppermost Miocene marine "Modelo" formation, the lower Pliocene marine Pico formation, the Pliocene-Pleistocene non-marine Saugus formation, and by Pleistocene terrace deposits and Recent alluvium. Angular unconformities characterize most of the boundaries between these formations, but disconformable relationships appear to exist locally. As a result {{of two or more}} major periods of deformation, the rocks are highly folded, with broken anticlines and dips that vary from horizontal to vertical. Overturning occurs at least at one place. Compressive stresses from the north appear to have been the most active agents of deformation; but the block-type San Gabriel fault, which runs through the Southern part of the Humphreys Station area, may have had some <b>tilting</b> <b>effect</b> upon the beds throughout this whole region. In general, the structural trend is northwest-southeast. Broad folds in the Mint Canyon formation plunge northwestward at low to moderate angles.

30|$|The {{geological}} events {{occurring in}} Elysium Planitia, probably the fluvial activity (Burr et al., 2002) or the flood lava eruption (Jaeger et al., 2010), created a very flat surface on Mars. The maximum height difference over the hundreds kilometer squared target areas {{was less than}} 30 m. Due to the flat terrain surface, the stereo image matching {{as well as the}} geodic control became challenge tasks in the processor, because both procedures depended on the identification of the corresponding features and the textures between images. As a result, any insignificant vertical errors of ground control points determined in HRSC base DTM from h 2165 0000 would result in overall tilting in the CTX stereo (G 01 _ 18537 _ 1861 and G 0219170 _ 1861) topography. Therefore, the surface matching tool (Lin et al., 2010) was applied {{to improve the quality of}} geodetic control between MOLA and stereo CTX DTM. Once the matching was convergence, the tilting in CTX DTM was successfully addressed. This is observed through the detailed measurement of the geodetic quality improvement and the comparison with MOLA spots (refer to Subsection 4.3). Such difficulty in geodetic control was not found in the HiRISE DTM processing procedure, as the HiRISE stereo (ESP 18537 1860 and ESP_ 019170 _ 1860) is located in the middle of CTX coverage where the <b>tilting</b> <b>effect</b> is minimum.

Isotropic scattering and several other simple phase functions are ruled out, and it is found that the phase function must be moderately peaked in both the forward and backward directions. The <b>tilt</b> <b>effect</b> can be explained by multiple scattering in a homogeneous layer, but, for ring B, this requires a single-scattering albedo in excess of 0. 8.

40|$|The ROMS-WEC model [Uchiyama et al., 2010] {{based on}} an Eulerian wave-averaged vortex-force {{asymptotic}} theory of McWilliams et al. (2004) is applied to analyze 3 -D transient wave-driven rip currents and associated intrinsic very low-frequency (VLF) variability in the surf zone on a surveyed bathymetry under spatiotemporally uniform offshore incident waves. The 3 -D rip currents are substantially depth-dependent due to the vertical recirculation, composed of pairs of counter-rotating longitudinal overturning roll cells that promote surface convergence. The vortex force {{plays an important role}} in vorticity budget, preconditioning overall vorticity reduction. These rip currents are intrinsically unstable and contribute about 70 % to kinetic energy (KE) as eddy kinetic energy (EKE), consistent with observations. The dominant fluctuation period fits the VLF band, at about 18 min. The current effect on waves (CEW) alters not only the mean rip structure, but also the associated turbulence as the modified cross-shore EKE profile with considerable accentuation in the inner surf zone. Increased alongshore bathymetric variability proportionally intensifies KE and intrinsic EKE, whereas it reduces the VLF period. With a guide of a pseudo 2 D model, we reveal that vortex <b>tilting</b> <b>effect</b> due to the horizontal vorticity inherent in the 3 -D rip currents promotes collapse of the 3 -D eddies through an enhanced forward kinetic energy cascade, leading to short-lived, laterally-stretched 3 -D eddies resulting in elongated filaments that decay more quickly than coherent, long-lived, circular 2 -D eddies...|$|E
40|$|Following {{an earlier}} {{diagnostic}} study, {{the present paper}} performs numerical simulations of the rare wintertime supercell storms during 19 - 20 December 2002 in a subtropical environment near Taiwan. Using Japan Meteorology Agency (JMA) 20 -km analyses and horizontal grid spacing of 1. 5 and 0. 5 km, the Cloud-Resolving Storm Simulator (CReSS) of Nagoya University successfully reproduced the three major storms at the correct time and location, but the southern storm decayed too early over the Taiwan Strait. The two experiments produce similar overall results, suggesting that the 1. 5 -km grid spacing is sufficient even for storm dynamics. Model results are further {{used to examine the}} storm structure, kinematics, splitting process, and the variation in the mesoscale environment. Over the Taiwan Strait, the strong surface northeasterly flow enhanced low-level vertical shear and helped the storms evolve into isolated supercells. Consistent with previous studies, the vorticity budget analysis indicates that midlevel updraft rotation arose mainly from the <b>tilting</b> <b>effect,</b> and was reinforced by vertical stretching at the supercell stage. As the ultimate source of vorticity generation, the horizontal vorticity (vertical shear) was altered by the baroclinic (solenoidal) effect around the warm-core updraft, as well as the tilting of vertical vorticity onto, and rotation of vortex tubes in the x-y plane, forming a counterclockwise pattern that pointed generally northward (westward) at the right (left) flanks of the updraft. In both runs, model storms travel about 15 degrees- 20 degrees {{to the left of the}} actual storms, and they are found to be quite sensitive to the detailed low-level thermodynamic structure of the postfrontal atmosphere and the intensity of the storms themselves, in particular whether or not the existing instability can be released by forced uplift at the gust front. In this regard, the finer 0. 5 -km grid did produce stronger storms that maintained longer across the strait. The disagreement in propagation direction between the model and real storms is partially attributed to the differences in environment, while the remaining part is most likely due to differences not reflected in gridded analyses. Since the conditions (in both the model and real atmosphere) over the Taiwan Strait are not uniform and depend on many detailed factors, it is anticipated that a successful simulation that agrees with the observation in all aspects over data-sparse regions like this one will remain a challenging task in the foreseeable future...|$|E
40|$|The {{extended}} use {{of digital}} communication requires ever {{more powerful and}} faster memory with concurrently minimized energy consumption. Novel non-volatile memory using ferroelectric crystalline thin films (FeRAM) are a possible replacement for Flash- and DRAM-memory with equivalent or superior performance. Ferroelectric films consisting of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) are a promising candidate for the application in these memory devices. One problem {{for the application of}} PZT in memory devices is its high switching voltage which cannot be further reduced at film thicknesses below 100 nm. One aim of this work has been to study the effect of a material modification on the electronic properties of PZT based films with thicknesses in the area of 100 nm. For the first time a systematic examination on polycrystalline and epitaxial thin films of ferroelectric barium substituted lead zirconate titanate (Pb 1 -xBax) (Zr 1 -yTiy) O 3 (PBZT) has been undertaken. These PBZT films have been synthesized by metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). A process has been developed to deposit single-phase PZT based perovskite films with varying barium content, both in polycrystalline form on iridium covered silicon substrates and hetero-epitaxially on strontium ruthenate covered strontium titanate single crystals. By modification of the processing of polycrystalline PBZT films, a significant improvement of interface quality in comparison to pure PZT films has been shown successfully. The shifting of the morphotropic phase boundary to lower zirconium content, which has been observed by the insertion of barium into PZT ceramics, could also be verified in thin films by X-ray diffraction. The tetragonality in PBZT films decreases linearly with barium content. In epitaxial films it could be shown by the method of reciprocal space mapping that the tilting angle of a-domains in c-axis oriented films is also being decreased by increasing barium content. This <b>tilting</b> <b>effect</b> is partially compensated by substrate induced compressive stress, which is comparable in all films. The substitution of PZT with barium allows {{for the first time to}} study the influence of the tetragonality on the structural and electrical properties of the films. Only by variation of the zirconium content in pure PZT this influence is limited by the phase transition from the tetragonal to the rhombohedral structure. In epitaxial 110 nm thick films with tetragonal structure and (001) orientation the switching voltage has been successfully reduced from 1. 5 V for pure PZT(29 / 71) to 0. 9 V by the substitution of 11 at% barium in PZT. At the same time the remanent polarisation is being decreased by less than a factor of two from 52 µC/cm 2 to 29 µC/cm 2...|$|E

40|$|The {{two major}} factors {{contributing}} to the opposition brightening of Saturn's rings are i) the intrinsic brightening of particles due to coherent backscattering and/or shadow-hiding on their surfaces, and ii) the reduced interparticle shadowing. We utilize the Hubble Space Telescope observations for different elevation angles B to disentangle these contributions. We assume that the intrinsic contribution is independent of B, so that any B dependence of the phase curves is due to interparticle shadowing, which must also act similarly for all colors. We construct a grid of dynamical/photometric simulation models to fit the elevation-dependent part of opposition brightening. Eliminating the modeled interparticle component yields the intrinsic contribution to the opposition effect: for the B and A rings it is almost entirely due to coherent backscattering; for the C ring, an intraparticle shadow hiding contribution may also be present. Based on our simulations, {{the width of the}} interparticle shadowing effect is roughly proportional to B. This follows from the observation that as B decreases, the scattering is primarily from the rarefied low filling factor upper ring layers, whereas at larger $B$'s the dense inner parts are visible. The elevation angle dependence of interparticle shadowing also explains most of the B ring <b>tilt</b> <b>effect</b> (the increase of brightness with elevation). From comparison of the magnitude of the <b>tilt</b> <b>effect</b> at different filters, we show that multiple scattering can account for at most a 10 % brightness increase as B -> 26 ^o, whereas the remaining 20 % brightening is due to a variable degree of interparticle shadowing. The negative <b>tilt</b> <b>effect</b> of the middle A ring is well explained by the the same self-gravity wake models that account for the observed A ring azimuthal brightness asymmetry.
