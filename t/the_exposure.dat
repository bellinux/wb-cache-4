Weak sufficient cause interactions concern cases in which a mechanism will operate under certain values of <b>the</b> two <b>exposures</b> but not when {{one or the other of}} <b>the</b> <b>exposures</b> takes some other value. Strong sufficient cause interactions concern cases in which a mechanism will operate under certain values of <b>the</b> two <b>exposures</b> but not when one or the other of <b>the</b> <b>exposures</b> takes any other value.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we disentangle, {{analytically}} and empirically, {{the roles of}} the unit-exposure restriction in Heston and Rouwenhorst (1994). We show that if the purpose is to construct factors, the unit-exposure variance-analysis model can be viewed as just an algorithm that does not really assume a return-generating process; and in practice the effect of relaxing the restriction is immaterial. The restriction is more important if one wants to estimate whether, for a typical stock, the country factor generates more variance than <b>the</b> sector factor: <b>exposure</b> estimation becomes more important (i) the further <b>the</b> average <b>exposures</b> are from unity; or (ii) the higher the dispersion of <b>the</b> <b>exposures.</b> With respect to (i), the more important the corrections for sector (or geographical) structure in country (or sector) factors are, the more <b>the</b> average <b>exposure</b> falls below unity. Thus, <b>the</b> average <b>exposure</b> provides an alternative indicator of the importance of country versus sector effects. We empirically find that <b>the</b> average sector <b>exposure</b> is low (0. 3) compared to <b>the</b> average country <b>exposure</b> (0. 9). With respect to (ii) we correct <b>the</b> dispersion of <b>exposures</b> for estimation error in <b>the</b> <b>exposures.</b> We find that in our sample these estimation error corrections are more important for sector factors than for country factors, and that country factors are generating far more variance, in a typical stock's return, than do sector factors. © 2010 Elsevier B.
