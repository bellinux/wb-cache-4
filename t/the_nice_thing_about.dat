6000|$|Densher was to feel sure {{afterwards}} that Kate had had {{in these}} pleasantries no conscious, above all no insolent purpose of making light of poor Susan Shepherd's property in their young friend--which property, by such remarks, {{was very much}} pushed to the wall; {{but he was also}} to know that Mrs. Stringham had secretly resented them, Mrs. Stringham holding the opinion, of which he was ultimately to have a glimpse, that all the Kate Croys in Christendom were but dust for the feet of her Milly. That, it was true, would be what she must reveal only when driven to her last entrenchments and well cornered in her passion--the rare passion of friendship, the sole passion of her little life save the one other, more imperturbably cerebral, that she entertained for the art of Guy de Maupassant. She slipped in the observation that her Milly was incapable of change, was just exactly, on the contrary, the same Milly; but this made little difference in the drift of Kate's contention. She was perfectly kind to Susie: {{it was as if she}} positively knew her as handicapped for any disagreement by feeling that she, Kate, had [...] "type," [...] and by being committed to admiration of type. Kate had occasion subsequently--she found it somehow--to mention to our young man Milly's having spoken to her of this view on the good lady's part. She would like--Milly had had it from her--to put Kate Croy in a book and see what she could so do with her. [...] "Chop me up fine or serve me whole"--it was a way of being got at that Kate professed she dreaded. It would be Mrs. Stringham's, however, she understood, because Mrs. Stringham, oddly, felt that with such stuff as the strange English girl was made of, stuff that (in spite of Maud Manningham, who was full of sentiment) she had never known, there was none other to be employed. These things were of later evidence, yet Densher might even then have felt them in the air. They were practically in it already when Kate, waiving the question of her friend's chemical change, wound up with the comparatively unobjectionable proposition that he must now, having missed so much, take them all up, on trust, further on. He met it peacefully, a little perhaps as an example to Mrs. Stringham--"Oh as far on as you like!" [...] This even had its effect: Mrs. Stringham appropriated as much of it as might be meant for herself. <b>The</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> her was that she could measure how much; so that by the time dinner was over they had really covered ground.|$|E

5000|$|Diagnosed HIV {{positive}} in 1983, Locke retired from stage and screen {{and became an}} activist against the virus. He took education at the American Red Cross and the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York City, then used his name and celebrity to make personal appearances at sensible sex seminars around the country. Eventually, Locke moved to Desert Hot Springs near Palm Springs, California and built a geodesic domed home, powered by electricity from his own windmill. He did volunteer work from the Desert AIDS Project and gave weekly messages at the Villa Caprice Hotel in nearby Cathedral City. Returning to the Bay area a few years later, he had recently lived on the Russian River. When his health began failing in February, 1996, he moved to an apartment in Sacramento {{to be close to}} his family and the medical facilities at UC-Davis. Locke was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the 1994 Gay Erotic Video Awards in Los Angeles. He returned to the screen in 1995 to play a non-sexual role in Jerry Douglas' The Diamond Stud , which was destined to be farewell appearance. He had also written the books Locked Out, In The Heat Of Passion, was working on two unfinished autobiographies, [...] "Living" [...] and [...] "Dying" [...] and his one-act play, “Loving,” was filmed in 1995 in Toronto for future release. Services were held on September 29, 1996 in Sacramento, with interment at Benicia Cemetery outside Oakland.

[...] Memamps failed as both Google and Apple introduced software similar to that which Slowe was seeking to develop. Immediately upon graduating, in what has been considered a startling departure from expectations, he left academia to co-found reddit, a social news website where users can post links to content on the web. Other users may then vote the posted links up or down, causing them to appear more or less prominently on the reddit home page. [...] Of this change in direction, Slowe explained that [...] "(my) career path may have veered away from the original degree, but that's <b>the</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> start-ups - they're usually built around an idea that nobody has previously thought of. In these situations, past experience may not help. What is needed most is insane determination to see something through when failure is a more likely result than success.". Of his decision to move away from science and into in an entrepreneurial direction, he notes “I can’t think of another decision that has affected me more". Slowe had realised that academia was not the road for him. “I got into physics because I liked hard problems, and I enjoyed the process of discovery in solving them. Though the types of problems are drastically different, startup life is structured much the same way.” ...|$|E

Andrew S Tannenbaum One of the most daunting aspects of using genomic technologies—including microarray, proteomic, metabolomic, and other approaches—is the sheer quantity of data that they produce. With thousands of biologically relevant molecules surveyed across (increasingly) large numbers of samples, interpretation of the data requires the use of computational approaches. And while many researchers thought that storing the data could simply build on our experiences with genome sequencing, it quickly became apparent that if one was to make sense of the results from any analysis, there was a need to store much more complex ancillary data than would be necessary for genome sequence.

The distinctions between the names are not standardized and are only loosely recognized. However, here’s my take. Numerical Methods are what one uses {{to solve a problem}} from continuous mathematics (vide Nick Trefethen’s essay [5]). Numerical Analysis is how one proves that such algorithms give an accurate answer (or not), and in what sense. Scientific Computing is the use of numerical methods to solve problems of scientific interest. Computational Mathematics tends to be more ‘pure ’ in its orientation, using computational methods to explore problems of mathematical interest, typically with arbitrary precision or exact computation. Computational Science is, often, the study of the use of parallel or vector machines and architectures to solve massively huge problems; many people use this term interchangeabl...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{derivation}} of the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equation and the Manakov-PMD {{equation is}} reviewed. It is {{shown that the}} usual scalar nonlinear Schrödinger equation {{can be derived from}} the Manakov-PMD equation when polar-ization mode dispersion is negligible and the signal is initially in a single polarization state as a function of time. Applications of the Manakov-PMD equation to studies of the interaction of the Kerr nonlinearity with polarization mode dispersion are then discussed. There has been a flood of recent work on polarization effects in optical fibers, most of it focused on polarization mode dispersion (PMD). There are good, practical reasons for this recent interest. As the data rate per channel increases, PMD becomes an increas-ingly important limitation in communication systems. However, my own interest in polarization issues was, at least originally, focused on more fundamental questions. Since nearly all the contributions in this volume focus on the more immediate practical issues that are a consequence of polarization effects, it seemed useful to me to focus this contribution on more fundamental issues. <b>The</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> fundamenta...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, we {{introduce}} the intersperse coloring problem, {{which is a}} generalized version of the hypergraph coloring problem. In the intersperse coloring problem, we seek a coloring that assigns at least l different colors to each hyperedge of the input hypergraph, where l is an input parameter of the problem. We show {{that the notion of}} intersperse coloring unifies several well-known coloring problems, in addition to the conventional graph and hypergraph coloring problems, such as the strong coloring of hypergraphs, the star coloring problem, the problem of proper coloring of graph powers, the acyclic coloring problem, and the frugal coloring problem. We also provide a number of upper and lower bounds on the intersperse coloring problem on hypergraphs in the general case. <b>The</b> <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> our general bounds is that they can be applied to all the coloring problems that are special cases of the intersperse coloring problem. In this thesis, we also propose a new model for graph and hypergraph property testing, called the symmetric model. The symmetric model is the first model {{that can be used for}} developing property testing algorithms for non-uniform hypergraphs. We also prove that there exist graph properties that have efficient property testers in the symmetric model but do not have any efficient property tester in previously-known property testing models...|$|E
