40|$|X-Ray Lang {{topography}} is used {{to investigate}} the dislocation substructure developped under stress in slightly n-doped InSb samples. Results confirm the much higher velocity of α-dislocations compared <b>to</b> <b>screws.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, β-dislocations are excessively little mobile, apparently at all stress and temperature. This has for consequence : 1) to affect the mobility of screw dislocations whose motion looks {{to be controlled by}} the propagation of single α-kinks. 2) to prevent the development of efficient internal sources, except near surfaces. This behaviour induces a plasticity which appears to be very specific to III-V compounds...|$|R

6000|$|Of course I obeyed, {{wondering}} what the captain wanted with so much hot water as to let the people eat their dinners off cold grub, rather than dispense with it; for this was a consequence of his decree. But we had not got the coppers half-filled, before I saw Mr. Marble and Neb lowering a small ship's engine from the launch, and placing it near the galley, in readiness to be filled. The mate told Neb <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> <b>on</b> the pipe, and then {{half a dozen of}} the men, as soon as we got through with the coppers, were told to fill the engine with sea-water.

50|$|Havens Steel Company, the {{contractor}} responsible for manufacturing the rods, {{objected to the}} original plan, since it required {{the whole of the}} rod below the fourth floor to be screw threaded in order <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> <b>on</b> the nuts to hold the fourth floor walkway in place. These threads would probably have been damaged and rendered unusable as the structure for the fourth floor was hoisted into position with the rods in place. Havens therefore proposed an alternate plan in which two separate -- and offset -- sets of tie rods would be used: one connecting the fourth floor walkway to the ceiling, and the other connecting the second floor walkway to the fourth floor walkway.|$|E
5000|$|The end of {{the barrel}} was threaded, and this thread was used <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> <b>on</b> a blast-reduction tube of a length that {{depended}} on the installation requirements: One of the outstanding features of this weapon is the method of solving blast tube difficulties, a troublesome problem in all installations of aircraft cannon in fighter aircraft. The Soviets' simple solution was to thread the {{end of the}}ir standard barrel and then screw on for whatever length was needed a heavy piece of tubing, the bore diameter of which was slightly greater than that of the rotating band of the projectile. This arrangement allowed the blast and gas to leak around the projectile before it cleared the tube, not only reducing the blast effect of the weapon but also by its added length safely leading the blast and projectile past portions of the plane that would otherwise have been injured.|$|E

Venom started to take their cogs apart thinking they did it wrong. Claw managed to get the cogs in properly and started <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> <b>on</b> the nuts. Venom were still having problems and they had a chance to catch up when Claw had lost their crank to turn the raft. Millie and Jemima desperately dived down to find the crank, when Jemima suddenly found it.

40|$|In I 894 Leonard Gigli {{described}} a simple device for cutting bones. The instru-ment {{consisted of a}} single steel wire, the surface {{of which had been}} roughened, and two handles which were attached {{to the ends of the}} wire allowing to-and-fro move-ments. Since that time, the apparatus has been modified, using braided wires with corrugations and has become known as the Gigli saw. Because of its simplicity and reliability, the Gigli saw has become very popular as a bone-cutting instrument. The main difficulty in its use is in passing the device around the bone which is to be cut. At least two instruments have been designed to help effect this passage 2, 3 We have modified a stethoscope earpiece in such a way as to make a very suit-able guide for passage of the Gigli saw (Fig. 1). A transverse bar is welded onto the end of the single earpiece of the stethoscope to allow control of the apparatus. A semisharp trocar is machined <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> <b>on</b> the tip of the earpiece to allow passage through soft tissue. After passage is accomplished, the trocar is removed. The Gigli saw is then inserted through the guide, and the guide is removed. This permits divi-sion of the bone from within outwards under full control.
