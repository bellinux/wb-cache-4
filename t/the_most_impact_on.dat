While she contributes to the news program all throughout the year, in 2011, Couric created her newly annual special The Year with Katie Couric, which is a program that {{marks the end of}} the year and covers some of the biggest newsmakers and news events of that year. This is a collaboration with People magazine, which also reflects events in the world of news, sports, politics, and major headlines that helped shape the world. This is very similar to that of Walters's iconic Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People, a year end program that marks {{the end of the year}} and acknowledges the people that had <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the year at hand with interviews on their perspective of the year.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between coaching behaviors and traits and their <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> athlete motivation and affective learning in a collegiate coactive team setting. By conducting in-depth interviews with NCAA Division I men’s tennis players at a Midwestern, mid-sized University it was discovered that Coach Craig Keller’si credibility and caring behaviors had <b>the</b> <b>most</b> salient <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> athlete intrinsic motivation, his use of mild verbal aggression and his career record had <b>the</b> <b>most</b> salient <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> athlete extrinsic motivation, and his extreme verbal aggression and lack of feedback/praise significantly decreased their levels of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Moreover, the athletes noted that Coach’s credibility and caring behaviors increased their levels of affective learning, his will to win and desire to be professional increased affective learning through trait modeling, and his inability to follow through with claims decreased their affective learning. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> significant finding was that Coach’s dynamic leadership had <b>the</b> <b>most</b> positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> player intrinsic motivation while his mild verbal aggression had <b>the</b> <b>most</b> positive <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> player extrinsic motivation. However, it was discovered that this type of leadership ceased being motivational when the sentiment of the messages became negative and singled out individual players.

25|$|Interest in {{environmental}} transformation {{continued to increase}} in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, resulting {{in a series of}} new intellectual approaches. One of these approaches was environmental determinism, developed by geographer Friedrich Ratzel. This view held that it is not social conditions, but environmental conditions, which determine the culture of a population. Ratzsel also viewed humans as restricted by nature, for their behaviors are limited to and defined by their environment. A later approach was the historical viewpoint of Franz Boas which refuted environmental determinism, claiming that it is not nature, but specifics of history, that shape human cultures. This approach recognized that although the environment may place limitations on societies, every environment will impact each culture differently. Julian Steward's cultural ecology is considered a fusion of environmental determinism and Boas' historical approach. Steward felt it was neither nature nor culture that had <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> a population, but instead, the mode of subsistence used in a given environment.|$|E

500|$|Fish size, age, {{concentration}} of triactinomyxon spores, and water temperature all affect infection rates in fish, {{as does the}} species of the fish in question. [...] The disease has <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> fish less than five months old because their skeletons have not ossified. [...] This makes young fish more susceptible to deformities and provides M. cerebralis more cartilage on which to feed. [...] In one study of seven species of many strains, brook trout and rainbow trout (except one strain) were far more heavily affected by M. cerebralis after two hours of exposure than other species were, while bull trout, Chinook salmon, brown trout, and Arctic grayling were least severely affected. [...] While brown trout may harbor the parasite, they typically do not show any symptoms, and this species may have been M. cerebralis original host. [...] This lack of symptoms in brown trout meant that the parasite was only discovered after nonnative rainbow trouts were introduced in Europe.|$|E
