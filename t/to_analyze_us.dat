40|$|Health indices provide {{information}} {{to the general public}} on the health condition of the community. They {{can also be used to}} inform the government’s policy making, to evaluate the effect of a current policy or healthcare program, or for program planning and priority setting. It is a common practice that the health indices across different geographic units are ranked and the ranks are reported as fixed values. We argue that the ranks should be viewed as random and hence should be accompanied by an indication of precision (i. e., the confidence intervals). A technical difficulty in doing so is how to account for the dependence among the ranks in the construction of confidence intervals. In this paper, we propose a novel Monte Carlo method for constructing the individual and simultaneous confidence intervals of ranks for age-adjusted rates. The proposed method uses as input age-specific counts (of cases of disease or deaths) and their associated populations. We have further extended it to the case in which only the age-adjusted rates and confidence intervals are available. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed method <b>to</b> <b>analyze</b> <b>US</b> age-adjusted cancer incidence rates and mortality rates for cancer and other diseases by states and counties within a state using a website that will be publicly available. The results show that for rare or relatively rare disease (especially at the county level), ranks are essentially meaningless because of their large variability, while for more common disease in larger geographic units, ranks can be effectively utilized...|$|E

Statistical inference procedures including Welch's t-test and non-parametric methods are presented in the context of changes of climate regimes and extremes.

These were indeed watershed moments for human rights activists not only in the US but elsewhere. However, the US has rarely implemented these laws since their enactment in the mid- 1970 s.

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{the effect of}} US foreign policy on the internal security dynamics of aid recipient states. I draw upon the international security and contentious politics literatures <b>to</b> <b>analyze</b> how <b>US</b> foreign assistance affects the ability of recipient countries to employ violence against their citizens. I argue that {{as a consequence of}} fungibility—the diversion of aid for use as a general government resource—foreign aid may increase the likelihood of state violence through its effect on the state’s coercive capacity. I further hypothesize that the coercive effects of foreign aid are conditioned by the political institutions of the recipient state and its past history of conflict. I test this argument through multiple case studies and a time-series cross-national dataset of annual US bilateral foreign aid and various measures of state violence and repression for approximately 110 developing countries during the period of 1976 to 2008. This research links the study of political violence with the changing nature of international relations and provides considerable insight into international influences on intrastate conflict.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} and explain which policy instruments for human rights (HR) the United States and the European Union use towards Burma and to examine the priority given to HR in their respective foreign policy.

Both actors primarily use different forms of diplomatic tools and sanctions to try to force change for HR in Burma. From a comparison of the two this paper concludes that as a hegemon, and unlike the EU with economic interest in Burma, the US ability to focus on the HR issue in the country by far exceeds that of the European Union’s. Though the US and the EU claim to follow liberal ideas about HR, this study shows that often other realistic preferences determine their modes of action...|$|R

Using a Partial Least Squares model, these four dierent freight accessibility measures are combined into two constructs, continental and intercontinental freight accessibility, and related to logistics employment, dierentiating counties inside metropolitan areas from those outside. Results show that highly accessible non-metropolitan counties attract more logistics employment than other non-metropolitan counties. In metropolitan counties, no signicant relationship was found between freight accessibility and logistics employment. This is primarily explained by the highly signicant relations of both freight accessibility and logistics employment with county population.

In this work, we show that the total L_ 1 influence of a [- 1, 1]-valued function f can be upper bounded by a polynomial {{in the degree of}} f, resolving affirmatively an open problem of Aaronson and Ambainis (ITCS 2011). The main challenge here is that the L_ 1 influences do not admit an easy Fourier analytic representation. In our proof, we overcome this problem by introducing a new analytic quantity I_p(f), relating this new quantity to the total L_ 1 influence of f. This new quantity, which roughly corresponds to an average of the total L_ 1 influences of some ensemble of functions related to f, has the benefit of being much easier <b>to</b> <b>analyze,</b> allowing <b>us</b> <b>to</b> resolve the problem of Aaronson and Ambainis.

The {{purpose of this article is}} two-fold. First, we demonstrate that based on a multicointegrated vector autoregression (VAR) two equivalent error correction model (ECM) representations can be derived; the first is expressed in terms of adjustments in the flows of the variables (the standard I(2) ECM), and the second is expressed in terms of adjustments in both the stocks and the flows. Secondly, we apply I(2) estimation and testing procedures for multicointegrated time series <b>to</b> <b>analyze</b> data for <b>US</b> housing construction. We find that stocks of housing units started and completed exhibit polynomial cointegration (and hence the flows are multicointegrated) and the associated ECM's are estimated.
