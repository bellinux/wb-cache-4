500|$|Garfield did not {{consider}} Lincoln particularly worthy of re-election, but no viable alternative seemed available. [...] "He {{will probably be the}} man, though I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do better." [...] The Ohioan attended the party convention and promoted Rosecrans as Lincoln's running mate, but delegates chose Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson. Both Lincoln and Garfield were re-elected. By then, Chase had left the Cabinet and had been appointed Chief Justice, and his relations with Garfield became more distant.|$|E
500|$|Stargate {{producers}} {{were not}} sure actor Richard Dean Anderson would return for the episode, so they devised many scenes where Anderson was [...] "in" [...] the episode but not actually shown. [...] However, Anderson was willing to return and appeared in several scenes. In the DVD special Stargate SG-1: Behind the 200th Cooper said, [...] "it {{was a big deal}} for us to have [...] back for the 200th episode. We obviously didn't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do it without him." ...|$|E
500|$|The Nazi Party's rise {{to power}} {{provided}} Himmler and the SS an unfettered opportunity to thrive. By 1933, the SS numbered 52,000 members. Strict membership requirements ensured that all members were of Hitler's Aryan Herrenvolk ("Aryan master race"). Applicants were vetted for Nordic qualitiesâ€”in Himmler's words, [...] "like a nursery gardener trying to reproduce a good old strain which has been adulterated and debased; we started from the principles of plant selection and then proceeded quite unashamedly to weed out the men whom we did not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> use for the build-up of the SS." [...] Few dared mention that by his own standards, Himmler did not meet his own ideals.|$|E

500|$|Whole {{songs were}} {{sometimes}} played during battles. [...] The {{survivors of the}} disastrous Pickett's Charge returned under the tune Nearer My God to Thee. [...] At the Battle of Five Forks, Union musicians under orders from Sheridan played Stephen Foster's minstrel song Nelly Bly while being shot at on the front lines. [...] Samuel P. Heintzelman, {{the commander of the}} III Corps, saw many of his musicians standing at the back lines at the Battle of Williamsburg, and ordered them to play anything. [...] Their music rallied the Union forces, forcing the Confederate to withdraw. [...] It was said that music was the equivalent of [...] "a thousand men" [...] on one's side. [...] Robert E. Lee himself said, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have an army without music." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Eurocom {{worked on}} the 1999 shooter , none of its {{technology}} {{was used in the}} game. The new engine, which was completely created from scratch and adapted to fully take advantage of the Nintendo 64 strengths, is capable of delivering a fast and smooth frame rate while offering particle explosions, dynamic lighting effects, long draw distances, and other environmental effects like fog or smoke. Focusing on the game's frame rate and technical aspects was a major priority because developers wanted The World Is Not Enough to be the fastest first-person game on the Nintendo 64 system. According to Eurocom, [...] " [...] don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> push it much more than we have". In addition, with The World Is Not Enough being Eurocom's last Nintendo 64 game, the company saw it as [...] "a nice swan song to go out on." ...|$|E
500|$|Stefani had an {{emotional}} breakdown from difficulties collaborating {{with many other}} artists and songwriters, so No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal invited her to his house. Kanal {{had been working on}} a track, which later became [...] "Crash", the sixth single from the album. However, the two were unable to write anything following that, because they had differing ideas of how the music should sound. Stefani commented that [...] "it was just frustrating and embarrassing to sit there and <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> write songs." [...] Six months later, the two returned to work and came up with the beginnings of a song while working in Kanal's bedroom. The two experimented with combining various melodies and including what Stefani referred to as [...] "this really kinda fast rappy part". This was the last song she and Kanal wrote together for the album.|$|E

500|$|The band started {{recording}} the album in London {{a week after}} the September 11 attacks in the United States, during which their [...] "poignant songs ... garnered larger audiences". Coldplay had never stayed in London for an extended period before and were bombarded by problems focusing on the production process. They decided to relocate to Liverpool, where they had recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Lead singer Chris Martin said that once there they [...] "became obsessed with recording". [...] "In My Place" [...] was the first song recorded for the album and the one that the band released as the album's lead single [...] "because it was the song that made us want to do a second album. It kept us going and made us <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> still write songs", following [...] "a strange period of not really knowing what we were doing" [...] three months after the success of Parachutes.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} in the office, Arrington {{sponsored}} authors to write academic LDS Church histories. Among the best known works from this [...] "New Mormon History" [...] were two general Church histories, one aimed at LDS Church members, The Story of the Latter-day Saints, and one for interested outsiders, The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-day Saints. Arrington also granted liberal access to church archival material to both Mormon and non-Mormon scholars. Arrington continued to professionalize the archives with the systematic cataloging started by Joseph Fielding Smith. This era is sometimes referred to as [...] "Camelot" [...] due to its open and idealistic ethos. The division's output was not subject to the LDS Church's Correlation Program. The Correlation Program edited officially published church materials, like instruction manuals and magazines, to ensure that they presented a consistent message that LDS Church authorities agreed on. Arrington, Bitton, Allen, and Maureen Beecher served as a reading committee for the division's writings in place of formal Correlation approval. Arrington wanted to avoid the Correlation Program, stating that [...] "I do not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> determine the truth of what had happened in history by having the Quorum of the Twelve vote on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Cambridge won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station. [...] The race {{commenced}} at 3.40pm, in a [...] "slight drizzle". After a fast start, Cambridge took a half-length lead by Fulham. [...] Rounding the Middlesex bend, Oxford drew back into contention and the crews were level at the Mile Post {{in a time of}} 4 minutes 4 seconds. [...] On the approach to Harrods Furniture Depository, Painter, the Dark Blue cox, steered his boat so close to the Surrey shore that Douglas Calder, writing in The Times, suggested [...] "if the crews had gone any farther over they would have been practically on the towpath". After being warned twice by the umpire for steering too close to their opponents, and taking a small lead, Oxford were made to concede to the Light Blues, and Cambridge rallied. Despite rough water through Crabtree Reach, Cambridge pushed on at Hammersmith Bridge and opened an eight-second lead by the time the crews reached Chiswick Steps. [...] By Barnes Bridge they had extended their lead to twelve seconds, and passed the finishing post three-and-a-half lengths ahead in a time of 18 minutes 22 seconds. [...] It was the Light Blues' first victory in four years. [...] Their cox remarked [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have won on a foul if I had forced a collision at Harrods. [...] However, {{we did not want to}} win this way if we could help it. [...] I decided to give Oxford enough rope to hang themselves..." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} the first Hollywood {{production}} to be filmed with the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED Epic camera and was shot in 3-D at 5K resolution. Cinematographer John Schwartzman {{had this to say}} about the camera: [...] "Today was Epic, Monday December 6 marks the first day the Red Epic camera was used to shoot a major studio motion picture. I can say for certainty the camera does exist and boy is it ready for primetime, as a matter of fact it's a true game changer." [...] Schwartzman felt that the 3D would have been impossible without it. He said, [...] "I can tell you without these cameras it would be impossible to move a 3D rig in the ways that THIS story demands, if Jim and the crew hadn't made these cameras available to us I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have shot this movie the way our director envisioned it in 3D." [...] Webb wanted cameras small enough to fit on the rigs and swing around very fast, saying that the [...] "RED Epic cameras were the right cameras to do that." [...] Webb continued that [...] "you need to shoot it with a level of velocity and 3D cameras can be very large... and so we need those cameras to mount on rigs that could fly to the air and run to the streets in a certain pace. That allowed us to do it." [...] The Amazing Spider-Man climax was filmed in a 1:78:1 aspect ratio for its IMAX DMR release.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Rush" [...] has {{generally}} received critical acclaim from music critics. Rachel Brodsky of MTV gave a positive review towards the song, writing [...] "It's true -- we're not totally {{used to hearing}} Kelly exploring her country side (though she is from Texas, so go figure), but judging by the vocals on [...] "Don't Rush," [...] we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get used to Country Kelly". Sam Wilbur of AOL Radio complimented the song for being [...] "a feel-good track with a nostalgic, classic country feel". Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song four stars and a half, writing [...] "Itâ€™s difficult for a female vocalist to sound sexy without drawing criticism. Clarksonâ€™s voice is a wine and roses romance, instead of the wanton yearn of a beauty in a too-short skirt. The original â€˜American Idolâ€™ may have found her niche." [...] Michaelangelo Matos of New York Post gave the song three stars out of five and praised Clarkson for [...] "getting completely into character" [...] and successfully delivering the emotion of the song. Mark Blankenship of Logo complimented Clarkson for embracing her country side. Calling the song as [...] "a good song", he concluded his review by writing [...] "Even better, itâ€™s a flirty, seductive love song, not a furious break-up anthem, which is a nice change after ten years of Kellyâ€™s heartbroken rage." [...] Chuck Dauphin of Billboard ranked [...] "Don't Rush" [...] at number eight in his list of Top 10 Country Songs of 2012, writing [...] "One of the most luscious sounding love songs I have heard in a while. It's the definition of 'Ear Candy.' If youâ€™re not in love, you'll want to be after hear it." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his mission, Wilkinson {{finished}} his schooling {{and became a}} dentist instead. Wilkinson chalked up his personal success in life to his national championship season with Utah as a freshman.

2500|$|Regarding {{the live}} video, Ament said, [...] "Initially, {{it was a}} problem in terms of talking the record company into taking it seriously...That people didn't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> pull it off made us want to do it even more. We felt we could do a better version of it. Sonically, it's an {{inferior}} version of the song. But it's live."

2500|$|Nevertheless, Cowell {{said before}} the first live show that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> be heading for a train wreck," [...] {{referring}} {{to the fact that}} the public did not believe any of the final 12 this year were as good as Lewis, But he added, [...] "But if you take Leona out of the equation, they weren't that good last year. As a whole, we've probably got the most talented 12 we've had. We just haven't had the chance to showcase them properly yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Intelligence reports {{indicate}} that United States president Bill Clinton and his cabinet were aware before {{the height of the}} massacre that a [...] "final solution to eliminate all Tutsis" [...] was planned. However, fear of a repeat of the events in Somalia shaped US policy at the time, with many commentators identifying the graphic consequences of the Battle of Mogadishu as the key reason behind the US's failure to intervene in later conflicts such as the Rwandan Genocide. After the battle, the bodies of several US casualties of the conflict were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu by crowds of local civilians and members of Aidid's Somali National Alliance. According to the US's former deputy special envoy to Somalia, Walter Clarke: [...] "The ghosts of Somalia continue to haunt US policy. Our lack of response in Rwanda was a fear of getting involved in something like a Somalia all over again." [...] President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have ended the violence, but I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have cut it down. And I regret it." [...] Eighty percent of the discussion in Washington concerned the evacuation of American citizens.|$|E

2500|$|The Chiefs of Staff Committee {{concluded}} in May that if France collapsed, [...] "we do not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> continue {{the war with}} any chance of success" [...] without [...] "full economic and financial support" [...] from the United States of America. Although its government was sympathetic to Britain's plight, American public opinion at the time overwhelmingly supported isolationism to avoid US involvement in [...] "another European war". Reflecting this sentiment, Congress had passed the Neutrality Acts three years previously, which banned the shipment or sale of arms from the US to any combatant nation. Additionally, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was further constrained by the upcoming 1940 Presidential election, as his critics sought to portray him as being pro-war.|$|E
