40|$|This paper {{suggests}} an incipient approach to perform target detection {{as well as}} tracking for single and multiple moving objects in <b>thermal</b> <b>video</b> sequences. <b>Thermal</b> imaging is complimentary to visible imaging as it has capability to detect object in low light or dark conditions by detecting the infrared radiation of an object and creating an image which contains temperature information. The extracted regions are then used for performing the segmentation of targets in <b>thermal</b> <b>videos.</b> In projected method first, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is used for segmentation in <b>thermal</b> <b>videos.</b> Second, to enlarge the set of target proposals, DAG is initialized with an incremented object proposal set in which, from adjacent frames motion based predictions are used.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis involves {{the development of a}} video coding scheme which provides lossless Region Of Interest (ROl) coding specifically targeted toward the compression of <b>thermal</b> <b>video</b> sequences. In particular the scheme is designed to provide lossless coding of critical temperature data contained in <b>thermal</b> <b>video</b> sequences used within firefighting applications. High coding efficiency is achieved by the use of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based lossy coding for non-critical areas of the video sequence. The research is divided into three key sections; an investigation into <b>thermal</b> <b>video,</b> the practical development of a novel scheme for selective lossless compression of <b>thermal</b> <b>video</b> containing critical temperature data, and the presentation and analysis of test results which demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme. The scheme's multi-pass encoder stores data which enables the recovery of the losses which occur within critical thermal data {{as a result of the}} lossy DCT coding stage. This error recovery data is stored as codewords where each individual codeword is used to represent the error data for up to two pixels within the ROI. Efficient entropy coding of the error recovery data is achieved through a combination of a new adaptive reordering scheme followed by Run Length Coding (RLC) and Variable Length Coding (VLC). By storing these error recovery codes within the normally unused colour channels of a compressed video sequence, the compressed <b>thermal</b> <b>video</b> sequence can be transmitted as an MPEG- 1, MPEG- 2 and MPEG 4 compliant bitstream. This novel storage mechanism allows the error recovery codes to be spatially mapped to the ROl data, and hence the scheme can benefit from the motion compensation facilities provided within the MPEG compliant bitstream. Decoding of the lossy video sequence can be carried out using any MPEG compliant decoder. Lossless ROl decoding can be carried out using the special decoder described in, and provided with, the thesis...|$|R

Although new camera technologies, including <b>thermal</b> <b>video</b> sensors, may improve {{the performance of}} digital video-based sensors, their performance under various conditions has rarely been evaluated at multimodal facilities.

40|$|A {{constructive}} {{research methodology}} {{has been used}} to explore the use of thermal images for improving Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) performance. Previous research has shown that the addition of a visual modality for speech recognition improves ASR performance in both clean and noisy environments. However, Audio-Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (AVASR) performance can be greatly affected by changing lighting conditions. Conversely, thermal cameras are highly invariant to changes in lighting conditions as such the use of <b>thermal</b> <b>video</b> may be beneficial to AVASR. An AVASR system was created for testing the effect of adding a third modality to AVASR. Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) based speech recognition was used for audio speech recognition. For visual recognition, the standard <b>video</b> and <b>thermal</b> <b>video</b> were processed using a method derived from Wai Chee Yau’s (2008) proposed Motion Templates method of feature extraction. A custom audio visual database was created for this project. Eleven participants were recorded in audio, standard <b>video</b> and <b>thermal</b> <b>video</b> repeating ten words each (the numbers zero through nine) fifteen times to create a database of 1650 words for testing. Testing was completed using a speaker dependent, isolated word recognition system. For each participant 14 samples of each word were used for training Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with the remaining sample used for testing with Gaussian white noise added to the audio signal at 20, 10, 0, - 10 and - 20 decibel signal to noise ratios (SNR). This test was repeated five times with different samples selected for each test and the results averaged to reduce sample bias. It was successfully shown that combining audio, standard, and <b>thermal</b> <b>video</b> for ASR can improve performance by increasing recognition rates a relative 11. 8 % over audio and standard video combined ASR and a relative 38. 2 % over audio only ASR when averaged over all noise levels...|$|R

40|$|Undiscovered gas leaks, {{known as}} {{fugitive}} emissions, in chemical plants and refinery operations can impact regional air quality and present {{a loss of}} product for industry. Surveying a facility for potential gas leaks can be a daunting task. Industrial leak detection and repair programs can be expensive to administer. An efficient, accurate and cost effective method for detecting and quantifying gas leaks would both save industries money by identifying production losses and improve regional air quality. Specialized thermal video systems have proven effective in rapidly locating gas leaks. These systems, however, {{do not have the}} spectral resolution for compound identification. Passive FTIR spectrometers can be used for gas compound identification, but using these systems for facility surveys is problematic due to their small field of view.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify the {{relationship}} between the dosage parameters and temperature increase at the target tissues (up to 5 cm below the skin surface), and to explore the possibility of proposing a preliminary model to guide clinicians and researchers in determining treatment dosages based on expected increase in temperatures at the target tissue. Prior to the conduct of the main study several protocol-related issues were investigated. These included the reliability of the measurement procedures, the optimum speed of movement of the transducer, the optimum size of the treatment area, and the maximum output intensity that could be considered safe for treatment applications and investigations. An in-vitro post-mortem pig model was chosen for the experimental design using only adult-sized pigs, weighing between 60 to 80 kilograms. A total of 76 specimens were obtained from the shoulder and thigh sections of 19 pigs. The therapeutic ultrasound machine used throughout the study was the Omnisound 3000 TM (Physio Technology Inc., Topeka, Kansas, USA) Output from the Omnisound 3000 TM was checked and calibrated as necessary prior to each experiment using a power meter (Model UPM-DT- 10, Ohmnic Instruments Co., St. Michaels, Maryland 21663, USA). Calibration was only performed when the checks demonstrated an error in the output intensity of the machine exceeded ± 10 %. The Minolta spot thermometer (HT- 11, Minolta Co. Ltd., Japan) and the Avio <b>thermal</b> <b>video</b> <b>system</b> (TVS) 2000 TM (Nippon Avionics Co. Ltd., Japan) were used to measure the change in tissue temperatures (dependent variable) at the skin surface and subcutaneously (at l, 2, 3, 4 and 5 cm below skin surface) respectively. The prepared specimen was mounted on a fixed table, with the clean cross-section facing the infrared thermographic camera. The camera to specimen distance was standardised at 50 cm for all experiments. Markers corresponding to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 cm on the specimen were plotted on the display unit, and saved to a 3. 5 inch floppy disk. Measurements were recorded at baseline (prior to commencement of the experiment) and subsequently at 1 -minute intervals during 10 minutes of exposure to the ultrasound, and for a further 10 minutes post-exposure, until the end of the experiment at 20 minutes. In general, there were five main parameters for all the studies: the movement speed of the transducer, the size of the treatment, and the frequency, intensity and duration of exposure and post-exposure to ultrasound. These five parameters represented the independent variables for all the studies. The dependent variable throughout was change in tissue temperature (measured in °C) at the skin surface, and at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 cm below the skin surface. Data were analysed using the SPSS for Windows software, Version 10. 0 (SPSS Inc., 444 N Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA). Analyses of the data, using a repeated measures analysis of variance procedure, were performed on change in temperature, rather than actual temperature measured at selected time points. Only data from the 5 th, 10 th, 15 th, and 20 th minutes were analysed. This corresponded to the middle and end of the ultrasound exposure phase (5 th and 10 th minute) and post-exposure phase (15 th and 20 th minute), as these were considered to be representative of both these phases of data collection. Data for all 20 -minute sampling is provided in the table of means for each experiment. The level of statistical significance was set at 0. 05. Results of the reliability study showed that both the infrared spot thermometer and the video thermography unit were reliable within acceptable limits (as defined in this study). The latter, however, was more reliable than the former. In addition, the reliability was better for the post-exposure phase compared with the exposure phase, and for deeper tissues compared with the superficial and surface tissues. An unplanned analysis of the twenty minutes of data (at one minute intervals) suggested the possibility of reducing the duration factor from 20 to 4 (5 th, 10 th, 15 th and 20 th minute). In this manner, the data analyses for subsequent studies could be simplified considerably without affecting the overall results. Results of the other protocol-related studies showed that: a. There was no difference in change in temperatures between the slow (60 beats/min or 7 cm/s), moderate (120 beats/min or 14 cm/s) and fast (180 beats/min or 21 cm/s) movement speeds of the transducer. However, for practical reasons, the moderate speed was recommended for subsequent studies; b. There was a significant difference in change in temperatures between the small (2 X ERA), medium (3 X ERA) and large (4 X ERA) treatment sizes. The small treatment size provided the most effective and deeper heating, and was the recommended treatment size for subsequent studies; c. For both 1 and 3 MHz, tissue damage did not occur for intensities up to 1. 5 Watts/cm[superscript] 2. However, irreversible thermal injury to the tissues occurred at 2. 0 Watts/cm[superscript] 2 (1 MHz). Therefore, the recommended maximum intensity at which investigations could be carried out without any risks of thermal injury to the tissues was 1. 5 Watt s/cm[superscript] 2 for both 1 and 3 MHz. The results from the main study demonstrated that the increase in temperature due to absorption of the ultrasonic energy at any of the investigated target sites (up to 5 cm below surface) was related to the ultrasound frequency, intensity and duration of exposure. For the frequency factor, the evidence seems to suggest that compared with the 3 MHz ultrasound, the 1 MHz frequency may be more appropriate for clinical applications as it does not overheat surface tissues, and at the same time, is able to increase the temperatures of target tissues up to a depth of 5 cm. For the intensity factor, the results suggest that the therapeutic range of intensities which can be considered neither too low (as to be ineffective) nor too high (as to be damaging) are 0. 5 to 1. 3 Watts/cm 2 and 0. 3 to 0. 5 Watts/cm[superscript] 2 for 1 and 3 MHz respectively The narrow therapeutic range for 3 MHz could render it questionable for clinical applications. In contrast, the larger therapeutic range available for the 1 MHz frequency suggests that it is more suitable for clinical applications and research. For the duration factor, the results demonstrated that the temperatures at all tissue sites increased as the duration of exposure increased. However, for the post-exposure phase, while the superficial tissues decreased with time, the deeper tissues continued to increase in their temperatures, albeit gradually. In summary, the results demonstrated that a higher frequency, a higher intensity, a greater exposure time and a more superficial site all contribute to a greater change in mean temperature. From these results, a preliminary model to guide clinicians and researchers in determining treatment dosages, based on expected increase in tissue temperatures at the target site, was proposed. While the preliminary model provided is only a first step effort, it is hoped that it can be refined further through use by physical therapists and other users of therapeutic ultrasound...|$|E
