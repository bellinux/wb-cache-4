25|$|In {{order to}} aid Ferdinand (elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1619) against the Northern Protestants and {{to produce a}} balance in the Army of the Catholic League under Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, Wallenstein offered to raise a whole army for the {{imperial}} service following the bellum se ipsum alet principle, and received his final commission on 25 July 1625. Wallenstein's successes as a military commander brought him fiscal credit, which in turn enabled him to receive loans to buy lands, many of them being the former estates of conquered Bohemian nobles. He used his credit <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>loans</b> to Ferdinand II, which were repaid through lands and titles. Wallenstein's popularity soon recruited 30,000 (not long afterwards 50,000) men. The two armies worked together over 1625–27, at first against Mansfeld.|$|E

Lasting less than 21 months, the government faced riots due to a drivers' strike in Adelaide streets, and criticism of how Verran handled the problem. Considerable sums were spent on railways and harbours. The Advances for Homes Act of 1911 allowed the State Bank of South Australia <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>loans</b> to poorer people, but the Legislative Council would not support the government attempts to create state brickyards and timber mills. Relations between the assembly and the council were strained, with Verran petitioning the British parliament to veto the council's decision.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{association}} between bank-firm relationship {{and the use of}} derivatives, in term of decision to use or not to use derivatives as well as the extent of derivatives usage. We employ samples of non-financial companies listed in NIKKEI 225 index from 2005 - 2009. Using probit regression test, we find that bank-firm relationship and firm’s size positively induce the decision to use derivatives. Meanwhile, using tobit regression test, the result indicate that bank-firm relationship, firm’s size, leverage and dividend yield positively influence the magnitude of derivatives usage. The findings of our paper provide an empirical support for the hypothesis of Hakenes (2004) which argues that bank-firm relationship will benefit firm not only as the sources <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>loan,</b> but also as delegated risk manager which could assist the firm in designing the appropriate hedging instrument...|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} CRR, banks are {{required}} to maintain liquid assets {{in the form of}} gold, cash and approved securities. Higher liquidity ratio forces commercial banks to maintain a larger proportion of their resources in liquid form and thus reduces their capacity <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>loans</b> and advances, thus it is an anti-inflationary impact. A higher liquidity ratio diverts thebank funds from loans and advances to investment in government and approved securities. In well-developed economies, central banks use open market operations—buying and selling of eligible securities by the central bank in the money market—to influence the volume of cash reserves with commercial banks and thus influence the volume of loans and advances they can make to the commercial and industrial sectors. In the open money market, government securities are traded at market-related rates of interest. The RBI is resorting more to open market operations in the more recent years.
