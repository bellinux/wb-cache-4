5|$|Left {{to run its}} course, this tidal drag would {{continue}} until the spin of Earth and the orbital period of the Moon matched, creating mutual tidal locking between the two.

However, the Sun will become a red giant engulfing the Earth-Moon system long before this occurrence.|$|E

5|$|While a great {{solution}} for the actors' performances the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> the Bolivian desert, and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight Dalsa Origin cameras (supported by seven HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was {{used to create a}} virtual camera with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at Double Negative developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in a synthetic environment as seen by a synthetic camera.|$|E

500|$|The {{definition}} of planet, since {{the word was}} coined by the ancient Greeks, has included within its scope {{a wide range of}} celestial bodies.

500|$|Fears were {{as high as}} ever {{among the}} traumatised fire victims, fear of foreign arsonists and of a French and Dutch invasion. There was an {{outbreak}} of general panic on Wednesday night in the encampments at Parliament Hill, Moorfields, and Islington. A light in <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> Fleet Street started a story that 50,000 French and Dutch immigrants had risen, widely rumoured to have started the fire, and were marching towards Moorfields to finish what the fire had begun: to cut the men's throats, rape the women, and steal their few possessions. Surging into the streets, the frightened mob fell on any foreigners whom they happened to encounter, and were only appeased, according to Evelyn, [...] "with infinite pains and great difficulty" [...] and pushed back into the fields by the Trained Bands, troops of Life Guards, {{and members of the}} court.|$|E
500|$|After the 1883 {{eruption}} of the Krakatoa volcano, weather watchers tracked and mapped {{the effects on}} <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> several years. They labelled the phenomenon the [...] "equatorial smoke stream". In the 1920s, a Japanese meteorologist, Wasaburo Oishi, detected the jet stream from a site near Mount Fuji. [...] He tracked pilot balloons, also known as pibals (balloons used to determine upper level winds), as they rose into the atmosphere. Oishi's work largely went unnoticed outside Japan because {{it was published in}} Esperanto. American pilot Wiley Post, the first man to fly around the world solo in 1933, is often given some credit for discovery of jet streams. Post invented a pressurized suit that let him fly above [...] In the year before his death, Post made several attempts at a high-altitude transcontinental flight, and noticed that at times his ground speed greatly exceeded his air speed.|$|E

500|$|Knowledge of {{the events}} faded: in 1622 when the Danish diplomat Peder Galt asked for {{the meaning of the}} signs in the painting, he could get no replies {{anywhere}} in the city. He translated the Swedish text then accompanying the painting to Latin — [...] "Anno 1535 1 Aprilis hoc ordine sex cœlo soles in circulo visi Holmie a septima matutina usque ad mediam nonam antermeridianam" [...] — and concluded that the real sun represented Gustav Vasa and the other suns his successors, an assumption he thought confirmed by contemporary Swedish history. Even this confused report was soon forgotten and in 1632 the halo display in the painting was described in a German leaflet as three beautiful rainbows, a ball, and an eel hanging in <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> the Swedish capital day and night for four weeks in 1520, furthermore interpreted as a prophecy announcing the forthcoming liberation of Protestant Germany by [...] "the Lion from the North" [...] (i.e. King Gustavus Adolphus).|$|E
500|$|In the Solar System, {{the planets}} and the Sun lie roughly {{within the same}} flat plane, known as {{the plane of the}} ecliptic. From our {{perspective}} on Earth, the ecliptic is the path taken by the Sun across <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> the course of the year. The twelve constellations that line the ecliptic are known as the zodiacal constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called [...] "precession", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a spinning top wobbles as it slows down. Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a Great Year, the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac. In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the March equinox, one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation Pisces moving back into Aquarius. This signaled the end of one astrological age (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the Age of Aquarius).|$|E
500|$|Krøyer's Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach, one of {{the best}} known of his works, shows many of the Skagen artists {{standing}} around the traditional Sankt Hans Aften bonfire. He had been working on the huge painting (...) for years before he finally completed it in 1906. Marie is standing next to a fishing boat with her new lover, Hugo Alfvén, the Swedish composer, just {{to the left of the}} flames that seem to stream towards them. Despite Alfvén's affair with Marie, Krøyer had welcomed him to the house in Skagen and appeared to tolerate their relationship. The painting is Krøyer's last major work. The preparatory pastel sketch on which it is based was produced in a couple of hours, but the painting was completed with difficulty as not only had Krøyer spent several lengthy periods in a mental hospital from 1900 but he had also begun to lose his sight, particularly in one eye. He was not altogether happy with the finished product; he thought it had become [...] "too dark" [...] and felt it did not capture the [...] "pale radiance" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>over</b> Skagen on Midsummer Eve. Although it is an important work in the Skagens Museum collection it is not considered to be among the best of the group portraits produced by the Skagen Painters or even by Krøyer himself. In contrast, writing in Kristeligt Dagblad, Morten Rasmussen reports that the work is considered by many to be Krøyer's [...] "Magnum Opus", representing a reflection of his own life and a tribute to the people who contributed to his success. Marie left Krøyer for Alfvén in 1902, but it was not until 1905 when she was pregnant with Alfvén's child that Krøyer finally agreed to a divorce.|$|E
