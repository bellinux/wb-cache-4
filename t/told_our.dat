Sasha Fierce), Kanye West (808s & Heartbreak), and Guns N' Roses (Chinese Democracy) had already set release dates, the only one available was six weeks later than expected. The album was made available for streaming on December 8. It was soon announced that a new release date for Folie was December 16, 2008. Although December 16 was not an ideal date according to demographic marketing analysis, Stump said [...] "we put our eight feet down [...] <b>told</b> <b>our</b> label it must come out this year." ...|$|E
500|$|Days {{after the}} verdict, a The Times of India {{headline}} hailed Chanderpati, who struggled years for justice, as [...] "Mother Courage" [...] for having done [...] "what even top politicians and bureaucrats have {{shied away from}} doing—taken on the dreaded khap panchayats." [...] Chanderpati now lives with her two daughters and remaining son {{under the protection of}} two policemen. She withdrew her daughter Rekha from public school and sent Vinod to a school in another district. Chanderpati also reported threats from villagers, [...] "The villagers have threatened to eliminate us. I am enemy number one and my son is a culprit. We've been <b>told</b> <b>our</b> ordeal can end if we withdraw the police case but we refused. So, the nightmare continues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then Australian coach Bob Dwyer, in The Winning Way, wrote that, [...] "I had noticed... {{that the}} American cover defence {{was intent on}} getting across to the winger, which meant it left huge holes inside. I <b>told</b> <b>our</b> players to try putting up a centre kick, which they did with resounding success." [...] Campese set up Andrew Slack for Australia's fourth try in this Test by utilising a centre kick as Slack {{streamed}} through the midfield.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas also deplored {{the secular}} {{objection}} to birth control because it originated from [...] "racial and national" [...] group-think. [...] "The white race, we are <b>told,</b> <b>our</b> own nation—whatever that nation may be—is endangered by practicing birth control. Birth control {{is something like}} disarmament—a good thing if effected by international agreement, but otherwise dangerous to us in both a military and economic sense. If we {{are not to be}} overwhelmed by the 'rising tide of color' we must breed against the world. If our nation is to survive, it must have more cannon and more babies as prospective food for the cannon." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to Plame's testimony, Republican Senators Kit Bond, Orrin Hatch, Richard Burr submitted additional views to the Senate report that stated [...] "Mrs. Wilson told the CIA Inspector General that she suggested {{her husband for}} the trip, she <b>told</b> <b>our</b> committee staff {{that she could not}} remember whether she did or her boss did, and told the House Committee, emphatically, that she did not suggest him." [...] Also in the additional views is the full text of an e-mail message sent by Plame on February 12, 2002, to the Directorate of Operations at CPD, in which she writes that Joe Wilson [...] "may {{be in a position to}} assist" [...] the CIA's inquiries into the Niger reports.|$|E
2500|$|Alexander P. Butterfield, the White House aide {{best known}} for {{revealing}} the existence of Nixon's taping system, told The Hartford Courant in 1995, [...] "I {{think it was a}} guy named Mark Felt." [...] In July 1999, Felt was identified as Deep Throat by the Hartford Courant, citing Chase Culeman-Beckman, a nineteen-year-old from Port Chester, New York. Culeman-Beckman said Jacob Bernstein, the son of Carl Bernstein and Nora Ephron, had told him the name at summer camp in 1988, and that Jacob claimed he had been told by his father. Felt denied the identification to the Courant saying [...] "No, it's not me. I would have done better. I would have been more effective. Deep Throat didn't exactly bring the White House crashing down, did he?" [...] Bernstein said his son didn't know. [...] "Bob and I have been wise enough never to tell our wives, and we've certainly never <b>told</b> <b>our</b> children." [...] (Bernstein reiterated on June 2, 2005, on the Today Show that his wife had never known.) ...|$|E

2500|$|UK band, Deep Purple {{went home}} with $60,000 (2013:$382,202), while most local groups went home empty handed. AC/DC {{allegedly}} refused to play after Deep Purple roadies provoked a fistfight with them. According to Deep Purple's lead vocalist, David Coverdale, [...] "Apparently, a young Aussie band had jumped onstage, plugged into our gear and started playing! Well, all hell broke loose, from what I was <b>told.</b> <b>Our</b> roadies (big buggers to a man) wrestled with the young band {{to get them off}} our equipment and off the stage. Chaos and frolics ensued". Jim Keays performed his solo concept album The Boy from the Stars. Keays and his band were reportedly the only act to have been paid for their appearance, having arranged an outside sponsorship. Later in the year, Deep Purple planned a tour for 1976 and after the Australian Musicians Union [...] "made it clear ... that the proposed tour of Deep Purple could lead to considerable unrest" [...] the UK band placed money into a fund so that artists appearing at Sunbury '75 were paid the full musician's rate.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] he said, [...] "my lord, {{now seems}} to remain in which I can render any assistance; permit me to look after a duty of humanity--the Knight of Ardenvohr, as I am <b>told,</b> is <b>our</b> prisoner, and {{severely}} wounded." ...|$|R
