With age, however, George I argued with his sons and Olga lamented the quarrels that divided the family periodically. In private, Olga and George I conversed in German because it was the only language they both spoke at the time of their marriage. With their offspring, they spoke mainly English, although the children were required to speak Greek among themselves, and Prince Andrew refused to speak anything but Greek to his parents.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of this Supermom ideal, {{cultural}} contradictions of motherhood widely exist. Working mothers are often critiqued for being selfish and not spending enough <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> They defend their position by saying they work to support their children economically. Homemakers are often critiqued for not pursuing meaningful careers. They respond by saying that the childcare and other domestic work they do for their families is much more important. Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution for most women.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} early child development on maternal labor force participation using data from teacher assessments. Mothers might react to having a poorly developing child by {{dropping out of the}} formal labor force in order to spend more <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child,</b> or they could potentially increase their labor supply to be able to provide the funds for better education and health resources. Which action dominates is therefore the empirical question we seek to answer in this paper. Importantly, we control for the potential endogeneity of child development by using an instrumental variables approach, uniquely exploiting exogenous variation in child development associated with child handedness. We find that having a poorly developing young child reduces the probability that a mother will participate in the labor market by about 25 percentage points.

25|$|Though the {{simultaneous}} bilingual child learns two languages at once, {{this does not}} mean that he or she speaks them with identical competence. It is common for young simultaneous bilinguals to be more proficient in one language than the other, and this is probably related to each child's relative exposure to each language; for example, many bilingual children are more proficient in the mother's than the father's language, arguably because their mothers assume most of the childcare responsibilities and/or simply spend more <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> The dominant language is almost always the language spoken by the greatest number of the people the child interacts with (generally the language the child is educated in). The child sees this language as most effective and begins to favor it. However, their dominant language need not be their L1. In addition, it is possible to show language dominance in one language for one domain and dominance in the other language for another domain. For example, a child may be dominant in his or her L1 at home, but in the school context, his or her L2 becomes the dominant language being used.|$|E

50|$|Daddy's Roommate {{was one of}} {{the first}} children's books to portray {{homosexuality}} in a positive light; the two men in the book do the same things heterosexual couples do: Take care of the house, argue, and spend <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> Consequently, the book has become one of the most challenged books in recent years with the American Library Association listing it at number 2 in their list of the 100 most challenged books from 1990-1999. Lon Mabon launched an anti-gay campaign attempting to amend the Oregon state constitution to allow discrimination against lesbians and gay men. He used Heather Has Two Mommies and Daddy's Roommate as evidence of a militant homosexual agenda. However, citizens of Oregon voted on November 3, 1992, and the measure was defeated. Despite its challenges, this book won a Lambda Literary Analysis book award under the Gay Men's Small Press category.|$|R

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{there have}} been no statutory maternity leave provisions in Australian workplaces and the recently instituted statutory leave does not benefit all employees. A prospective panel study of Australian first-time mothers was recruited in the last trimester of pregnancy and followed for the next year to consider how intentions to return to work may change after birth and the factors that influence any changes. Before birth, nearly all the mothers intended to return to work, although their postnatal practices were affected by the availability of maternity leave and condition of work. Less education and limited maternity leave were predictive of the intention, and actual, early return to work. These mothers, breastfed for shorter periods and <b>their</b> <b>children</b> were likely to be in childcare for longer periods each day. Women with the highest levels of education were likely to have jobs with more family-friendly structures and this security of future employment allowed these women to delay their return to work. Across all of the mothers, there was a gap between expected timing of return and actual return, as they weighed work hours and responsibilities, against <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> Changes came about after reassessing priorities, and comparing the desire to spend <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child,</b> the quality of care available and job availability. Having a more difficult child increased the hours that mothers worked. Mothers’ attitudes to maternal employment changed over <b>time,</b> <b>with</b> benefits being perceived similarly over time, whereas the costs became less apparent. However, mothers working longer hours perceived greater costs, rather than benefits, for themselves and <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> In addition, mothers who believed that there were greater costs of employment {{were more likely to be}} depressed over time, whereas higher rating of benefits and workplace support of the mother, lead to greater work satisfaction and her retention in the workplace. The decision to return to work after having a child is more complex than simply being a period away from work. Return to work is complicated by the desire to stay with the child, the child’s temperament, and the quality of care that was available for the child, in addition to the nature of work and the benefits that work provided. Supporting mothers, and by extension <b>their</b> partners and <b>children,</b> by providing adequate maternity leave benefits and family-friendly structures will ensure that women can balance their work and family roles and is insurance for employee retention...|$|R
