5|$|Under the 1951 City Charter, Philadelphia elects a City Controller <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{head of an}} {{independent}} auditing department. The Controller approves all payments made {{out of the city}} treasury and audits the executive departments.

5|$|By the 18th century, Mersea Fort was in ruins. The fishery {{rules were}} {{reinforced}} by fresh legislation in 1758, which created {{a court of}} conservancy to oversea the oyster stocks. Officially, this court was supposed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fort, but rather than using the now dilapidated earthworks, it began to meet in Colchester's Moot Hall. Instead, a ceremony began to take place each year at the Mersea Stone, near to the fort, involving local dignitaries and extensive eating and drinking. The fort was recommissioned during the Napoleonic Wars {{at the start of}} the 19th century, and a new gun battery was constructed overlooking the sea, equipped with six 24-pounder (10.9kg) guns. After this the fort was abandoned once again. A sea wall was built along the coast early in the century, cutting through the south-east side of the fort. The legislation on oysters was reformed by Parliament in 1870, which disbanded the previous court structure and severed the historic link with Mersea Fort. A defensive pill-box was constructed at the castle during the Second World War.|$|E

When the 1820 Settlers arrived in Port Elizabeth, the fort was already ancient and had never fired a shot from its guns and still has not.|$|R

5|$|The {{chessboard}} {{on the top}} of {{the cabinet}} was thin enough to allow for a magnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the board. This allowed the director inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the director to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move. The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.|$|E

25|$|After work, {{the philosopher}} would often relax by {{watching}} Westerns, where he preferred <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> very {{front of the}} cinema, or reading detective stories especially the ones written by Norbert Davis.

25|$|Rabbi Ziemba {{was brought}} up in the Gerrer chasidus by his {{grandfather}} and remained a loyal chasid his entire life. Even years later when he was world-renowned as a Torah scholar, Posek and master of Hasidic thought, he still considered himself a simple Chasid of the rebbe of Ger. When he visited Ger, he was called by his first name and refused <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Rebbe's top table, an honour reserved for visitors of note.|$|E

In September 1791, after king Louis XVI approved the new constitution, the National Constituent Assembly disbanded, and Latouche-Tréville resumed his naval activities.|$|E
25|$|Kyrie Eleison. When the celebrant has {{finished}} reciting the Introit, he recites, again {{independently of the}} choir, the Kyrie Eleison alternately with the Master of Ceremonies (the other sacred ministers may join in with the M.C.)

25|$|In 1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) refused {{permission}} for Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in their Constitution Hall.

Constitution Hall also {{did not have the}} segregated public bathrooms required by DC law at the time for such events. The District of Columbia Board of Education also declined a request to use the auditorium of a white public high school.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of a shift in low positions, the thumb of the left hand moves up or down the neck of the {{instrument}} so as to remain in the same position relative to the fingers (though the movement of the thumb may occur slightly before, or slightly after, the movement of the fingers). In such positions, the thumb is often thought of as an 'anchor' whose location defines what position the player is in. In very high positions, the thumb is unable to move with the fingers as the body of the instrument gets in the way. Instead, the thumb works around the neck of the instrument <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> point at which the neck meets the right bout of the body, and remains there while the fingers move between the high positions.|$|E

I'd bring in 'My Generation'. At {{the end of the}} song, the drums go nuts. 'My Generation' was a turning point for me because before that it was all the Charlie Watts and Ringo type of thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Bishop's {{undergraduate}} {{work with}} Hickson {{was her first}} major research effort, concerning the reproduction of Spirostomum ambiguum, a large ciliate that {{has been described as}} [...] "wormlike". In 1923, while working at Manchester University, Bishop was appointed an honorary research fellow. In 1924, she became a part-time instructor for the Department of Zoology at Cambridge, one of only two women, both of whom were sometimes marginalised. For example, she was not allowed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table with the men of the department at tea: instead, she sat on a first-aid kit. There, Bishop continued her work with Spirostomum as the only protozoologist on the faculty.|$|E

50|$|The 1971 Miami Dolphins {{season was}} the team's sixth, and {{second in the}} National Football League (NFL). The team {{improved}} on their 10-4 record from 1970 and finished 10-3-1. The Dolphins opened the season tying the Denver Broncos, the first season opener in NFL history to end in a tie, before splitting their next 2 games <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> 1-1-1. <b>The</b> Dolphins then won 8 in a row <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> 9-1-1. <b>The</b> Dolphins won their first division title, finishing first in the AFC East, and then defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round in 2 overtimes, the game is considered the longest in NFL history by time, and then advanced to their first ever AFC championship game, where they defeated the reigning champion Colts, 21-0, {{and went on to}} play in Super Bowl VI, their first Super Bowl berth. However, in the Super Bowl, Miami was walloped 24-3 by Dallas.|$|R
500|$|According to Sánchez, {{when she}} began blogging, Cubans, by law, were not allowed into tourist hotels, but with her “European” appearance, and ability to speak German, she {{routinely}} managed {{to get past the}} gatekeepers to work on her blog. [...] Due to the difficulties in accessing the Internet, her access speed is determined by the speed of the bus that connects to La Víbora at Línea and G. [...] "Each post depends on a countless chain of events that normally don’t go well. From my isolated PC to a flash memory and then to the public space of a cybercafé or a hotel. For this, without detailing all the complications, the elevator does not work, the gatekeeper asks me to show my passport <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> computer, or there are frustrations to sign on, plus the slow-speeds imposed by proxies, filters and keylogger." ...|$|E
500|$|Determined {{to improve}} his family's behavior, Homer {{attempts}} to get them <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table properly, which goes awry as the family prefers to eat while watching TV. When Marge, Bart and Lisa claim there's nothing wrong with them, he decides to prove to them {{that there is something}} wrong. He takes them {{on a tour of the}} neighborhood, peeking through living room windows to observe how happy families spend time together. The rest of the Simpsons are unnerved by Homer's sudden rash behavior along with unnecessarily spying on their neighbors and retreat quickly back to the safety of their own home. Depressed by the outing, he stops by Moe's Tavern for a drink. After getting into a fight with Barney, Homer later sees a commercial for Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center. Dr. Monroe guarantees [...] "family bliss or double your money back." [...] This gives Homer an idea {{to improve his}} family's behavior.|$|E
