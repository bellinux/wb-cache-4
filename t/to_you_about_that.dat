500|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{used his}} pre-match {{interview}} {{to state that}} his previous wins in the tournament had changed the way that clubs approach the League Cup: [...] "Lots of teams have followed us since then when we took the League Cup as a real competition, as a real challenge. It is a big competition." [...] He separated the final from the league season, saying, [...] "I don't think if we win the cup final we will win the league, or if we lose it we will lose the league." [...] He refused to discuss the suspension of Matić, dismissing it with [...] "If I speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> I promise you I will be in big trouble". Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly, he criticised players who dive, despite not naming any names. Mourinho also claimed that in after leaving Chelsea {{for the first time}} in September 2007, he was approached to manage Tottenham by chairman Daniel Levy, and again in 2012.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} wishing to speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> very thing,' said John. 'I {{think you may}} be in danger of putting {{yourself}} {{between him and his}} wife.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I'm trying <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> if you'd only shut up {{a second}} and let me talk. You don't give a fellow a chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don’t <b>you</b> talk <b>to</b> me," [...] roars Bill. [...] "If I choose <b>to</b> knock <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that’s</b> my business, ain’t it? Besides, {{you know}} very well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, cook, {{there is}} no chance. I forgot <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> little matter. The boy was here {{yesterday}} and he refused--absolutely declined a splendid offer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't sniff at Aunt Lora, Bailey," [...] said Ruth. [...] "I've had {{to speak}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> before. What's the matter? What has sent you flying up here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Slidder," [...] said I, really grieved, for I saw by his earnest {{face that}} he meant it, [...] "would you go and steal after all I have said <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> sin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I {{am going}} to begin to talk," [...] he said. [...] "Don't look as though {{you were going to}} run away, because you're not. I {{am going to}} talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> fellow Maraton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "’Ah, yes,’ ses Smith, {{looking as}} though ’e’d just remembered something. ’I wanted <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> see if I’ve done right. I’m glad you’ve come in.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The point is," [...] I continued, [...] "not {{having seen}} {{you with your}} clothes off, {{nevertheless}} I am able <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> scar above your right elbow, and that scar on your right ankle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, not entirely, sir," [...] {{answered}} Peters, unabashed; [...] "there's {{another little}} thing I wished <b>to</b> speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about,</b> and <b>that's</b> this"--saying which, {{he laid the}} Bishop's bag before the Canon and told his story.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you go getting alarmed! And don't you," [...] added Webster, [...] "go shoving your oar in {{when your}} social {{superiors}} are talking! I've {{had to speak}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> before. My remarks were addressed to Mrs. Withers here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, we do,' {{replied the}} robber; 'we {{have come to}} speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> guitar. It is your fault that we have murdered all our wives; and, though we played as you told us, none of them ever came back to life.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} searching for it for years," [...] Mark replied. [...] "Our lawyer, Prendergast, wrote <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> box; at least, he wrote to you asking {{if you had any}} {{property}} belonging to Colonel Thorndyke, and your people wrote to say they hadn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it is true," [...] {{answered}} the young man. [...] "I came <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> very thing, and <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> {{that there is}} to be a meeting outside the big hut to-day. We shall want your advice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ahem [...] . Anne, I've {{been wanting}} <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> little matter we were {{discussing}} the other day. I've decided not to let my fences to that company after all. A society with an aim like yours ought to be encouraged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, but doctor, there's the will, it's already made. I don't want <b>to</b> consult <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> {{are named}} as executor, {{and if you}} have the heart to refuse to act when I'm dead, why, of course, you can do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} {{to say a few}} words <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> money this morning, commandant: by the by, they had better be said now. My lord bishop, do you know that had we not taken this ship when we did, you had lost not merely money, as you have now, but life itself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, Mr. Vine," [...] Weiss said slowly, [...] "this isn't {{the country}} or the age for Don Quixotes. Fight against our Trusts and our {{monetary}} system with all your eloquence, if you will, but don't tamper with things you don't understand, or you may do harm where you meant to do good. Now what can we say <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> document?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About his French reading, Mrs. Brook?" [...] Mitchy {{responded with}} interest. [...] "The worse things are, {{let me just}} mention <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> the better they seem {{positively}} to be for one's feeling up in the language. They're more difficult, the bad ones--and there's a lot in that. All the young men know it--those who are going up for exams." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Belding, I think you're {{taking the}} wrong {{view of the}} matter. I'm going to develop this valley. You'd do better to get in with me. I've a {{proposition}} <b>to</b> make <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> strip of land of yours facing the river." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't {{think you}} need let the want of money enough to buy {{a few miles of}} wire prevent your putting up a really useful line," [...] said Mr. Martin; [...] "our company would be willing <b>to</b> help <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> I'm sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We came <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> <b>about</b> a man {{who called}} <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> last night, a Mr. Job Haskers," [...] said Dave, after a pause, during which the {{visitors}} seated themselves. [...] "Perhaps it is none of our business, Mr. Fordham, but my chums and I here felt it our duty <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, all right, all right!" [...] said Sir Mallaby. [...] "I don't want it all. Life is real! Life is earnest, Sam. I want {{to speak}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> when I've {{finished}} answering these infernal letters. Where was I? 'We should be glad to meet you at any time, if you will make an appointment...' Bingley-on-the-Sea! Good heavens! Why Bingley-on-the-Sea? Why not Margate, while you are about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However, I did {{not come}} to talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> As I said before, I know nothing of the squire's affairs, and, as a matter of course, I do not ask you to tell me. But I am sure you will agree with me in this, that, as a mother, I cannot but be {{interested}} about my only son," [...] and Lady Arabella put her cambric handkerchief to her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are faults {{enough in}} my life," [...] Saton answered. [...] "I have never denied it. But I {{have had to}} fight with {{my back to the}} wall. I shall win. I am not afraid of a {{thousand}} Mr. Rochesters. I am gathering to my hands--no, I will not talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that!</b> Lois, I am more anxious about you than Mr. Rochester. I am afraid that you will hate me for always now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not just yet. I've {{several things}} <b>to</b> talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about.</b> Sit down. <b>That's</b> right. Now cover up your poor little pink ankles, or you'll be catching----" ...|$|R
60|$|L. Stop! {{that puts}} me {{in mind of}} {{something}} I had <b>to</b> show <b>you,</b> <b>about</b> minerals <b>that</b> are like hair I want a hair out of Tittie's tail.|$|R
5000|$|I pray {{remember}} what I saide <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Curtius <b>that</b> if the king my deare Brother will not {{keep him in}} his service, he may be dismissed with his favour, and {{the sooner the better}} for the poore man is there London on his own purse and cannot be paid what is owing of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because you are here," [...] the Marquis affirmed. [...] "Baron, I {{meant to}} speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> man before we parted. There is no great work done without difficulties. The {{greatest}} difficulty {{you will have}} to face in your new life is that man. It is very possible that you may find within the course of a few months that your whole career, your very life, has developed into a duel à outrance with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've just discovered," [...] Dauncey continued, [...] "that Dane Montague and Littleham have {{an option}} on the Water and Electric Light Company. I don't suppose they {{said a word}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> You found {{the money to buy}} the land, all right, but they're going to make the bulk of the profit {{out of the water and}} lighting. That young lawyer at Cropstone gave us a word of warning, you remember, the day we were over there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can see 'em, Muster Fenwick, in course. It don't make no odds about dinner. But I was wanting {{just to say}} a word <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> poor young ooman there." [...] This he said in a slow, half-hesitating voice, {{as though}} he could hardly bring himself to speak of the unfortunate one to whom he alluded. The Vicar muttered some word of assent, and then the miller went on. [...] "You knows, of course, as how she be back here at the mill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what use}} can I be to you?" [...] the doctor asked. [...] "You {{know all about}} the man whom I fixed up {{on the night of}} the murder. There's nothing more <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I'd as soon go up to town and lunch with you as not, but if you think that I've {{anything}} more <b>to</b> tell <b>you,</b> you'll only be disappointed." ...|$|R
60|$|COKESON. [Looking at the CHAPLAIN {{over his}} spectacles] Ye-es, but I wanted <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> special. He had hopes they'd have let her {{come and see}} him, but they haven't. Of course he asked me questions. I did my best, but I couldn't tell the poor young fellow a lie, with him in here--seemed like hitting him. But I'm afraid it's made him worse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I wish he'd struck {{you more}} on an average," [...] {{interrupted}} Miss Port. [...] "But there's no use talkin' {{any more about}} it. I hired a horse and a carriage and a boy {{to come out here}} this mornin' <b>to</b> ask <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> man. And what's come of it? You haven't got a single thing to tell anybody except that he's big." ...|$|R
