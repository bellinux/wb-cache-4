5|$|With the {{expiration}} of the permit {{to use the}} site, and neither a current plan permission nor application for a mosque, the building's future appeared uncertain. In February 2010, Newham Council tried <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> existing temporary facility by serving an enforcement notice on the owners. However, this was overturned on appeal and a two-year extension granted {{for the use of}} the site.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After the routine maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several hours on the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
50|$|From 1912 to 1990, {{death row}} was housed at Central Correctional Institution in Columbia.

Due to his weight, Homer gets lodged in the water slide mid-course and the park's rescue crew are forced <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> ride and remove him {{with the help of}} a large crane. Homer is made a fool of on the news for his massive size and admits that he needs to lose weight.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} depression, the storm moved rapidly through the Lesser Antilles; consequently, most islands only experienced minor effects. For example, Saint Lucia received light and sporadic rain showers, accompanied by sustained winds of 20–25mph (32–40km/h) and gusts to 35mph (55km/h). In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, however, the depression dropped up to 9.2inches (235mm) {{of rain in}} 24hours. The rainfall blocked storm drains, including those near the airport, which was forced <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> rainfall caused debris to collect on roads throughout the island. Although the storm passed just 70miles (110km) north of the Yucatán Peninsula, the storm dropped only 0.6inches (15mm) of rain due to its small size.|$|E
5|$|Back in Washington, both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, {{who does not}} believe their claims. McGrath offers an {{especially}} harsh reprimand to Mulder, and presents written testimony by Henderson claiming that Max's {{body was found in}} a cargo container. McGrath and his disciplinary board decide <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but the decision is vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels it would be more dangerous for them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E
50|$|In February 2006, {{the federal}} courts in Brazil gave Cargill six months to {{complete}} the environmental assessment. This ruling came {{as part of a}} broader popular backlash against the port; while it was initially supported by locals who hoped for jobs, opinion has turned against it as the jobs have not appeared. In July 2006, federal prosecutor Felícia Pontes Jr. suggested that the government was close <b>to</b> <b>shutting</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> port.|$|R

5|$|In 1905 {{there were}} 19 {{fatalities}} nationwide. President Theodore Roosevelt reportedly threatened <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> game if drastic changes were not made. However, the threat by Roosevelt to eliminate football is disputed by sports historians. What is absolutely {{certain is that}} on October 9, 1905, Roosevelt held a meeting of football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Though he lectured on eliminating and reducing injuries, he never threatened to ban football. He also lacked the authority to abolish football and was, in fact, actually {{a fan of the}} sport and wanted to preserve it. The President's sons were also playing football at the college and secondary levels at the time.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, Marburger became {{president}} of Brookhaven Science Associates, which subsequently won a bid to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory for the federal government, and he became {{the director of the}} lab. He took office after a highly publicized scandal in which tritium leaked from the lab's High Flux Beam Reactor, leading to calls by activists <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> lab. Rather than directly oppose the activists, Marburger created policies that improved the environmental management of the lab as well as community involvement and transparency. Marburger also presided over the commissioning of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, expanded the lab's program in medical imaging and neuroscience, and placed more emphasis on its technology transfer program.|$|E
5|$|In the Crystal City, Virginia {{headquarters}} of the software company Eurisko, founder Brad Wilczek {{and chief executive officer}} Benjamin Drake argue about downsizing measures. After Wilczek leaves, Drake writes a memo proposing <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Central Operating System, a computer which runs the Eurisko Building. Seeing this through a surveillance camera, the COS sets up a trap and lures Drake into a bathroom, locking the door behind him. Drake tries to use his keycard to open it, but it rejects the card.

50|$|In 2003, Cargill {{completed}} a port for processing soya in Santarém in the Amazon region of Brazil, dramatically increasing soya {{production in the}} area and, according to Greenpeace, speeding up deforestation of local rain forest. In February 2006, the federal courts in Brazil gave Cargill six months to complete an environmental assessment (EA). Initially supported by job-seeking locals, public opinion turned against the port as jobs have not appeared. In July 2006, the federal prosecutor indicated they were close <b>to</b> <b>shutting</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> port.|$|R
5|$|Silver Reef's {{residents}} {{rebuilt the}} businesses {{that had been}} destroyed, but the town soon began to decline. In 1881, the Stormont Mining Company and the Barbee & Walker Mining Company had to decrease wages from $4 per day to $3.50 per day in all of their mines except the Savage mine (a Stormont property). In response to the decrease in wages, the Silver Reef Miners Union was formed. In February 1881, union members began talking about striking the mines, and as word of this potential strike spread, the Stormont Mining Company discharged those of its miners {{who were part of}} the Miners Union. In response, the discharged union members escorted the company's superintendent, Washington Allen, out of Silver Reef. Allen immediately went to the Second District Court in Beaver and filed a lawsuit against the union members. Before they went to court, the union members held a meeting and decided <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Savage mine. Led by Matthew O'Loughlin, the president of the Silver Reef Miners Union, they walked through Silver Reef in rows of two, and, upon arriving at the Savage mine, O'Loughlin and nine other men went into the hoisting works and ordered the engineer on duty <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pumps that kept water from the water table out of the mine. After the pumps were shut down, the group of ten went into the Savage mine and ordered everyone out.|$|E

The Ravi flows in east-west direction forming deep canyons. During the spring and summer months, the levels of the river rise significantly from snow melt and pose a flooding risk. Record levels were experienced in early July 2005, when the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation was forced <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> power generation on its 300-MW Chamera Power Station.|$|E

5|$|California {{governor}} Jerry Brown {{declared a}} state of emergency for the city of San Francisco on August 23, after the fire caused damage to the power infrastructure serving the Bay Area, causing two out of the existing three hydroelectric power plants <b>to</b> <b>shut</b> <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> fire also threatened the Hetch Hetchy reservoir, the main source of water for San Francisco, providing up to 85% of the city's supply to 2.6 million customers. On August 26, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission moved water away from Hetch Hetchy into downstream reservoirs located in San Mateo and Alameda Counties as a precautionary measure, but did not expect the fire to cause any disruption to the city's water supply. The fire advanced to within a mile of Hetch Hetchy by Monday, August 26, which was a concern to O'Shaughnessy Dam officials due to ash falling in the water.|$|E
