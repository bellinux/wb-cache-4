5|$|With an Ebola {{epidemic}} devastating West Africa, Burwell began holding daily {{meetings on}} July 28, 2014, {{as part of}} the efforts of the United States government, including the Department of HHS, to prevent further spread of the disease. Starting on September30, other Obama administration officials began giving daily public briefings while Burwell took less of a public role, although she did take part in a number of public meetings. In the fall of 2014, the first known death from Ebola in the United States occurred. The Obama administration proposed devoting $6billion to fight the spread of Ebola, including $2billion for the State Department and USAID. The plan included provisions to help U.S. hospitals become better prepared and to support global health initiatives aimed at containing the disease in Africa. Congress allocated $5.4billion to fight Ebola in response to the Obama administration request. Burwell and other Obama administration officials sought to assure the public that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>health</b> system was prepared to deal with Ebola cases and that the chances of a full outbreak in the United States were low.|$|E
