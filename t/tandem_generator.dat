5000|$|Research at TUNL {{is focused}} on nuclear physics, {{including}} studies on Fundamental symmetries, Neutrinos, Nuclear astrophysics, and Hadron structure. [...] TUNL also conducts applied research, investigating the applications of nuclear physics to topics such as National security, Public health, and Plant physiology.The Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory was established in 1965, with a $2.5 Million grant from the United States Atomic Energy Commission providing the funding for a new 15 MeV Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator {{as well as a}} 15 MeV Cyclotron. After three years of construction and testing, the new accelerator facility became operational in December 1968. Henry Newson, a nuclear physics professor at Duke University, was responsible for the proposal, was the original proponent of combining the efforts of the three universities, and served as the first director of the new laboratory. The <b>Tandem</b> <b>Generator</b> and the Cyclotron at TUNL were combined into what was named a Cyclo-Graaff accelerator. Ions would first be accelerated in the Cyclotron. Then, once the initial energy was high enough, the beam from the cyclotron would be injected into the <b>Tandem</b> <b>Generator</b> where it would be further accelerated. Using the accelerators together effectively doubled the maximum energy that the lab could reach when compared to the energies of each individual accelerator. This combination, the Cyclo-Graaff, would be used by Henry Newson to study Nuclear Structure until his death in 1978.|$|E

50|$|During the Second World War, Pescara {{worked on}} {{electrical}} power in Portugal. Free-piston engines received new attention {{when they were}} mass-produced by the Société Industrielle Générale de Mécanique Appliquée (SIGMA), a French company that developed the GS-34, a 1138-horsepower generator. In 1963, Pescara rejoined his sons in Paris where he served as an expert for S.N. Marep during the testing of its 2000-horsepower EPLH-40. Pescara subsequently proposed the production of more powerful machines - new <b>tandem</b> <b>generators</b> based on the existing EPLH-40 and GS-34 - but died in Paris, France, before the company that was to develop the engineer's proposal was established.|$|R
50|$|Classic {{solutions}} such as passive filters reduce THDI to 5%-10% at full load. They are reliable, but big {{and only}} work at full load, and present {{their own problems}} when used in <b>tandem</b> with <b>generators.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Van de Graaff {{generator}} is {{a simple}} mechanical device. Small Van de Graaff generators are built by hobbyists and scientific apparatus companies and are used to demonstrate the effects of high DC potentials. Even small hobby machines produce impressive sparks several centimeters long. The largest air insulated Van de Graaff generator in the world, built by Van de Graaff himself, is operational and is {{on display in the}} Boston Museum of Science. Demonstrations during daytimes are a popular attraction. More modern Van de Graaff generators are insulated by pressurized dielectric gas, usually freon or sulfur hexafluoride. During recent years, Van de Graaff generators have been slowly replaced by solid-state DC power supplies without moving parts. The energies produced by Van de Graaff atomic particle accelerators are limited to about 30 MeV, even with <b>tandem</b> <b>generators</b> accelerating doubly charged (for example alpha) particles. More modern particle accelerators using different technology produce much greater energies, thus Van de Graaff particle accelerators have become largely obsolete. They are still used to some extent for graduate student research at colleges and universities and as ion sources for high energy bursts.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} programme {{consists of}} five subprograms of the MA nuclear characteristics measurements and their evaluation. The measurements {{will be performed}} with the different methods using different installations (nTOF, Pb-slow down spectrometer, <b>tandem</b> <b>generator,</b> irradiation in high flux reactor, benchmark experiments at BFS). Nuclear characteristics (σf, σc, α, resonance integrals and parameters, central reactivity coefficient etc.) will be measured for 22 isotopes of Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk and Cf in four energy range of neutron spectra: thermal region, resolved resonance region (1 to 100 eV), unresolved resonance region (0. 1 to 100 keV) and fast spectrum region (0. 1 to 30 MeV). The measured data will be evaluated and prepared as a file compatible with existing nuclear data libraries. 44...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFor the {{feasibility}} studies of spatially fractionated hadron therapy prototypes {{of the equipment}} for hadron minibeams shaping and monitoring have been designed, built and tested. The collimators design was based on Monte Carlo simulations (Gate v. 6. 2). Slit and matrix collimators were used for minibeams shaping. Gafchromic films, micropixel detectors Timepix in a hybrid as well as metal mode were tested for measuring hadrons intensity distribution in minibeams. An overall beam profile {{was measured by the}} metal microstrip detector. The performance of a mini-beams shaping and monitoring equipment was characterized exploring low energy protons at the KINR <b>Tandem</b> <b>generator</b> as well as high energy carbon and oxygen ion beams at HIT (Heidelberg). The results demonstrate reliable performance of the tested equipment for shaping and imaging hadron mini-beam structures...|$|E

This paper reports {{the design of a}} novel piezoelectric <b>tandem</b> shock wave <b>generator</b> for SWL. The system generates two shock waves with an adjustable time delay (50 - 950 msec) to enhance cavitation–induced damage to the kidney stone, without increasing tissue trauma.

50|$|These {{arrangements}} include single casing, {{tandem compound}} and cross compound turbines. Single casing units {{are the most}} basic style where a single casing and shaft are coupled to a <b>generator.</b> <b>Tandem</b> compound are used where two or more casings are directly coupled together to drive a single generator. A cross compound turbine arrangement features two or more shafts not in line driving two or more generators that often operate at different speeds. A cross compound turbine is typically used for many large applications. A typical 1930s-1960s naval installation is illustrated below; this shows high- and low-pressure turbines driving a common reduction gear, with a geared cruising turbine on one high-pressure turbine.|$|R
40|$|Cavitation {{associated}} with the generation of shock waves in water was examined. To study these processes, a <b>tandem</b> shock wave <b>generator,</b> which generates two cylindrical pressure waves focused by a metallic parabolic reflector to a common focal region, was developed. The temporal evolution of cavitation generated by shock waves at the focal region was determined experimentally using high-temporal-resolution microphotography {{for a certain time}} delay {{between the first and second}} shock waves. Observation of the focal area also showed jetting cavitation bubbles with diameters of 100 m without presence of any rigid boundary. A theoretical model that provides analytical expressions for the temporal evolution of the pressure inside the cavitation bubbles and parameters of the pressure waveform of the second shock wave at the focal area was used to improve the same measurement by PVDF sensor gauges. On the basis of this model, the amplitudes of the compression and rarefaction part...|$|R

The Participants, Destec Energy, Inc., (Destec) of Houston, Texas and PSI Energy, Inc., (PSI) of Plainfield, Indiana, formed the Wabash River Coal Gasification Repowering Project Joint Venture (the JV) to participate in the DOE`s Clean Coal Technology (CCT) program by demonstrating the coal gasification repowering of an existing 1950 `s vintage generating unit affected by the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA). The Participants, acting through the JV, signed the Cooperative Agreement with the DOE in July 1992. The Participants jointly developed, and separately designed, constructed, own, and will operate an integrated coal gasification combined cycle (CGCC) power plant using Destec`s coal gasification technology to repower Unit {number_sign} 1 at PSI`s Wabash River Generating Station located in Terre Haute, Indiana. PSI is responsible for the new power generation facilities and modification of the existing unit, while Destec is responsible for the coal gasification plant.
