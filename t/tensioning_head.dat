40|$|Five sand tank {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the behavior of unsaturated flow in heterogeneous porous media and to test the recent stochastic theories of Yeh et al. (1985 a, b. c) and Mantoglou et al. (1987 a, b, c) on flow through unsaturated porous media. The hydraulic properties @(w) and K(0) of the medium and coarse sand used in the {{experiments were}} measured with various laboratory columns. Fourteen medium and coarse sands were alternately layered in the 2. 38 m long x 1. 12 m high x 0. 1 m thick sand tank. Water was infiltrated from a point source for three of five experiments and from a channel source for two experiments. An array of 62 tensiometers were used to record the capillary <b>tension</b> <b>head</b> distribution during each experiment. The wetting front profiles for the first experiment show the stratified sand effects both the development and dissipation of preferential flow paths. The experimental results qualitatively support stochastic theory of saturation dependent anisotropy. Three of the five experiments agree with the stochastic result of Yeh et al. (1985 a and b) that {{an increase in the}} variance of the capillary <b>tension</b> <b>head</b> (soil becomes drier) is proportional to an increase in the mean <b>tension</b> <b>head...</b>|$|R

Most modern banjos also have a metal [...] "tone ring" [...] assembly that helps further clarify and project the sound, however many older banjos do not include a tone ring.|$|R

25|$|The second biggest {{factor that}} affects drum sound is <b>head</b> <b>tension</b> against the shell. When the hoop is placed around the drum head and shell and {{tightened}} down with tension rods, the <b>tension</b> of the <b>head</b> can be adjusted. When the tension is increased, the amplitude {{of the sound}} is reduced and the frequency is increased, making the pitch higher and the volume lower.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} some of {{the tensions}} faced in public libraries in the United Kingdom between the desires to support patrons’ rights to privacy and freedom of expressions, versus the reality of modern practice. Considering both privacy and freedom of expression as ethical concepts, it then discusses some examples from the UK where the tensions between privacy and freedom of expression manifest in practice, including around filtering and government initiatives to tackle extremism, as well as issues around cloud storage of user data. It concludes with a discussion on how public libraries and the profession in the UK must struggle to balance the competing interests of patrons and the state, and encourages the profession to address the <b>tensions</b> <b>head</b> on by regular and rigorous debate as to the issues...|$|R
5000|$|Conga drums are tunable to {{different}} notes. The original drums were tuned by adjusting knots and tension ropes on the drumhead, or, where the drum-heads were tacked or {{nailed to the}} top of the shell, by careful heating of the head. Modern congas use a screw-and-lug <b>tension</b> <b>head</b> system, which makes them easier to tune (or detune). This modern type of tension system is attributed to Carlos [...] "Patato" [...] Valdes, a popular Cuban Conguero. As was discussed above, terminology for the drums varies. Here, the naming system used is a composite of those mentioned before with those currently in use by major conga manufacturers. The drums are discussed in order from largest to smallest; the sizes of the drumheads given vary considerably by manufacturer, model, and style.|$|R

40|$|To obtain some {{fundamental}} suggestion {{on the net}} design of trawl net, Author carried out the field experiment. Results obtained are summarized as follows: (1) On Danish seine net, the <b>tension</b> on the <b>head</b> rope was about 40 % of the net resistance and that on the ground rope was about 60 % of the net resistance． (2) While Trawl net was draging, the <b>tension</b> on the <b>head</b> rope was about 20 % of the net resistance, the tension on the lacing line was about 20 % of the net resistance and the tension on the ground rope was about 60 % of the net resistance.

50|$|When <b>tensioning</b> a <b>head,</b> the <b>tensioning</b> rod {{closest to}} the {{tensioner}} should be tightened first. The {{reason for this is}} to keep an even tension across the drum head, which is impossible to do if the lugs are tightened differently. Next, the tension rod opposite the first lug is tightened by the same number of turns. The process is repeated for the remaining lugs in order, moving {{from one side of the}} head to the other.|$|R
40|$|Five sand-box {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the behavior of water flow in unsaturated stratified porous media. The hydraulic properties OM and K(0) of the medium and coarse sands used in the {{experiments were}} measured with various laboratory columns. Fourteen layers comprised of the medium and coarse sands were alternately layered in a 2. 38 m long x 1. 12 m high x 0. 1 m thick sand tank. Water was infiltrated from a point source for three of five experiments and from a channel source for two experiments.

The wetting front profiles of the first experiment show the stratified sand affects both the development and dissipation of preferential flow paths.

25|$|In the {{balanced}} action system, a spring or hydraulic cylinder {{is used to}} balance the <b>tension</b> on the <b>head</b> so the pedal will stay in position and the head will stay at pitch.

50|$|A {{machine head}} (also {{referred}} to as a tuning machine, tuner, or gear head) is a geared apparatus for tuning stringed musical instruments by adjusting string <b>tension.</b> Machine <b>heads</b> are used on mandolins, guitars, double basses etc., and are usually located on the instrument's headstock. Non-geared tuning devices that are used on violins, violas, cellos, lutes, older Flamenco guitars, ukuleles etc., are known as friction pegs. Friction pegs hold the string in tune by way of friction caused by their tapered shape and by the string pull created by the tight string. Some other commonly used slang names for guitar tuners are pegs, gears, machines, cranks, knobs, tensioners and tighteners.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the impact of new managerialism on junior academic-managers (defined as those having informal leadership or management roles below the level of head of department). It aims to discover: whether junior academic-managers experience the same <b>tensions</b> as <b>Heads</b> of Department; whether distributed leadership is possible and/or desirable in Higher Education; and what types of support junior academic-managers might welcome. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws upon previous literature and a small case study of one university department in a mid-ranking UK university. Findings – Junior academic-managers experience similar kinds of <b>tensions</b> to <b>heads</b> of department. Although distributed leadership is considered a necessity in higher education, in practice, devolved leadership is more common than genuinely distributed leadership. Junior academic-managers would benefit from the same types of support as heads of department, but increased administrative assistance would be particularly helpful. Some, though not all, of the tensions felt by both groups could be alleviated if higher education institutions (HEIs) adopted a modified form of workforce remodelling, similar to that being implemented in English and Welsh schools. Research limitation/implications – The empirical data come from within one department of one university. It is debatable how far the findings of this study are generalizable to other contexts. Originality/value – There are relatively few studies looking at academic heads of department, and virtually none looking at junior academic-managers. The argument that school workforce remodelling might be adapted for the HE sector is not made elsewhere...|$|R

5000|$|The tsudzumi (...) or tsuzumi is a Japanese hand drum of Chinese/Mongolian/Indian origin. It {{consists}} of a wooden body shaped like an hourglass, and it is taut, with two drum heads with cords that can be squeezed or released to increase or decrease the <b>tension</b> of the <b>heads</b> respectively. This mechanism allows the player to raise or lower the pitch of the drum while playing, not unlike the African talking drum.|$|R
