5|$|Old {{styles are}} {{considered}} slow, well-pronounced and dignified like the Maguindanao’s kamamatuan and the Maranao’s andung.

5|$|Alternative {{theories}} are that La Reforma is a dome which was eroded {{to form a}} circular pattern or a set of tectonic blocks. Although the dome {{was thought to be}} formed by <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Comondú volcanics, {{it appears to be a}} product of La Reforma activity.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian was a {{synthetic}} language, {{but it became}} more analytic later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced <b>the</b> <b>older</b> inflectional suffixes. There was a change from <b>the</b> <b>older</b> verb–subject–object word order to subject–verb–object. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church, and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic.|$|E

The normal battleship configuration was present aboard North Carolina in April 1944, with SK and SG radars (air and surface search, respectively), a backup SG, and Mark 8s to direct its main battery. All of the Mark 4s remained for the secondary battery, {{and one of}} <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Mark 3s was still present, possibly as a backup for the Mark 8s. An SK-2 dish replaced <b>the</b> <b>older</b> SK radar and Mark 12s and 22s superseded the Mark 4s in September of that year. Aside from never receiving an SK-2, Washington was the recipient of similar upgrades.|$|E

5|$|Facing continual {{threats from}} the Acrocanthosaurus, Red, {{her sister and}} the chicks are forced up into the mountains. They {{encounter}} ice and snow for the first time, and kill a segnosaur in a cave, turning the den into their nest. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> chick accompanies the two adults on hunting expeditions. One day the raptors encounter a strange creature they have never seen—a whip-tailed diplodocid who inflicts wounds on Red and her sister; <b>the</b> <b>older</b> chick is forced to set off alone and find the pack's food. This calamity coincides {{with the arrival of}} a large pack of smaller raptors known as Deinonychus. Sensing the weakness of the Utahraptor pack, they surround the nest and wait for the wounded raptors to become weak enough to attack.|$|E

A fissure created by Gareloi's 1929 eruption runs along the southern summit of the volcano. Steep sea cliffs on the southwest {{side of the island}} cut into <b>the</b> <b>older</b> caldera. Three masses offshore of the island were produced by debris flows from the volcano.|$|E
