40|$|Motivation: When {{comparing}} {{the organization of}} two genomes, {{it is important not}} <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> conclusions on their modes of evolution from a single most parsimonious scenario explaining their differences. Better estimations can be obtained by sampling many different genomic rearrangement scenarios. For this problem, the Double Cut and Join (DCJ) model, while less relevant, is computationally easier than the Hannenhalli-Pevzner (HP) model. Indeed, in some special cases, the total number of DCJ sorting scenarios can be analytically calculated, and uniformly distributed random DCJ scenarios can be drawn in polynomial running time, while the complexity of counting the number of HP scenarios and sampling from the uniform distribution of their space is unknown, and conjectured to be #P-complete. Statistical methods, like MCMC for sampling from the uniform distribution of the most parsimonious or the Bayesian distribution of all possible HP scenarios are required. Results: We use the computational facilities of the DCJ model <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> of HP scenarios.

40|$|Introduction Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) can be {{considered}} a high-level query language for databases, aimed at generating quality reports which support decision making on various levels of an institution. However, today there are three main obstacles to overcome before the high-level support can be satisfactory. Firstly, most tools for data mining do not offer database access, but demand the user <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> from the database and to convert it into a specific format. Secondly, data preprocessing, which is crucial for the success of the data mining step, is not sufficiently supported. Preprocessing includes aggregation, discretisation, data cleaning, and treatment of missing values. Feature generation and selection are also major challenges for KDD [3]. Although up to 80 percent of the efforts in KDD processes are spent on clever preprocessing it is still common practice to carry out this task manually by applying low level methods including SQL statements and Perl...|$|E
