60|$|Concluding Remarks.--In {{comparing}} the capitulum of the hermaphrodite {{with that of}} the complemental male (Pl. VI, figs. 6 and 3), we must be struck with the differences in their shape, in the number, relative sizes, and forms of the several valves. It should, however, be borne in mind, that the scuta and carina in the hermaphrodite at first grow exclusively downwards; so that if we remove the upper portions subsequently added, the difference in shape in these valves is not so great as it at first appears. The rostrum in the male is of much larger relative size; whilst of the upper latera there is not a trace, although in the hermaphrodite these valves are larger than the rostrum. The terga, compared with those of the hermaphrodite, differ more essentially than do the other valves; {{and the manner in which}} the primordial valves project, shows that from the first commencement of calcification, the lines of growth have followed an unusual course. The great breadth and shortness of the terga is evidently related to the shortening of the whole capitulum, and the <b>transverse</b> <b>position</b> of the orifice; and this shortening of the capitulum, no doubt, is rendered necessary for its reception and protection within the shallow furrow between the scuta of the hermaphrodite. Finally, if we compare the internal parts of the hermaphrodite and male, the differences are considerable, though partly to be accounted for by the youth of the latter: the form and position of the labrum, and the distance between the first and second pair of cirri, is the same in both; but the mandibles and maxill√¶ differ considerably.|$|E
60|$|The Cirri are {{developed}} at first of considerable length, {{so that the}} young animal may soon provide itself with food; in Lepas australis they are of great length, the sixth pair consisting of seventeen or eighteen obscure segments. The extreme tips of the twenty-four rami of the six pair of cirri, are formed within the twenty-four, corresponding, little, bi-segmental rami of the six pair of natatory legs; but as the cirri are many times longer than these legs, they occupy in a bundle the whole thorax of the larva; no part whatever of the thorax of the Cirripede is formed within the thorax of the larva, but (together with the pedicels of the anterior cirri) within the cephalic cavity. As a consequence of this, the longitudinal axis of the thorax of the young Cirripede lies almost transversely to the longitudinal axis of the larva; and the Cirripede, from this <b>transverse</b> <b>position</b> of its thorax, comes to be, as it were, internally, almost cut in twain, and the sack thus produced. As soon as the young Cirripede is free and can move itself, the cirri are curled up, and the thorax is advanced towards the orifice of the capitulum, its longitudinal axis resuming the position of approximate parallelism to the longitudinal axis of the whole body, which {{it had in the}} larval condition. The reader will, perhaps, understand what I mean, if he will look at the mature Cirripede, figured in Pl. IX, fig. 4. In this, he will see that the body or thorax is united to the peduncle only by a small part below the mouth; on the other hand, if he imagines the whole bottom of the body (as high up as the letter h) united and blended into the peduncle, he will see the state in which these parts exist in the larva. Now, let him greatly shorten the cirri, so as to resemble the natatory legs of the larva, and then imagine a young Cirripede, with cirri of full length, formed within the old one, he will see that the new thorax supporting the cirri will have to be developed in an almost transverse position,--the animal consequently being internally almost separated into twain.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the velocity derivative skewness, S(?u/?x), is investigated along two streamwise axes and four <b>transverse</b> <b>positions</b> {{in the wake of}} a square-fractal-element grid. In the near-field, the produced turbulence exhibits non-equilibrium characteristics including C ? ?Re ? M /Re ? L. In the far-field, the turbulence agrees with canonical grid turbulence results and C ? is approximately constant. It is found that in the non-equilibrium region, the value of ?S(?u/?x) is dependent on both streamwise and <b>transverse</b> <b>positions,</b> but after a sufficient decay period, it takes on a near constant value in the far-field. It is demonstrated that the evolution C ? approximately corresponds to that of ?S(?u/?x), which is suggestive that some of the non-equilibrium properties are likely a result of residual strain from the turbulence generating conditions...|$|R

60|$|All {{that night}} Godfrey was toiling to {{retrieve}} the disaster. He took down the whole tower from where it stood and raised it again on the high ground {{to the north of}} the city which is now marked by the pine tree that grows outside Herod's gate. And all the time he toiled, it was said, sinister sorcerers sat upon the battlements, working unknown marvels for the undoing of the labour of man. If the great knight had a touch of such symbolism on his own side, he might have seen in his own strife with the solid timber something of the craft that had surrounded the birth of his creed, and the sacred trade of the carpenter. And indeed the very pattern of all carpentry is cruciform, and there is something more than an accident in the allegory. The <b>transverse</b> <b>position</b> of the timber does indeed involve many of those mathematical that are analogous to moral truths and almost every structural shape has the shadow of the mystic rood, as the three dimensions have a shadow of the Trinity. Here is the true mystery of equality; since the longer beam might lengthen itself to infinity, and never be nearer to the symbolic shape without the help of the shorter. Here is that war and wedding between two contrary forces, resisting and supporting each other; the meeting-place of contraries which we, by a sort of pietistic pun, still call the crux of the question. Here is our angular and defiant answer to the self-devouring circle of Asia. It may be improbable, though it is far from impossible (for the age was philosophical enough) that a man like Godfrey thus extended the mystical to the metaphysical; but the writer of a real romance about him would be well within his rights in making him see the symbolism of his own tower, a tower rising above him through the clouds of night as if taking hold on the heaven or showing its network of beams black against the daybreak; scaling the skies and open to all the winds, a ladder and a labyrinth, repeating till it was lost in the twilight the pattern of the sign of the cross.|$|E

40|$|The beam {{transport}} {{system for the}} Advanced Hydrotest Facility (AHF) anticipates multiple beam splitters. Monitoring two separated beams in a common beam pipe in the splitter sections imposes certain requirements on diagnostics for these sections. In this note we explore a two-beam system in a generic beam monitor and study the feasibility of resolving {{the positions of the}} two beams with a single diagnostic device. In the Advanced Hydrotest Facility (AHF), 20 -ns beam pulses (bunches) are extracted from the 50 -GeV main proton synchrotron and then are transported to the target by an elaborated {{transport system}}. The beam transport system splits the beam bunches into equal parts in its splitting sections so that up to 12 synchronous beam pulses can be delivered to the target for the multi-axis proton radiography. Information about the <b>transverse</b> <b>positions</b> of the beams in the splitters, and possibly the bunch longitudinal profile, should be delivered by some diagnostic devices.

5000|$|The {{shortening}} of {{the pelvis}} and smaller birth canal evolved as {{a requirement for}} bipedalism and had significant effects {{on the process of}} human birth which is much more difficult in modern humans than in other primates. During human birth, because of the variation in size of the pelvic region, the fetal head must be in a <b>transverse</b> <b>position</b> (compared to the mother) during entry into the birth canal and rotate about 90 degrees upon exit. The smaller birth canal became a limiting factor to brain size increases in early humans and prompted a shorter gestation period leading to the relative immaturity of human offspring, who are unable to walk much before 12 months and have greater neoteny, compared to other primates, who are mobile at a much earlier age. The increased brain growth after birth and the increased dependency of children on mothers had a big effect upon the female reproductive cycle, [...] and the more frequent appearance of alloparenting in humans when compared with other hominids. Delayed human sexual maturity also led to the evolution of menopause with one explanation providing that elderly women could better pass on their genes by taking care of their daughter's offspring, as compared to having more children of their own.|$|E

Ascertaining the precise position of the fetal head is paramount, and though historically was accomplished by feeling the fetal skull suture lines and fontanelles, in the modern era, confirmation with ultrasound is essentially mandatory.
