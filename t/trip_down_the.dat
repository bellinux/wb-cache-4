25|$|The railway {{was officially}} opened on Monday 6 April 1896, and two trains were {{dispatched}} to the summit.

25|$|The {{site where}} Fort Randolph was built {{emerged as a}} {{strategic}} location {{in the years before}} the American Revolution. In the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768, the British acquired title to present-day West Virginia from the Iroquois. Thereafter, British colonists and land speculators began to explore the region. One of the first to do so was George Washington, a planter and politician from Virginia, who in 1770 made a long canoe <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Ohio River to examine the land around Point Pleasant. Many other British colonists and surveyors did the same over the next few years.|$|E
25|$|Once in South America, a new, {{far more}} ambitious goal was added: {{to find the}} {{headwaters}} of the Rio da Duvida, and trace it north to the Madeira and thence to the Amazon River. It was later renamed Roosevelt River in honor of the former President. Roosevelt's crew consisted of his son Kermit, naturalist Colonel Rondon, George K. Cherrie, sent by the American Museum of Natural History, Brazilian Lieutenant João Lira, team physician Dr. José Antonio Cajazeira, and 16 skilled paddlers and porters. The initial expedition started somewhat tenuously on December 9, 1913, {{at the height of the}} rainy season. The <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> River of Doubt started on February 27, 1914.|$|E

25|$|Twain {{initially}} {{conceived of}} the work as a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer that would follow Huckleberry Finn through adulthood. Beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel, Twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled Huckleberry Finn's Autobiography. Twain worked on the manuscript {{off and on for}} the next several years, ultimately abandoning his original plan of following Huck's development into adulthood. He appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress, and set it aside for several years. After making a <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Hudson River, Twain returned to his work on the novel. Upon completion, the novel's title closely paralleled its predecessor's: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's Comrade).|$|E
25|$|Upon {{recovering}} in June, Coles and his 40-year-old mulatto {{slave and}} coachman, Ralph Crawford, toured the Northwest Territory {{in search of}} land Coles could purchase and develop as a home for himself and {{a place for the}} slaves he still proposed to free. Coles wrote letters to President Madison and to relatives expressing dissatisfaction with the high land prices in Ohio, then with squatters, real estate speculators and fraudulent businessmen as he travelled further west into the Indiana (and what became the Illinois) Territory. In the Missouri Territory Coles bought some land for investment, before finally embarking in St. Louis on a keel boat for his <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River to New Orleans, from where Coles ultimately sailed home to Virginia.|$|E
25|$|By 1969 the Ho Chi Minh Trail was a {{sophisticated}} logistical web with paved roads, truck parks, maintenance and supply depots, and well organized and defended terminuses and bases, moving {{thousands of men}} per month into the battle zone. A fuel pipeline complete with pumping stations was even in place by 1969, and this was to multiply, together with other installations such as missile batteries, as the conflict extended. The need for massive amounts of manual labor for construction actually decreased on the Trail as heavy equipment like bulldozers and rock crushers were deployed, and both miles of road built and truck traffic expanded. By the war's end almost a million soldiers had made the <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Trail {{and tens of thousands}} of tons were being transported annually.|$|E

25|$|Matthew Turner {{was born}} in Geneva, Ohio on June 17, 1825, the fourth child of George Turner and Emily Atkins. George Turner owned a sawmill {{on the shores of}} Lake Erie and later {{launched}} his first ship, the sloop Geneva, in 1839, to ship lumber and building stone. Matthew, after watching the construction of the Geneva and a later vessel the Philena Mills, designed his first ship, the schooner G.R. Roberts. His father was sufficiently impressed with the design to build the boat, which was launched in 1848. Matthew took on the command of the boat and later that year married Amanda Jackson. Amanda died in childbirth with their first child. On a <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi river in late 1849 he heard about gold mining in California and set off for the West Coast in 1850. He spent 3½ years mining gold in Calaveras County and was quite successful.|$|E
25|$|August {{started with}} a {{friendly}} against Rangers at Tannadice and United showed that they could still compete with the best as they narrowly lost 2–1. Just days later, United played Dundee at Tannadice in Dave Bowman's testimonial match, with United winning 2–0. The season got under way with a draw with Morton at Tannadice with five new players in the starting line-up, then a short <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road saw Cowdenbeath beaten in the 2nd round of the League Cup. With United now playing in the First Division, they were entered into the Scottish Challenge Cup for the first time, and won 2–0 at Stranraer. a 3–0 defeat away to Dunfermline meant United had picked up only one point in their opening two league matches. Kirkwood then snapped up former Rangers and Aberdeen player Jim Bett, following his release from Hearts. The 3rd round of the League Cup saw Motherwell win 2–1 at Tannadice, giving United one less distraction during a difficult season.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{autonomous}} vehicles, {{also known}} as driverless cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car), {{and are expected to}} be commercially available around 2020. According to urban designer and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehicles—in conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for work, travel, and pleasure—could reduce the world's 800 million vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few decades. This would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public self-driving taxis that would be in near constant use. This would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular need—a bus could come for a group of people, a limousine could come for a special night out, and a Segway could come for a short <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street for one person. Children could be chauffeured in supervised safety, DUIs would no longer exist, and 41,000 lives could be saved each year in the US alone.|$|E

25|$|She {{referred}} to her early girlhood as the most eventful part of her life. There was the long journey to Vermont the summer she was 18 months old, and her young mother’s death only four days after reaching the state which it had been hoped would give her health. There was the sojourn in New York, where William had established himself in business, and where he wanted his little daughter’s company. Clear and vivid was her memory of that <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Hudson River taken with her father when she was three years old, and of their arrival at the small boarding school on then fashionable Bleeker Street. At six, {{she was back in}} Middlebury, browsing in her father’s large and well chosen library —she could not remember the time when she {{did not know how to}} read— a library established in a newly-built house four miles up the Otter from Middlebury village in a quarter of the town called Farmingdale, a house presided over by a new step-mother. Here, also she recited daily lessons to her father and did her daily “stent” of sewing or knitting. Dorr grew to womanhood in a home of culture and refinement, and it is here where she began writing as a little child. It is here also that the father engaged in business again, and devoted himself chiefly to the development of the Rutland marble quarries. The home also included her half-brothers, Edward H. Ripley and Major General William Y. W. Ripley, both of whom became prominent officers in the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Morrison {{was born}} in Geelong, Victoria, Australia. His father George Morrison (brother of Alexander Morrison) was {{headmaster}} of The Geelong College at which school he was educated. It was at The Geelong College that Morrison won a gold medal, in 1876, for Scripture History. The medal (5.4cm in diameter) is handcrafted and engraved by an unknown maker. The gold disc medal {{is surrounded by a}} chased Scottish Thistle and Oak wreath and attached with a blue ribbon. During a vacation, before his tertiary education, he walked from Geelong to Adelaide, a distance of about 600 miles (960km). He initially studied at the University of Melbourne. After passing his first year medicine he took a vacation <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Murray River in a canoe from Albury, New South Wales to the mouth, a distance of 1650 miles (2,640km), covered in 65 days. Bypassing his next examinations, Morrison shipped on a vessel trading to the South Sea islands, discovered some of the evils of the Kanaka traffic, and wrote articles on it which appeared in The Age and had some influence on the eventual suppression of it. He next visited New Guinea and did part of the return journey on a Chinese junk. Landing at Normanton, Queensland at the end of 1882 Morrison decided to walk to Melbourne. He was not quite 21, he had no horses or camels and was unarmed, but carrying his swag and swimming or wading the rivers in his path, he walked the 2043 miles (3270km) in 123 days. No doubt the country had been much opened up in the twenty years since Burke and Wills well-funded failure, but the journey was nevertheless a remarkable feat, which stamped Morrison as a great natural bushman and explorer. He arrived at Melbourne on 21 April 1883 to find that during his journey Thomas McIlwraith, the premier of Queensland, had annexed part of New Guinea, and was vainly endeavouring to get the support of the British government for his action.|$|E

[...] Despite this, he left for Kentucky in March 1793 and resigned without serving a day in Congress, which convened on March 4. He chose the longer but safer route to Kentucky, joining a group of flatboats at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, for the <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Monongahela and Ohio rivers to Limestone (now Maysville, Kentucky).
