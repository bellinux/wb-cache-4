50|$|Despite their <b>table-topping</b> league form, Lantana did not supply any {{players to}} the Estonian {{national}} side. This was due {{the perception that}} the club was representative of the ethnically-Russian minority in Estonia, and indeed many of the squad were Russian and ineligible under FIFA rules to represent Estonia.|$|R

25|$|In {{a typical}} NPT set up, a small <b>table-top</b> device is used. A drop of {{capillary}} blood is obtained with an automated finger-prick, {{which is almost}} painless. This drop is placed on a disposable test strip with which the machine has been prepared. The resulting INR comes up on the display a few seconds later.

25|$|Jaquays {{expanded}} {{her career}} to include video game {{design in the}} early 1980s, but continued {{to work as a}} freelancer for various <b>table-top</b> game publishers including TSR, Chaosium, West End Games, Flying Buffalo, and Iron Crown Enterprises. She produced illustrations for Game Designers' Workshop (GDW), most notably creating all the starship illustrations in Traveller Supplement 9 - Fighting Ships. A number of these became the basis for starship models from Ad Astra Games and the deckplans found in Mongoose Traveller Supplement 3 - Fighting Ships.|$|E
25|$|Van Gogh {{also wrote}} to Wilhelmina {{regarding}} the Portraits of Madame Ginoux he painted first in Arles in 1888 {{and again in}} February 1890 while at the hospital in Saint-Rémy. The second set were styled after the portrait of the same figure by Gauguin, and Van Gogh described Gachet's enthusiasm upon viewing the version painted earlier that year, which the artist had carried {{with him to the}} home in Auvers. Van Gogh subsequently carried compositional elements from this portrait to that of Dr. Gachet, including the <b>table-top</b> with two books and pose of the figure with head leaning on one hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{tower of}} three stages is 85 feet in height, with a battlemented parapet and crocketted finials, the top stage is {{decorated}} with four carved figures, possibly the Four Evangelists. There is a piscina (used to cleanse sacred vessels after mass at the high altar) {{on the north side}} and the remains of rood loft stairs, now built up. In the south aisle is a second piscina and a priest's doorway. The font is one of Norman <b>table-top</b> type: it has a circular basin, hollowed in a square block decorated with blind arcade set on a round ornamented shaft.|$|E
50|$|The post-Christmas {{slump in}} form for Saracens looked all too familiar. Yet {{a change in}} playing style and having found {{a new sense of}} attacking rugby, Sarries stopped the rot with a 58-15 drubbing of {{struggling}} Newcastle. From then on, they went on to win four out the five matches played, including impressive wins away to Sale, Northampton and <b>table-topping</b> Leicester Tigers.|$|R
25|$|As {{the coach}} of the Afghanistan cricket team, Afghanistan beat Zimbabwe again in the Group Stage of ICC World Twenty20, which helped them {{progress}} to the Super 10 stage. His team battled hard against Sri Lanka and South Africa but were unable to pull off a victory despite valiant efforts. In their final game of the tournament, against the <b>table-topping</b> West Indies, they managed to secure a historic victory.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} season, 1921/22, Ashworth lead Liverpool {{to their}} third League Championship. The team were {{well on their}} way to a second successive Championship the following season, when in February 1923 Ashworth left the <b>table-topping</b> side to return to Oldham, then at the bottom of the league. Oldham ended the season relegated, while Liverpool only won one of their last seven games, but still won the Championship by six points.|$|R
25|$|From 1986 to 1993, she did {{freelance}} {{work while}} running a design studio. Jaquays prepared {{a series of}} character-creation supplements called Central Casting (1988-1991) for Flying Buffalo, which were published by Task Force Games. Jaquays also prepared three more City Books (1990-1994) out of house for Flying Buffalo. From 1993 to 1997, she returned to full-time employment in the <b>table-top</b> gaming industry as an illustrator for TSR, including a six-month period as Director of Graphics. She left TSR just before their takeover by Wizards of the Coast. During this time, she played {{an active role in}} the creation of the Dragon Dice game, both as cover artist and icon designer.|$|E
25|$|This subgenre of turn-based {{role-playing}} games principally {{refers to}} games which incorporate elements from strategy games {{as an alternative}} to traditional role-playing game (RPG) systems. Tactical RPGs are descendents of traditional strategy games, such as chess, and <b>table-top</b> role-playing and strategic war games, such as Chainmail, which were mainly tactical in their original form. The format of a tactical CRPG is also like a traditional RPG in its appearance, pacing and rule structure. Like standard RPGs, the player controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies. And like other RPGs, death is usually temporary, albeit some have permanent death of party members. But this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as tactical movement on an isometric grid. Tactical RPGs tend not to feature multiplayer play.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Nihon Falcom's Brandish was {{an early}} {{overhead}} action RPG to use mouse controls, where the player could move forward, backward, turn, strafe and attack by clicking on boxes surrounding the player character. The 1991 Dragon Slayer title Lord Monarch departed from the action RPG gameplay of its predecessors, instead using an early form of real-time strategy gameplay. The erotic adult RPG Dragon Knight III, released in 1991 for the PC-8801 and as Knights of Xentar for MS-DOS, introduced a unique pausable real-time battle system, where characters automatically attack based {{on a list of}} different AI scripts, though this meant the player had no control over the characters during battle other than to give commands for spells, item use, and AI routines. That same year, Arcus Odyssey by Wolf Team (now Namco Tales Studio) was an action RPG that featured an isometric perspective and co-operative multiplayer gameplay. The sequel to the first-person shooter role-playing game Star Cruiser, simply called Star Cruiser 2, was released in 1992, for the PC-9821 and FM Towns computers. T Soft released the PC-98 game Sword World PC in 1992 and a console version Sword World SFC for the Super Famicom in 1993. It was officially based on Sword World RPG, a popular Japanese <b>table-top</b> role-playing game. The video game versions were multiplayer titles and early attempts at recreating an open-ended, <b>table-top</b> role-playing experience on video game platforms, being set in the same world as Sword World and implementing the same rules and scenarios. Wolf Team's Dark Kingdom, released for the PC-98 in 1992 and ported to the SNES console in 1994, featured a unique storyline that revolved around the players conquering the world as a villain instead of saving the world.|$|E
50|$|Starting his {{professional}} career with Third Division Wigan Athletic in 1990, Sonner {{never made a}} first team appearance for Bryan Hamilton's side, and so signed with Frank Casper's Fourth Division Burnley in March 1991. After Casper was replaced by Jimmy Mullen, Sonner barely featured at Turf Moor during their <b>table-topping</b> 1991-92 season and so was loaned out to Mike Walsh's Bury, back in the fourth tier, in November 1992, staying {{for the rest of}} the season.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately for United, {{the title}} slipped {{away on the}} final day of the season when they just couldn't get the better of a rock solid West Ham side who held them to a 1-1 draw at Upton Park. A win would have given them their third {{successive}} title, as <b>table-topping</b> Blackburn lost their final game of the season at Liverpool. There was more frustration a week later in the 1995 FA Cup Final, when they lost 1-0 to a resurgent Everton side.|$|R
50|$|Omigie had to {{wait until}} 2 November 1996 to make his first {{appearance}} of the 1996-97 season for the <b>table-topping</b> Bees, replacing Carl Asaba after 62 minutes of a 2-0 defeat to Watford. He scored his first goal for the club in a resounding 4-1 away victory over Plymouth Argyle. Omigie made semi-regular appearances through {{to the end of the}} season, but failed to appear in the Bees' unsuccessful playoff campaign. He finished the 1996-97 season having made 15 appearances and scored one goal.|$|R
25|$|The grating {{fabrication}} {{challenge was}} eased {{by the discovery}} of a phase moiré effect which provides an all-phase-grating interferometer that works with compact sources, called the polychromatic far-field interferometer (see figure on the right). Phase gratings are easier to make when compared with the source and analyzer gratings mentioned above, since the grating depth required to cause phase shift is much less than what is needed to absorb x-rays. Phase gratings of 200 - 400 nanometer periods have been used to improve phase sensitivity in <b>table-top</b> PFI imagers. In PFI a phase grating is used to convert the fine interference fringes into a broad intensity pattern at a distal plane, based on the phase moiré effect. Besides higher sensitivity, another incentive for smaller grating periods is that the lateral coherence of the source needs to be at least one grating period.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the limited}} success, Nintendo would press ahead with 3D {{development}} into the 1990s. Gunpei Yokoi, {{creator of the}} Game Boy handheld device and popular Metroid video game, developed a new 3D device for Nintendo called the Virtual Boy. It was a portable <b>table-top</b> system consisting of goggles and a controller that used a spinning disc to achieve full stereoscopic monochrome 3D. Released in 1995, the Virtual Boy sold fewer than a million units, spawning only 22 compatible game titles, and was widely {{considered to be a}} commercial failure. Shigeru Miyamoto, known for his work on popular game franchises such as Mario and The Legend of Zelda, commented in a 2011 interview that he felt conflicted about Yokoi's decision to use wire-frame models for 3D and suggested that the product may not have been marketed correctly. The failure of the Virtual Boy left many at Nintendo doubting the viability of 3D gaming. Despite this, Nintendo continued to investigate the incorporation of 3D technology into other products.|$|E
25|$|For those {{grounded}} in the RPG tradition, the very first release of Call of Cthulhu created a brand new framework for <b>table-top</b> gaming. Rather than the traditional format established by Dungeons & Dragons, which often involved the characters wandering through caves or tunnels and fighting different types of monsters, Sandy Petersen introduced {{the concept of the}} Onion Skin: Interlocking layers of information and nested clues that lead the Player Characters from seemingly minor investigations into a missing person to discovering mind-numbingly awful, global conspiracies to destroy the world. Unlike its predecessor games, CoC assumed that most investigators would not survive, alive or sane, and that the only safe {{way to deal with the}} vast majority of nasty things described in the rule books was to run away. A well-run CoC campaign should engender a sense of foreboding and inevitable doom in its players. The style and setting of the game, in a relatively modern time period, created an emphasis on real-life settings, character research, and thinking one's way around trouble.|$|E
25|$|Kosmina got {{the side}} of to a flying start under his tenure, his first match in charge, a clash with then <b>table-topping</b> rivals Central Coast, a thrilling 3–2 victory {{in front of a}} crowd of nearly 18,000 at the SFS, a sign of bigger things to come for the Blues. This was {{followed}} by an impressive 1–0 away victory over Newcastle Jets; with former England junior Michael Bridges recording his first goal for Sydney FC. An entertaining 0–0 draw at the Telstra Dome, with rivals Melbourne, followed, with Sydney FC still undefeated under Kosmina.|$|R
50|$|He {{returned}} to Crystal Palace following his loan spell on 12 January 2010, and scored his first goal for Palace against Doncaster Rovers on 27 February 2010. He began the following season in Palace's first team but dropped out as manager George Burley sought {{to bring in}} more experienced players. In February, he {{returned to}} <b>table-topping</b> Chesterfield for a second loan spell, helping them to win the League Two title. When his contract at parent club Crystal Palace expired, he opted to leave Selhurst Park in the summer of 2011 to seek more game time.|$|R
50|$|In September 1988, he {{returned}} to Sincil Bank, rejoining Lincoln City for a club record fee of £60,000. His first match back at Lincoln was a League Cup match against the club he had just left, Southampton, in which Hobson scored City's consolation goal at The Dell. Hobson spent two more years with Lincoln, finishing as top scorer both seasons, with a hat-trick in a 4-1 win at <b>table-topping</b> Burnley in November 1988. In his two spells with Lincoln, Hobson made a total of 386 first-team appearances, scoring 105 goals.|$|R

It has improved battery life over the DSi on all brightness settings; for example, batteries last 13–17 hours at the dimmest setting. The handheld is outfitted with identical speakers contained in larger speaker enclosures, enabling them to produce louder sound. The hinges stop the screen at 120° {{in addition to the}} original DSi's position of 155° to allow easier <b>table-top</b> viewing. The DSi XL is bundled with two longer styli, one of which is thicker, rounded, and pen-like, and does not fit inside the unit.|$|E
500|$|Black tea: The {{tea leaves}} {{are allowed to}} {{completely}} oxidize. Black tea is first withered to induce protein breakdown and reduce water content (68-77% of original). The leaves then undergo a process known in the industry as [...] "disruption" [...] or [...] "leaf maceration", which through bruising or cutting disrupts leaf cell structures, releasing the leaf juices and enzymes that activate oxidation. The oxidation process takes between 45–90 minutes to 3 hours and is done at high humidity between 20-30 degrees Celsius, transforming much of the catechins of the leaves into complex tannin. Orthodox processed black teas are further graded according to the post-production leaf quality by the Orange Pekoe system, while crush, tear, curl (CTC) teas use a different grading system. Orthodox tea leaves are heavily rolled either by hand or mechanically on a cylindrical rolling table or a rotorvane. The rolling table consists of a ridged <b>table-top</b> moving in an eccentric manner to a large hopper of tea leaves, of which the leaves are pressed down onto the <b>table-top.</b> The process produces a mixture of whole and broken leaves, and particles which are then sorted, oxidized, and dried. The rotovane consisted of an auger pushing withered tea leaves through a vane cylinder [...] which crushes and evenly cuts the leaves. Crush, tear, curl is a production method developed by William McKercher in 1930 which uses machines with contra-rotating rotors with surfaces patterning that cut and tear the leaves producing a product popular for use in tea bags. The rotovane to often use to precut the withered tea prior to the CTC and to create broken orthodox processed black tea.|$|E
