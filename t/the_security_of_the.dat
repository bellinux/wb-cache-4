The article describes <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> ensuring <b>the</b> economic <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. The organizational approach was approved using <b>the</b> example <b>of</b> Kharkiv city. <b>The</b> list <b>of</b> threats to <b>the</b> economic <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and their urgency is justified by combining such methods as expert surveys, SWOT-analysis and the hierarchy analysis method.

5|$|As bishop, Burnell had a wall {{built around}} the cathedral at Wells, which helped to improve <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathedral and its {{outlying}} buildings. He left the court each year at Lent, {{when he returned to}} his diocese and attended to its affairs. Peckham appointed Burnell to be his deputy when the archbishop went to Wales in 1282. It was probably Burnell who suggested a compromise in 1285 over the jurisdictions of the royal and ecclesiastical courts, which allowed royal officials to return cases involving only religious matters to the church courts.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the episode}} was broadcast, it was {{announced}} that Rupert Penry-Jones would leave the series after playing Adam Carter for four years, while afterwards, another announcement was made introducing a new lead character, Lucas North. Inspiration towards the plot for the episode, and the remainder of the series, came from the resurgence of Russia, which the producers felt would in subtle ways threaten <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West. The episode was partially filmed on location in Moscow, the first time in series history where filming took place outside the United Kingdom.|$|E

Mackay's injuries were severe {{enough for him to}} be evacuated to Malta and then England, and he did not rejoin his battalion until February 1916, by which time it had been withdrawn to Egypt. For his actions at Lone Pine, Mackay was nominated for the Victoria Cross. He was overlooked for the award, although he was later mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|Following Thermopylae, the Persian {{army had}} {{proceeded}} to burn and sack the Boeotian cities {{which had not}} surrendered, Plataea and Thespiae, before taking possession of the now-evacuated city of Athens. The allied army, meanwhile, prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth. Xerxes wished for a final crushing defeat of the Allies to finish the conquest of Greece in that campaigning season; conversely the allies sought a decisive victory over the Persian navy that would guarantee <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peloponnese.

5|$|Fresh {{worries about}} France, {{combined}} {{with the development of}} rifled cannon and iron-clad warships, led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom being established in 1859, and expressing fears about <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south coast. In response, Sandgate was re-equipped with heavier guns in 1859, and extensive work was carried out on Southsea. Hurst was fitted with two huge batteries of heavy rifled breech-loading guns, protected by iron armour-plate, intended for use against fast-moving enemy warships. Tilbury Blockhouse was destroyed to make way for heavier guns at the fort after 1868. Portland was readopted by army as a garrison base in 1869 in response to fears of an invasion, but it was not rearmed.|$|E
5|$|In mid-November, Allied forces {{attacked}} the Japanese at Buna-Gona in New Guinea.

Therefore, Combined Fleet naval staff officers began to prepare plans for abandoning Guadalcanal and shifting priorities and resources to operations around New Guinea. At this time, the navy did not inform the army of their intentions in this regard.|$|E

Spain received the territory west of the Mississippi, including New Orleans, although they did not make their claim to that city effective until Governor Alejandro O'Reilly suppressed the Rebellion of 1768. Once in control of New Orleans, the Spanish imposed severe restrictions on trade up the Mississippi, cutting off the supply of arms to the Southern Pawnees and Wichitas.|$|E
