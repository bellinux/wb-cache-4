People {{are more likely to}} remember the dream if they are awakened during the REM phase. The average person has three to five dreams per night, and some may have up to seven; however, most dreams are immediately or quickly forgotten. Dreams tend to last longer as the night progresses. During a full eight-hour night sleep, most dreams {{occur in the}} typical two hours of REM.|$|E

Consideration is given primarily to verbal commentary but also to the use of art materials as a medium to facilitate dream image description and interpretation...|$|R
