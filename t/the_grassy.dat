5|$|Males, {{females and}} juveniles each form {{separate}} social groups. The male groups are the smallest; the members stay together {{and search for}} food or water sources. The female group is much larger and covers greater areas. They travel <b>the</b> <b>grassy</b> plains in wet periods and prefer bushy areas in dry periods. Females have a complex linear hierarchy. The nursery and juvenile group is naturally formed when females give birth to calves. After about 24 hours of the delivery, the mother and calf join this group. The calves start befriending each other and stay back in the nursery group while the mother returns to the female group. The calves leave the nursery group when they {{are at least two}} years old and join a male or female group.|$|E
5|$|Gratiot Avenue runs northeasterly through downtown, past Ford Field. Near the stadium, {{the street}} passes over I-375 (Chrysler Freeway) without any direct connections. On {{the east side}} of the freeway, M-3 runs past the Historic Trinity Lutheran and St. John's-St. Luke's Evangelical churches before {{intersecting}} the end of the Fisher Freeway, which at this location is an unnumbered connector to I-75 and I-375. Gratiot continues past the freeway on the city's east side, bordering residential neighborhoods along the way. Through this area, it had a continuous center turn lane, losing <b>the</b> <b>grassy</b> median it had in places downtown. The highway intersects Grand Boulevard near Dueweke Park, and at Van Dyke Avenue, it intersects the southern end of M-53. Gratiot Avenue crosses I-94 at the latter's exit219 near the Coleman A. Young International Airport and an adjacent industrial area.|$|E

There are a souvenir shop and small art gallery and two nature trails. The Grebe Trail is a hard-surfaced, all-weather path suitable for pedestrians, pushchairs and wheelchairs and covers a circuit 0.75miles (1.2km) long, starting and finishing at the wooded picnic area. The Bittern Trail is reached from the Grebe Trail by the footbridge over Hollow Brook. <b>The</b> <b>grassy</b> path is often waterlogged in winter, but there is a boardwalk over a short section. The trail runs along the east shore, visits an open bird hide and returns to the footbridge, making a 1-mile (1.5-kilometre) circuit. Bristol Water imposes conditions on visitors, particularly related to the areas where dogs are allowed.|$|E
5|$|The Albany Pine Bush {{is home to}} {{hundreds}} of species of Lepidoptera (moths), including over 40 Noctuidae considered to be pine barrens specialists. The most well-known species in the area is the Karner blue (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), discovered in the 1940s and named by the author Vladimir Nabokov. The butterfly {{is now on the}} Endangered Species List. Once found in large numbers throughout <b>the</b> <b>grassy</b> openings of the pine barrens, it is today extremely rare and found in a handful of sites. Attempts to reintroduce the butterfly focus on the food and host plant for its larvae – the wild blue lupine, which needs frequent forest fires to maintain its habitat. Other regionally rare butterflies include the dusted skipper (Atrytonopsis hianna), Henry's elfin (Incisalia henrici), frosted elfin (Incisalia irus), and Edward's hairstreak (Satyrium edwardsii). The inland barrens buck moth (Hemileuca maia) is a state-listed special concern animal; and other rare moths include the broad-lined catopyrrha (Catopyrrha coloraria), several noctuid moths (Apharetra purpurea, Chaetaglaea cerata, Chytonix sensilis, Macrochilo bivittata, and Zanclognatha martha), bird dropping moth (Cerma cora), and a geometrid moth (Itame). The Albarufan dagger moth was last seen in the Pine Bush in 1983 and is presumed locally extinct.|$|E
5|$|The Sprain Brook Parkway, {{designated}} by the New York State Department of Transportation as NY987F, a state reference route, begins at a fork from the Bronx River Parkway along the latter's right-of-way along the Bronx River {{in the city of}} Yonkers. Crossing through the Northeast Yonkers neighborhood as a six-lane freeway design, the Sprain Brook crosses an interchange with NY100 (Central Park Avenue) south of Andrus Park. Bending to the north through Yonkers, the Sprain Brook reaches an interchange with Tuckahoe Road, with the northbound and southbound lanes splitting around <b>the</b> <b>Grassy</b> Sprain Reservoir. The two directions bend northeast along the reservoir. The southbound lanes cross Sprain Ridge Park, while the northbound lanes cross through a golf course. Leaving Yonkers for the town of Greenburgh, the lanes of the Sprain Brook come back together, reaching an interchange with Jackson Avenue. The six lane parkway continues northward and to the northeast through Greenburgh, crossing under Ardsley Road. After turning northward once again, the Sprain Brook crosses under a former alignment of NY131 (Underhill Road) and passes by the Sunningdale Country Club.|$|E

5|$|The puffins are {{energetic}} burrow-engineers and repairers and <b>the</b> <b>grassy</b> slopes may {{be undermined}} by {{a network of}} tunnels. This causes the turf to dry out in summer, vegetation to die and dry soil be whirled away by the wind. Burrows sometimes collapse, and humans may cause this to happen by walking incautiously across nesting slopes. A colony on Grassholm was lost through erosion when there was so little soil left that burrows could not be made. New colonies are very unlikely to start up spontaneously because this gregarious bird will only nest where others are already present. Nevertheless, the Audubon Society had success on Eastern Egg Rock Island in Maine, where, after a gap of ninety years, puffins were reintroduced and started breeding again. By 2011 there were over 120 pairs nesting on the small islet. On the Isle of May {{on the other side}} of the Atlantic, only five pairs of puffins were breeding in 1958 while twenty years later there were 10,000 pairs.|$|E
5|$|What is now Route 147 was an {{unimproved}} {{road back}} in 1927. When the 500-series county routes {{were established in}} the 1950s, this road {{became a part of}} County Route 585, a route that ran from Route 109 (then a part of U.S. Route 9) in Lower Township north to U.S. Route 30 and Route 157 in Absecon. The route was also designated as part of County Route 18, which continued west past U.S. Route 9 to Route 47. In 1971, Route 147 was designated to replace the portion of County Route 18/County Route 585 between U.S. Route 9 in Burleigh and the North Wildwood border. As a result of a bridge replacement over <b>the</b> <b>Grassy</b> Sound, Route 147 was realigned off its former drawbridge, and the former alignment became Cape May County Route 665. The southern terminus of County Route 585 was eventually truncated its current location at Route 52 in Somers Point. By the 1990s, Route 147 was extended to its current terminus at New York Avenue in North Wildwood.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 Daytona 500 {{is known}} for the final lap battle between Pearson and Petty. In 2007, ESPN rated the race as the fourth most {{interesting}} Daytona 500. Petty was leading Pearson going into the last lap {{by a couple of}} car lengths. Pearson used the draft to attempt a slingshot pass against Petty {{at the end of the}} back stretch on the last lap, but his car pushed high into the final turn while going around another car. Petty edged under Pearson, and their cars crashed into each other on the frontstretch in the final turns. They both spun out into the infield grass approximately 100 feet (30 meters) short of the finish line. Benny Parsons who was driving the third place car, was over a lap behind the disabled cars. With Petty unable to restart his car, Pearson slowly drove his Wood Brothers Mercury over <b>the</b> <b>grassy</b> infield past the finish line for his only Daytona 500 victory. He won a series-best ten races in 1976, but finished ninth in season points after competing in only 22 of 30 events. He won his only IROC race at the first race of IROC III in 1975/1976 at Michigan International Speedway and finished fifth in points.|$|E
