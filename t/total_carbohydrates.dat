50|$|Net {{carbohydrates}} can {{be calculated}} from a food source by subtracting fiber and sugar alcohols from <b>total</b> <b>carbohydrates.</b> Sugar alcohols contain about two calories per gram, although the American Diabetes Association recommends that diabetics not count alcohol as carbohydrates. Fructose (for example, as found in many industrial sweeteners) has four calories per gram but has a very low glycemic index and does not cause insulin production, probably because β cells have low levels of GLUT5. Leptin, an appetite-regulating hormone, is not triggered following consumption of fructose. This may for some create an unsatisfying feeling after consumption which might promote binge behavior that culminates in an increased blood triglyceride level arising from fructose conversion by the liver.|$|E

The seasonal variation of carbohydrate content of the three cultivars budded on different rootstocks was nearly same. Soluble carbohydrate concentration showed a continuous decrease from January to mid or late-summer, and then slowly began to increase after early autumn till winter. The sucrose was the dominant soluble carbohydrate in leaves. The seasonal evolution of starch content in leaves increased initially during January to March, and then decreased in April. The starch concentration showed a continuous decrease slowly until the mid-autumn, and then accumulation began during late-autumn and winter. The <b>total</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> content differences among the rootstocks were significant, but the content was changed among the cultivars and according to the season. The change in the <b>total</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> content of leaf tissues showed a strong similarity in cultivars budded on different rootstocks throughout the year.
