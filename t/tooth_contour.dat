40|$|Dedicated imaging {{methods are}} among the most {{important}} tools of modern computer-aided medical applications. In the last few years, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has gained popularity in digital dentistry for 3 D imaging of jawbones and teeth. However, the anatomy of a maxillofacial region complicates the assessment of tooth geometry and anatomical location when using standard orthogonal views of the CT data set. In particular, a tooth is defined by a sub-region, which cannot be easily separated from surrounding tissues by only considering pixel grey-intensity values. For this reason, an image enhancement is usually necessary in order to properly segment tooth geometries. In this paper, an anatomy-driven methodology to reconstruct individual 3 D tooth anatomies by processing CBCT data is presented. The main concept is to generate a small set of multi-planar reformation images along significant views for each target tooth, driven by the individual anatomical geometry of a specific patient. The reformation images greatly enhance the clearness of the target <b>tooth</b> <b>contours.</b> A set of meaningful 2 D <b>tooth</b> <b>contours</b> is extracted and used to automatically model the overall 3 D tooth shape through a B-spline representation.

Dental radiographs are often the only means of identifying victims, but manually comparing dental radiographs is inefficient and subject to errors due to fatigue in human experts.

Conventionally, in these networks, air gap permeances are calculated by approximating flux paths; however, it is time inefficient. For an improved simulation time, spatial discretization techniques are presented to calculate air gap permeances in double salient PM machines. The spatial techniques discussed here cover the <b>tooth</b> <b>contour</b> method and Schwarz–Christoffel (SC) mapping as semidiscrete methods, which are used to discretize only the air gap region.

Further on, machine characteristics such as phase flux linkage and cogging torque are also compared to show the impact of the modeling techniques.

40|$|Introduction: Various {{computer}} assisted medical procedures such as dental implant, orthodontic planning, face, jaw and cosmetic surgeries require automatic quantification and volumetric visualization of teeth. In this regard, segmentation {{is a major}} step. Material and Methods: In this paper, inspired by our previous experiences and considering the anatomical knowledge of teeth and jaws, we propose a hybrid technique for teeth segmentation and visualization in CT volumetric data. The major steps of the proposed techniques are as follows: (1) Separation of teeth in CT dataset; (2) Initial segmentation of teeth in panoramic projection; (3) Final segmentation of teeth in CT dataset; (4) 3 D visualization of teeth. Results: The proposed algorithm was evaluated in 30 multi-slice CT datasets. Segmented images were compared with manually outlined contours. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we utilized several common performance measures such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy and mean error rate.

40|$|Dental {{comparison}} {{is a technique}} widely used in forensic science to identify human remains. It involves the comparison of post-mortem (PM) dental information with ante-mortem (AM) information {{in order to establish}} identity. Such information includes x-ray based radiographs―including periapical film and bitewing radiographs, and panoramic radiographs or orthopantomographs (OPGs) ―and written notes and charts from patient records. Dental {{comparison is}} labour-intensive, error prone, and subjective. This has motivated the research and development of computer-assisted dental comparison techniques/systems. Nevertheless the majority of existing approaches to computer-assisted dental comparison have focussed on the use of conventional x-ray radiographs because they are the most abundant source of AM image data. However, the use of PM conventional radiographs is problematic for several reasons including: their inherently poor image quality, the difficulty matching the AM and PM viewing geometries, and the difficulty obtaining such radiographs when the state of the dental remains is poor. This thesis explores an alternative approach, that does not suffer these limitations, based on acquiring PM x-ray computed tomography (CT) data and using it to reconstruct 2 D radiograph-like images for matching against AM radiographs. In particular the thesis describes and develops several image processing and analysis tools for the purpose of comparing digitised AM dental radiographs to PM dental CT data. These include algorithms for synthesising/reconstructing 2 D radiograph-like images from dental CT data, a metal artefact reduction algorithm for attenuating CT image artefacts resulting from metal restorations in the teeth, a semi-automatic tool for segmenting individual <b>tooth</b> <b>contours</b> in 2 D radiographs, and an algorithm for automatically and quantitatively matching AM <b>tooth</b> <b>contours</b> in conventional radiographs to those in 2 D panoramic-like images reconstructed from PM CT data. A prototype dental identification system (DIS), based on these algorithms, is also described and evaluated. The system is able to reconstruct a 2 D panoramic-like image from a dental CT data set and to match this against a database of AM digitised bitewing radiographs to establish identity.

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of tooth anatomies {{is of utmost}} importance when dental implant surgeries and/or orthodontic corrections must be planned. In the last few years, cone beam CT (CBCT) has gained popularity in dentistry for 3 D imaging of jawbones and teeth. However, within CBCT data sets, each tooth is defined by a region, which cannot be easily separated from surrounding tissues (i. e., bone tissue) by only considering pixel’s grey-intensity values. For this reason, some enhancement is usually {{necessary in order to}} properly segment tooth geometries. In this paper, a semi-automatic approach to reconstruct individual 3 D tooth anatomies by processing CBCT-scan data is presented. The methodology is based on the creation of a minimal number of 2 D “local ray-sum” images by adding the absorption values of adjacent voxels along the most significant views for each tooth. The knowledge of the specific anatomical patient morphology drives the selection of these significant projection directions. The reconstructed “ray-sum” images greatly enhance the clearness of the root contours, which can then be interactively traced by dentists. A set of meaningful 2 D <b>tooth</b> <b>contours</b> is consequently obtained and used to automatically extract a cubic spline curve for each transverse slice, thus approximating the overall 3 D tooth profile.

This report describes a case of congenital hypothyroidism in a 20 -year-old female patient, presenting with a short stature, hypotonia, alopecia, euryprosopic face with puffiness, multiple retained deciduous teeth, delayed fusion of the intracranial sutures, and epiphysis and diaphysis of the long bones. Based on various biochemical and radiographic investigations, diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism was established. Craniometry and hand-wrist radiographic evaluation of the growth pattern further aided in strengthening the diagnosis...|$|R
5000|$|Interdental food packing - (food getting {{pushed down}} between teeth) - {{this can be}} caused by missing teeth, tilted, spaced or crowded <b>teeth,</b> or poorly <b>contoured</b> approximal dental fillings. Food debris becomes trapped, {{undergoes}} slow bacterial putrefaction and release of malodorous volatiles. Food packing can also cause a localized periodontal reaction, characterized by dental pain that is relieved by cleaning the area of food packing with interdental brush or floss.|$|R
50|$|The goblet is {{prepared}} by a gold tin engraving method. It is spherical, with a hollow stem and wide mouth opening. The {{center of the}} stem is surrounded by three pairs of lions facing each other. The images of the animals are made by the engraving method. They have wide open mouths, and tongues marked by two crossing lines. Their tails are long, wrapped around the stem with tangled edges. Delicate patterns accent the claws, muscles, <b>teeth,</b> eyes, and <b>contoured</b> ears. The line of lions on top and bottom are surrounded by zig-zag delicate engraved belts. The vessel has a handle, as demonstrated by two holes drilled on the stem.|$|R
5|$|Disorders of the maxillary sinus can be {{referred}} to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these <b>teeth</b> disrupt the <b>contour</b> of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and neoplasms of the sinus (such as adenoid cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or tilting the head forward.|$|R
30|$|Mucosal {{dehiscence}} around dental implants {{has frequently}} been observed. This phenomenon not only causes an esthetic disturbance in the anterior region {{but it may}} also lead to poor oral hygiene in the posterior region, because molar <b>teeth</b> exhibit <b>contours</b> with prominent convexities leading to accumulation of plaque. A few clinical articles on mucosal dehiscence coverage around dental implant have been published [1, 2]. Of these, only one study has been randomized controlled [3], whereas the other has been either a small a series of cases or a case report related to recession around a single implant. A literature review and a conference paper cited that dehiscence coverage around dental implant is technique-sensitive [1, 2]. Although no recommendation can be made to support the selection of one technique over another [1, 2], coronary positioned flap (CPF) with sub-epithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) {{is considered to be a}} major treatment option. The present case report demonstrates a peri-implant mucosal dehiscence coverage technique with modified semilunar CPF in the posterior zone. This favorable result may be attributed to improved peri-operative usability and post-operative stability of the conventional technique.|$|R
