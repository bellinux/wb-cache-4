5|$|By {{the events}} of Drakengard 3, Zero had forged a {{partnership}} with the dragon Michael: as dragons are the only beings that can destroy Intoners, Michael would help Zero kill her sisters, then kill her to finish off the flower. Their first attempt to take down all the Intoners ends in disaster, with Zero losing her arm and Michael being wounded and forced to reincarnate as the child dragon Mikhail. During their second attempt, they attack each one individually: after killing one, Zero takes on their disciple, a servant created <b>to</b> <b>magnify</b> the Intoners' powers, who each help in battle and act as a personal harem. Before facing One, Zero reverts her disciples to their original bird forms, releasing them from their servitude. During the battle, both One and Mikhail are killed, then Zero is killed by a male clone of One created as a fail-safe in the event of Zero's victory.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the next}} morning, as he {{prepared}} to advance further, Caesar received word from Atrius that, once again, his ships at anchor had been dashed against each other in a storm and suffered considerable damage. About forty, he says, were lost. The Romans were unused to Atlantic and Channel tides and storms, but nevertheless, considering the damage he had sustained the previous year, this was poor planning on Caesar's part. However, Caesar may have exaggerated the number of ships wrecked <b>to</b> <b>magnify</b> his own achievement in rescuing the situation. He returned to the coast, recalling the legions that had gone ahead, and immediately set about repairing his fleet.

25|$|In addition, {{the ideal}} city {{is used as}} an image to {{illuminate}} the state of one's soul, or the will, reason, and desires combined in the human body.

The ideal city is not promoted, but only used <b>to</b> <b>magnify</b> the different kinds of individual humans and the state of their soul. However, the philosopher king image was used by many after Plato to justify their personal political beliefs. The philosophic soul according to Socrates has reason, will, and desires united in virtuous harmony. A philosopher has the moderate love for wisdom and the courage to act according to wisdom. Wisdom is knowledge about the Good or the right relations between all that exists.|$|E
25|$|A source which {{concentrates}} on Cerball's career is the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, so called because only fragments remain of a seemingly longer work, these again copied by Mac Fhirbhisigh in the 17th century from a 15th-century manuscript. The fragment {{which deals with}} Cerball's lifetime ends in the early 870s, so that {{the last fifteen years}} of his life are missing. Joan Radner, editor and translator of the modern edition of the Fragmentary Annals, argues that these were compiled at the court of Cerball's great-great-grandson Donnchad mac Gilla Pátraic. Although called annals, these are closer to narrative history and are derived from a number of sources. The basic framework is from the Chronicle of Ireland, but to this has been added a variety of material whose source is unknown, perhaps including early sagas, which concerns Cerball. The Fragmentary Annals were intended <b>to</b> <b>magnify</b> Cerball's achievements, and to present his dealings with Vikings and Norse–Gaels in a favourable light.|$|E

40|$|The {{cross grid}} encoder is a {{diffraction}} grating type encoder to measure two-dimensional {{position of a}} optical head by using a grid plate, and is widely used in the industry to evaluate the two-dimensional contouring performance of a machine tool. In the graphical display of measured contouring error profiles, the error is often <b>magnified</b> <b>to</b> some given scale {{with respect to the}} reference trajectory. The conventional algorithm <b>to</b> compute the <b>magnified</b> contouring error profile, adopted in a commercial software to analyze an error profile measured by the cross grid encoder, makes the magnified trajectory discontinuous when the given reference trajectory is unsmooth, which makes it difficult <b>to</b> understand the <b>magnified</b> trajectory especially at corners.

Application examples are presented with error profiles obtained by using a cross grid encoder applied to a commercial machining center...|$|R

25|$|Bereft {{of further}} combat {{replacements}} for his hard-pressed Marauder battalions, Stilwell {{felt he had}} no choice but to continue offensive operations with his existing forces, using the Marauders as 'the point of the spear' until they had either achieved all their objectives, or were wiped out. He was also concerned that pulling out the Marauders, the only U.S. ground unit in the campaign, resulted in charges of favoritism, forcing him to evacuate the exhausted Chinese and British Chindit forces as well. When General William Slim, commander of British and Commonwealth forces in Burma, informed Stilwell that his men were exhausted and should be withdrawn, Stilwell rejected the idea, insisting that his subordinate commanders simply did not understand enlisted men and their tendency <b>to</b> <b>magnify</b> physical challenges. Having made his own 'long march' out of Burma under his own power using jungle trails, Stilwell found it difficult to sympathize with those who had been in combat in the jungle for months on end without relief. In retrospect, his statements at the time revealed a lack of understanding of the limitations of lightly equipped unconventional forces when used in conventional roles. Myitkyina and the dispute over evacuation policy precipitated a hurried Army Inspector General investigation, followed by U.S. congressional committee hearings, though no disciplinary measures were taken against General Stilwell for his decisions as overall commander.|$|E
