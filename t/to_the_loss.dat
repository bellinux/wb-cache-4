5|$|With {{the decline}} of the whaling {{industry}} and the California Gold Rush, in the late 1840s, Hawaii's population dropped, and infectious disease epidemics contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of local populations.|$|E
5|$|After the hurricane's passage, {{officials}} deployed the Florida National Guard to {{affected areas}} {{in order to}} maintain order and quell looting. Across Florida, a total of 3,897people filed damage claims after receiving damage from the hurricane, 80% of them in the Miami area. Insurance companies paid about $1million to compensate for the storm damage. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> in citrus crop, prices briefly increased, although they returned to normal levels by late October.|$|E

5|$|Because of the B-52's mission parameters, {{only modest}} {{maneuvers}} {{would be required}} with no need for spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord rudder, giving it limited yaw control authority. Originally an all-moving vertical stabilizer was to be used, but was abandoned because of doubts about hydraulic actuator reliability. Because the aircraft has eight engines, asymmetrical thrust due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of an engine in flight would be minimal and correctable with the narrow rudder.|$|E
5|$|Children {{were also}} {{affected}} through {{the loss of}} parents in the bombing. Many children lost one or more parents in the blast, with a reported seven children that lost their only remaining parent. Children of the disaster have been raised by single parents, foster parents, and other family members. Adjusting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> has made these children suffer psychologically and emotionally. One interview revealed the sleepless nights and obsession with death {{of one of the}} at least ten orphaned children.|$|E
5|$|Combining the {{strengths}} of the both companies was not successful in bus chassis production because of strategic mistakes by SAT. The Vanaja LK-series with a large, centrally mounted engine was discontinued, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of the main customer, Väinö Paunu Oy. SAT offered Sisu chassis to replace the Vanaja models, but a number of bus operators, including TKL, rejected them.|$|E

5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of the {{original}} multi-track tape, {{there had never been}} an official true stereo release of the final track until the 2012 remastered version of Smiley Smile. The stereo mix was made possible through the invention of new digital technology by Derry Fitzgerald, and received the blessing of Brian Wilson and Mark Linett. Fitzgerald's software extracted individual instrumental and vocal stems from {{the original}} mono master—as the multi-track vocals remained missing—to construct the stereo version that appears on the 2012 reissue of Smiley Smile.|$|E
5|$|Early in July, Gilmore {{was rushed}} to the {{emergency}} room after suffering from vision problems. He was immediately hospitalized and compelled to undergo surgery after he was diagnosed with a detached retina. Gilmore's campaign was stalled as the candidate was ordered by doctors to restrict travel for an indefinite period. The doctors revealed that Gilmore's vision problems could have deteriorated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of eyesight.|$|E
5|$|Following negotiations, the JNA {{evacuated}} its Jastrebarsko barracks on 13 November. The garrison left, under ECMM escort, to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The next day, {{an agreement}} to evacuate the JNA from Šibenik {{was made in the}} village of Žitnić near Drniš. The Yugoslav Navy's bombardment of Split, Šolta and Brač on 15 Novemberin response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of a Mukos (PČ-176) patrol boatand the subsequent Battle of the Dalmatian channels appeared to have derailed the Žitnić agreement.|$|E
50|$|Other typhoons {{also contributed}} their share <b>to</b> <b>the</b> damage and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> of <b>the</b> cooperative. Typhoon Puring in 1994 and Typhoon Pepang in 1995 caused {{setbacks}} to CENECO's efforts to recover.|$|R
50|$|In 2007 {{a report}} stated that, due to new {{development}} and older residents, {{certain areas of}} RISD faced student decreases. The removal of some low income apartment complexes contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>losses.</b>|$|R

5|$|Fox {{suffered}} an outage during their broadcast of Game 1, {{resulting in a}} loss of coverage for 15 minutes, followed by a 5-minute delay in-game while officials addressed the availability of video review due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of Fox's feed; the teams agreed to allow the use of footage from the world feed of the game for video review. Fox temporarily switched to the MLB International feed of the game with Vasgersian and Smoltz to restore coverage. The video from the feed was then accompanied by Fox's commentators before the full Fox production was restored.|$|E
5|$|German {{fighter pilot}} Siegfried Bethke said that German {{aircraft}} that {{crashed into the}} Channel were not counted in the official figures and that one aircraft in his unit that was damaged by 88 hits was broken up and taken back to Germany and not added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> record.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of life by uniformed soldiers, millions {{died in the}} superpowers' proxy wars {{around the}} globe, most notably in Southeast Asia. Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War; interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, as well as refugee and displaced persons crises have declined sharply in the post-Cold War years. Left over from the Cold War are numbers stations, which are shortwave radio stations thought {{to be used to}} broadcast covert messages, some of which can still be heard today.|$|E
25|$|Between January and May 1944 the Luftwaffe {{undertook}} Operation Steinbock, {{the so-called}} Baby Blitz, assembling 474 bombers {{for a campaign}} against London. Steinbock was called off when V-1 rockets became available for the retribution attacks and after <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of 329 bombers. The lack of night flying experience of <b>the</b> crew contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>losses.</b> <b>The</b> bomber force, {{under the command of}} Oberst Dietrich Peltz, now had only 143 bombers available for the Normandy invasion.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> {{listed above}} an estimated 2.5 to 3.2 million Soviet civilians died due to famine and disease in non-occupied {{territory of the}} USSR, which was caused by wartime shortages in the rear areas.|$|R
5|$|Most tern {{species are}} declining in numbers due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> or {{disturbance}} of breeding habitat, pollution and increased predation. Gull populations have {{increased over the}} last century because of reduced persecution and the availability of food from human activities, and terns have been forced out of many traditional nesting areas by the larger birds. A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the Arctic tern in Scandinavia, Forster's tern around the Great Lakes, the Sandwich tern in eastern North America and its yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{structural}} material was long ago carried off for reuse in buildings in Cley and Blakeney. The surviving ruins are protected as a scheduled monument and Grade II listed building because of their historical importance, {{but there is no}} active management. The ever-present threat from the encroaching sea is likely to accelerate following a realignment of the Glaven's course through the marshes, and lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of the ruins.|$|E
5|$|Oil {{production}} was slowed {{as a result}} of Humberto, as at least four refineries—the Valero, ExxonMobil, Total SA and Motiva Enterprises LLC plants in Port Arthur—were halted due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of power. Oil prices rose above $80 a barrel in intraday trading on September 12 as a result, ending the next day at a record high of $80.09 a barrel. Natural gas futures rose 8percent ahead of the storm, but lost most of those gains the next day.|$|E
50|$|In February 1941, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> of pilots {{during the}} Battle of Britain, an Army Council Instruction (ACI) was issued which stated that British Army {{personnel}} could apply <b>to</b> transfer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> RAF, which 18,000 officers took up.|$|R

During this delay, second officer Aeneas Mackintosh suffered an accident that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of his right eye. After emergency surgery by Marshall and Mackay, he was forced to relinquish his shore party place and go back to New Zealand with Nimrod. He recovered sufficiently to return with the ship in the following season.|$|E
5|$|Pattle was {{provisionally}} {{credited with}} 50 air victories (and two shared), seven (and one shared) probable victories, and four (and two shared) damaged. It {{is likely that}} his total was at least 40 enemy aircraft destroyed a figure which biographer Edgar Baker has compiled through a list of semi-official records and log-books. Baker asserts that the true figure could be higher, owing to the inability of post-war researchers to identify an exact figure, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> or destruction of British records in the retreat from Greece or during the subsequent occupation.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, however, Dayton's {{population}} has declined, mainly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan areas, {{as well as}} the national housing crisis that began in 2008. While much of the state has suffered for similar reasons, the impact on Dayton has been greater than most. Dayton had the third-greatest percentage loss of population in the state since the 1980s, behind Cleveland and Youngstown. Despite this, Dayton has begun diversifying its workforce from manufacturing into other growing sectors such as healthcare and education.|$|E
