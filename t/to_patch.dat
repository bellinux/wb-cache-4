McKay (David Hewlett) determines that the power {{conduits}} are damaged, preventing Atlantis from completing its jump to the planet M12-578. While teams are sent <b>to</b> <b>patch</b> them up, the shield starts to collapse, resulting {{in the deaths of}} one team. McKay later decides to collapse the shield to cover the central tower in order to conserve power, and give Zelenka (David Nykl) time <b>to</b> <b>patch</b> up the conduits. However, the city approaches an asteroid belt, {{and the only way to}} go through without using up the power is for Sheppard to lead a fleet of Puddle Jumpers and clear a path. Although inexperienced, the pilots succeed, but impacts from the stragglers damage the stardrive control crystals, and they have to fix it before jumping again.|$|E
5|$|On August 24 Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller {{announced}} that her government would provide JA$225million in emergency {{assistance to the}} country's agriculture sector, especially the parishes of Portland, Clarendon, St. Thomas, Manchester, St. Catherine and St. Elizabeth. JA$100million was immediately allocated to the purchase of fertilizers, JA$25million to the Blue Mountain coffee farmers, and the Agriculture Ministry's JA$50million fruit tree programme was accelerated. She also {{announced that}} the National Housing Trust had established a JA$500million programme to provide loans at 6% per annum for emergency repairs. The National Housing Trust also made JA$200million available to the Hurricane Relief Fund. The government provided tarpaulins, 10,000 of which were shipped in after the storm, free of charge <b>to</b> <b>patch</b> houses with damaged roofs.|$|E

The Rajputs first expelled the commandants of Jodhpur and Hindaun-Bayana and recovered Amber by a night attack. They next killed Sayyid Hussain Khan Barha, the commandant of Mewat and many other officers (September, 1708).

Parasitoids of fungivorous flies allocate more searching time <b>to</b> <b>patches</b> containing a filtrate of mushrooms infested with host larvae compared <b>to</b> <b>patches</b> with a filtrate of uninfested mushrooms. Filtrates of mushrooms infested with a non-host species do not increase their searching time. Studies with parasitoids of frugivorous Drosophila showed {{that the ability to}} recognize kairomone is acquired through learning. Females without oviposition experience do not respond differently <b>to</b> <b>patches</b> with and without kairomone. Parasitoids that had learned the kairomone of one drosophilid host species also recognized the kairomone of another host species, which suggests that kairomones from Drosophilidae may be similar. ...|$|R
5|$|By 01:00, {{there was}} too much water in the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began to enter the forward {{generator}} compartments, which forced the crew to work by candlelight. LÃ¼tzow was so low in the water by 01:30 that water began to flood the forward boiler room. By that point, almost all of the compartments in the forward part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the upper portion of the ship forward of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser's crew attempted <b>to</b> <b>patch</b> the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly washed over the deck and inhibited progress on the repair work. The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but this had to be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; forward draft had increased to over 17meters.|$|E
5|$|Music {{composer}} James Horner {{felt he was}} {{not given}} enough time to create a musical score. Horner arrived in England and expected the film to write the score in six weeks, which {{he thought was a}} sufficient amount of time. Horner, however, discovered that filming and editing were still taking place, and he was unable to view the film. He visited the sets and editing rooms for three weeks and found that editor Ray Lovejoy was barely keeping up with the workload for reasons of time restrictions. Horner believed Cameron was preoccupied with sound effects, citing that Cameron spent two days with the sound engineer creating the sounds for the pulse rifles. He also complained that he was given an outdated recording studio; the score was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, a 30-year-old studio that was barely able <b>to</b> <b>patch</b> in synthesizers or use the electronic equipment that Horner required.|$|E
5|$|On September25, the {{government}} of Spain approved $1.07million in food assistance for Cuba. On September29, {{the government}} of Japan sent water equipment, soap, towels, and emergency health kits worth $119,200 to the affected areas in Cuba. By February 1999, the Japanese Government had provided Cuba with nearly $1million in disaster funds. An emergency cash grant of $50,000 was also given to Cuba by the United Nations. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized about 8,700 volunteers to assist victims of the storm in the 900 shelters set up throughout the island. Plastic sheeting was to be distributed {{for about a week}} for residents <b>to</b> <b>patch</b> holes in the roof of their homes. The National Council of Churches sent relief goods valued at $70,000 to the Cuban Government on October9. By February 1999, the Cuban Red Cross distributed over 30,000 sheets of roofing to nearly 5,500 people in three provinces. Several months after the storm, the Cuban Government reported that they had allocated about $38million in funds for Hurricane Georges.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after its}} debut, {{most of the}} {{development}} staff were laid off; the remaining staff tried <b>to</b> <b>patch</b> Bloodlines and develop game concepts to secure funding to keep Troika in business. Troika, unable to obtain further funding from Activision or other publishers, released its employees in two waves: the first in November 2004, followed by the remaining staff in December, except for its three founders Anderson, Boyarsky, and Tim Cain. Some employees worked without pay to fix the game. When the company closed in February 2005, it had secured no other game development deals. That month, Boyarsky confirmed that Troika had not {{been working on a}} patch for the game since most of its staff were gone since December 2004. In a November 2004 interview Boyarsky said that although the team would like to pursue a Bloodlines sequel, the decision was Activision's. In a 2006 interview, Anderson said that although Troika Games' library had been critically well received, consistent technical issues had marred the perception of the company's games, contributing to Troika's difficulty in obtaining new projects.|$|E
5|$|Sixty {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families {{set up for}} the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and Murphys another, and Reeds and Graveses the third. Keseberg built a lean-to for his family {{against the side of the}} Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide <b>to</b> <b>patch</b> the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, 6 of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: 6 men, 3 women, and 12 children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4âthe beginning of a storm that lasted 8 days.|$|E
5|$|Streltsov was {{released}} on 4 February 1963, five years into his twelve-year sentence, and owing to the ban from professional play began to split his time between work at the ZiL factory {{and the study of}} automotive engineering at the attached technical college. After failing <b>to</b> <b>patch</b> up his differences with Alla, he married Raisa Mikhailovna in September 1963. He started to play for the amateur factory team, which caused it to attract large crowds, both at home and away. When the ZiL side travelled to Gorky for an away match late in the 1964 season, the team's coach received orders from above not to play Streltsov, something which spectators noticed immediately when the match started; during the first half, they began to riot and threatened to burn down the stadium, chanting Streltsov's name. Worried that the angry crowd might go through with this, the Gorky factory chief ordered the ZiL coach to send Streltsov out for the second half. On stepping onto the field, the former Gulag prisoner received a standing ovation.|$|E

5|$|The 1986 SQL {{standard}} basically adopted Codd's proposal {{after an}} implementation prototype in IBM System R. Although Don Chamberlin recognized nulls (alongside duplicate rows) {{as one of}} the most controversial features of SQL, he defended the design of Nulls in SQL invoking the pragmatic arguments that it was the least expensive form of system support for missing information, saving the programmer from many duplicative application-level checks (see semipredicate problem) while at the same time providing the database designer with the option not to use Nulls if he so desires; for example, in order to avoid well known anomalies (discussed in the semantics section of this article). Chamberlin also argued that besides providing some missing-value functionality, practical experience with Nulls also led to other language features which rely on Nulls, like certain grouping constructs and outer joins. Finally, he argued that in practice Nulls also end up being used as a quick way <b>to</b> <b>patch</b> an existing schema when it needs to evolve beyond its original intent, coding not for missing but rather for inapplicable information; for example, a database that quickly needs to support electric cars while having a miles-per-gallon column.|$|E
5|$|The band {{continued}} to release commercially successful albums, including Some Girls (1978) and Tattoo You (1981), which were their most popular albums worldwide. From 1983 to 1987, tensions between Jagger and Richards almost caused the band to split. However, they managed <b>to</b> <b>patch</b> up their friendship after they separated temporarily {{to work on}} solo projects, and experienced a comeback with Steel Wheels (1989), which {{was followed by a}} large stadium and arena tour. Since the 1990s, new recorded material from the group has been less well-received and less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones have {{continued to}} be a huge attraction on the live circuit, with stadium tours in the 1990s and 2000s. By 2007, the band had four of the top five highest-grossing concert tours of all time: Voodoo Lounge Tour (1994â1995), Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997â1998), Licks Tour (2002â2003) and A Bigger Bang Tour (2005â2007).|$|E

40|$|A {{laboratory}} experiment {{was performed to}} estimate the elemental composition of rhizomorphs of an ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungus growing in a patchy environment. Successive samples of Rhizopogon rhizomorphs, located adjacent <b>to</b> <b>patches</b> with organic matter or patches with acid-washed sand, were taken {{over a period of}} 45 d. The mass per unit area was analyzed with scanning transmission ion microscopy (STIM), and the elemental content of elements heavier than Mg were analyzed with particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE). Rhizomorphs associated with the organic matter on average were three times heavier per unit area than rhizomorphs associated with sand. The Ca concentration (mg g(- 1)) increased in rhizomorphs adjacent <b>to</b> <b>patches</b> with sand, while it decreased in rhizomorphs adjacent <b>to</b> <b>patches</b> with organic matter. Fe concentration was higher in rhizomorphs adjacent <b>to</b> <b>patches</b> with sand. We concluded that the EM fungus responded to the organic matter by producing larger rhizomorphs, rather than increasing the concentration of elements in the rhizomorphs, to improve the transport of elements to the roots. The elemental composition of rhizomorphs varied considerably over time, and the accumulation of Ca in rhizomorphs in the sand-filled compartments could be the effect of acropetal flow of solutes from the plant roots toward the mycelial front...|$|R
