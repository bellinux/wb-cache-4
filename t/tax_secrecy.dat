40|$|Transparency {{represents}} today a {{key issue}} on the agendas of international and domestic tax policy makers. Improving the access and the exchange of relevant tax information and removing existing bank and <b>tax</b> <b>secrecy</b> regimes is currently seen as the most effective tool, together with the identification of harmful tax regimes and practices, to counter both tax evasion and harmful or aggressive tax competition. Action item 13 of the BEPS Action Plan suggests to reform {{the structure of the}} transfer pricing documentation and introduce a new reporting requirement {{in the form of a}} countryby-country reporting template. Although such new reporting requirement is meant to provide an informative tool for the up-front identification of transfer pricing risks within the group, its unexpected area of application may become the improvement of the global acceptance of the formulary apportionment idea for the allocation of multinational enterprises’ profits. This article aims to provide a critical review of the proposed template and assess its potential in reviving the debate on formulary apportionment.

At its best, the ‘request of information process’ is an automatic transfer system based on the despatch of data in bulk format either upon request, at defined points in time, or following detection in the relevant offshore jurisdiction. This process lacks scope for timeliness in detection and enforcement. There is also scope for errors in analysing data for its potential use as evidence in other legal systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} that tax havens play {{a prominent role}} in international service trade and investigates the nature of this role. We employ a firm-level dataset with detailed information about service trade and foreign affiliates for virtually all multinational firms in Germany, which allows us to approximately distinguish trade between related and unrelated parties. We find that the service trade of tax havens partly reflects genuine specialization in service industries, which suggests that institutional features such as low <b>tax</b> rates, <b>secrecy</b> and low regulatory standards create a comparative advantage in service production. We also find that trade in service categories such as intellectual property (patents and trademarks) and headquarter services (administration, management and advertising) partly reflects mispriced affiliate trade serving to shift profits to tax havens. We argue, however, that the loss of government revenue resulting from this type of corporate tax evasion is likely to be modest...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to {{research}} the regulatory framework of the Greek tax audit procedure and its application by the tax authorities under a constitutional aspect, in order to propose a constitutional “model” of the tax audit. For this purpose, the constitutional and institutional framework of the tax procedure {{as well as the}} tax audit procedure was examined. Then, the constitutional rules and principles that should apply for the formation of the regulatory framework and during the execution of the tax audit were examined. The thesis shows that the current tax audit procedure introduces several constitutional issues. More specifically, the regulatory framework of the tax audit does not agree with the principles of good legislation. Furthermore, the tax administration knows almost no strategic planning nor is it stuffed with capable civil servants, which are constantly educated and valuated. In addition, the ambiguous regulatory framework of preventive, temporary and supplementary tax audit may cause contradictions and phenomena of arbitrariness against the tax payers. The same applies for some of the methods for the simplification of the tax audit procedure, {{such as the use of}} computed values and the automated closure of the tax cases. Questions are also raised in connection with the constitutionality of measures, such as the prolonging of the time of the statute of limitation of the right of the State to issue tax assessments acts. Moreover, the classification of the majority of the tax sanctions as administrative sanctions, though some of the have the characteristics of penal sanctions, has as a result that the taxpayers are not entitled to fundamental defend rights. Furthermore, the right of <b>tax</b> <b>secrecy</b> is violated by the numerous exemptions of the said secrecy. Anti-constitutional limitations are also introduced as far as the right of hearing and the access right are concerned. Finally, the one-dimensional superiority recognised in favour of the public revenue interest indirectly causes many of the constitutional problems of the tax audit procedure. ...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{aim of the}} EUSD {{was that}} all countries would freely disclose interest earned by a resident of an EU country {{in order to ensure}} that the interest was fully declared in his country of residence. The plan was that non-EU countries would also agree to disclose information about the interest earned by EU residents. Many non-EU states and countries agreed to introduce similar measures. These countries included most tax havens and dependent territories of the EU countries. Countries such as the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, Cayman Islands, Andorra, Turks & Caicos, British Virgin Islands, Monaco, Switzerland, and many others thus agreed to implement similar or transitional arrangements (see below). The transitional arrangements involved the payment of a withholding <b>tax</b> whilst bank <b>secrecy</b> remained protected.|$|R

40|$|Global tax {{abuse is}} one of the key {{obstacles}} to sustainable development. Each year more than USD one trillion are lost to cross border tax abuse and stored away in tax havens. We establish that tax abuse accumulates capital, makes tax systems more regressive and diminishes government revenues. Tax abuse consequently indirectly increases economic inequality and relative poverty and reduces social expenditure affecting both dimensions of economic and social rights fulfillment: the ability of people to claim their rights in the market place or through the provision of entitlements. We test our theory in a cross-sectional study and find empirical evidence for several of the factors in our theory. Both revenue generation and expenditure of fiscal policy are subject to the obligations to progressively realize economic and social human rights by using the maximum of available resources. We confirm that Mozambique has respect, protect and fulfill obligations to refrain from granting extensive tax exemptions, prevent tax avoidance and prosecute tax evasion. State parties hosting and controlling multinational corporations committing tax abuse abroad have similar extraterritorial obligations. <b>Tax</b> havens and <b>secrecy</b> jurisdictions deliberately undermine the sovereignty of other states in domestic resource mobilization for rights fulfillment...|$|R

40|$|Corruption in Brazil is endemic and has {{increased}} {{since the end}} of the military transition regime in 1985, a year marked by an indirect presidential election, which was followed by the 1988 Constitutional Reform. The present thesis answers the research question of how corruption affects well-being in Brazil" by investigating the existing cause-effect relationships and complex dynamics and logic between corruption and related variables in Brazil, with each of the twenty-seven causal diagrams being analyzed individually. Among the key findings are that (i) a center role is played by the level of quality of institutions, (ii) high corruption is a symptom of a fundamental problem with the independence, quality and effectiveness of the judiciary, and that (iii) corruption is dominated by fast destructive reinforcing loops that can deteriorate quite rapidly if left unwatched, and improvement to lower corruption levels is characterized by feedback loops with long delays. The present thesis also recommends anti-corruption policies that can result in lower levels of corruption and in improved well-being. Among the several policies recommended are: stop impunity of the corrupt, close the loophole on the penal procedure code that allows corrupt criminals to escape serving jail time, introduce severe jail sentences to the corrupt, strengthen control of corruption, strengthen the procedure for nomination of Supreme Court Judges and to ensure the independence of the judiciary, introduce the study of corruption at all levels of the school curricula, introduce a political reform to stop reelection and to strengthen the electoral system to promote the election of non- corrupt representatives, introduce policies to strengthen the control of the black market for currencies and illicit financial flows, including money laundering, trade misinvoicing, anonymous companies, <b>tax</b> havens, bank <b>secrecy</b> and others - ultimately, allow Brazil to win the war against corruption...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{collapse}} of the Celtic Tiger, the socio-economic particularity of neoliberal capitalism in its Irish manifestation has increasingly been critiqued, but little {{attention has been paid to}} neoliberalism as ecology within Ireland. This article conducts an exploratory survey of the characteristics of the Irish neoliberal ecological regime during and after the Celtic Tiger, identifying the opening of new commodity frontiers (such as fracking, water, agro-biotechnology, and biopharma) constituted in the neoliberal drive to appropriate and financialize nature. I argue for the usefulness of applying not only the tools of world-systems analysis, but also Jason W. Moore’s world-ecological paradigm, to analysis of Ireland as a semi-periphery. What is crucial to a macro-ecological understanding of Ireland’s role in the neoliberal regime of the world-ecology is the inextricability of its financial role as a <b>tax</b> haven and <b>secrecy</b> jurisdiction zone from its environmental function as a semi-peripheral pollution and water haven. We can adapt Jason W. Moore’s slogan that “Wall Street…becomes a way of organizing all of nature, characterized by the financialization of any income-generating activity” (Moore 2011 b: 39) to say that to say that the “IFSC is a way of organizing nature,” with pernicious consequences for water, energy, and food systems in Ireland. Financial service centers and pharmaceutical factories, plantations and cattle ranches, tax havens and pollution havens, empires and common markets are all forms of environment-making that constellate human relations and extra-human processes into new ecological regimes. More expansive, dialectical understandings of “ecology” as comprising the whole of socio-ecological relations within the capitalist world-ecology—from farming to pharma to financialization—are crucial to forming configurations of knowledge able not only to take account of Ireland’s role in the environmental history of capitalism, but also to respond to the urgent ecological crises of the neoliberal present...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this report is to provide Glencore with {{applicable}} recommendations {{so that it can}} improve its sustainable reputation. The second purpose of the work is to present all risks incurred by Glencore’s non-application of sustainable recommendations. Recommendations and risks have been developed based on literature, interviews and companies’ good practices. Sustainability reports of mining companies publicly quoted have been intensively used to grasp the different sustainability criterions known and applied in the sector. Recommendations and risks analysis have been presented in a consistent manner throughout the report as per the following: 1 st good practice based on literature is presented, 2 nd Glencore’s practice is highlighted, 3 rd recommendations are formulated and 4 th risks if Glencore does not implement these recommendations are also developed. The work starts with a brief presentation of Glencore including its flotation as well as its merger with Xstrata. The work then considers the global economic growth {{and its impact on the}} health of extractive companies as well as on the environment and the population. Secondly, as the goal of this work is not to criticize the commodity sector but rather to improve it, the importance and knowledge of trading and mining activities, to balance supply and demand, is also demonstrated. Thirdly, the environment of the sector going toward more transparency with many supporting initiatives and the reputational risk mining and trading will face if they do not reckon on this trend is mentioned. Finally, in order to familiarize the reader with Glencore’s top controversies, various examples on Glencore’s past negative experiences are given and explained. These examples include <b>tax,</b> corporate, transparency, <b>secrecy,</b> pollution and human rights issues. This introduction phase is followed by the core of the analysis that features the following results: The results of this report demonstrate that despite Glencore’s relatively recent active engagement in sustainability development, the company is still classified as a relatively poor performer compared to competitors. Moreover, a little less than thirty recommendations related mainly to transparency, communication and management have been formulated and eighteen risks have been established. The report concludes with the responsibility companies have in developing countries. The role of a company active in the mining sector in countries where governance is very weak is not necessarily to improve governance, human rights and legal loopholes all by itself, but it is essential that it does not aggravate the situation. The job of a mining company is to win a so called “license to operate” through trust-building established over several years of upright practices and understands that many benefits will follow...|$|R
