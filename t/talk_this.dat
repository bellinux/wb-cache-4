500|$|Forever Now was reissued in the US and UK in 2002 by Columbia/Legacy. As {{with the}} {{simultaneous}} reissues of The Psychedelic Furs and Talk Talk <b>Talk,</b> <b>this</b> release used the original UK album cover art (though using the original US release track listing). The CD includes six songs previously unavailable on albums: [...] "Aeroplane", [...] "Alice's House", [...] "I Don't Want to Be Your Shadow", an alternative version of [...] "Yes I Do" [...] renamed [...] "Mary Go Round", and live versions of [...] "President Gas" [...] and [...] "No Easy Street". Lengthy new liner notes were added {{by the music}} journalist Tony Fletcher.|$|E

500|$|Spiegelman blurs {{the line}} between the frame and the world, such as when neurotically trying to deal with what Maus is {{becoming}} for him, he says to his wife, [...] "In real life you'd never have let me <b>talk</b> <b>this</b> long without interrupting." [...] When a prisoner whom the Nazis believe to be a Jew claims to be German, Spiegelman has difficulty deciding whether to present this character as a cat or a mouse. [...] Throughout the book, Spiegelman incorporates and highlights banal details from his father's tales, sometimes humorous or ironic, giving a lightness and humanity to the story which [...] "helps carry the weight of the unbearable historical realities".|$|E
500|$|The Blessing has {{provoked}} a more divided response. Waugh's judgement was {{that those who}} criticised the book were [...] "lazy brutes..... can't bear to see a writer grow up". More recently, Philip Hensher and others have [...] argued that although the novel is immensely enjoyable and that Mitford's [...] "marvellous voice" [...] is undiminished, she is on less sure ground with her [...] "Frenchness" [...] than with the English country house ambience, and her picture of France {{as the embodiment of}} everything civilised is less than convincing. Similar mixed comments greeted Mitford's final novel, Don't Tell Alfred, Waugh again hailing it as her best, [...] "clamouring for a sequel". In this judgement he was largely alone; other critics perceived in the anecdotal framework of the book an uncertainty as to what it was about. An American reviewer wondered what parts were to be taken seriously: [...] "What exactly goes on?... Can you always tell an Etonian, even when he goes beat? Is all modern architecture a fraud? Do U-people really <b>talk</b> <b>this</b> way?" [...] Similar questions were raised in the Times Literary Supplements review, in relation to Mitford's fictional output as a whole: [...] "Would she have been a better novelist if she had 'tried harder', gone in further, dropped the pose of amateurishness, cut the charm, looked beyond the worlds that she knew and, more importantly, loved?" ...|$|E
500|$|The English {{language}} localization of Dragon Warrior VII began directly {{after the}} game's Japanese release. Enix of America was tasked with translating over 70,000 pages of text via 20 translators and 5 copy editors. No {{effort was made}} to edit or censor the context of the Japanese script. Weeks prior to the game's US release, Enix released new information about the game's different mechanics on their website weekly to introduce players to the game. Paul Handelman, president of Enix America, commented on the game that [...] "All the <b>talk</b> <b>this</b> month about new systems with the latest technological wizardry doesn't diminish the fact {{that at the end of}} the day, compelling game play is what it's all about, and Dragon Warrior VII provides just that." [...] Dragon Warrior VII was released in the US on November 1, 2001 and was the last game in the series to have Warrior in its title instead of Quest. In 2003, Square Enix registered the Dragon Quest trademark in the US, with the intent to retire the Dragon Warrior name. Soon after the game's release, developer Heartbeat went on hiatus. Justin Lucas, product manager of Enix America, commented on the hiatus, saying that the developer merely [...] "worked their tails off on Dragon Warrior 7 and Dragon Warrior 4. They decided to take a sabbatical for a while and rest up", noting that it had nothing to do with the game's US sales.|$|E

2500|$|Lord Foulkes, when {{being interviewed}} for BBC News by Carrie Gracie to defend Michael Martin, asked Gracie {{how much money}} she earned. When she said she earned £92,000, Foulkes said: [...] "£92,000? So you're paid nearly {{twice as much as}} an MP to come on and <b>talk</b> <b>this</b> nonsense." [...] Gracie defended herself by saying that she paid for all of her phone calls and [...] "understood what public sector money is about".|$|E
2500|$|It is at {{this point}} that Wilson's own {{memories}} end, but the Scarecrow Guide informs him that all Dreamscapes are connected, and {{he will be able to}} uncover the truth of Amelia's disappearance if he continues searching. He begins by going back to the barn and discovering Amelia's necklace. It is also while he is here that he remembers a conversation he had with Amelia the day before the wedding, where she expressed concern for Frank after he called her and told her to cancel the wedding. As a result of this, she told Wilson she didn't want him at the wedding in case he did something stupid. Wilson recalls a telephone conversation he overheard Frank having one day at the airfield, and realizes that this conversation was the one Amelia was referring to. He remembers that Frank told her to meet him at their special spot so they can <b>talk.</b> <b>This</b> special spot is the lake, which is the location where Amelia and Frank had their one and only date many years prior. After he discovered that Amelia intended to follow through and marry Wilson, he drowned her in a fit of anger, telling her that [...] "If I can't have you, no one can." ...|$|E
