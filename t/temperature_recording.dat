40|$|Abstract Changes in {{the extent}} of absolute, all-time, daily <b>temperature</b> <b>records</b> across the {{contiguous}} United States were examined using observations and climate model simulations. Observations from station data and reanalysis from 1980 to 2013 show increased extent of absolute highest <b>temperature</b> <b>records</b> and decreased extent of absolute lowest <b>temperature</b> <b>records.</b> Conversely, station data from 1920 to 2013 showed decreased extent of absolute highest records with nearly half of such records occurring in the 1930 s during exceptional widespread drought. Simulated changes {{in the extent}} of absolute <b>temperature</b> <b>records</b> from climate model experiments were in general agreement with observed changes for recent decades. However, fewer lowest <b>temperature</b> <b>records</b> and highest <b>temperature</b> <b>records</b> were observed since 2000 than simulated by most models.

Several small mountain streams feed the lake, including one through pasture land at Peldo Le. The lake is fed by springs and snow melt and has a maximum depth of 40 m.

Due to its elevation, the town often records some of the coldest temperatures in Queensland during winter, dropping below freezing an average of 14.3 times per year. The annual average rainfall in Kingaroy is 779.1 mm (30.7 in), {{with the majority of}} it falling during the summer months. Frost is common from June to August, whilst sleet occurs occasionally, and light snow fell in July 1959. Winters are generally sunny with occasional periods of rain during the passage of frontal systems, whilst summers feature sunny days with frequent evening thunderstorms. Heavy rain events can occur at any time of year although are most frequent in late summer and can last from a few hours to as long as a week. On 27 January 2013, 230 mm (9.2 in) of rain fell in a single night due to the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Oswald, causing significant flooding in the town.|$|E

30|$|Model {{accuracy}} {{was highest}} on north-facing slopes. Although Dobrowski (2011) reported that aspect has little {{direct effect on}} minimum temperature, the increased solar radiation on south-facing slopes and ridgelines may interact with the dry soil conditions during summer months at Teakettle and promote stronger divergence from the regional temperature patterns characterized in large-scale climate datasets. The ridgeline regions at Teakettle make up a relatively small area compared to other sampled landscapes. Consequently, we had only one <b>temperature</b> <b>recording</b> location that captured ridgeline variability, {{making it more difficult}} to estimate near-ground surface temperatures along mountain ridges. Locally, north-facing slopes experience the smallest amount of solar radiation and the most canopy shading and, therefore, the narrowest fluctuations in temperature and lapse rates compared to the other sites. To better understand patterns of near-ground surface temperatures in mountainous regions we plan to add <b>temperature</b> <b>recording</b> stations that capture the vertical temperature profile at our other three other research sites, San Joaquin Experimental Range and Tehachapi low and high elevation landscapes. With these additional <b>temperature</b> <b>recording</b> sites, near-ground surface temperature models will support models of tree seedling recruitment in all project study areas, allowing us to better link topographically influenced micro-scale climate to macro-scale tree species range dynamics.|$|E

40|$|Aims and Objectives: To {{improve the}} prevention, detection, and {{treatment}} of perioperative inadvertent hypothermia (PIH) in adult surgical patients by implementing a Thermal Care Bundle. Background: Keeping patients normothermic perioperatively prevents adverse surgical outcomes. Hypothermia leads to serious complications including increased risk of surgical bleeding, surgical site infections, and morbid cardiac events. The Thermal Care Bundle consists of three elements: 1) assess risk; 2) record temperature; and (3) actively warm. Design: A pre-post implementation {{study was conducted to}} determine the impact of the Thermal Care Bundle on the prevention, detection {{and treatment of}} PIH. Methods: The Thermal Care Bundle was implemented using an adapted version of the Institute of Healthcare Improvement's Breakthrough Series Collaborative Model. Data were collected from auditing medical records. Results: Data from 729 patients (pre-implementation: n= 351; post-implementation: n= 378) at four sites were collected between December 2014 to January 2016. Improvements were recorded in the percentage of patients with a risk assessment; at least one documented <b>temperature</b> <b>recording</b> per perioperative stage; and appropriate active warming. Despite this, the overall incidence of PIH increased post-implementation. Conclusion: The Thermal Care Bundle facilitated improved management of PIH through increased risk assessment, <b>temperature</b> <b>recording,</b> and active warming but did not impact on PIH incidence. Increased <b>temperature</b> <b>recording</b> may have more accurately revealed the true extent of PIH in this population...|$|E
