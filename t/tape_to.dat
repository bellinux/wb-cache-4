5|$|Although the ZX Microdrive was {{initially}} greeted with good reviews, it never took {{off as a}} distribution method due to worries {{about the quality of}} the cartridges and piracy. Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and niche products like the Tasword word processing software and Trans Express, (a <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> microdrive copying utility). No games are known to be exclusively released on Microdrive.|$|E
5|$|Imaging techniques, such as x-ray, {{fluoroscopy}} and ultrasound {{are typically}} {{used to help}} guide {{the placement of the}} applicators to their correct positions and to further refine the treatment plan. CAT scans and MRI can also be used. Once the applicators are inserted, they are held in place against the skin using sutures or adhesive <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> prevent them from moving. Once the applicators are confirmed as being in the correct position, further imaging can be performed to guide detailed treatment planning.|$|E

5|$|Keith {{questions}} Veronica {{about whether}} or not she broke into the house, despite knowing her guilt. Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes the names of all the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in the newspaper that charges have been filed against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons' {{family members}} that showed up {{took some time}} to be made, but the staff enjoyed the results. All of the male Simpson family members that showed up were voiced by Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer. He had asked for the {{recording}} <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> be run for about 20 minutes, so he could do many different voice variations that would fit the different men, but still be close to Homer's voice.|$|E
5|$|The {{rejection}} by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal immigration and epidemics prompted Savage {{to record a}} demo tape with a mock radio talk show about {{the contents of the}} work. He mailed this <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host. On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for the liberal Ray Taliaferro and later as a weekend host.|$|E

5|$|Copies were {{leaked to}} the press via a Dutch news agency during the 1983 general {{election}} campaign. The U.S. State Department and British Government believed the <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> be propaganda produced by the KGB (as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and The Sunday Times). Although the tape was produced anonymously, The Observer linked the tape with the band. Previously classified government documents made public in January 2014 under the UK's 'Thirty Year Rule' reveal that the prime minister was personally aware of the tape and had discussed it with her cabinet.|$|E

The two are sent flying and crashing through the record building, Perry using the PFT <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> latch himself safely on a flag pole in the resulting free fall, while Doofenshmirtz plummets to the ground, landing on top of a mattress placed on top of a parked truck. Unfortunately, the truck belongs to a folding mattress company and Doofenshmirtz is crushed by the mattress and then crushed by his own robot immediately afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Pink Floyd used {{innovative}} {{sound effects}} and {{state of the}} art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut. Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears.|$|E
5|$|The duo of Hardcastle and Cage {{were known}} as Hard Impact before {{changing}} their name to The Suicide Blondes. They also worked in Japan under the name The Canadian Rockers. Copeland also wrestled briefly as Damon Striker against Kevin Sullivan and Meng on separate episodes of WCW Pro. In the summer of 1995, he worked a show in Ajax, Ontario, where Bret Hart's business manager, Carl De Marco, was watching. Impressed, he suggested Copeland send an audition <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> the WWF. Copeland did not hear back from WWF, but some time later, De Marco was appointed President of WWF Canada and told Copeland that he'd put in a good word.|$|E
5|$|The {{music that}} would {{ultimately}} become the Hybrid Theory album was first produced by Linkin Park in 1999 as a nine-track demo tape. The band sent this <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> various recording companies and played forty-two different showcases for recording industry representatives, including performances for Los Angeles promoter and impresario, Mike Galaxy's showcase at The Gig on Melrose. However, they were initially {{turned down by}} most of the major labels and several independent record labels. The band was signed by Warner Bros. Records in 1999, {{due in large part to}} the constant recommendations of Jeff Blue, who had joined the label after resigning from Zomba.|$|E

5|$|Noted songwriting duo Julia Houston (Debra Messing) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) get {{inspiration}} {{for a new}} Broadway show after Tom's personal assistant Ellis Tancharoen (Jaime Cepero) reveals his love for Marilyn Monroe. The two decide to cut a demo with Broadway veteran Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) which Ellis videotapes. He sends the <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> his mother who uploads it online. Julia and Tom grow angry towards this, fearing that theater critic Michael Riedel will write a harsh review of the song. They decide to fire Ellis, until they learn Riedel loved the song and approved {{of the idea of}} a Marilyn Monroe musical. They rehire Ellis and they quickly receive interest from producer Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston), who brings on director Derek Wills (Jack Davenport), who had a strained relationship with Tom. Derek demands to audition for the main role while Tom wants Ivy to play Marilyn. Meanwhile, a waitress named Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee), who came from a small town in Iowa to make her theatrical dreams a reality hears the original demo song and decides to audition. Karen makes a good impression on the producers, leading to both Karen and Ivy getting a callback. Later on, Derek calls Karen to have a meeting at his loft late at night.|$|E
5|$|The team {{becomes aware}} that a human has the {{uncontrolled}} ability to affect electrical energy, made this way by Jacob Fischer (Max Baker). Fischer is a rogue scientist wanted by Interpol, who experimented on humans by luring his victims through bogus ads. Olivia continues to encounter John Scott, who promises her that he does love her, and will prove it. Through him, Olivia realizes that someone survived the elevator impact. Now aware of Meegar's identity, they attempt to track him. However, Meegar is captured by Fischer who wishes to perform further tests on him. Walter finds Meegar's Walkman and uses its cassette <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> find a unique electromagnetic signature, then has homing pigeons guide Olivia, Peter, and Charlie to his location. Alerted by the FBI's arrival, Fischer attempts to leave with Meegar, who escapes. After Fischer is apprehended, Meegar attempts to flee, but he's also caught. They send Meegar to a hospital to be examined.|$|E
5|$|Two predatory lenders awaken {{on either}} side of a room split by a caged-in scale, wearing head {{harnesses}} with screws poised to pierce their temples. The one who sets more flesh weight upon their tray will survive. Eddie cuts fat from his torso, but Simone chops off her arm, and Eddie is killed when the timer expires. As he reviews the game's footage, Detective Lieutenant Mark Hoffman is called to the scene by FBI Agent Dan Erickson, who has found Peter Strahm's fingerprints. Also present is Lindsey Perez, whose survival was covered up by Erickson for her protection. They learn from Dr. Adam Heffner, the coroner who performed all of the autopsies for the case thus far, that the knife used to cut the jigsaw piece from Eddie's flesh was only used once before, on Seth Baxter. The agents intend to find the Baxter audio <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> prove Strahm's involvement.|$|E

5|$|With demos completed, Green Day {{relocated}} to Los Angeles to continue {{work on the}} album. The group first recorded at Ocean Way Recording, then moved to Capitol Studios to complete the album. Cool brought multiple drum kits to the studio, including over seventy-five snares. Drum tracks were recorded on two-inch <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> produce a compressed sound and were transferred to Pro Tools to be digitally mixed with the other instruments. All drum tracks were produced at Ocean Way Studio B, picked for its high ceiling and acoustic tiling, which produced better sound. The songs were recorded in order as they appear on the track listing, which was a first for the trio. Each song would be recorded in its entirety before proceeding to the next. They reversed {{the order in which}} they recorded guitars and bass (recording the guitars first), as they heard that was how the Beatles recorded songs. Armstrong admitted that at points during the recording process he expressed fear at the amount of work before him, likening it to climbing a mountain.|$|E
5|$|After toying {{around with}} her brother Alex's guitar, Winehouse bought her own when she was 14 and began writing music a year later. Soon after, she began working for a living, including, at one time, as an {{entertainment}} journalist for the World Entertainment News Network, in addition to singing with local group the Bolsha Band. In July 2000, she became the featured female vocalist with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra; her influences were to include Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington, the latter whom she was already listening to at home. Amy's best friend, soul singer Tyler James, sent her demo <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> an A person. Winehouse signed to Simon Fuller's 19 Management in 2002 and was paid £250 a week against future earnings. While being developed by the management company, she was kept as a recording industry secret although she was a regular jazz standards singer at the Cobden Club. Her future A representative at Island, Darcus Beese, heard of her by accident when the manager of The Lewinson Brothers showed him some productions of his clients, which featured Winehouse as key vocalist. When he asked who the singer was, the manager {{told him he was}} not allowed to say. Having decided that he wanted to sign her, it took several months of asking around for Beese to eventually discover who the singer was. However, Winehouse had already recorded a number of songs and signed a publishing deal with EMI by this time. Incidentally, she formed a working relationship with producer Salaam Remi through these record publishers.|$|E
5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|E
