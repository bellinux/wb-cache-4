A study is carried out of the features of the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> from esophageal cancer. It allows us to determine more and less epidemiologically affected regions and to carry out more detailed studies on the link between <b>the</b> mortality <b>rates</b> from esophageal cancer and various factors, such as the environmental situation, socio-demographic characteristics of the population, culture and nature of nutrition, the general health status of the population, the availability of resources and the level of healthcare in the region.

25|$|This {{definition}} of immortality {{has been challenged}} in the Handbook of the Biology of Aging, because the increase in rate of mortality {{as a function of}} chronological age may be negligible at extremely old ages, an idea referred to as the late-life mortality plateau. <b>The</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> may cease to increase in old age, but in most cases that rate is typically very high.

25|$|The late 1960s and the 1970s {{witnessed}} {{a reversal of}} the declining trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> in the USSR, and was especially notable among men of working age, but was also prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country. An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again. The infant mortality rate increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974. Some researchers regarded the rise as largely real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services. The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the Soviet government simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years. Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve into the real causes.|$|E

40|$|Background: Chronic {{diseases}} {{are the leading}} cause <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> in Chile and, among these, tumors are the second most frequent cause of death. The langest number of deaths occur in the Metropolitan Region. Aim: To describe <b>the</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> caused by solid tumors in the Metropolitan Region. Material and methods: Analysis of deaths that occurred in 1999 in the Metropolitan Region. Data from death certificates, gathered by the Ministry of Health, were used. Crude mortality rates and Potential Years of Life Lost (PYLL) caused by solid tumors were calculated. Results: Among men, gastric cancer accounts for <b>the</b> higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>mortality,</b> followed by lung cancer. Among women, gallbladder cancer is the most frequent cause of death, followed by breast cancer.
