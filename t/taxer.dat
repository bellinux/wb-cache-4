Ernest Dumas of the Arkansas Times, a consistent Huckabee critic, responded most of the tax cuts were small deductions and exemptions initiated by the state legislature, that the broad-based tax cut was proposed by his predecessor and Huckabee was [...] "the biggest <b>taxer</b> and spender in Arkansas history." [...] Former Arkansas State Representative Randy Minton (R) has said; [...] " [...] support for taxes split the Republican Party, and damaged our name brand." [...] The group has pointed out that Huckabee publicly opposed the repeal of a sales tax on groceries and medicine in 2002, signed a bill raising taxes on gasoline in 1999, and signed a $5.25 bed-tax on private nursing home patients in 2001.|$|E

They had sown the best that was in them of mind and body, giving all they had, courage that never faltered, as well as the ceaseless effort of over-strained muscle, and as yet their fee was but the right to hope and toil. And now, they knew, it was once more possible that the full-fleshed <b>taxer</b> of other men's labours would sweep what was theirs into his garner.|$|E

50|$|Under feudal law, {{the payment}} of quit rent (Latin Quietus Redditus, pl. Redditus Quieti) freed the tenant of a holding from the {{obligation}} to perform such other services as were obligatory under feudal tenure, or freed the occupier of the land from the burden of having others use their own distinct rights that affected the land (e.g. hunting rights which would have hindered farming). Thus it was a payment for distinct rights that were connected with the full enjoyment of the land but not parcelled up in the ownership of the land. Formally it {{was a sort of}} buy-back rather than a tax. A tax can be varied by the taxer; and if not paid there are penalties that can be varied by the <b>taxer</b> without formal limit. In contrast the only sanction for not paying a feudal quit rent was that the alternative burdens would return. This imposed a ceiling on how much could be demanded in payment of a quit rent. Where the sanctions for non-compliance are limited in this way, a quit rent is a rent in form and name, and not a tax; where they are not so limited, a quit rent is a rent only in form and name, being rather a tax. The latter is the usual case today, as the former was in earlier times.|$|E

40|$|This report argues that, when {{comparing}} 2 ̆ 7 like for like 2 ̆ 7 taxation burdens, Australia {{is among the}} top bracket of highest taxing countries in the world. Executive summary 	Australia {{has become one of}} the highest taxed countries in the world. 	With the imposition of the deficit levy Australiaʼs top rate of personal income tax has increased to up to 50. 5 per cent, making it one of the highest marginal income tax rates in the developed world. 	Claims that Australia is a low tax country are undermined by the exclusion of the likes of compulsory superannuation from official OECD statistics. 	Adding in compulsory super and health insurance mandates raises Australiaʼs tax-to-GDP ratio from 26. 5 per cent, as reported by the OECD, to 32. 2 per cent in 2011. 	Comparing Australiaʼs tax burden to the OECD average is also misleading, given the massive variations in economic size of different countries and our diversifying trading relationship towards the Asia-Pacific region. 	Adjusting the OECD-average tax-to-GDP ratio for economic size and trade reduces it to about 30 - 31 per cent of GDP, belying the claims that Australia is a low <b>taxer.</b> 	Australia’s regime of direct taxes are very highly progressive by international standards, meaning that relatively few taxpayers are paying for the bulk of this tax burden whereas others are much less exposed to the cost of funding government. 	It will especially important that Australia avoids the policy clamour for higher taxation in the future, which would only weaken our economic potential and impair future living standards...|$|E

The intuition is that <b>tax</b> evasion has externalities: <b>tax</b> evaders protect each other, because they tie down limited enforcement capacity. Thus, relatively small <b>tax</b> rate cuts, which decrease incentives to evade <b>taxes,</b> {{can lead to}} increased revenues through spillovers - creating Laffer effects.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} <b>tax</b> developments in recent years, and one that continues to attract considerable attention, is the adoption by several countries of a form of "flat <b>tax.</b> " Discussion of these quite radical reforms has been marked, however, more by assertion and rhetoric than by analysis and evidence. This paper reviews experience with the flat <b>tax,</b> seeking to redress the balance. It stresses that the flat <b>taxes</b> that have been adopted differ fundamentally, and that empirical evidence on their effects is very limited. This precludes simple generalization, but several lessons emerge: {{there is no sign of}} Laffer-type behavioral responses generating revenue increases from the <b>tax</b> cut elements of these reforms; their impact on compliance is theoretically ambiguous, but there is evidence for Russia that compliance did improve; the distributional effects of the flat <b>taxes</b> are not unambiguously regressive, and in some cases they may have increased progressivity, including through the impact on compliance; adoption of the flat <b>tax</b> has not resolved common challenges in <b>taxing</b> capital income; and it may have strengthened, not weakened, the automatic stabilizers. Looking forward, the question is not so much whether more countries will adopt a flat <b>tax</b> as whether those that have will move away from it. <b>Tax</b> systems;Tax reforms;Income taxes;flat <b>tax,</b> <b>tax</b> reform, flat <b>taxes,</b> marginal <b>tax</b> rate, <b>tax</b> payments, taxation, <b>tax</b> rates, <b>tax</b> income, <b>tax</b> system, flat <b>tax</b> reforms, marginal <b>tax</b> rates, <b>tax</b> changes, <b>tax</b> liability, <b>tax</b> evasion, <b>tax</b> countries, average <b>tax</b> rate, <b>tax</b> administration, rate of <b>tax,</b> optimal <b>tax,</b> flat <b>tax</b> reform, <b>tax</b> compliance, <b>tax</b> revenue, proportional <b>tax,</b> <b>tax</b> ? reforms, <b>tax</b> increases, corporate income <b>tax,</b> <b>tax</b> incomes, amount of <b>tax,</b> indirect <b>tax,</b> <b>tax</b> credit, <b>tax</b> structure, <b>tax</b> avoidance, <b>tax</b> authorities, <b>tax</b> reduction, <b>tax</b> cuts, <b>tax</b> revenues, taxable income, <b>taxes</b> on labor, <b>tax</b> cut, personal income <b>tax,</b> excise <b>tax,</b> corporate <b>tax</b> rate, <b>tax</b> base, indirect <b>taxes,</b> income groups, <b>tax</b> inspectors, level of taxation, flat <b>tax</b> ? reforms, <b>tax</b> ? reform, substitution effect, <b>tax</b> structures, progressive taxation, indirect taxation, total <b>tax</b> revenue, <b>tax</b> payment, personal <b>taxes,</b> <b>tax</b> arbitrage, gasoline <b>taxes,</b> <b>tax</b> collection, progressive <b>tax,</b> average rate of <b>tax,</b> income effect, vat rate, flat <b>tax</b> rate, corporation <b>tax,</b> <b>tax</b> design, <b>tax</b> administrations, <b>tax</b> instruments, higher income, marginal rate of <b>tax,</b> dividend taxation, fiscal documentation, fiscal policies, reforming <b>tax</b> systems, fiscal affairs department, flat income <b>taxes,</b> optimal <b>tax</b> problem, <b>tax</b> on dividends, <b>tax</b> liabilities, capital gains <b>tax,</b> <b>tax</b> competition, <b>tax</b> instrument, <b>tax</b> policy, <b>taxes</b> exports, <b>tax</b> distortions, <b>tax</b> treatment, fiscal affairs, federal <b>taxes,</b> lower income groups, reduction in <b>tax,</b> <b>tax</b> allowances, optimal] <b>tax,</b> vat structure, public finance, lower <b>tax</b> rates, vat compliance, <b>tax</b> burden, fiscal rules, <b>tax</b> preferences, <b>tax</b> on capital, discretionary fiscal policy, taxation of capital income, international <b>tax,</b> <b>tax</b> rate changes, regional <b>tax,</b> income <b>tax</b> rates, flat rates, fiscal policy, flat <b>tax</b> ? reform...|$|R

40|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1990 s, the Baltics, Russia, and other (BRO) {{countries}} of the former Soviet Union initiated <b>tax</b> reforms that varied widely at the later stages. Recently, some of the BRO countries, basing decisions on the proposition that lowering of the top marginal income <b>tax</b> rate would significantly benefit economic development and increase <b>tax</b> compliance, have initiated a new stage of <b>tax</b> reforms. This paper reviews country experiences and suggests that (i) overall, {{there seems to be}} little evidence of a substantial improvement in income <b>tax</b> revenues resulting simply from a reduction in the top marginal <b>tax</b> rates, and (ii) in the BRO countries, the elasticity of the behavior of economic agents, in terms of labor supply, saving, and investment, with respect to income <b>tax</b> rates is not large, and a reduction of the existing income <b>tax</b> rates is unlikely to lead to a notable expansion of economic activity. <b>Tax</b> reforms;Tax systems;Value added tax;tax administration, <b>tax</b> reform, <b>tax</b> system, taxation, <b>tax</b> revenues, <b>tax</b> policy, <b>tax</b> rates, <b>tax</b> evasion, <b>tax</b> base, personal income <b>tax,</b> <b>tax</b> structures, income <b>tax</b> rates, <b>tax</b> revenue, <b>tax</b> compliance, <b>tax</b> mix, <b>tax</b> policy reform, <b>tax</b> incentives, <b>tax</b> exemptions, <b>tax</b> authorities, income <b>taxes,</b> <b>tax</b> administrations, indirect <b>taxes,</b> direct <b>taxes,</b> income <b>tax</b> revenues, good <b>tax</b> system, <b>tax</b> reduction, <b>tax</b> structure, <b>tax</b> increases, <b>tax</b> burden, fiscal affairs department, <b>tax</b> legislation, fiscal affairs, vat rate, <b>tax</b> efficiency, <b>tax</b> reform programs, <b>tax</b> policy reforms, marginal <b>tax</b> rates, fiscal crisis, <b>tax</b> rate reductions, substitution effect, increase in <b>tax</b> revenues, <b>tax</b> reform efforts, <b>tax</b> reductions, flat <b>tax,</b> progressive <b>tax,</b> <b>tax</b> changes, <b>tax</b> liabilities, <b>tax</b> avoidance, fiscal regime, <b>tax</b> brackets with rates, <b>tax</b> rate reduction, marginal <b>tax</b> rate, effective <b>tax</b> rates, government <b>tax</b> revenue, <b>tax</b> change, severe fiscal imbalances, income effect, consumption <b>tax,</b> <b>tax</b> credit, <b>tax</b> research, fiscal policy, <b>tax</b> bases, corporate income <b>tax,</b> fiscal imbalances, amount of <b>tax,</b> higher <b>tax</b> revenues, capital <b>tax,</b> personal income <b>tax</b> revenues, excise <b>taxes,</b> sales <b>taxes,</b> presumptive <b>taxes,</b> personal income <b>taxes,</b> vat system, fiscal arrangements, trade <b>taxes,</b> central government budget, fiscal stability, <b>tax</b> enforcement, high <b>tax</b> rates, government budget, taxation policy, foreign capital, fiscal situation, effects of taxation, higher income, rate of income <b>tax,</b> taxpayer compliance, consumption <b>taxes,</b> taxpayer education, public expenditure, <b>tax</b> officials, indirect <b>tax,</b> <b>tax</b> administration reforms, capital income taxation, expenditure cuts, <b>tax</b> revenue increases, personal income <b>tax</b> rate, input <b>tax</b> credit, direct taxation, direct <b>tax,</b> optimal <b>tax,</b> fiscal sustainability, reduction in <b>tax,</b> fiscal operations, fiscal transparency, <b>taxes</b> on income, <b>tax</b> compliance costs, reforming <b>tax</b> systems, <b>tax</b> withholding, lower <b>tax</b> rates...|$|R
