5|$|Convicted serial rapist Jonathan Haynes {{forced his}} victims to destroy {{forensic}} evidence. He was only caught {{after one of}} his victims deliberately pulled out her own hair which was later discovered in his car, tying him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b> She was inspired by watching the CSI television series.|$|E
5|$|CeeCee Lyles {{was one of}} {{the flight}} attendants on board. In 2003, a statue of Lyles was {{unveiled}} in her hometown of Fort Pierce, Florida, which has since gained national recognition as one of the many monuments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b> On August 9, 2007, a portion of U.S.219 in Somerset County, near the Flight 93 National Memorial, was co-signed as the Flight 93 Memorial Highway. At the National September 11 Memorial, the names of the 40 victims of Flight 93 are inscribed on Panels S-67 and S-68 at the South Pool.|$|E
5|$|David Headley {{pleaded guilty}} to 12 counts related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> {{including}} conspiracy to commit murder in India and aiding and abetting {{in the murder of}} six Americans. On 23 January 2013, he was sentenced to 35 years in federal prison. His plea that he not be extradited to India, Pakistan or Denmark was accepted.|$|E

5|$|In March 2007, Silverstein {{appeared}} {{at a rally}} of construction workers and public officials outside an insurance industry conference. He highlighted {{what he describes as}} the failures of insurers Allianz and Royal & Sun Alliance to pay $800 million in claims related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b> Insurers state that an agreement to split payments between Silverstein and the Port Authority is a cause for concern.|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, {{families}} of American {{victims of the}} attacks filed a lawsuit in Brooklyn, New York, naming Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, chief of the I.S.I., as being complicit in the Mumbai attacks. On 22 September 2011, {{the attack on the}} American Embassy in Afghanistan, was attributed to Pakistan via cell phone records identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> in Mumbai, also linked to Pakistan.

5|$|In September 2010, in {{retaliation}} against the Bollywood film industry's hiring of Aiplex Software to launch cyberattacks against The Pirate Bay, Anonymous members, recruited through posts on 4chan boards, subsequently initiated their own attacks, dubbed Operation Payback, targeting the website of the Motion Picture Association of America and the Recording Industry Association of America. The targeted websites usually went offline {{for a short}} period of time due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> before recovering.|$|E
5|$|According to musicologist Francis Maes, Rubinstein {{could not}} be accused of any lack of artistic integrity. He fought for change and {{progress}} in musical life in Russia. Only his musical tastes were conservativeâ€”from Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven to the early Romantics up to Chopin. Liszt and Wagner were not included. Neither did he welcome many ideas then new about music, including the role of nationalism in classical music. For Rubinstein, national music existed only in folk song and folk dance. There {{was no place for}} national music in larger works, especially not in opera. Rubinstein's public reaction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> was simply not to react. His classes and concerts were well attended, so he felt no reply was actually necessary. He even forbade his students to take sides.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} was Boost Mode: a two-player, side-scrolling, arcade-style beat 'em up mode {{not included}} in the arcade version, in which a player fights enemy waves to accumulate items, health and experience. For the Xbox, this mode was adapted for online play with Xbox Live, supporting up to 16 players. Experience points from Boost Mode can be used in the new Robo-Ky II Factory mode, in which a player can customize a robot named Robo-Ky II by teaching him moves, combos, or one of 65 special attacks from other characters. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks,</b> other aspects such as jump height, offense, defense, recovery time, tension, and speed can be improved.|$|E
50|$|On 5 July 2010, Pakistani {{police arrested}} six men, {{members of the}} banned group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, {{believed}} to be linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b> <b>The</b> men were in possession of 18,000 kg of explosives, 21 grenades, six AK-47 rifles, as well as bomb-making material, and four of the men are alleged to have been logistical supporters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|R

5|$|Geoffrey is {{mentioned}} {{again in the}} campaigns of the early 1270s, when Palaiologos sent a new commander to the Morea, Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos. In 1270, Geoffrey and his neighbour, the Baron of Akova, joined the Prince's army with 150 horsemen and 200 infantry. The Latin force raided the Byzantine holdings in Laconia, but Philanthropenos avoided being drawn into a pitched battle. A period of relative peace followed due to the ongoing Second Council of Lyon, but in 1275, the mutual truce was broken by the Greeks. Prince William entrusted a force of 50 horse and 200 crossbowmen to Geoffrey, who stationed them to keep watch over the defiles of Skorta, but he died of dysentery in late 1275. After his death, Karytaina was increasingly subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> of the Byzantines, and finally fell to them in 1320.|$|E
5|$|On 11 July, NATO {{prepared}} for a large-scale mission in Srebrenica involving 60 aircraft. At 2:30 PM, {{the first wave of}} the assault, two Dutch F-16s, bombed two Serb tanks {{on the outskirts of the}} town. Two USAF F-16s were dispatched next to attack an artillery piece, but they failed to find their target. Soon thereafter, Bosnian Serb troops seized several Dutch peacekeepers as hostages and threatened to kill them if NATO did not call off its attacks. The Dutch commander reported this back to his government, and Dutch Defense Minister Joris Voorhoeve immediately telephoned the NATO operations center and ordered an end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 12 February 2009 Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik {{said that}} Pakistani {{national}} Javed Iqbal, who acquired VoIP phones in Spain for the Mumbai attackers, and Hamad Ameen Sadiq, who had facilitated money transfer for the attack, had been arrested. Two other men known as Khan and Riaz, but whose full names were not given, were also arrested. Two Pakistanis {{were arrested in}} Brescia, Italy (east of Milan), on 21 November 2009, after being accused of providing logistical support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> and transferring more than US$200 to Internet accounts using a false ID. They had Red Corner Notices issued against them by Interpol for their suspected involvement and it was issued after the last year's strikes.|$|E

5|$|Sviatoslav {{retreated to}} Dorostolon, which the Byzantine armies besieged for sixty-five days. Cut off and surrounded, Sviatoslav came {{to terms with}} John and agreed to abandon the Balkans, renounce his claims to the {{southern}} Crimea, and return west of the Dnieper River. In return, the Byzantine emperor supplied the Rus' with food and safe passage home. Sviatoslav and his men set sail and landed on Berezan Island {{at the mouth of}} the Dnieper, where they made camp for the winter. Several months later, their camp was devastated by famine, so that even a horse's head could not be bought for less than a half-grivna, reports the Kievan chronicler of the Primary Chronicle. While Sviatoslav's campaign brought no tangible results for the Rus', it weakened the Bulgarian statehood and left it vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> of Basil the Bulgar-Slayer four decades later.|$|E
5|$|The September 11 {{attacks in}} the United States caused NATO to invoke Article5 of the NATO Charter {{for the first time}} in the organization's history. The Article says that an attack on any member shall be {{considered}} to be an attack on all. The invocation was confirmed on 4October 2001 when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty. The eight official actions taken by NATO in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> included Operation Eagle Assist and Operation Active Endeavour, a naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea which is designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction, as well as enhancing the security of shipping in general which began on 4October 2001.|$|E
5|$|Years {{after the}} attacks, legal {{disputes}} over {{the costs of}} illnesses related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attacks</b> {{were still in the}} court system. On October 17, 2006, a federal judge rejected New York City's refusal to pay for health costs for rescue workers, allowing for the possibility of numerous suits against the city. Government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower Manhattan in the weeks shortly after the attacks. Christine Todd Whitman, administrator of the EPA {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, was heavily criticized by a U.S. District Judge for incorrectly saying that the area was environmentally safe. Mayor Giuliani was criticized for urging financial industry personnel to return quickly to the greater Wall Street area.|$|E
