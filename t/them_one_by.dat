25|$|Assisted by the prelates and {{a growing}} number of lesser nobles, Charles I {{launched}} a series of expeditions against the great lords. Taking advantage of the lack of unity among them, he defeated <b>them</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> one. He won his first victory in the battle of Rozgony (present-day Rozhanovce, Slovakia) in 1312. However, the most powerful lord, Matthew Csák preserved his autonomy up until his death in 1321, while the Babonić and Šubić families were only subjugated in 1323.|$|E

25|$|The Marian {{apparition}} of Our Lady of Fátima on {{a remote}} mountain top to three young Portuguese children in 1917 also seemed fanciful and the local administrator initially jailed the children and threatened that he would boil <b>them</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> one in a pot of oil. However, {{over the years the}} effect of Fátima has been undeniable. With over 25 million registered Catholic members, the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fátima (which was approved by Pope Pius XII in 1947) is the largest Marian Society in the world. And the message of Fátima has inspired the spread of other devotions. An example is Our Lady's Rosary Makers formed by Brother Sylvan Mattingly in 1949 with $25 to distribute free rosaries, based on his devotion to Fátima. Our Lady's Rosary Makers has since distributed hundreds of millions of free rosaries to Catholic missions worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The Pandavas, who {{had ruled}} their kingdom meanwhile, decide to renounce everything. Clad in skins and rags they retire to the Himalaya and climb towards heaven in their bodily form. A stray dog travels with <b>them.</b> <b>One</b> <b>by</b> one the {{brothers}} and Draupadi fall on their way. As each one stumbles, Yudhishthira gives the rest {{the reason for}} their fall (Draupadi was partial to Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva were vain and proud of their looks, and Bhima and Arjuna were proud of their strength and archery skills, respectively). Only the virtuous Yudhishthira, who had tried everything to prevent the carnage, and the dog remain. The dog reveals himself to be the god Yama (also known as Yama Dharmaraja), and then takes him to the underworld where he sees his siblings and wife. After explaining {{the nature of the}} test, Yama takes Yudhishthira back to heaven and explains that it was necessary to expose him to the underworld because (Rajyante narakam dhruvam) any ruler has to visit the underworld at least once. Yama then assures him that his siblings and wife would join him in heaven after they had been exposed to the underworld for measures of time according to their vices.|$|E
500|$|The {{premise of}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer {{is that an}} {{adolescent}} girl, Buffy Summers, is chosen by mystical forces and given superhuman powers to kill vampires, demons, and other evil creatures in the fictional town of Sunnydale. She {{is supported by a}} close circle of family and friends, nicknamed the Scooby Gang. [...] "Restless" [...] centers on the dreams of the four main characters after enduring an exhausting fight in the previous episode. The dreams are used to comment on the characters—their fears, their past and their possible future. Consistent with each dream is the presence of the First Slayer who hunts and kills <b>them</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> one until, in the final sequence, she is confronted and disempowered by Buffy.|$|E

The Pet Shop Boys music for the song's remix start in the background. Madonna and her female dancers take to one side of a giant cage and start singing the song. As the song progresses to the intermediate verses, Madonna engages in an energetic fight with her male dancers which demonstrated her bending her body and putting her leg over her head and jumping from the cage on a dancer's back.|$|E
500|$|The average {{gestation}} period is around 110days, the female {{giving birth to}} a litter of one to four cubs in a secluded den (which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area) usually away {{from the rest of}} the pride. She will often hunt by herself while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the thicket or den where the cubs are kept. The cubs themselves are born blind – their eyes do not open until roughly a week after birth. They weigh [...] at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age. The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying <b>them</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> one by the nape of the neck, to prevent scent from building up at a single den site and thus avoiding the attention of predators that may harm the cubs.|$|E
500|$|III. Gruppe {{relocated}} back to Sicily on 17 December 1941 {{for operations}} in the Siege of Malta. The island of Malta had a strategically important position in the Mediterranean Sea. With {{the opening of a}} new front in North Africa in mid-1940, British air and sea forces based on the island could attack Axis ships transporting vital supplies and reinforcements from Europe to North Africa. To counter this threat, the Luftwaffe and the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) conducted bombing raids to neutralize the RAF defenses and the ports. During the siege, Wilcke claimed four victories over RAF fighters in April–May 1942. He claimed his first victory during the siege, and 35th overall, [...] over a Spitfire fighter on 2 April 1942. His 36th aerial victory on 22 April may have been Hurricane (Z4011) [...] "B" [...] of No. 185 Squadron flown by Pilot Officer [...] "Sonny" [...] Ormrod, who was killed in the engagement.

That summer, the Ustaše had offered amnesty for all Serbs in the NDH who would convert from Eastern Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism. Many Serbs responded positively, and one group turned up at a Serbian Orthodox church in Glina where a conversion ceremony was to take place. The Serbs who had gathered, thinking they were to undergo a conversion ceremony, were greeted by six members of the Ustaše under the direct command of Vjekoslav Luburić. When all were inside, the doors to the church were sealed. The Serbs were then forced to lie on the ground as the six Ustaše struck <b>them</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> one on the head with spiked clubs.
