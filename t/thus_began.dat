5|$|Artillery, supplies, {{and troops}} were all being {{evacuated}} {{across the river}} at this time {{but it was not}} going as fast as Washington had anticipated and daybreak soon came. A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there {{did not seem to be}} any American pickets and <b>thus</b> <b>began</b> to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan. All 9,000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{territorial}} gains {{following the}} Paris Peace Conference, the Greeks still hoped {{to achieve the}} Megali Idea and annex Constantinople and larger areas of Ottoman Asia Minor; they invaded Anatolia beyond Smyrna and sought to take Ankara, {{with the aim of}} destroying the Turkish resistance led by Mustafa Kemal (later known as Atatürk). <b>Thus</b> <b>began</b> the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). Although Alexander's reign saw success after success for the Greek armies, it was eventually Atatürk's revolutionary forces that obtained victory in 1922.|$|E
5|$|For the Persians, {{the only}} {{unfinished}} business that remained {{by the end}} of 493 BC was to exact punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt.

The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius <b>thus</b> <b>began</b> to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria. The first Persian invasion of Greece <b>thus</b> <b>began</b> in the following year, 492 BC, when Mardonius was dispatched (via Ionia) to complete the pacification of the land approaches to Greece, and push on to Athens and Eretria if possible. Thrace was re-subjugated, having broken loose from Persian rule during the revolts, and Macedon compelled to become a vassal of Persia. However, progress was halted by a naval disaster. A second expedition was launched in 490 BC under Datis and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes. This amphibious force sailed across the Aegean, subjugating the Cyclades, before arriving off Euboea. Eretria was besieged, captured and destroyed, and the force then moved onto Attica. Landing at the Bay of Marathon, they were met by an Athenian army, and defeated in the famous Battle of Marathon, ending the first Persian attempt to subdue Greece.|$|E

5|$|On {{the same}} day Erica paralleled the coast of New Caledonia before making {{landfall}} on {{the southern end of}} the island at L'Île-des-Pins. However, at the same time the cyclone also entered an area with strong wind shear and <b>thus</b> <b>began</b> to weaken. After passing the island, an extratropical transition begun, weakening the cyclone as it moved towards the southeast. On 15 March, Erica completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone and later fully dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|Philip then ordered {{another attack}} on Athens; his army {{failed to take}} either Athens or Eleusis, but {{subjected}} Attica to the worst ravaging the Atticans had seen since the Persian Wars. In response, the Romans declared war on Philip and invaded his territories in Illyria. Philip was forced to abandon his Rhodian and Pergamese campaign {{in order to deal}} with the Romans and the situation in Greece. <b>Thus</b> <b>began</b> the Second Macedonian War.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1699, {{other members}} of the Royal Society (of which Newton was a member) accused Leibniz of plagiarism.

This study was cast into doubt when it was later found that Newton himself wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz. <b>Thus</b> <b>began</b> the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.|$|E

He recovered his own drop, however, and the Falcons retained possession. With the Falcons facing fourth down on their half of the field, time ran out in the quarter. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, Virginia Tech held a 73 lead.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{fears of}} an {{approaching}} Ottoman army, Skanderbeg first sent his nephew, Constantine, with 500 cavalry to Barletta. They were incorporated into Ferdinand's forces to combat his Angevin rivals. They held back their enemy for a year, but did not gain much ground until Skanderbeg arrived in September 1461. Before reaching Italy, Skanderbeg visited Ragusa (Dubrovnik) to convince its rectors to help fund his campaign. Meanwhile, his men landed in Italy and Angevin forces lifted their siege on Barletta. Upon arriving, Skanderbeg continued to pursue his ally's enemies with great success. Ferdinand's adversaries <b>thus</b> <b>began</b> to retreat from his territories and Skanderbeg went back to Albania; a troop of his men stayed until Ferdinand managed to finally defeat the pretenders to his throne at the Battle of Orsara, {{although it is not}} known if Skanderbeg's men participated.|$|E

5|$|During {{the later}} nineteenth century, Megalosaurus {{was seen as}} the typical {{carnivorous}} dinosaur. If remains were found that were not deemed sufficiently distinct to warrant a separate genus, often single teeth, these were classified under Megalosaurus, which <b>thus</b> <b>began</b> to function as a wastebasket taxon, a sort of default genus. Eventually, Megalosaurus contained more species than any other non-avian dinosaur genus, most of them of dubious validity. During the twentieth century, this practice was gradually discontinued; but scientists discovering theropods that had been mistakenly classified under a different animal group in older literature, still felt themselves forced to rename them, again choosing Megalosaurus as the default generic name.|$|E
5|$|From that point, Pegues {{rushed for}} 13 {{yards on the}} first play of the drive, giving the Hokies a first down at their 24-yard line. Two more rushes by Pegues gained seven yards, then North Carolina {{committed}} a five-yard offsides penalty, giving the Hokies a first down at the 36-yard line. Clark threw an incomplete pass, Pegues was tackled for no gain on a running play, then Tech committed a five-yard delay of game penalty. On third down, Clark was sacked for a loss, and Tech punted. The kick was partially blocked, allowing North Carolina to return {{the ball to the}} 45-yard line of Virginia Tech. The Tar Heels <b>thus</b> <b>began</b> a drive inside Virginia Tech territory with 3:33 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{expanded}} his nonviolent non-co-operation platform {{to include the}} swadeshi policy—the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that khadi (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning khadi {{in support of the}} independence movement. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours. Gandhi <b>thus</b> <b>began</b> his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively.|$|E

5|$|In 1569, the Treaty of Lublin unified Poland and Lithuania {{into the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Duchy of Livonia, tied to Lithuania in real union since the Union of Grodno in 1566, came under Polish–Lithuanian joint sovereignty. In June 1570 a three-year truce was signed with Russia. Sigimund II, the Commonwealth's first King, died in 1572 leaving the Polish throne {{with no clear}} {{successor}} {{for the first time}} since 1382 and <b>thus</b> <b>began</b> the first free election in Polish history. Some Lithuanian nobles, in an effort to retain Lithuanian autonomy, proposed a Russian candidate. Ivan, however, demanded the return of Kiev, an Orthodox coronation, and a hereditary monarchy in parallel to Russia's, with his son, Fedor, as King. The electorate rejected these demands and instead chose Henry of Valois (Henryk Walezy), brother of King Charles IX of France.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Erica was a {{powerful}} cyclone considered the worst to affect New Caledonia since Cyclone Beti. It developed from a monsoonal trough on March 4 just off Queensland in the Australian cyclone region. Once it entered the South Pacific cyclone region on March 12, Erica steadily intensified in a favourable environment, reaching peak intensity on March 13 as a Category5 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. On that day Erica paralleled the coast of New Caledonia, before making landfall on {{the southern end of}} the island at L'Île-des-Pins. At the same time the cyclone entered an area with strong wind shear and <b>thus</b> <b>began</b> to weaken. After passing the island, an extratropical transition began, weakening the cyclone as it moved southeast. On March 15, Erica completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone and fully dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Allies seem to {{have formed}} into two wings; on the right were the Athenians, Corinthians, Sicyonians and Troezenians, and on the left were the Spartans with other contingents. The right wing marched across level ground {{straight}} towards the Persian camp, whilst the left wing attempted to outflank the Persians by passing through more broken ground. The right wing <b>thus</b> <b>began</b> fighting with the Persians while the left wing was still approaching. Herodotus reports that the Persians fought well at first, but that the Athenians and the contingents with them wished to win the victory before the Spartans arrived, and thus attacked ever more zealously.|$|E
