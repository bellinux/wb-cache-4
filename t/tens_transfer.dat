When he was 12 he heard a performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony conducted by Erich Kleiber, which gave him the ambition to become a conductor. His parents could not afford to pay for years of musical education, and his rich uncles did not consider music a suitable profession; from the age of 13 Solti paid for his education by giving piano lessons.|$|R
40|$|High {{rates of}} {{understatement}} are found for many government transfer programs {{and in many}} datasets. This understatement has major implications for our understanding of economic well-being {{and the effects of}} transfer programs. We provide estimates of the extent of under-reporting for <b>ten</b> <b>transfer</b> programs in five major nationally representative surveys by comparing reported weighted totals for these programs with totals obtained from government agencies. We also examine imputation procedures and rates. We find increasing under-reporting and imputation over time and sharp differences across programs and surveys. We explore reasons for under-reporting and how under-reporting biases existing studies and suggest corrections. ...|$|R

Mechanical testing of the tendons that could be dissected free demonstrated no significant differences (p =  0.5) in load to failure between bony (27  ±  11  N) and cartilaginous (18  ±  15  N) transfer.

40|$|The {{recently}} proposed parallel-adaptive (PA) algorithm reliably {{generates the}} frequency response template {{of a given}} system to a prescribed accuracy. However, It suffers from an Inherent disadvantage in that the system parameters are always bisected along the maximum width coordinate direction, without due consideration of whether the function widths are thereby significantly reduced or not. Due to the disadvantage, the template generated may comprise of an unnecessarily large number of angle-magnitude rectangles. In this paper, an improved version of the PA algorithm, called the parallel-adaptive algorithm with back-tracking (PABT) Is proposed. In this, parameters are bisected only along favorable directions. Performances of PABT and PA algorithms are compared {{on a set of}} <b>ten</b> <b>transfer</b> function examples. PABT algorithm generates a system template comprising of lesser number of rectangles, and hence is superior to the PA algorithm...|$|R

40|$|AIM The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} is to assess whether the advantages of variable practice are due to schema formation or to enhanced information processing (contextual interference) alone. DESIGN The design involved a 2 (mode; cognitive and motor) x 5 (practice schedule; blocked, random, constant distance one, constant distance two, and constant distance three) between subjects design resulting in ten groups. One hundred participants were randomly chosen from Human Movement students at Australian Catholic University and assigned {{to each of the}} ten groups (n= 10). The cognitive mode involved the participants having to recognise the appropriate target from three geometrical shapes (triangle, square or circle), the triangle being the target in every case. The motor mode involved the participants having to tap on the target among three boxes that was merely filled in. The experiment consisted of ninety (3 blocks of 30) acquisition trials followed by <b>ten</b> <b>transfer</b> trials to a novel movement. MAIN HYPOTHESIS It was hypothesised that if facilitated transfer to a novel target occurs through schema formation, then there would be no differences between the motor groups and their corresponding cognitive groups. However, if facilitated transfer to a novel target occurs through enhanced information processing, then there would be differences between the motor groups and their corresponding cognitive groups. RESULTS Statistical analysis revealed a contextual interference effect for participants involved in the cognitive mode, in that the cognitive blocked group outperformed the cognitive random group in acquisition, but the reverse was the case in transfer.;CONCLUSION The results appear to indicate that for simple motor tasks it is the amount of variability of practice that is important for transfer to a novel task, while for tasks with a cognitive component, the schedule of practice is critica...|$|R
