5|$|The Old Members' Building, which {{contains}} a music room, 24 study-bedrooms and some lecture rooms, was built between 1969 and 1971. It was built after a fundraising appeal to Old Members {{to mark the}} college's quatercentenary, and was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1971. The Fellows' Garden is between the Old Members' Building and {{the rear of the}} rooms {{on the west side of}} the second quadrangle. In 2002, a two-year project to rebuild the property above the college-owned shops on Ship Street was completed. As part of the work, the bottom floor was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new Junior Common Room (JCR), to replace the common room in the second quadrangle, which was by <b>then</b> <b>too</b> small to cope with the increased numbers of students.|$|E

The new JCR, about twice the size of the previous one, can be partitioned into smaller rooms or kept open for large meetings; there is also a kitchen, a student committee room and a glazed conservatory extending onto the adjoining terrace. Above the JCR are three floors of new student rooms. The two rooms of the old JCR, each of which contain war memorials, have been converted into seminar and meeting rooms, and are now known as the Harold Wilson Room and the Memorial Room.|$|E
5|$|Thi {{publicly}} disassociated {{himself from}} the Struggle Movement. However, he remained in I Corps and was still regarded as a significant political influence and motivating factor for the Struggle Movement. Regardless of what he may have thought, the discontent against Kỳ was by <b>then</b> <b>too</b> much for him to control {{even if he had}} wanted to. By June, ARVN loyalists, {{with the help of the}} American forces, prevailed. Their superior numbers convinced many in the Struggle Movement to back down and realign with the government, and those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting. While the Struggle Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Kỳ at an American air base in Chu Lai to reach a settlement, seeing as the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers of subsidies and the cover story of a medical trip.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 17th century, {{the play was}} famous for its ghost and vivid dramatisation of melancholy and insanity, leading to a {{procession}} of mad courtiers and ladies in Jacobean and Caroline drama. Though it remained popular with mass audiences, late 17th-century Restoration critics saw Hamlet as primitive and disapproved of its lack of unity and decorum. This view changed drastically in the 18th century, when critics regarded Hamlet as a hero—a pure, brilliant young man thrust into unfortunate circumstances. By the mid-18th century, however, the advent of Gothic literature brought psychological and mystical readings, returning madness and the ghost to the forefront. Not until the late 18th century did critics and performers begin to view Hamlet as confusing and inconsistent. Before then, he was either mad, or not; either a hero, or not; with no in-betweens. These developments represented {{a fundamental change in}} literary criticism, which came to focus more on character and less on plot. By the 19th century, Romantic critics valued Hamlet for its internal, individual conflict reflecting the strong contemporary emphasis on internal struggles and inner character in general. <b>Then</b> <b>too,</b> critics started to focus on Hamlet's delay as a character trait, rather than a plot device. This focus on character and internal struggle continued into the 20th century, when criticism branched in several directions, discussed in context and interpretation below.|$|E
25|$|The decimal half penny coin was demonetised in 1984 as {{its value}} was by <b>then</b> <b>too</b> {{small to be}} useful. The pre-decimal sixpence, {{shilling}} and two shilling coins, which had continued to circulate alongside the decimal coinage with values of p, 5p and 10p respectively, were finally withdrawn in 1980, 1990 and 1993 respectively. However, the double florin and crown with values of 20p and 25p respectively have not been withdrawn.|$|E

25|$|Steuart's grandson, Major General George H Steuart (1790–1867) was a United States {{general who}} fought during the War of 1812. His {{military}} career began in 1814 when, {{as a young}} captain, he raised a company of Maryland volunteers, the Washington Blues, leading them at the Battle of Bladensberg and the Battle of North Point, where he was wounded. After the war he rose to become major general of the Maryland Militia. In 1861, {{at the start of}} the Civil War, Steuart left his home state of Maryland, which stayed in the Union, and joined the Confederacy, though at 71 he was by <b>then</b> <b>too</b> old for active service.|$|E
25|$|The inverse is {{also true}} when the {{aircraft}} is in inverted flight. The float becomes submerged as the fuel is pulled downward by gravity {{to the top of}} the fuel bowl. The float lifts upward toward the bottom of the inverted fuel bowl. With the float at the bottom of the fuel bowl, the fuel inlet valve opens, as it would when there is not enough fuel in the fuel bowl. With the fuel inlet valve open, the fuel pump continues pumping fuel into the fuel bowl, where the resulting excess fuel causes the fuel-air ratio to become lower than nine to one, which is <b>then</b> <b>too</b> rich for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|E

25|$|Historically, refugee {{populations have}} often been portrayed as a {{security}} threat. In the U.S and Europe, {{there has been much}} focus on the narrative that terrorists maintain networks amongst transnational, refugee, and migrant populations. This fear has been exaggerated into a modern-day Islamist terrorism Trojan Horse in which terrorists hide among refugees and penetrate host countries. 'Muslim-refugee-as-an-enemy-within' rhetoric is relatively new, but the underlying scapegoating of out-groups for domestic societal problems, fears and ethno-nationalist sentiment is not new. In the 1890s, the influx of Eastern European Jewish refugees to London coupled with the rise of anarchism in the city led to a confluence of threat-perception and fear of the refugee out-group. Populist rhetoric <b>then</b> <b>too</b> propelled debate over migration control and protecting national security.|$|E
25|$|The British hired armed cutter Sandwich {{was under}} the command of Lieutenant George Lempriere and {{cruising}} off the coast of Barcelona on 14 June 1799 when she sighted a large fleet. Lempriere believed the vessels to be a British fleet and sailed towards them. When the strange vessels did not reply to the recognition signals, Lempriere realized that they were enemy vessels and attempted to sail away. The French fleet detached a lugger, possibly Affronteur, to pursue Sandwich. A frigate joined the lugger in pursuit and towards evening the lugger opened fire with her bow chasers. The frigate <b>then</b> <b>too</b> opened fire, with Sandwich returning fire as best she could.

25|$|Following {{this initial}} mention of {{incidents}} {{related to the}} religion there were several contacts between New Zealanders and Bahá'ís {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century. New Zealander Wilhelmina Sherriff Bain may have met Sarah Jane Farmer, a notable Bahá'í in the United States, (see Green Acre) in 1904. Whoever her contact was, Bain authored a large detailed article in the Otago Witness published 30 December 1908 edition about the religion. Other articles followed in 1909, 1911, and 1913. It is also known that letters were exchanged in 1910 between a Mildred Burdon of Geraldine and `Abdu’l-Bahá. Robert Felkin had met `Abdu'l-Bahá in London in 1911 and in 1912 moved to New Zealand where he helped found the Whare Ra. Felkin wrote an article for a New Zealand publication which was published around <b>then</b> <b>too.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upon {{receiving}} the opening kickoff, CSU promptly went three-and-out, giving {{the ball back}} to WSU, who started their drive in CSU territory after a 23-yard punt. WSU entered the red zone, but ultimately settled for an Andrew Furney field goal {{to take the lead}} by 15 (38–23). CSU's ensuing drive lasted only one play – a 75-yard touchdown run by Kapri Bibbs that made the score 38–30, with Washington State retaining the eight-point advantage. Though they reached the red zone on their next drive, Cory James sacked Halliday twice, and then WSU committed a delay of game penalty, which ultimately moved them out of field goal range, so they had to punt. They had another opportunity, starting in CSU territory after Jordon Vaden fumbled the ball on a run after a catch, but punted <b>then</b> <b>too.</b> At {{the end of the third}} quarter, WSU led 38–30.|$|E

25|$|His Holiness Sree Narayana Guru, {{the spiritual}} leader of the Thiyyas is {{reported}} to have disapproved of the present methods of Satyagraha at Vaikom. He suggests that volunteers should advance along barricaded roads and scale the barricades. They should enter temples and sit with others to dine. Now the action proposed is not Satyagraha. For scaling barricades is open violence. If you may scale barricades, why not break open temple doors and even pierce temple walls? How are the volunteers pierce through a row of policemen except by using force?. If the Thiyyas are strong and willing to die in sufficient numbers, they can gain their point. All I submit is that they will have gained it by some thing the reverse of Satyagraha.

25|$|Rommel {{considered}} Point 204 a key {{position and}} so great {{a part of}} the available neighbouring armoured and infantry units were committed to attack it on 15 December and in fierce and determined fighting, the attacking force, the Ariete and the 15th Panzer Division, with the 8th Bersaglieri Regiment and the 115th Lorried Infantry Regiment, overran The Buffs and its supporting elements during the afternoon. The Buffs lost over 1,000 men killed or captured with only 71 men and a battery of field artillery escaping. Fortunately for the rest of 5th Indian Brigade it was by <b>then</b> <b>too</b> late in the day for the attacking force to collect itself and advance further to intervene at Alem Hamza.

But every attempt to emerge from the lanes and fields was repulsed by the royal cavalry, and indeed, by every available man and horse.
