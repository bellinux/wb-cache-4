5|$|In the Gotham Stakes on April 7, Laurin {{decided to}} {{experiment}} with Secretariat's running style. With no speed horses entered in the race, Secretariat {{would be allowed to}} set his own pace. Accordingly, Turcotte hustled Secretariat from <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate</b> and they led easily. Down the stretch though, Champagne Charlie came running and at the eighth pole was almost even. Turcotte tapped Secretariat once on each side with the whip and Secretariat drew away to win by three lengths. He ran the first 3/4 mile in 1:08 and finished the one-mile race in 1:33, matching the track record.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat {{was widely}} viewed as the {{favorite}} to win by most sportswriters and people; however, the added distance {{and the possibility of}} running too slow for a distance or running too fast too soon could potentially cause him to lose. Out of <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate,</b> Secretariat and Sham traded the lead. Around the three-quarters mile marker Sham began to fade and Secretariat began to extend an advantage. Twice a Prince and Our Native overtook Sham to take second and third, respectively. Sham finished last, behind Pvt. Smiles, who was in last before Sham slowed severely.|$|E
25|$|A {{starting}} gate, {{also known}} as starting stalls, is a machine used in the sports of thoroughbred horse and dog racing to ensure a fair start in a race. <b>The</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate</b> was invented by Clay Puett of Chillicothe, Texas when it was used at Lansdowne Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada {{for the first time}} on July 1, 1939. U.S. patent #2,232,675 was filed by Puett on August 7, 1939 and issued to him on February 18, 1941.|$|E

50|$|In {{thoroughbred}} horse racing, a false start {{occurs when a}} horse breaks through <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gates</b> before they open. There is usually no penalty; the horse is simply reloaded into the gate. In some events, a horse who breaks through <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gates</b> is disqualified. A notable example was the 2006 Preakness Stakes when Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro broke through the gate early; he was reloaded and <b>the</b> race was <b>started</b> properly. <b>The</b> 1993 Grand National was void because the recall flag to signal a false start was not unfurled, so that most jockeys continued to race.|$|R
25|$|Winkfield {{was born}} in Chilesburg, Kentucky and {{began his career as}} a jockey in 1898 at age sixteen. He was {{suspended}} for four years after just one race for his involvement in a four-horse accident at <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate.</b> However, he returned in 1900 to ride a horse named Thrive in the Kentucky Derby, finishing third. He rode the race again in 1901 and 1902, winning on His Eminence and Alan-a-Dale respectively - in 1901 alone, he won 220 races. He competed in his final Derby in 1903, finishing second on Early.|$|E
25|$|Hoy {{arrived in}} Athens {{in the form}} of his life. His main event was the Kilo Time Trial. He was ranked No 1 and was last man off. The sea level World Record was broken four times as he sat in the track centre waiting for his start. He had been {{involved}} in an accident in the athlete's village just a few days prior to competition where he came off his bike in front of a village bus, narrowly avoiding serious injury. As he came out of <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate,</b> his scarred arms and legs showed how close he was to not competing.|$|E
25|$|The risk {{of further}} fire-damage, coupled with Domitian's fate, may have {{prompted}} Trajan's decision {{to rebuild the}} Circus entirely in stone, and provide a new pulvinar in the stands where Rome's emperor could be seen and honoured {{as part of the}} Roman community, alongside her gods. Under Trajan, the Circus Maximus found its definitive form, which was unchanged thereafter save for some monumental additions by later emperors, an extensive, planned rebuilding of <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate</b> area under Caracalla, and repairs and renewals to existing fabric. Some repairs were unforeseen and extensive, such as those carried out in Diocletian's reign, after the collapse of a seating section killed some 13,000 people.|$|E

25|$|Carry Back, a {{dark brown}} horse, raced {{in the blue}} and silver colors of retired {{manufacturer}} Jack Price, who bred the colt at the Ocala Stud in Marion County, Florida. Price trained the colt for his wife, Katherine. In early 1958, Price took over ownership of an obscure mare named Joppy for a fee of $150 plus a $150 overdue board bill at his Ohio farm. Joppy's racing record was poor. In seven starts, she finished second twice and earned only $325. Joppy was eventually banned from racing, {{a result of her}} frequent refusals to leave <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate.</b> For a modest $400 stud fee, Price bred Joppy to a stallion named Saggy. Saggy's only real claim to fame was that in April 1948 he handed Citation the only loss of his Triple Crown winning season with a one length win in the Chesapeake Trial at Havre de Grace Racetrack.|$|E
25|$|Miller won {{his first}} ever Olympic medal on February 13, in the {{combined}} event. He was 15th after the downhill portion losing 2.44 seconds to Kjetil André Aamodt. He then put a remarkable second run of the slalom portion to finish second overall just 0.28 behind Aamodt. Later on Miller won a second silver medal, {{this time in the}} giant slalom where he lost only to Stephan Eberharter of Austria. Miller was on a verge of winning medals in all disciplines he had entered at the Olympics, while he was second after first run of the slalom race. At <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate</b> before his final run Miller had already a huge advantage of 1.79 seconds over then leading Sébastien Amiez. Instead of having a careful run to secure at least another silver medal, Miller decided to push for a gold. The tactics resulted in a fall and missed gate, which caused him to finish far behind the medal positions.|$|E
500|$|In {{the moments}} before {{his very first}} race began, Go Man Go flipped over in <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate,</b> {{unseated}} his rider, crashed through the front, and ran around the whole track. [...] He finally {{allowed himself to be}} caught and reloaded into <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate</b> and went on to win that race. He won his next five races with a total lead of ninehorse-lengths. He faced Vandy's Flash, himself a World Champion Quarter Racing Horse, twelve times. Their last meeting, on September 6, 1959 at Ruidoso Downs, was also Go Man Go's final race, and {{was the only one of}} their races won by Vandy's Flash.|$|E

50|$|The Austrian win {{was almost}} jeopardized by a ski {{malfunction}} in Manuel Fettner's second jump. His right ski unclipped during the landing, but Fettner {{managed to stay}} upright until he passed the fall line and Austria kept their lead. It {{is the first time}} someone managed this in a World Championship. The time between the end of the competition and the flower ceremony was chaotic due to a point reduction given to Norway, which initially was declared silver medalists. The reason for the point deduction was a human error done by <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>gate</b> official who moved <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>gate</b> up instead of down, as the Norwegian coach requested, on Anders Bardal's first jump.|$|R

500|$|Twice a Prince {{reared in}} <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate,</b> which delayed the start. Out of <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate,</b> Shecky Greene {{set the pace}} for the field, while race {{favorite}} Secretariat started in last place. Exiting the gate, Sham hit his mouth against the gate and subsequently bumped into Navajo before gaining proper stride. Sham briefly took the lead around the quarter-mile marker, but Shecky Greene quickly retook the lead. Beginning the first turn, Secretariat had moved ahead of only two horses; however, in the next quarter-mile Secretariat moved into sixth position. A half-mile in, Shecky Greene maintained a three length lead over Gold Bag, but his pace had slowed compared to the first quarter. Sham remained close {{to the front of}} the field within the top four for the first half of the race; he moved into second position as the field reached the half-mile post. At the three-quarters post, at the start of the homestretch, Shecky Greene began to fade and Sham overtook him to move into first going into the final furlong. Secretariat, who had passed his competitors on the outside throughout the race, overtook Sham in the final furlong and pulled ahead, finishing [...] horse lengths in front of Sham. Our Native took third and Forego, who went on to win multiple Eclipse Awards as an older horse, was fourth.|$|E

[...] Pincay stated that in future races, he planned to [...] "wait a little longer before making my move." [...] Donald Brumfield, Our Native's jockey said Twice a Prince kicked Our Native in the hoof and body while rearing in <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate.</b> This forced Brumfield to dismount and adjust the saddle, delaying the Derby's start. Despite this, Brumfield stated he did not [...] "want to make excuses, everything considered, my horse did fine." ...|$|E
500|$|Go Man Go (1953–1983) was an American Quarter Horse {{stallion}} {{and race}} horse. He was named World Champion Quarter Running Horse {{three times in}} a row, one of only two horses to achieve that distinction. Go Man Go was considered to be of difficult temperament. While waiting in <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate</b> for his very first race, he threw his jockey, broke down the gate, and ran alone around the track; he was eventually caught and {{went on to win the}} race. During his five years of competition until his retirement from racing in 1960 he had 27wins, earning more than $86,000 (approximately $ as of [...] ).|$|E

500|$|Out of <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate,</b> Secretariat and Sham raced evenly {{through the}} first turn. Through a half-mile, the two were even. Entering the backstretch and {{approaching}} three-quarters of a mile, Secretariat began to distance himself as Sham began to fade, ultimately finishing last. Secretariat continued to extend his advantage {{for the rest of}} the race, finishing 31 lengths over the second-place finisher, Twice a Prince. Twice a Prince started slowly and moved along the rail until reaching second position, passing Sham and outpacing My Gallant. Track announcer Chic Anderson described Secretariat's move from the backstretch with the famous call, [...] "Secretariat is widening now. He is moving like a tremendous machine!" ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012 Napravnik {{became the}} first woman jockey to win the Kentucky Oaks, riding Believe You Can. The race was also her first Grade I win. She then rode in the Belmont Stakes for the first time, {{finishing}} fifth aboard Five Sixteen. Later that year, she won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile aboard Shanghai Bobby, becoming only the second woman jockey to win a Breeder's Cup race. [...] Her injury for 2012 was relatively minor: a non-displaced fracture of her toe, obtained when her horse hit the side of <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate</b> at Saratoga. [...] She finished the race and returned to ride the next day. She ended the year ranked 8th in national earnings, winning $12,451,713, which surpassed the earnings and national placing record for a female jockey previously held by Julie Krone. As a result, sports analysts viewed her as the most successful woman jockey since Krone.|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah won the Belmont Stakes on June 6, {{becoming}} the 12th Triple Crown winner {{and the first}} since 1978, ending a [...] "drought" [...] of 37 years. [...] The horse was leaning back in <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate</b> when it opened and was a touch late at the start, but he soon pulled out to an early lead, which he maintained for a gate-to-wire win. He steadily increased his lead throughout the race. He was challenged by Materiality until {{the top of the}} stretch when Materiality faded, ultimately finishing last, and Frosted held second although starting to fade at the sixteenth pole. Keen Ice ran {{in the middle of the}} pack until a late rally brought him into third over Mubtaahij, who was fourth.

Going into the course's first turn, Secretariat passed two horses {{on the outside and}} passed the remainder as the horses entered the backstretch. Sham was the only horse that was able to stay with Secretariat's acceleration. Secretariat held the lead {{for the remainder of the}} race and crossed the finish line in first position, [...] lengths ahead of Sham. Our Native placed third, eight lengths behind Sham.

500|$|Paynter next went east {{to run in}} the Grade I Woodward Stakes at Saratoga on August 31. [...] Five of {{the horses}} in the initial seven-horse field, {{including}} Paynter, were previous Grade I stakes winners. [...] Paynter drew post position 5 and was the second favorite at 3-1 odds on the morning line. However, following the scratch of a speed horse, the oddsmaker revised his figures to make front-running Paynter the 2-1 favorite. On race day, over a sloppy track, another horse, Mucho Macho Man, scratched and only five horses went to the post. Paynter had a bad start, hitting the left side of <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate.</b> [...] Although he ran second for part of the race, he finished last in the field. Justin Zayat said after the race, [...] " [...] never got a hold of the track. We’ll be back another day."

All I had to do was just sit there and let him roll." [...] His time of 20.46seconds to cover [...] was remarkable considering that three days of rain {{before the start of the}} race had turned the track into a muddy quagmire. At another stakes, the Ribbon Futurity at Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Easy Jet won by three-quarters of a length and set a new track record of 16.92seconds for [...] The only time in 1969 he did not finish first, second, or third, he had issues in <b>the</b> <b>starting</b> <b>gate,</b> false-started, broke some teeth loose against the front of the gate, and was struggling to stand up again when the gates opened; he still managed to finish fifth out of ten horses.|$|E
