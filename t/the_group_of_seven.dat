5|$|According to Jagdish Narain Tiwari and Dilip Chakravati, the Matrikas were {{existent}} {{as early}} as the Vedic period and the Indus Valley civilization. Seals with rows of seven feminine deities or priestesses are cited as evidence for the theory. The Rigveda (IX 102.4) speaks of a group of seven Mothers who control the preparation of Soma, but the earliest clear description appears in select chapters of the epic Mahabharata dated to 1st century AD. Wangu believes that Matrika description in Mahabharata is rooted in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>seven</b> females depicted on Indus valley seals. It was assumed that the people locally worshipped these goddesses, such an example is also described in Zimmer Heinrich book The Art Of Indian Asia, about the seven shrines of seven Mother Goddesses worshipped locally.|$|E

5|$|Canadian {{visual art}} has been {{dominated}} by figures such as Tom Thomson – the country's most famous painter – and by <b>the</b> <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Seven.</b> Thomson's career painting Canadian landscapes spanned a decade up to his death in 1917 at age 39. The Group were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists—Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley—were responsible for articulating the Group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston, and by commercial artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson became part of the Group in 1926. Associated with the Group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Since the 1950s, works of Inuit art have been given as gifts to foreign dignitaries by the Canadian government.|$|E
5|$|Hart House Theatre is the university's student amateur theatre, {{generally}} producing {{four major}} plays every season. As old as Hart House itself, the theatre {{is considered a}} pioneer in Canadian theatre for introducing the Little Theatre Movement from Europe. It has cultivated numerous performing-arts talents, including Donald Sutherland, Lorne Michaels, Wayne and Shuster and William Hutt. Three members of <b>the</b> <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Seven</b> painters (Harris, Lismer and MacDonald) have been set designers at the theatre, and composer Healey Willan was director of music for fourteen productions. The theatre also hosts annual variety shows run by several student theatrical companies at the colleges and academic faculties, {{the most prominent of}} which are U.C.

5|$|Nhu summoned 7 of the 10 generals to Gia Long Palace on August 20 for consultations. They {{presented}} their request for martial law and discussed how to disband {{the groups of}} monks and their supporters from the temples in Saigon. Nhu sent the generals to see Diem. The president listened to <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>seven,</b> led by General Trần Văn Đôn. The group also included Army Chief General Trần Thiện Khiêm and General Nguyễn Khánh, commander of the II Corps in the Central Highlands. Khiêm and Khánh {{were two of the}} officers who were responsible for helping to put down the attempted coup against Diệm in 1960. Also present was Đôn's brother-in-law, General Đỗ Cao Trí, commander of I Corps, which oversaw the northernmost region around Huế, and General Lê Văn Kim, head of the military academy. Trí and Kim were favorites of the Diệm regime. General Tôn Thất Đính, a brash paratrooper, who was also South Vietnam's youngest-ever general, commanded the III Corps surrounding Saigon. General Huỳnh Văn Cao was the commander of the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta and {{the only one of the}} septet who would prove not to have been involved in the later plotting against Diệm. Đính and Cao controlled the two corps regions closest to Saigon and therefore the two areas most crucial in the success or failure of a coup. Cao had used the Seventh Division of his IV Corps to storm the capital in 1960 to save Diệm.|$|E

40|$|Fourteen {{immunosuppressed}} {{patients with}} Pneumocystis carinii infection presented in two clusters that {{were separated by}} 2 years.

Despite identical treatment three patients died and a further two who survived lost their grafts from rejection. Our data suggest that cyclosporin A adversely affects the prognosis from Pneumocystis carinii infection and {{raises the question of}} prophylactic co-trimoxazole in these patients. The clustering of Pneumocystis carinii infection suggests the possibility of nosocomial transmission although in this study we were unable to implicate person-to-person spread of infection...|$|R

25|$|While some {{nations are}} widely {{considered}} to be great powers, there is no definitive list of them. Sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the Congress of Vienna or the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States serve as the body's five permanent members). Accordingly, the status of great powers has also been formally and informally recognized in forums such as <b>the</b> <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Seven</b> (G7).|$|E

25|$|The {{works of}} most early Canadian {{painters}} followed European trends. During the mid-19th century, Cornelius Krieghoff, a Dutch-born artist in Quebec, painted {{scenes of the}} life of the habitants (French-Canadian farmers). At about the same time, the Canadian artist Paul Kane painted pictures of indigenous life in western Canada. A group of landscape painters called <b>the</b> <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Seven</b> developed the first distinctly Canadian style of painting. All these artists painted large, brilliantly colored scenes of the Canadian wilderness.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Seven</b> (G7) was an {{unofficial}} forum which brought together {{the heads of}} the richest industrialized countries: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada starting in 1976. The G8, meeting {{for the first time in}} 1997, was formed with the addition of Russia. In addition, the President of the European Commission has been formally included in summits since 1981. The summits were not meant to be linked formally with wider international institutions; and in fact, a mild rebellion against the stiff formality of other international meetings was a part of the genesis of cooperation between France's President Giscard d'Estaing and West Germany's Chancellor Helmut Schmidt as they conceived the initial summit of the Group of Six (G6) in 1975.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, John Weinzweig {{met with}} fellow composers Harry Somers and Samuel Dolin {{to discuss the}} issue of {{composing}} professionally in Canada. They wished to raise awareness and acceptance of Canadian music, to be listened to and taken seriously, and contacted around a dozen other Canadian composers who shared their desires. Within a year they had acquired a federal charter as the Canadian League of Composers (CLC), of which Weinzweig was the first president. Though the original members were all from close within Weinzweig’s circle, the idea of the CLC was to bring composers together to work for a common cause, not to achieve a uniform national style. This mindset was much like that of <b>the</b> <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Seven</b> 30 years earlier in Canadian art.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the Hudson River School, {{prominent}} in the middle to late 19th century, is probably the best-known native development in landscape art. These painters created works of mammoth scale that attempted to capture the epic scope of the landscapes that inspired them. The work of Thomas Cole, the school's generally acknowledged founder, has {{much in common with}} the philosophical ideals of European landscape paintings — a kind of secular faith in the spiritual benefits to be gained from the contemplation of natural beauty. Some of the later Hudson River School artists, such as Albert Bierstadt, created less comforting works that placed a greater emphasis (with a great deal of Romantic exaggeration) on the raw, even terrifying power of nature. The best examples of Canadian landscape art {{can be found in the}} works of <b>the</b> <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Seven,</b> {{prominent in}} the 1920s.|$|E
