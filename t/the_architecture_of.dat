5|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that <b>the</b> <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> government columbaria reflects the outlook of the Singaporean nation. The early columbaria were simple, with few aesthetic ornaments, just like early Singaporean housing flats. The later columbaria have more modern designs, with well-designed landscaped environments, and looking similar to contemporary HDB (Housing and Development Board) flats. These columbaria include the Chua Chu Kang Columbarium and the Mandai Columbarium, which was renovated and expanded in 2004 to accommodate approximately another 60,000 niches. The designs are more elaborate, and are often reminiscent of other structures people often encounter in everyday life. Comparisons have been drawn between <b>the</b> <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> these columbaria and that of schools and condominiums, and hypotheses have been made that such are deliberate efforts to eliminate the sense of fear and dread traditionally associated with landscapes of death.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> the Song dynasty (960–1279) {{was noted}} for its towering Buddhist pagodas, {{enormous}} stone and wooden bridges, lavish tombs, and extravagant palaces. Although literary works on architecture existed beforehand, architectural writing blossomed during the Song dynasty, maturing into a more professional form that described dimensions and working materials in a concise, organized manner. In addition to the examples still standing, depictions in Song artwork, architectural drawings, and illustrations in published books all aid modern historians in understanding <b>the</b> <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> the period.|$|E

Rainer Stadelmann, Miroslav Verner and Jean-Philippe Lauer compare <b>the</b> <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> the layer pyramid with that of the step pyramids of Djoser and Sekhemkhet, expecting the layer pyramid to have originally consisted of five steps, just as its near-contemporary predecessors. The layer pyramid exhibits at one site both complex developments concerning its substructures and simplifications concerning the building methods employed for the superstructure. According to these egyptologists, the layer pyramid is a clearly advanced version of the buried pyramid of Sekhemkhet.|$|E

Smoke Imix ruled Copán for 67years and died on 15June 695 at the age of 79, an age that was so distinguished that it is used to identify him in place of his name on AltarQ. His tomb had already been prepared in the Chorcha phase of Temple26 and he was buried just two days after his death.|$|E
5|$|Art historians {{disagree}} on when and why onion domes became a typical feature of Russian architecture. Byzantine churches and <b>the</b> <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> Kievan Rus {{were characterized by}} broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum.

5|$|Dominating the {{appearance}} of the house from the street is a large verandah-style porch, supported by large stone columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, is located on the rear portion of the house's east side. Projecting {{from the front of the}} house, above the porch, is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, and elaborate cornice. The house is built in a combination of styles; it includes many Italianate details, but its design appears to have been influenced by <b>the</b> <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> the Sears Modern Homes.|$|E

The city has 31 National Treasures, and Gyeongju National Museum houses 16,333 artifacts. There are four broad categories of relics and historical sites: tumuli and their artifacts; Buddhist sites and objects; fortresses and palace sites; and ancient architecture. Prehistoric remains including Mumun pottery have been excavated in central Gyeongju, in the Moa-ri and Oya-ri villages of the Cheonbuk-myeon district, and in the Jukdong-ri village of the Oedong-eup district.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{recovered}} from inflorescences include the banksia boring moth (Arotrophora canthelias), younger instars of which eat flower and bract parts before tunneling into the rachis {{as they get}} older and boring into follicles and eating seeds.

Other seed predators include unidentified species of moth of the genus Cryptophasa, as well as Scieropepla rimata, Chalarotona intabescens and Chalarotona melipnoa, Brachmia trinervis, Carposina hyperlopha and an unidentified weevil species.|$|E

5|$|Istanbul is {{primarily}} {{known for its}} Byzantine and Ottoman architecture, but its buildings reflect the various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city. Examples of Genoese and Roman architecture remain visible in Istanbul alongside their Ottoman counterparts. Nothing of <b>the</b> <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> the classical Greek period has survived, but Roman architecture {{has proved to be}} more durable. The obelisk erected by Theodosius in the Hippodrome of Constantinople is still visible in Sultanahmet Square, and a section of the Valens Aqueduct, constructed in the late 4th century, stands relatively intact at {{the western edge of the}} Fatih district. The Column of Constantine, erected in 330 CE to mark the new Roman capital, stands not far from the Hippodrome.|$|E
5|$|Manchester's {{buildings}} {{display a}} variety of architectural styles, ranging from Victorian to contemporary architecture. The widespread use of red brick characterises the city, much of <b>the</b> <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> which harks back to its days as a global centre for the cotton trade. Just outside the immediate city centre is {{a large number of}} former cotton mills, some of which have been left virtually untouched since their closure while many have been redeveloped into apartment buildings and office space. Manchester Town Hall, in Albert Square, was built in the Gothic revival style and is considered {{to be one of the}} most important Victorian buildings in England.|$|E
5|$|Many organs, {{particularly}} those {{built in the}} early 20th century, are contained {{in one or more}} rooms called organ chambers.

For this reason, some modern builders, {{particularly those}} building instruments specializing in polyphony rather than Romantic compositions, avoid this unless <b>the</b> <b>architecture</b> <b>of</b> the room makes it necessary.|$|E
