People try to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> should do, how you should act, what you should wear, who you should be with. At the time things started happening for me, it was popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer. But that role didn't speak to me, because it's so boring and superficial".|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Tony Benn reiterated his {{previous}} opposition to European integration. Speaking to the Oxford Union on the alleged overshadowing of the EU debate by [...] "UKIP and Tory backbenchers", he said:I took {{the view that}} having fought [...] that we should now work with them, and co-operate, {{and that was my}} first thought about it. Then how I saw how the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, they will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ... I think they're building an empire there, they want us {{to be a part of}} their empire and I don't want that.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2015 his {{autobiography}} entitled Over the Top and Back: The Autobiography {{was published by}} Michael Joseph. Reviewing the book in the Daily Express, Clair Woodward said, [...] "In the tradition of so many autobiographies these days, Tom Jones's doesn't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> really want to hear. ... What you are left with is a riotously enjoyable story of Jones 'The Voice' which nicely doubles as the story of British pop and light entertainment from the Sixties onwards." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{highlight}} in {{the debate}} happened when candidates were asked by Chris Matthews {{if they need to}} go to Congress to get authorization to take military action against Iran's nuclear facilities, if they were president of the United States. While Hunter, Huckabee, McCain, Thompson and Giuliani replied they would not obtain Congressional authorization if there was an imminent threat from Iran. Romney replied, [...] "You sit down with your attorneys and (they) <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have to do..." [...] Paul advocated obtaining Congressional authorization, which he claimed is mandated by the US Constitution.|$|E
2500|$|Ólafur's {{musical and}} sound {{contributions}} to Broadchurch series {{two have been}} highly praised. Show creator Chris Chibnall called Ólafur's soundtrack [...] "a narrative all its own". Susanna Lazarus at Radio Times described the soundtrack as full of [...] "ethereal vocals and haunting music". Alison Graham of Radio Times also had high praise for the soundtrack, saying, [...] "The terrific music is important in building Broadchurch chilly atmosphere and dark mood. Like the best music, it's unobtrusive and doesn't <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> should be feeling." [...] Catherine Bolado in the Dorset Echo called it [...] "Haunting, achingly beautiful, angry, harrowing, and joyous — the Broadchurch soundtrack is as emotionally charged as the show it is taken from." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{early media}} reports {{attributed}} the shootings to {{a desire for}} revenge {{on the part of}} Harris and Klebold for bullying that they received, subsequent psychological analysis indicated Harris and Klebold harbored serious psychological problems. According to Dave Cullen, Harris, who conceived the attacks, was a [...] "cold-blooded, predatory psychopath" [...] and an intelligent, charming liar with [...] "a preposterously grand superiority complex, a revulsion for authority and an excruciating need for control". In Cullen's assessment, Harris lacked remorse or empathy for others, and sought to punish them for their perceived inferiority. According to Principal Frank DeAngelis, Harris was [...] "the type of kid who, when he was in front of adults, he'd <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> wanted to hear." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{supposed}} [...] "story" [...] behind Iron Chef is recounted at {{the beginning}} of every episode. A title card, with a quote from famed French food author Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin first appears: [...] "Tell me what you eat, and I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are." [...] Then, it is said that Kaga [...] "realized his dream in a form never seen before" [...] and specially constructed a cooking arena called [...] "Kitchen Stadium" [...] in his castle. There, visiting chefs from [...] "around the world" [...] would compete against his Gourmet Academy, led by his three (later four) Iron Chefs. Chairman Kaga himself is a showpiece, dressed in outlandish examples of men's formal attire. The English name Iron Chef comes from the show itself: Kaga would use this translation of the Japanese title when summoning his chefs {{at the beginning}} of the battle.|$|E
2500|$|Second, Searle {{believes}} we can rationally {{do things}} that don't result from our own desires. It is widely believed that one cannot derive an [...] "ought" [...] from an [...] "is", i.e. that facts about how the world is can never <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> should do ('Hume's Law'). By contrast, {{in so far as}} a fact is understood as relating to an institution (marriage, promises, commitments, etc.), which is to be understood as a system of constitutive rules, then what one should do can be understood as following from the institutional fact of what one has done; institutional fact, then, can be understood as opposed to the [...] "brute facts" [...] related to Hume's Law. For example, Searle believes the fact that you promised to do something means you should do it, because by making the promise you are participating in the constitutive rules that arrange the system of promise making itself, and therefore understand a [...] "shouldness" [...] as implicit in the mere factual action of promising. Furthermore, he believes that this provides a desire-independent reason for an action—if you order a drink at a bar, you should pay for it even if you have no desire to. This argument, which he first made in his paper, [...] "How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is'" [...] (1964), remains highly controversial, but even three decades later Searle continued to defend his view that [...] "..the traditional metaphysical distinction between fact and value cannot be captured by the linguistic distinction between 'evaluative' and 'descriptive' because all such speech act notions are already normative." ...|$|E
