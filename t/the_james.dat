5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{generally}} features higher precipitation {{and lower}} topography than {{the western part}} of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the Coteau des Prairies, the Dissected Till Plains, and <b>the</b> <b>James</b> River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a plateau bordered on the east by the Minnesota River Valley and on the west by <b>the</b> <b>James</b> River Basin. Further west, <b>the</b> <b>James</b> River Basin is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following the flow of <b>the</b> <b>James</b> River through South Dakota from north to south. The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and fertile soil that covers much of Iowa and Nebraska, extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota. Layers deposited during the Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota. These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, the product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as till, over the area.|$|E
