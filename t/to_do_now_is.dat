500|$|In later life, Shostakovich {{suffered}} from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he {{suffered from}} a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 {{he wrote in a}} letter: [...] "Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order." ...|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{called the}} episode [...] "a decent" [...] and [...] "moderately sharp" [...] season premiere. He {{concluded}} that, [...] "While the episode still wasn't {{on par with}} those of the show's earliest seasons, ... The episode wasn't lazy—and for The Office, that's a win." [...] Other reviews were slightly more mixed. TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode a three out of five, but was appreciative of the additions to the cast, as well as many of the actors story lines. Jeffrey Hyatt of Screencrave noted that the episode was similar in tone to the season eight finale, [...] "Free Family Portrait Studio", but that [...] "the addition of Lacy and Duke pay quick dividends as the opener provides flashes of comedy moxie, while helping wash away painful memories of last season." [...] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News awarded the episode three stars out of five and wrote that [...] "The deadpan goofiness remains fresh enough to keep fans interested" [...] and that [...] "the fact that this whole drama doesn't feel new and shiny anymore isn't anyone's fault. ... All The Office needs <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> march out proudly random, zany and off-center." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall, however, was critical of the episode's humor, noting that it [...] "didn't give me a lot of hope for a last-minute resurgence". Matt Roush of TV Guide wrote that the [...] "one interesting storyline" [...] may make him watch the remainder of Pam and Jim's story, but not [...] "the rest of this sadly played-out workplace comedy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2011, Murphy {{discussed}} a possible fourth film, stating, [...] "They're not doing it. What I'm trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> produce a TV show starring Axel Foley's son, and Axel {{is the chief}} of police now in Detroit. I'd do the pilot, show up here and there. None of the movie scripts were right; it was trying to force the premise. If you have to force something, you shouldn't be doing it. It was always a rehash of the old thing. It was always wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roh's {{characteristically}} self-righteous stance {{resulted in}} harsh {{condemnation of the}} ex-President for hypocrisy. In response to the pervasive criticism upon Roh's bribery charges, he stated on his website, [...] "I have lost my moral cause just with the facts I have so far admitted. The only thing left is the legal procedure". Roh further added, [...] "What I have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> bow to the nation and apologize. From now on, the name Roh cannot be {{a symbol of the}} values you pursue. I'm no longer qualified to speak about democracy and justice.... You should abandon me." [...] Despite these appeals, Roh continued to deny all knowledge of the receipt of money by his family from Park Yeon-Cha, in contradiction to Park's testimony. Roh refused cross-examination with Park.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2014, {{she took}} a public stand against cyberbullying, calling herself [...] "patient zero" [...] of online harassment. Speaking at a Forbes {{magazine}} [...] "30 Under 30" [...] summit about her experiences {{in the aftermath of}} the scandal, she said, [...] "Having survived myself, what I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> help other victims of the shame game survive, too." [...] She said she was influenced by reading about the suicide of Tyler Clementi, a Rutgers University freshman, involving cyberbullying and joined Twitter to facilitate her efforts. In March 2015, Lewinsky continued to speak out publicly against cyberbullying, delivering a TED talk calling for a more compassionate Internet. In June 2015, she became an ambassador and strategic advisor for anti-bullying organization Bystander Revolution. The same month, she gave an anti-cyberbullying speech at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. In September 2015, Lewinsky was interviewed by Amy Robach on Good Morning America, about Bystander Revolution's Month of Action campaign for National Bullying Prevention Month. [...] Lewinsky wrote the foreword to an October 2017 book by Sue Scheff and Melissa Schorr, Shame Nation: The Global Epidemic of Online Hate.|$|E

30|$|By {{no means}} do we imply any {{criticism}} {{of the work that}} was done by generations of ISC Seismologists since 1964. The original ISC Bulletin remains a wealth of knowledge and information collected and created based on the widest possible international collaboration of seismic monitoring experts around the world. Much of the work that is possible for us <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> impossible <b>to</b> accomplish even 10 – 15  years ago, before the introduction of powerful computers, sophisticated database software and modern ways of exhibiting the bulletin information graphically and interactively from every possible angle.|$|R
2500|$|In a 2013 {{interview}} with Martha Raddatz of ABC News, Greenwald said {{that members of}} Congress are being [...] "blocked" [...] from getting [...] "the most basic information about what NSA is doing... and what the FISA court has been doing....", and specifically referenced Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), a ranking member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ("House Intelligence Committee"). Ruppersberger, who was a guest on the show, responded, [...] "We have rules {{as far as the}} committee and what you can have and what you cannot have. However, based on that, that statement I just made, is that since this incident occurred with Snowden, we've had three different hearings for members of our Democratic Caucus, and the Republican Caucus.... And we will continue to do that because what we're trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> to get the American public to know more about what's going on." [...] Rep. King, who was also a guest on This Week as a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated: [...] "o me it's unprecedented to have all of these top people from an administration during this time of crisis still come in and answer question after question after question. So anyone who says that Congress is somehow being stonewalled is just wrong and [...] is generally, I think, raised by {{people who are trying to}} make a name for themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album Music from Big Pink, in particular, is {{credited}} with contributing to Clapton's decision to leave the supergroup Cream. In his introduction of The Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 {{he had heard the}} album, [...] "and it changed my life." [...] Nazareth took their name from [...] "The Weight" [...] - taken from the line [...] "I pulled into Nazareth, feeling half past dead" [...] Guitarist Richard Thompson has acknowledged the album's influence on Fairport Convention's Liege and Lief, and journalist John Harris has suggested that The Band's debut also influenced the spirit of The Beatles' back-to-basics album Let It Be as well as the Rolling Stones' string of roots-infused albums that began with Beggars Banquet. George Harrison said that his song [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] was heavily influenced by the Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it. Meanwhile, the Big Pink song [...] "The Weight" [...] has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group's influence, [...] "We certainly didn't want everybody {{to go out and get}} a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we're going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> go to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and record four sides, four psychedelic songs. Total freak-me songs. Just to show that we have no hard feelings. Just pretty good rock and roll." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cycle of}} the feminization of poverty in the Dominican Republic {{is a direct result}} of {{cultural}} biases and systematic oppression. Dominican women make generally forty-four cents on the dollar as compared to men. This wage gap often leads to a high level of food insecurity among women in the Dominican Republic. Food insecurity often leads to an increased rate of dangerous behaviors such as unprotected sex and drug use. These behaviors put women at a greater risk for contracting HIV. There is a grand stigma around HIV positive women in the Dominican Republic. For this reason, women are more likely to be subjected to health screenings when applying for a job. If the screening reveals that a women is HIV positive, then they are almost guaranteed to be denied any position. Unemployment furthers the issue of food insecurity and because the HIV stigma is so prevalent in that culture, women are often ostracized from their families and forced to fend for themselves with no job prospects or support. One woman's doctor told her upon announcing her diagnosis, [...] "What you have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> die," [...] because he realized the severity of the cultural implication of the news. HIV positive women are also more likely to suffer domestic abuse. Children of HIV positive women are also affected. One women shared the story of her sister refusing to adopt her child when she was unable to provide for him after her diagnosis because the sister was afraid the child was tainted by virtue of his mother having the disease. The cycle runs deep of women suffering from HIV and therefore poverty within the country and the stigma disenfranchises citizens from wanting to address the problem.|$|E

The one wise thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{pave the way for}} the exertion of Sir Patrick's superior influence, and Sir Patrick's superior skill.
