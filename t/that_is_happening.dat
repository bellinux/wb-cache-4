5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of everything <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often less concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, and more with arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E

He has advised Pakistani authorities to shoot down NATO aircraft should a similar event take place in the future, and to keep the supply lines closed, on the argument that the U.S. cannot afford a war with Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|Solar output also varies on shorter time scales, {{including}} the 11-year solar cycle and longer-term modulations. Solar intensity variations possibly {{as a result}} of the Wolf, Spörer and Maunder Minimum are considered to have been influential in triggering the Little Ice Age, and some of the warming observed from 1900 to 1950. The cyclical nature of the Sun's energy output is not yet fully understood; it differs from the very slow change <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> within the Sun as it ages and evolves. Research indicates that solar variability has had effects {{including the}} Maunder minimum from 1645 to 1715 A.D., part of the Little Ice Age from 1550 to 1850 A.D. that was marked by relative cooling and greater glacier extent than the centuries before and afterward. Some studies point toward solar radiation increases from cyclical sunspot activity affecting global warming, and climate may be influenced by the sum of all effects (solar variation, anthropogenic radiative forcings, etc.).|$|E
25|$|The {{second point}} of {{contention}} between freewill and open theists is exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events. Freewill theists have traditionally affirmed {{what is known as}} simple foreknowledge according to which God, prior to creation, just “sees” or knows all that will ever happen in history. Sanders argues that the simple foreknowledge view has conflicts with types of biblical texts mentioned below and has two philosophical problems. The first problem is the old debate about whether or not divine foreknowledge entails determinism. Open theists argue that exhaustive definite foreknowledge is incompatible with the freewill of creatures. The other problem with simple foreknowledge is that it is useless for God to possess it since once God knows {{what is going to happen}} God cannot change it from happening. Sanders argues that simple foreknowledge cannot explain such things as prophecy, divine guidance, or why God did not prevent particular evils. Instead, open theists affirm “dynamic omniscience” (a term coined by Sanders). God knows all that has happened in the past and all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> in the present. God knows those future events that are determined to occur and God knows all that could possibly happen but does not know as definite what creatures with freewill will do. God has anticipatory knowledge (foresight) of what we are likely to do so God is not caught off-guard.|$|E

However, he noted that during visual effects reviews for the film {{it became apparent that}} these sequences were adversely affecting the story when viewed in 2D, which necessitated adjustments so the sequences would work in all formats.

[...] Sava applauded the fact that the episode delves into [...] "the demented relationship that develops between Ice King and his new wife", noting that while [...] "the writers could have easily depicted Ice King in a more unsympathetic light, ... the tragedy of the episode is that Ice King genuinely cares about his new wife." [...] He was also complimentary towards the song, describing it as a [...] "suitably bizarre Adventure Time version of 'A Whole New World'".|$|E

You listen to it and you can see everything <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening.</b> It's so dramatic.
