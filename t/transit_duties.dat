2500|$|Seven {{years had}} {{scarcely}} elapsed, when another serious dearth {{took place in}} the northern districts of the Presidency, and the pressure was apparently felt for about two years, viz., from November 1790 to November 1792. [...] In April 1791, it was stated, that 1,200 persons had died of starvation in the neighbourhood of Vizagapatam, and early in 1792, the district of Ganjam was in great straits for food, and those of Ellore, Rajamundry, and Condapilly, in serious distress. [...] From Masulipatam, it was reported, that there had been numerous deaths from starvation in all quarters of the neighbouring country, and the greatest difficulty was felt in supplying the inhabitants of the town with food, though the consumption had been at one time restricted to 1/4 seer, or half a pound, per head, per diem. [...] The price of rice in the town, had been at one time four Madras measures per rupee (or 2d. per lb.) Rice was also raised in price to 12 seers (8 Madras measures), the rupee, (1d., per lb) in Ganjam. [...] At an early period, the Government suspended the import and <b>transit</b> <b>duties</b> on all kinds of grain and provisions, and directed the local officers to afford every encouragement and assistance to the merchants in importing grain, but, at the same time, to prevent any improper attempts to raise the prices. [...] They also requested the Bengal Government to encourage the export of grain to the northern districts of Madras, and they imported considerably from the same quarter on government account. [...] In addition to these measures of relief, the Government found it necessary at the latter part of 1791, to prohibit the export of rice from Tanjore, until June 1792, except to the distressed districts, to permit 50 bags (about 7,500 lbs.) of rice, per mensem, to be distributed in charity, from the Government stores, at Vizagapatam, and to authorize the Collector of Ganjam to feed the poorest classes upon rice and natcheny porridge, at a cost of Rs. 200 to Rs. 300, per mensem. The pressure became at last so severe in this district, that Mr. Snodgrass, the Resident at Ganjam, collected local subscriptions for the relief of the poor, and employed 2,000 of them on public works, paying them their wages in grain from the Government stores.|$|E
2500|$|Steamers came late to {{the upper}} river, the section {{stretching}} from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But [...] summer was better navigationally and the three gorges, described as an [...] "150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass", posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 – 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70 - 80 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver {{through some of the}} most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges. Achibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the Chefoo Convention opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built Kuling but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of <b>transit</b> <b>duties,</b> competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes. [...] Kuling was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service. [...] In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade {{as long as it was}} restricted to native crafts. [...] In 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade. [...] Little took up residence in Chongqing and built Leechuan, to tackle the gorges in 1898. [...] In March Leechuan completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers. [...] Leechuan was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot. [...] In 1898, Little persuaded Captain Samuel Cornell Plant to come out to China to lend his expertise. [...] Captain Plant had just completed navigation of Persia's Upper Karun River and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on Leechuan at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS Pioneer built with Plant in command. [...] In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing. [...] Pioneer was sold to British Royal Navy after its first run due to threat from the Boxer Rebellion and renamed HMS Kinsha. [...] Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS Suixing ended in catastrophe. [...] On Suixing's maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze. [...] In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing. [...] Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS Shutung and SS Shuhun. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too. [...] Plant was appointed by Chinese Maritime Customs Service as First Senior River Inspector in 1915. [...] In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems. [...] He also wrote Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River, a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction. [...] Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze. [...] Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield and Swire and Standard Oil added their own steamers on the river between 1917 - 1919. [...] Between 1918 -1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business. Shutung was commandeered by warlords and Shuhun was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping. In 1921, when Captain Plant died tragically at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation. [...] The largest shipping companies in service, Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, Mackenzie & Co., Asiatic Petroleum, Robert Dollar, China Merchants S.N. Co. and British-American Tobacco Co., contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots. [...] In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners. [...] One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English. [...] Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.|$|E

Engine emissions certification level had the dominant effect on NOx; kinetic intensity was the secondary driving factor. The biodiesel effect on NOx emissions was not statistically significant for most buses and duty cycles for blends with certification diesel, except for a 2008 model year bus. CARB fuel had many more instances of a statistically significant effect of reducing NOx. SCR systems proved effective at reducing NOx to near the detection limit on all duty cycles and fuels, including B 100.

25|$|European {{settlers}} had {{two main}} criticisms of British South Africa Company railway policy. Firstly, that its financial arrangements unfairly benefited {{the company and}} its shareholders, and secondly, that the settlers paid for these benefits through exorbitant railway rates. Although the allegations were probably ill-founded, they caused tensions between the settlers and the BSAC. On the shorter east coast route from Beira, running expenses were high because of construction debts and because the Mozambique Company, which was granted the original concession to build the railway in 1891, imposed a <b>transit</b> <b>duty</b> of up to 3% on goods destined for Rhodesia in return for the sub-concession to the Beira Railway Company. From 1914, the European settlers had a majority in the Advisory Council, and called for the replacement of BSAC control of the railways through nationalisation. In 1923 responsible government was achieved, but rather outright nationalisation, the settler government opted for a form of public control under the Railway Act of 1926. This left BSAC as owner of the railways, which were called Beira and Mashonaland and Rhodesia Railways until 1927, and Rhodesia Railways Limited after. This remained the situation until 1947, when the Rhodesian Government acquired the assets of Rhodesia Railways Limited.|$|R

Despite its importance as a source of revenue, forty years of abuse of the likin system by local powers rankled with both the Chinese and the foreign merchant community. To compensate for its loss, the Qing regime increased import duties to 12.5% ad valorem while export duties increased to 7.5%.

In an effort to expand their privileges in China, Britain demanded the Qing authorities renegotiate the Treaty of Nanking (signed in 1842), citing their most favoured nation status. The British demands included opening all of China to British merchant companies, legalising the opium trade, exempting foreign imports from internal <b>transit</b> <b>duties,</b> suppression of piracy, regulation of the coolie trade, permission for a British ambassador to reside in Beijing and for the English-language version of all treaties to take precedence over the Chinese language.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a project (transitsearch. org) currently attempting to discover transiting intermediateperiod planets orbiting bright parent stars, and we simulate that project's performance. The discovery {{of such a}} transit would be an important astronomical advance, bridging the critical gap in understanding between HD 209458 b and Jupiter. However, the task is made dicult by intrinsically low transit probabilities and small <b>transit</b> <b>duty</b> cycles. This project's ecient and economical strategy is to photometrically monitor stars that are known (from radial velocity surveys) to bear planets, using a network of widely-spaced observers with small telescopes. These observers, each individually capable of precision (1 %) dierential photometry, monitor candidates during the time windows in which the radial velocity solution predicts a transit if the orbital inclination is close to 90. We use Monte Carlo techniques to simulate the performance of this network, performing simulations with dierent con gurations of observers in order to optimize coordination of an actual campaign. Our results indicate that transitsearch. org can reliably rule out or detect planetary transits within the current catalog of known planet-bearing stars.

Nepalese leaders asserted the position that as per the UN charter, transit privileges were [...] "a fundamental and a permanent right of a land-locked country" [...] and thus India's demand for a single treaty was unacceptable. So, after two extensions, the two treaties expired on 23 March 1989, resulting in a virtual Indian economic blockade of Nepal that lasted until late April 1990.

50|$|In the {{following}} years, peace had still {{not been fully}} restored in the Rampura district. After the Mandsaur Treaty in 1818, Holkar had lost most of his possessions, {{and it was only}} in 1856, in consideration of Rs. 16,000/-, and exchange for construction of a bridge over Gohi River, Holkar got back the Sendhwa fort. The region, however, experienced no peace or relief. As recorded in the official documents of the Central India Agency -Indore, the anarchy and confusion that prevailed in Holkar's territories previous to the conclusion of the Mandsaur Treaty had completely ruined the finances of the region. Holkar's minister Tantia Jogh set out to effect this recovery. It is reported that, in 1819, two insurrections broke in spite of formation of the Mahidpur Contingent and posting of a body of about 500 cavalry. These insurrections only added greatly to the challenges that Jogh was already facing. One was an imposter personating Malhar Rao Holkar and another Hari Rao a cousin of the Maharaja. By the time these were put to rest—literally—serious conflicts arose at the Rampura borders. The time was around 1821, and the troublemakers were the Thakur of Bhatkheri and his cronies. As a punishment, a part of the Bhatkheri Thakur’s' Jagir was confiscated and another of the leading insurgents, Bhairur Singh, delivered himself. Towards the end of 1822, it became necessary to employ a detachment of the British troops at Barkhera. As also reported in the official records of the Central Malwa Agency-Indore, in 1826, British made an agreement with Holkar, the states of Dhar and Dewas, as well as others in Malwa securing the British the exclusive right to purchase opium grown in Malwa.

5000|$|The {{conflict}} between local economic {{interests and the}} need for a national transportation network was demonstrated in the Erie War. Railroad development primarily followed a monopoly development model {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. Building railroads required a large capital investment. While many canals and turnpikes remained in operation, it was becoming clearer that railroad flexibility and efficiency would eclipse contemporary transportation and freight networks. Local and state governments with a vested economic interest in canals and turnpikes, who would hold heavier interests in railroads, desired to protect their investment. Although early railroads were funded by local investors, state and local economic interests relied on their performance. Local governments were eager to invest in railroads through bonds, since local development promised to benefit the local economy. In 1832 the New Jersey state legislature issued exclusive charter rights to the Camden and Amboy Railroad Company, exclusively authorizing it to carry passengers and goods across New Jersey and between New York City and Philadelphia. [...] "The Camden and Amboy was immediately a financial success, and the payment of dividends and <b>transit</b> <b>duties</b> constituted the principal source of revenue in the state budget." [...] The monopoly model was advantageous as a first step in railroad development, allowing secured private investments in doubtful ventures. [...] As railroads became a promising source of revenue for local and state governments, legislative precautions were taken to sustain the exchange. Mandated track-gauge differences were a primary way for state and local governments to ensure that rival out-of-state railroads could not interconnect and bypass local lines.|$|E

His responsibilities were extended quickly: initially involving himself with the regions of Mewar, Kota, Sirohi and Bundi, he soon added Marwar to his portfolio and in 1821 was also given responsibility for Jaisalmer. These areas were considered a strategic buffer zone against Russian advances from the north which, it was feared, might result in a move into India via the Khyber Pass. Tod believed that to achieve cohesion it was necessary that the Rajput states should contain only Rajput people, with all others being expelled. This would assist in achieving stability in the areas, thus limiting {{the likelihood of the}} inhabitants being influenced by outside forces. According to Ramya Sreenivasan, a researcher of religion and caste in early modern Rajasthan and of colonialism, Tod's [...] "transfers of territory between various chiefs and princes helped to create territorially consolidated states and 'routinised' political hierarchies."

Seven years had scarcely elapsed, when another serious dearth took place in the northern districts of the Presidency, and the pressure was apparently felt for about two years, viz., from November 1790 to November 1792. In April 1791, it was stated, that 1,200 persons had died of starvation in the neighbourhood of Vizagapatam, and early in 1792, the district of Ganjam was in great straits for food, and those of Ellore, Rajamundry, and Condapilly, in serious distress. From Masulipatam, it was reported, that there had been numerous deaths from starvation in all quarters of the neighbouring country, and the greatest difficulty was felt in supplying the inhabitants of the town with food, though the consumption had been at one time restricted to 1/4 seer, or half a pound, per head, per diem. The price of rice in the town, had been at one time four Madras measures per rupee (or 2d. per lb.) Rice was also raised in price to 12 seers (8 Madras measures), the rupee, (1d., per lb) in Ganjam. At an early period, the Government suspended the import and <b>transit</b> <b>duties</b> on all kinds of grain and provisions, and directed the local officers to afford every encouragement and assistance to the merchants in importing grain, but, at the same time, to prevent any improper attempts to raise the prices. They also requested the Bengal Government to encourage the export of grain to the northern districts of Madras, and they imported considerably from the same quarter on government account. In addition to these measures of relief, the Government found it necessary at the latter part of 1791, to prohibit the export of rice from Tanjore, until June 1792, except to the distressed districts, to permit 50 bags (about 7,500 lbs.) of rice, per mensem, to be distributed in charity, from the Government stores, at Vizagapatam, and to authorize the Collector of Ganjam to feed the poorest classes upon rice and natcheny porridge, at a cost of Rs. 200 to Rs. 300, per mensem.

Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70 - 80 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver {{through some of the}} most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges. Achibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the Chefoo Convention opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built Kuling but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of <b>transit</b> <b>duties,</b> competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes. Kuling was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service. In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade {{as long as it was}} restricted to native crafts. In 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade. Little took up residence in Chongqing and built Leechuan, to tackle the gorges in 1898. In March Leechuan completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers. Leechuan was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot. [...] In 1898, Little persuaded Captain Samuel Cornell Plant to come out to China to lend his expertise. Captain Plant had just completed navigation of Persia's Upper Karun River and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on Leechuan at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS Pioneer built with Plant in command. In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing. Pioneer was sold to British Royal Navy after its first run due to threat from the Boxer Rebellion and renamed HMS Kinsha. Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS Suixing ended in catastrophe. On Suixing's maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze. In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing. Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS Shutung and SS Shuhun. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too. Plant was appointed by Chinese Maritime Customs Service as First Senior River Inspector in 1915. In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems. He also wrote Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River, a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction. Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze. Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield and Swire and Standard Oil added their own steamers on the river between 1917 - 1919. Between 1918 -1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business. Shutung was commandeered by warlords and Shuhun was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping. In 1921, when Captain Plant died tragically at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation. The largest shipping companies in service, Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, Mackenzie & Co., Asiatic Petroleum, Robert Dollar, China Merchants S.N. Co. and British-American Tobacco Co., contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots. In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners. One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English. Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} a response to Axel Gosseries’s “Nations, Generations and Climate Justice. ” The core argument in Gosseries’s sharp and challenging text states that (1) we can understand intergenerational justice as <b>transit</b> <b>duties</b> between countries; that (2) impartial global planners should realize these duties through an intergenerational global leximin principle; and (3) that the right implementation of this principle implies strictly equivalent intergenerational transfers. In this text I will address the evaluative perspective of the impartial global planner and its institutional interpretation; then I will briefly present an “opportunistic” reply to the vagueness objection to rectificatory justice; finally I briefly examine the development of the right of transit in the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea and the limits to its intergenerational extension. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
