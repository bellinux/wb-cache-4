500|$|This {{underground}} station {{looks like a}} typical express station, with four tracks and two island platforms. To the east (railroad north) is a large storage and relay yard consisting of two levels with four relay tracks each, extending approximately [...] to around 184th Place. This total of eight storage tracks gives 179th Street the highest peak terminal capacity of any station in the New York City Subway: 63 trains per hour, or one train every 57 seconds, although the station currently operates at a far lower throughput (only 17–18 trains per hour during peak hours). Terminating trains enter {{on one of the}} two northbound tracks, then relay to one of the two levelsthe upper level if coming from the express track, or the lower level if coming from the local track. They then return on the corresponding track on the southbound side. Due to the switching configuration at the station, the few E trains that begin here always leave from the express track and run express along Hillside Avenue. F trains may leave from either <b>track,</b> <b>switching</b> to the local track east of 169th Street if necessary. Outside of relay operations, the yard provides storage for four trains. It is estimated that the relay tracks east of the station can fit about 600 passenger automobiles.|$|E

GamePros Captain Squideo said the production values of the full motion video are extraordinary, but tainted by the typically grainy video quality of the Sega CD, and that the game needed a port to the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer or 32X (systems with much higher full motion video capabilities than the Sega CD). He also complimented the voices and the [...] "low key" [...] musical score, but found the game controls poorly, with the <b>track</b> <b>switching</b> being inadequately responsive and the cursor often getting lost in the backgrounds.

Roger Hargreaves of the Metro rated the game a 6 out of 10, noting that the as-shipped music library is rather small and the game's continuous push on the user to buy more content. Electronic Games Monthly McKinley Noble was also critical of the constant push for players to buy content, and felt that the title [...] "would be a better game with a higher price tag and a bigger built-in song list" [...] instead of relying on DLC.XBLAFans reported that Rock Band Blitz dominated September 2012 XBLA sales achieving 116,426 sales between the dates of August 27 and September 30.|$|E

[...] Sam Moore of Drowned in Sound stated, [...] "Fifteen new tracks make the cut on A Better Tomorrow, with the oft-masterful RZA handling production on ten of the offerings. But the record doesn’t successfully break new ground as much as it reassuringly treads familiar paths: samples of dialogue and fighting sequences from old martial-arts films, cut-and-paste instrumentals that numerous members of the Clan take turns to go in over, and a plethora of references to those halcyon ’93 days. You know, classic Wu-Tang stuff." ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal IFAC-Papers OnLine and the definitive published version is available at [URL] track switches, {{commonly referred to as}} ‘turnouts’ or ‘points,’ are a necessary element of any rail network. However, they often prove to be performance-limiting elements of networks. A novel concept for rail <b>track</b> <b>switching</b> has been developed as part of a UK research project with substantial industrial input. The concept is currently at the demonstrator phase, with a scale (384 mm) gauge unit currently operational in a laboratory. Details of the novel arrangement and concept are provided herein. This concept is considered as an advance {{on the state of the}} art. This paper also presents the work that took place to develop the concept. Novel contributions include the establishment of a formal set of functional requirements for railway <b>track</b> <b>switching</b> solutions, and a demonstration that the current solutions do not fully meet these requirements. The novel design meets the set of functional requirements for <b>track</b> <b>switching</b> solutions, in addition to offering several features that the current designs are unable to offer, in particular to enable multi-channel actuation and rail locking, and provide a degree of fault tolerance. This paper describes the design and operation of this switching concept, from requirements capture and solution generation through to the construction of the laboratory demonstrator. The novel concept is contrasted with the design and operation of the ‘traditional’ switch design. Conclusions to the work show that the novel concept meets all the functional requirements whilst exceeding the capabilities of the existing designs in most non-functional requirement areas...|$|E
