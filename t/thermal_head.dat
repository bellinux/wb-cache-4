50|$|The <b>Thermal</b> <b>Head</b> is a {{component}} of a metrological device created to aid in development of new CPUs and chipsets. The first <b>Thermal</b> <b>Head</b> was constructed in 1996 by James Kerner. It was initially designed to control a slot 1 Intel processor's temperature while making computations in a test platform. A <b>Thermal</b> <b>Head</b> attached to a CPU may also increase a CPU's performance during computation. Today it is used for test/validation of a processor {{in conjunction with a}} Thermal Management System consisting of a temperature controller attached to the <b>Thermal</b> <b>Head</b> by way of an electrical umbilical.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} print, thermo-sensitive paper is {{inserted}} between the <b>thermal</b> <b>head</b> and the platen. The printer sends an electric current to the heating {{elements of the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>head,</b> which generate heat. The heat activates the thermo-sensitive coloring layer of the thermosensitive paper, which changes color where heated. Such a printing mechanism {{is known as a}} thermal system or direct system. The heating elements are usually arranged as a matrix of small closely spaced dots—thermal printers are actually dot-matrix printers, though they are not called such.|$|E

50|$|Thermal {{transfer}} printing is a {{very different}} method that uses a heat-sensitive ribbon instead of heat-sensitive paper, but uses similar <b>thermal</b> print <b>heads.</b>|$|R
50|$|The heating {{from the}} core creates a <b>thermal</b> <b>head</b> that assists the {{recirculation}} pumps in recirculating the water inside of the RPV. A BWR can be designed with no recirculation pumps and rely entirely on the <b>thermal</b> <b>head</b> to recirculate the water inside of the RPV. The forced recirculation head from the recirculation pumps is very useful in controlling power, however, and allows achieving higher power levels that would not otherwise be possible. The thermal power level is easily varied by simply increasing or decreasing the forced recirculation flow through the recirculation pumps.|$|E
5000|$|Process: A special [...] "thermo-sensitive" [...] {{paper is}} {{fed into the}} copier {{at the same time}} but in {{indirect}} contact to the original. The thermo-sensitive paper is actually feed between the <b>thermal</b> <b>head</b> and the platen. The copier, while scanning the original, sends an electric current to some selected heating elements of the <b>thermal</b> <b>head,</b> which generate heat. The heated elements correspond to the black areas of the original and, being pressed against the copy paper, make the areas they touch on the [...] "thermo-sensitive" [...] substrate, to become darker.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{performance}} of five bicycle helmets was evaluated with a <b>thermal</b> manikin <b>head</b> with six zones. Evaluation {{was made with}} physical and virtual experimental methods. Ambient temperature maintained at 24 °C and surface temperature of the <b>thermal</b> manikin <b>head</b> was set to 34 °C. Experiments were performed for air velocities of 1. 6 m/s and 6 m/s. Heat transfer (W) of four thermal zones was recorded for five helmets and compared with a nude <b>thermal</b> manikin <b>head</b> to assess <b>thermal</b> performance. Virtual experiments were performed using commercial CFD codes with a realizable k-e turbulence model. Correlation coefficients of 0. 78 (1. 6 m/s) and 0. 79 (6 m/s) were found between physical and virtual experiments. A combined physical and virtual evaluation methodology allows creating a design iteration process with virtual prototypes, physical prototypes and commercially available helmets...|$|R

25|$|A {{thermal printer}} (or direct thermal printer) {{produces}} a printed image by selectively heating coated thermochromic paper, or thermal paper {{as it is}} commonly known, when the paper passes over the <b>thermal</b> print <b>head.</b> The coating turns black in the areas where it is heated, producing an image.|$|R
50|$|Dye-sublimation {{printers}} {{have some}} drawbacks compared to inkjet printers. Each of the colored panels of the ribbons, and the <b>thermal</b> <b>head</b> itself, must match {{the size of}} the media that is being printed on. Furthermore, only specially coated paper or specific plastics can accept the sublimated ink. This means that dye-sublimation printers cannot match the flexibility of inkjet printers in printing {{on a wide range of}} media.|$|E
50|$|For ID card printing, {{text and}} bar codes are necessary, {{and they are}} printed {{by means of an}} {{additional}} black panel on the (YMCKO) ribbon. This extra panel works by thermal transfer printing instead of dye diffusion: a whole layer, instead of just some of the dye in the layer, transfers from the ribbon to the substrate at the pixels defined by the <b>thermal</b> <b>head.</b> This overall process is then sometimes called D2T2 (Dye Diffusion Thermal Transfer).|$|E
50|$|Dye {{sublimation}} {{offers some}} advantages over inkjet printing. For one, the prints are dry {{and ready to}} handle {{as soon as they}} exit the printer. Since the <b>thermal</b> <b>head</b> doesn't have to sweep {{back and forth over the}} print media, there are fewer moving parts that can break down. The whole printing cycle is extremely clean as there are no liquid inks to clean up. These factors make dye-sublimation generally a more reliable technology over inkjet printing.|$|E
50|$|Argon {{is used as}} a {{propellant}} in {{the development}} of the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR). Compressed argon gas is allowed to expand, to cool the seeker heads of some versions of the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile and other missiles that use cooled <b>thermal</b> seeker <b>heads.</b> The gas is stored at high pressure.|$|R
50|$|During the {{printing}} cycle, the printer rollers will move the medium {{and one of}} the colored panels together under a <b>thermal</b> printing <b>head,</b> which is usually the same width as the shorter dimension of the print medium. Tiny heating elements on the head change temperature rapidly, laying different amounts of dye depending on the amount of heat applied. Some of the dye diffuses into {{the printing}} medium.|$|R
50|$|Thermal {{printing}} (or {{direct thermal}} printing) is a digital printing process which produces a printed image by selectively heating coated thermochromic paper, or thermal paper {{as it is}} commonly known, when the paper passes over the <b>thermal</b> print <b>head.</b> The coating turns black in the areas where it is heated, producing an image. Two-colour direct thermal printers can print both black and an additional colour (often red) by applying heat at two different temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|As 1200-baud dialup {{communication}} {{became more}} common among Time-sharing providers, the Silent 700 faced the problem that its printhead technology simply couldn't [...] "heat up all the little dots" [...] at 120 characters per second. TI solved this in their 780-series terminals by creating a two-character-wide <b>thermal</b> <b>head,</b> which printed 60 pairs of characters per second. This allowed the product line to survive {{a few more years}} in the new high-speed interactive computing environment of the mid-1980s.|$|E
50|$|Gestetner, Risograph, {{and other}} {{companies}} still make and sell highly automated mimeograph-like machines that are externally similar to photocopiers. The modern version of a mimeograph, called a digital duplicator, or copyprinter, contains a scanner, a <b>thermal</b> <b>head</b> for stencil cutting, and a large roll of stencil material entirely inside the unit. The stencil material consists of a very thin polymer film laminated to a long-fibre non-woven tissue. It makes the stencils and mounts and unmounts them from the print drum automatically, making it almost as easy to operate as a photocopier. The Risograph is {{the best known of}} these machines.|$|E
50|$|The figure {{shows the}} {{cross section of}} a Flat No lead package with a lead frame and wire bonding. There {{are two types of}} body designs, punch {{singulation}} and saw singulation. Saw singulation cuts a large set of packages in parts. In punch singulation, a single package is moulded into shape. The cross section shows a saw-singulated body with an attached <b>thermal</b> <b>head</b> pad. The lead frame is made of copper alloy and a thermally conductive adhesive is used for attaching the silicon die to the thermal pad. The silicon die is electrically connected to the lead frame by 1-2 mil diameter gold wires.|$|E
50|$|Texas Instruments {{invented the}} <b>thermal</b> print <b>head</b> in 1965, and the Silent 700, a {{computer}} terminal with a thermal printer, {{was released in}} the market in 1969. The Silent 700 was the first thermal print system that printed on thermal paper. During the 1970s, Hewlett-Packard integrated thermal paper printers into the design of its HP9800 series desktop computers, and integrated it {{into the top of}} the 2600-series CRT terminals as well as in plotters.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principle}} {{is the same}} for practically all card printers: the plastic card is passed through a <b>thermal</b> print <b>head</b> {{at the same time as}} a color ribbon. The color from the ribbon is transferred onto the card through the heat given out from the print head. The standard performance for card printing is 300 dpi (300 dots per inch, equivalent to 11.8 dots per mm). There are different printing processes, which vary in their detail: ...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{stability}} of electroless Ni-P alloy thin film resistors for pulse heating was investigated using the {{step stress test}} method. The resistance of electroless Ni-P resistors i decreased by pulse heating. It was confirmed by a micro x-ray diffraction analysis of the resistors after the step stress test that this resistance decrease is due to crystallization of the resistor films. The degree of crystallization can be quantitativeIy evaluated as the {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} of Ni-P films calculated from resistance changes during pulse heating. The step stress test is demonstrated to be an effec-tive and quick method of determining the {{thermal stability}} of thin film resistors for pulse heating, and it also gives an eval-uation of the temperature coefficient of resistance of thin film resistors. An electroless Ni-P film is used as a thin film resistor be-cause of its high specific resistance and low temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) (1, 2). Recently, the electro-less Ni-W-P alloy thin films were being used as heating re-sistors for <b>thermal</b> <b>heads</b> (3, 4) because of their good mass productivity and low cost performance.

5000|$|A <b>Thermal</b> <b>Head</b> {{is always}} used in {{conjunction}} with a Thermal Tool System. [...] "Among the USTC Thermal Tool System products are the Integrated Thermal Management System (ITMS), Hybrid Air Thermal Management System (HATMS), Rack Integrated Thermal Management System (RITMS), Temperature Control System (TCS), and Thermal Heads (TH). Integrating cooling modules and the TCS in one enclosure with liquid as working fluid, combined with TH, the ITMS executes temperature control tasks without other components. Using air as cooling media, the HATMS executes the tasks like ITMS. The RITMS includes a smart TCS unit which automatically adjusts parameters for temperature control, with an ultra-low noise level and low power consumption. The TCS is a standard temperature control unit, and the TH dissipate heat from a heat-generated device, like a computer. The RITMS or TCS, combined with a chiller (or a heat exchanger) and TH, provide a standard way to control the temperature and dissipate heat on electronic components for production validation tests." ...|$|E
5000|$|As dye-sublimation thermal {{printers}} utilize heat {{to transfer}} the dye onto the print media, the printing speed {{is limited by the}} speed at which the elements on the <b>thermal</b> <b>head</b> can change temperature. Heating the elements is easy, as a strong electric current can raise the temperature of an element very quickly. However, cooling the elements down, when changing from a darker to a lighter color, is harder and usually involves having a fan/heatsink assembly attached to the print head. The use of multiple heads can also speed up this process, since one head can cool down while another is printing. Although print times vary among different dye-sublimation printers, a typical cheap home-use dye-sub printer can print a 6" [...] x 4" [...] photo in 45 - 90 seconds. More heavy-duty printers can print much faster; for example, a Sinfonia Colorstream S2 dye-sublimation printer can print a 6" [...] x 4" [...] photo in as little as 6.8 seconds, and a Mitsubishi CP-D707DW is known to have a faster print of under 6 seconds for similar size. In all cases, the finished print is completely dry once it emerges from the printer.|$|E

With the aim of future first stage high performance rocket combustion chambers, the combustion pressure levels have been varied up to 11. 5 MPa with real engine like conditions. Experimental investigations have shown remarkable circumferential variations of <b>thermal</b> <b>head</b> load due to injector design and film effectiveness which remain existent far downstream from the film injection point and injector face plate, and which are more pronounced at higher chamber pressure levels...|$|E
50|$|Desktop inkjet printers, as used {{in offices}} or at home, tend to use aqueous inks based on a mixture of water, glycol and dyes or pigments. These inks are {{inexpensive}} to manufacture, but are difficult to control {{on the surface of}} media, often requiring specially coated media. HP inks contain sulfonated polyazo black dye (commonly used for dyeing leather), nitrates and other compounds. Aqueous inks are mainly used in printers with <b>thermal</b> inkjet <b>heads,</b> as these heads require water to perform.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, the RISO Kagaku Corporation {{introduced}} the digital duplicator. It uses the basic mimeograph technology but improves on it, {{in that the}} operator {{does not have to}} create the stencil directly. The stencil, called a master, is made by use of a scanner and <b>thermal</b> print <b>head.</b> A used master is automatically removed and placed in a disposal box, as a new one is created. This way the operator should not have to touch the used master material that is coated in ink.|$|R

By providing rapid analysis and a large number of accurate measurements of surface and subsurface contamination, the cost of remediation of large industrial sites will be dramatically lowered by reducing both characterization time and the material fraction that must be remediated. The RSSAR system is capable of sampling a variety of surfaces for semivolatile organic contaminants. The sampling is rapid (one sample per 100 sec).

40|$|In {{order to}} develop a {{high-speed}} and high-resolution thermal printer, it is required to improve a heat conduction in a <b>thermal</b> <b>head</b> {{which leads to a}} uniform temperature. On the other hand, a moderate heat insulation might make thermal printers more energy-saving. Thermally anisotropic materials seem to be promising for these purposes. It can flatten the temperature distribution in a desired direction while preventing heat flow to the other direction. In this study the feasibility of the anisotropic sub-layer substrate is examined both experimentally and computationally. Carbon fiber composites are used to make thermal heads and the distribution of temperature is evaluated. The result shows that a control of the heat conduction in a desired direction is possible. To improve the controllability of heat conduction, the neural network is applied to seek the optimum composition of heat conductance...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of the head in dissipating body heat and the prevention of heat illness under hot conditions is well recognised (Desruelle and Candas, 2000), although {{little is known about}} the local differences in sweat secretion within the head. In this study, we focussed on this sweat distribution, since such information will contribute significantly to our understanding of thermoregulation in general and of human sudomotor control in particular. Despite its relatively small surface area (6 - 7 % of total area; Hardy and DuBois, 1938), the head is highly vascular, and has a surface area-to-mass ratio that favours heat loss. Indeed, heat loss per unit area is significantly higher from the head than most other body segments (Froese and Burton 1957; Rasch et al., 1991). In addition, when the body is covered with clothing, the head becomes a major avenue for heat dissipation, but this is adversely influenced by helmets and other headgear. Therefore, it is most important, either for the development of <b>thermal</b> (<b>head)</b> manikins or for the design of headgear, that the sweat secretion patterns of the head are known across a wide range of thermal loads.
