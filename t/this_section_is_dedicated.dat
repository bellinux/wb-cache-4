You can make your characters move just by selecting him or her and using tools in the movement tab to move your character around the background. You can also make your character do a certain action, such as cry, run, laugh, walk, or fall backwards. The action tab has a list of available actions you can use for your character instead of just simply moving your character around. You can also make your characters talk. To do this, click on the talk tab, and then select what you want your character to say by clicking on it. There's three sections in the talk tab. The first one is hellos. This one is pretty self explanatory. You can make your character say hello to other characters or towards the audience (by breaking the 4th wall). The second one is goodbyes. This one is also pretty self explanatory. You can make your character say goodbye to other characters or towards the audience (again by breaking the 4th wall). The last one is sayings. <b>This</b> <b>section</b> <b>is</b> <b>dedicated</b> {{to a list of}} lines that your character can say towards other characters or towards the audience (yet again by breaking the 4th wall).

Luckily, there is an option to record your own voice if you have a microphone. Sadly, you can only record 10 seconds of your own voice. Just select the character and say something short. You can further extend it by recording your voice over and over again.

40|$|Inverse Problems, Vol. 16, no. 5, Oct. 2000 In {{the past}} couple of decades, there have been {{considerable}} advances in the efficiency, robustness and efficacy of inversion methods in almost every field. This is apparent in the many journal articles published on this subject, the ever-growing number of specialized sessions organized in major conferences, and in the several books and proceedings that have appeared in the past few years. Inverse scattering continues to be a primary area of research to a large number of scientists and practitioners. Many developments have been driven by several new applications and some old ones, such as mathematical physics, atmospheric sciences, geophysical prospecting, quantum mechanics, remote sensing, underwater acoustics, nondestructive testing and evaluation, medical imaging, to mention only a few. These developments have been applied to a variety of data that include direct current (DC), monochromatic, multi-frequency and transients. The majority of the effort has gone into improving on the robustness and speed of the various inversion techniques. A considerable effort has also gone into addressing the nonuniqueness and ill-conditioning that are inherent in almost all inverse scattering problems which arise mainly {{as a consequence of the}} inadequacy and redundancy in measurements. Many researchers have attempted to quantify these uncertainties by resorting to probabilistic methods. <b>This</b> special <b>section</b> <b>is</b> <b>dedicated</b> to the imaging and inversion of the Earth's subsurface by electromagnetic means with special emphasis, though nonexclusive, toward oil and mineral exploration, evaluation and monitoring...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of new binding sites raises {{the problem of}} defining their role, if any. At times they are shown to be pharmacological receptors, in a strict sense, as they fulfill certain requirements, and a precise physiological role and function, and an endogenous ligand (neurotransmitter) are discovered. At other times, however, neither a clear physiological role nor an endogenous ligand are found, but the term “receptor” is still used, although {{it may not be}} a proper one in the conventional pharmacological sense. Furthermore, no clear intracellular signalling transduction pathway is defined and, as a consequence, it is not possible to determine whether drugs binding to these receptors act as agonists or antagonists. What their structure and biological function are and how they mediate the pharmacological effects of ligands may remain for a long time an enigma. The matter, in any case, is of great interest to researchers of different areas, especially to medicinal chemists who foresee novel potential targets for therapeutic interventions.

40|$|One of the {{cleavages}} within {{sustainable development}} is division between grassroots environmental action, often deemed good on participation terms, and green innovation, usually centred on technologies in firms and deemed good for ecological modernisation. <b>This</b> special <b>section</b> <b>is</b> <b>dedicated</b> to an obvious and missing connection: grassroots innovation for sustainability. Grassroots innovations typically involve networks of activists and organisations generating novel bottom-up solutions for sustainable development; solutions that {{respond to the}} local situation and the interests {{and values of the}} communities involved (Seyfang and Smith, 2007). What they share is commitment {{on the part of those}} involved towards openness and inclusion in the processes of innovation and the outputs of innovation. Research is still needed that considers whether and how grassroots innovators network with one another; the extent to which movements for grassroots innovation approaches exist and how they operate; whether and how innovations diffuse through processes of replication, scaling-up, and translation into institutions; and whether or not these developments constitute alternative pathways for sustainability. The empirical contributions in <b>this</b> special <b>section</b> consider the dilemmas of going to scale, the challenges of moving from innovation to institutionalisation, and the risks of capture and instrumentality when grassroots innovations encounter more powerful political economies of conventional innovation systems (see also Smith et al., 2013). A recurring theme is diversity in innovation for sustainability; which might be served best by resisting pressures to mainstream, yet simultaneously generates accusations of marginality. In highlighting these themes and introducing the special section, we use a particular example, the Brighton Earthship, and which all contributing authors visited as part of a research workshop on grassroots innovation held at Sussex University in May 2012 and that led to the papers here...|$|R

40|$|VaR is {{the most}} {{accepted}} risk measure worldwide and the leading reference in any risk management assessment. However, its methodology has important limitations which makes it unreliable in contexts of crisis or high uncertainty. For this reason, {{the aim of this}} work is to test the VaR accuracy when is employed in contexts of volatility, for which we compare the VaR outcomes in scenarios of both stability and uncertainty, using the parametric method and a historical simulation based on data generated with the Black & Scholes model. VaR main objective is the prediction of the highest expected loss for any given portfolio, but even when it is considered a useful tool for risk management under conditions of markets stability, we found that it is substantially inaccurate in contexts of crisis or high uncertainty. In addition, we found that the Black & Scholes simulations lead to underestimate the expected losses, in comparison with the parametric method and we also found that those disparities increase substantially in times of crisis. In the first <b>section</b> of <b>this</b> work we present a brief context of risk management in finance.

40|$|Socio-cultural life is decomposable in {{conversational}} interaction settings which constitute relevant {{units of}} analysis at the microscopic scale, susceptible to an empirical study inscribed within the disciplinary borders of an anthropology of contemporary societies, based on the variation and articulation of micro-, meso- and macro-social scales of analysis. The convergences between ethnographers and conversation analysts, which were at the source of micro-ethnography, have taken place first within the American context and have only recently reached European anthropology. Through a re-reading {{of the works of}} Marcel Maus and Bronislaw Malinowski, this thesis establishes the existing affiliations between this enterprise and the European research traditions that, to this day, have been subject to a lengthy work of Europeanization. This will be done through a critical examination of the debate that has taken place around Harold Garfinkel and ethnomethodology, the main theoretical framework of conversation analysis. The theoretical framework of this research will be completed by a discussion of auxiliary theories in conversation analysis. The methodological choices undertaken in this work in what concerns the empirical research are then presented and discussed, followed by the description of its two main stages. The first stage consisted of an exploration of this approach, resorting to the multi-situated floating observation; the second stage, for methodological reasons detailed in <b>this</b> <b>section,</b> <b>was</b> <b>dedicated</b> to establishing a corpus of recordings of conversational interactions, in order to consolidate the analysis and apply it to a well defined institutional and professional setting. This corpus of over 50 hours of taped interactions provides the empirical basis for the study of a class of interactional events, defined during its analysis: service encounters in Social Services. The recordings of the interviews took place in the county of Sintra and used a co-participative methodology. The methodological section presents and discusses the relevant aspects of the research: the challenges encountered in the opening of institutional terrains; the triangulation of methodologies and data (field research supported by photography, interviews, recordings and primary documentation) in order to carry out an approach to the research object that is both ethnographic and micro-ethnographic; the corpus as a long term work space, the inductive methodology and the itineraries of corpus analysis. Approached as micro-observatories of social policies and large scale social phenomena, service encounters are interactional events with an institutional ecology described in this thesis by means of visual ethnography. The sequential organization of service encounters and the wide range of micro-actions occurring within this context are subject to detailed descriptions, supported by transcriptions, and contribute to reveal and highlight the systematic procedures and devices applied by social workers and clients in the co-steering of their conversational interaction in the context of social service encounters. A vida sociocultural comporta quadros de interacção conversacional que constituem importantes unidades de análise à escala microscópica, passíveis de um estudo empírico que se inscreve dentro das fronteiras disciplinares de uma antropologia das sociedades contemporâneas que varia consoante as escalas de análise. As convergências entre etnógrafos e analistas da conversação na origem da micro-etnografia, que ocorreram primeiro no contexto americano, alargaram-se à antropologia europeia só numa data recente. A partir de uma releitura das obras de Marcel Mauss e de Bronislaw Malinowski, esta tese estabelece as filiações existentes entre este empreendimento e tradições investigativas europeias, trabalho de europeização prolongado até à actualidade, mediante um exame crítico das controvérsias travadas em torno da obra de Harold Garfinkel e da etnometodologia, principal quadro teórico da análise da conversação. Uma vez expostas a análise da conversação e as suas teorias auxiliares, a tese expõe as opções metodológicas da investigação empírica desenvolvida, retratando as suas duas principais etapas. A primeira etapa explorou esta abordagem com recurso ao método da observação flutuante multisituada; a segunda, por razões metodológicas, foi consagrada à constituição de um corpus de gravações de interacções conversacionais, com vista à consolidação das análises e à sua aplicação a um domínio institucional e profissional delimitado. Um corpus de mais de 50 horas de gravação faculta a base empírica ao estudo de uma classe de eventos interacionais, definidos com precisão no decurso da análise: atendimentos em serviços de acção social, gravados no Concelho de Sintra, ao abrigo de uma investigação conduzida com a participação das pessoas envolvidas. A secção metodológica da tese, que pretende examinar várias questões inerentes à dupla abordagem etnográfica e micro-etnográfica do objecto, incide sobre os seguintes aspectos: - a abertura de terrenos institucionais; - a dinamização da participação dos intervenientes; - a triangulação de métodos: pesquisa de terreno auxiliada pela fotografia, entrevistas, gravações e documentos primários; - a separação das fases de registo e de análise; - a transcrição; - a organização e o tratamento do corpus; - a metodologia indutiva; - os roteiros de análise. Abordados como micro-observatórios das políticas sociais e de fenómenos sociais de grande escala, os atendimentos sociais são eventos interaccionais cuja ecologia institucional é descrita na tese com o auxílio da etnografia visual. A organização sequencial dos atendimentos e o vasto leque de micro-acções ocorrendo no seu quadro são objectos de descrições detalhadas, apoiadas em transcrições, que contribuem para revelar os procedimentos e os dispositivos metódicos aplicados por técnicos e utentes na co-pilotagem da sua interacção conversacional em sede de atendimentos de acção social...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we are aimed by {{the purpose of}} {{describe}} three important cases of chemical interest and show how theoretical and computational methods can be useful, even needful to explore and solve very significative applications. The commons theme of this work are represented by the well known Density Functional Theory and the Polarizable Continuum Model used for all the cases reported. As we will able to recall the first {{is one of the}} most diffused theoretical approach in computational chemistry studies whenever the electronic structure has to be solved. The second one represents a wide diffuse model which is able to describe with good accuracy molecular interactions in condensed matter. Both of them provide the most common computational configuration in organic, and oreganometallic studies. In this thesis we are going to describe few examples which spread from the study of condensed matters under extremely high pressure to a biological application on DNA nucleobase systems, moving through some typical organometallic problems. Focusing on our issues we are going to present a new computational QM method for the study of structural properties (i. e. equilibrium geometry) of molecular systems under very high pressure. The procedure is based on the Polarizable Continuum Model, usually used to study molecular solutes under standard pressure conditions. The presented development considers two critical items: the definition of the pressure and the elaboration of an analytical code for the calculation of molecular gradient. The method has been developed at HF and DFT levels, with computational costs comparable with those of similar calculations in vacuo. The numerical examples regarding the equilibrium geometries and conformational energies (DFT level) of 1, 3 -butadiene under high pressure give an indication of the potentialities of the approach and of the problems to which it may be applied. The next argument regards several application in the field of inorganic chemistry. We will shortly describe a computational procedure where we investigate some spectroscopical properties of some luminescence silver complexes. In this, we will describe a time dependent density functional study of several excited states. Moreover we will study the correlation between stretching vibration and Mulliken charges in some rhodium complexes. But most of <b>this</b> <b>section</b> will <b>be</b> <b>dedicate</b> to a very practical application in chemistry that is the chemical reaction path determination. Aimed by unclear experimental evidences provided by the catalytic investigation of an half sandwich Ru(II) complex, we performed a deep exploration of the mechanism through which the pre catalysts operate. Several data obtained by high-resolution MS (ESI) have been explained by a combined ”Density Functional /Polarizable Continuum Model” study. The results reveal that the complexes containing PNH 2 operate through a bifunctional mechanism analogous to that proposed for diamines and amino alcohol ligands, but with some new aspects that are important to point out. Finally an efficient computational method has been identified which uses Density Functional Theory, Polarizable Continuum Models with a modified UFF cavity and Boltzmann weighting of tautomers to predict the site-specific and global pKa of DNA nucleobases and their oxidation products. The method has been used to evaluate the acidity of Gh and Sp, two highly mutagenic guanine oxidation products. The trend observed for the pKa values of Gh (9. 64 and 8. 15) is consistent with the experimentally observed values for guanidine cation (13. 7) and hydantoin (9. 16). The pKa 1 (calc) value for deprotonation of Sp cation (Sp+ [...] >Sp) is very close to the experimentally observed pKa 1 for 8 -oxoG and is consistent with the similarity in their structures. The data suggest that the imide (N 7) proton in Sp is considerably more acidic than that in Gh, possibly due to the presence of the through-space electronic e ects of the carbonyl group located at C 6. This difference in the acidity of Gh and Sp may be an indication of their potential toxicity and mutagenicity in vivo and remains a fertile area for experimental study...|$|R
