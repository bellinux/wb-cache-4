25|$|The lack {{of celebrity}} was symbolised in earlier series by the {{presence}} of a minor, and often somewhat cult, celebrity, locked up in a cage in the dungeon of the Bungalow. In later series, the celebrity would sit in the attic. In both cases <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> nothing and often do nothing. Some people {{who have been in the}} cage or the attic included Vince Earl, Sarah Greene, John Kettley, Hugo Myatt (as Treguard from Knightmare), Su Pollard, Bodger and Badger, and Peter Simon.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{replied that}} he would consent to the test since he was confident of Marie's guilt, but he felt {{there was no need}} to call on Orfila to do it. The president of the court ruled in favor of the prosecutor's suggestion. Therefore, in lieu of Orfila, two well-known apothecaries from Tulle, M. Dubois and his son, and a chemist from Limoges named Dupuytren, were assigned to conduct the tests. While they were performed, the trial proceeded at a snail's pace. When they finally entered the courtroom, everyone waited to see what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> The elder Dubois testified that despite using the Marsh test carefully, they failed to find any arsenic. Almost immediately, the courtroom was in an uproar as Marie felt vindicated.|$|E

That deal, {{which was}} the topic of that closed-door meeting with Tuohy, stated that Heirens would serve one life sentence if he confessed to the murders of Josephine Ross, Frances Brown, and Suzanne Degnan. With {{the help of his}} lawyers, he began drafting a confession using the Chicago Tribune article as a guide:As it turned out, the Tribune article was very helpful, as it provided me with a lot of details I didn't know. My attorneys rarely changed anything outright, but I could tell by their faces if I had made a mistake. Or <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'Now, Bill, is that really the way it happened?' Then I would change my story because, obviously, it went against what was known (in the Tribune).|$|E

The track topped the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, Lo received nominations, alongside the others co-writers of the song, for the Golden Globes, Grammys and Critics' Choice Awards. [...] Discussing {{the process of writing}} for other artists, the singer told Paste that she avoids drawing from her own experiences so that the songs do not become personal. She also stated: [...] "My main goal is to say something how <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> it, even if I might say it in a different way that makes more sense to me".|$|E

500|$|... "Hair" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Gaga and RedOne, {{and the name}} of the song was revealed through an interview with Vogue magazine in February 2011. On The Graham Norton Show, Gaga explained the origin of the song, which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom, and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her. According to a press listening in February, [...] "Hair" [...] draws inspiration from Pat Benatar's '80s classic [...] "We Belong", while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of [...] "Born This Way". Gaga elaborated on the song's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account: [...] "When I was a kid, I used to always come down the stairs of my parents' house, and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'Go back upstairs and brush your hair, change your clothes, you can't go out wearing that', and I felt like it was stifling my identity... My hair was my glory. It was the only thing that I could change about myself." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Monaghan, Drive Shaft {{is similar}} to Oasis, in that [...] " [...] first album {{was kind of like}} Oasis's first album: {{critically}} acclaimed, didn't sell big numbers, but in the industry, people gave it respect." [...] J.J Abrams and Damon Linelof told Monaghan that if he wanted to write the song that would be Charlie's [...] "one hit wonder", they would consider using it in the show. Monaghan wrote a song called [...] "Photos and Plans" [...] with a friend; Abrams and Lindelof liked the song, but it did not make it into Lost. The lyrics were inspired by an incident on The Phil Donahue Show, where Matt Reeves, who was close friends with producers Bryan Burk and Damon Lindelof, saw a female audience member yell out, [...] "You all everybody, acting like it's the stupid people wearing expensive clothes." [...] The producers had an inside joke where <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> this quotation to each other. According to Burk, [...] "At one point, in a delirious stupor, we realized we had said it so many times that that had to be the song." ...|$|E
500|$|Letters {{began to}} pour in for her {{from all over}} the country. There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for {{reassurance}} that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: [...] "The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They wrote to me in thousands, asking me to confirm these wonderful things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." [...] The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, [...] "This is the only book (and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> this about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards." ...|$|E

500|$|The Phantom Tollbooth {{contains}} {{allusions to}} many works, including those loved by Juster {{in his own}} upbringing. Some of Juster's favorite books as a child, including The Wind in the Willows, had endpaper maps; Juster insisted on one, over Feiffer's opposition, {{going so far as}} to sketch one and require that his collaborator reproduce it in his own style. Juster was also inspired by his father Samuel's love of puns, with which the book is more than sprinkled. In his childhood, Juster spent much time listening to the radio. According to Juster, the need to envision the action when listening to radio serials helped inspire The Phantom Tollbooth, as well as yielding the character of Tock, based on sidekick Jim Fairfield from Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy. Jim gave Tock his wisdom, courage, and adventurous spirit. As a child, Juster had synesthesia, and could only do arithmetic by making associations between numbers and colors. He remembered that the condition affected word associations. [...] "One of the things I always did was think literally when I heard words. On the Lone Ranger [...] <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'Here come the Injuns!' and I always had an image of engines, of train engines." ...|$|E
500|$|Instead, {{the group}} agreed {{to use the}} tour's {{satellite}} dish to conduct live video transmissions between their concerts and Carter in Sarajevo. Carter returned {{to the city and}} was able to assemble a video unit. The band had to purchase a satellite dish to be sent to Sarajevo and had to pay a £100,000 fee to join the European Broadcasting Union. Once set up, the band began satellite link-ups to Sarajevo on a near nightly basis, the first airing on 17 July 1993 in Bologna, Italy. To connect with the EBU satellite feeds, Carter and two co-workers had to traverse [...] "Sniper Alley" [...] at night to reach the Sarajevo television station, and they had to film with as little light as possible to avoid the attention of snipers. This was done a total of ten times {{over the course of a}} month. Carter discussed the deteriorating situation in the city, and Bosnians often spoke to U2 and their audience. These grim interviews deviated from the rest of the show, and they were completely unscripted, leaving the group unsure of who would be speaking or what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> U2 stopped the broadcasts in August 1993 after learning that the siege of Sarajevo was being reported on the front of many British newspapers. Though this trend had begun before the first link-up, Nathan Jackson suggested that U2's actions had brought awareness of the situation to their fans, and to the British public indirectly.|$|E

During the broadcasts, Carter discussed the deteriorating situation in the city, and Bosnians often spoke to U2 and their audience. These grim interviews starkly contrasted with the rest of the show; concerts on the Zoo TV Tour were elaborately staged multimedia events that satirised television and the audience's over-stimulation.
