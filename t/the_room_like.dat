500|$|Lichtenstein's studios {{reference}} {{what are}} known as Matisse's four Symphonic Interiors of 1911 (The Pink Studio, The Painter's Family, Interior with Eggplants, The Red Studio) and an earlier Matisse The Dance. Artist's Studio—Look Mickey was part of a series that included The Artist's Studio [...] with Model, 1974, Artist's Studio, Foot Medication, 1974, Artist's Studio, the [...] "Dance", 1974, Artist's Studio/A Still Life, 1973. Artist's Studio—Look Mickey {{was the only one of}} the five to include a corner of <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>like</b> The Red Studio. Many sources, including Lichtenstein himself only include four works in the series (excluding Artist's Studio/A Still Life, 1973). In a 1995 lecture in conjunction with the Kyoto Prize, he said [...] "I did a series of four large, about 8' x10', paintings of interiors of artists' studios. They were inspired by Matisse's paintings..." [...] Artist's Studio—Look Mickey is regarded as the first of the four Artist's Studio works. From among the Artist's Studio series works, this depicts [...] "the deepest, most plainly articulated interior space." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Armageddon Machine", Keen {{journeys}} {{through the}} giant Armageddon Machine space station, destroying the subsystems {{of the machine}} located in each level. Along the way, he learns that the Shikadi are being led by the [...] "Gannalech". After Keen reaches the final level and destroys the Quantum Explosion Dynamo, the Shikadi flee the station, and Keen looks {{in the control room}} to find out why the Shikadi wanted to destroy the galaxy. There, he finds a note, written in the series' Standard Galactic Alphabet cypher, from the final boss of the Vorticons trilogy: his school rival Mortimer McMire, whose IQ is [...] "a single point higher" [...] than Keen's. The note tells Keen that the McMire killed in the previous game was an android replica, that the [...] "Gannalech" [...] is a mispronunciation of [...] "Grand Intellect", his title from the first trilogy, and that the Armageddon Machine was itself a distraction, as McMire plans on destroying the universe instead. As Keen leaves the command center, the game screen focuses on an abandoned football helmet in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> Keen's, with two Ms on it.|$|E
60|$|The Inspector left <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> a dazed man. They {{could hear}} him giving orders outside.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will do that}} willingly," [...] the {{old woman}} said; [...] "but first, my dears, you must have some rest; come in here." [...] And she {{led the way to}} <b>the</b> next <b>room.</b> [...] "There is a bed for you, Mademoiselle Marie, and one for the two young ones. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> is not <b>like</b> what you are {{accustomed}} to, but I dared not buy finer things, though I had plenty of money from your mother to have furnished <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>like</b> a palace; but you see it would have seemed strange to my neighbours; but, at least, everything is clean and sweet." ...|$|R
60|$|But to Christie {{there was}} only one face worth looking at till David came, and that was Mr. Power's; for he was a perfect host, and pervaded <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>like</b> a genial atmosphere, using the welcome of eye and hand which needs no {{language}} to interpret it, giving to each guest the intellectual fare he loved, and making their enjoyment his own.|$|R
60|$|Then Goguelat {{shook hands}} with me, embraced me again, and I went out of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> sobbing <b>like</b> an infant.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{sound of}} quick {{footsteps}} outside, and Mamie entered <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> a small whirlwind.|$|E
60|$|Miss Trimble's {{right eye}} flashed about <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> a searchlight, {{but she kept}} the other hypnotically on her companion's face.|$|E
60|$|She {{swept into}} <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> a {{battleship}} into action, and let fly her first broadside at Mistress Winthrop from the threshold.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How can it say so, {{when it is}} {{blooming}} in <b>the</b> front <b>room</b> <b>like</b> {{a little}} rose in a demnition flower-pot?' urged Mantalini. 'May its poppet come in and talk?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope {{it keeps}} fine for you," [...] said the relative, and passed from <b>the</b> <b>room</b> looking <b>like</b> {{something}} out of an Edgar Allan Poe story.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mercy on us, my lady, are you ill?" [...] cried Hester, the maid, as her {{mistress}} glided into <b>the</b> <b>room</b> looking <b>like</b> a ghost, {{half an hour}} later.|$|R
60|$|My heart {{gave one}} great bound: I knew {{who it was}} in an instant, and rushed into <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> a mad woman.|$|E
60|$|With {{the sound}} of the word the door burst open, and we fell into <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> an invasion, only to stop dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Weren't the {{performing}} wolves wonderful?" [...] exclaimed Joan in her fresh joyous voice, that rang round <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> laughter of the woodpecker.|$|E
60|$|And even as {{he spoke}} the {{guttering}} tallow candle, swaying in its socket, suddenly went out with a loud splutter and a sizzle that echoed through <b>the</b> desolate <b>room</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> mocking laugh of ghouls.|$|R
2500|$|Members of MCC {{and their}} guests have {{free access to}} <b>the</b> <b>room</b> (there are windows with views of the ground) and will often greet Australian batsmen with [...] "witticisms ... like 'See you soon'". On this point, Australian Justin Langer, {{described}} walking through <b>the</b> Long <b>Room</b> <b>like</b> [...] "being bearhugged by an invisible spirit".|$|R
50|$|There {{was a fire}} in the {{southern}} wing of old monastery on December 6, 1899, that destroyed some of <b>the</b> old <b>rooms,</b> <b>like</b> another smaller cloister, the library, stables and barns, that were not reconstructed, and later, that piece of land was sold.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she answered, and at {{that moment}} Beatrice, pale and troubled, walked into <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>like</b> a lamb to the slaughter.|$|E
60|$|Josie stopped {{astonished}} and startled for a moment, {{and then}} tip-toed out of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> a burglar, and told Mrs. Thatcher all about it.|$|E
6000|$|STEVE. 'On my word of honour--' Here arrives Richardson, {{so anxious}} to come that she is {{propelled}} into <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> a ball. 'What is it?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Chicks that sing on [...] "Friends Like You" [...] {{and made}} <b>the</b> <b>room</b> NOT smell <b>like</b> boy: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We went inside. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> looked <b>like</b> a Broadway stockbroker's--light oak desks, two 'phones, Spanish leather {{upholstered}} {{chairs and}} couches, oil paintings in gilt frames a foot deep and a ticker hitting off {{the news in}} one corner.|$|R
60|$|She {{gathered}} herself together, though bent {{a little}} as from a blow, and, closing the shop door, followed James to <b>the</b> living <b>room,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> inevitable. He was eating his dinner, and seemed oblivious of her entry. There was a smell of Irish stew.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nobody {{seems to}} know. Lupton {{was saying that}} the policemen would wait about in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> {{servants}} till the Emperor and the Princes had gone away.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dinner," [...] said Barker the valet, {{appearing}} {{at the door}} and breaking a silence that seemed to fill <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> a tangible presence, [...] "is served!" ...|$|E
60|$|She turned {{perhaps a}} trifle paler {{than she had}} been hitherto, and her eyes roamed round <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> those of a trapped hare seeking to escape.|$|E
60|$|A tall, slender {{young man}} in black, the Queen's {{attendant}} of that other night of gems--the night of the Grove of Venus--stepped quickly into <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> bowed <b>like</b> a courtier to Madame de la Motte, and presented a note.|$|R
60|$|I {{glanced at}} her husband, who was {{stalking}} grimly about <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> looking <b>like</b> a retired soldier with the gout; and I thought that {{to be in the}} society of such a person was enough to make anyone miserable.|$|R
60|$|This is a beastly place, with a {{very good}} hotel. Except Preston, {{it is one of}} the nastiest places I know. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> is <b>like</b> a capacious coal cellar, and is {{incredibly}} filthy; but for sound it is perfect.|$|R
60|$|JOANNA (wandering about <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>like</b> one {{renewing}} {{acquaintance with}} it {{after returning from}} a journey). Hadn't we better go to bed? It must be getting late.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} the muffled whining changed {{suddenly}} {{to a series}} of tenor shrieks, and the India-rubber form of Sammy bounded into <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> an excited kangaroo.|$|E
60|$|He saw the rector {{sitting at}} a desk writing. There was a skull {{on the desk and}} a strange solemn smell in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>like</b> the old leather of chairs.|$|E
60|$|The latter {{had pushed}} his chair impatiently aside {{and now was}} pacing up and down <b>the</b> narrow <b>room</b> <b>like</b> some caged feline {{creature}} waiting for its meal.

50|$|Victor RoscovichA {{crew member}} who was {{detained}} after <b>the</b> engine <b>room</b> sabotage. <b>Like</b> Allen, there's not much known about him.|$|R
5000|$|... "Putting on the meets is a {{labor of}} love. We give thanks to all who participated and to all who came to spectate - except {{to the guy who}} threw up in the sink in <b>the</b> men's <b>room.</b> <b>Like</b> us, he has got to clean up his act." ...|$|R
