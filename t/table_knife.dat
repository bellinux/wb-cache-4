It was believed that the suitcase was owned by the man found on the beach. In the case were a red checked dressing gown; a size seven, red felt pair of slippers; four pairs of underpants; pyjamas; shaving items; a light brown pair of trousers with sand in the cuffs; an electrician's screwdriver; a <b>table</b> <b>knife</b> cut down into a short sharp instrument; {{a pair of scissors}} with sharpened points; a small square of zinc thought to have been used as a protective sheath for the knife and scissors and a stencilling brush, as used by third officers on merchant ships for stencilling cargo.|$|E

2500|$|Zero-tolerance {{policies}} have been adopted in schools and other education venues around the world. These policies are usually promoted as preventing drug abuse, violence, and gang activity in schools. In schools, common zero-tolerance policies concern possession or use of drugs or weapons. Students and, sometimes staff, parents, and other visitors, who possess a banned item or perform any prohibited action for any reason are automatically punished. School administrators are barred from using their judgment, reducing severe punishments to be proportional to minor offenses, or considering extenuating circumstances. For example, the policies treat possession of a knife identically, {{regardless of whether the}} knife is a blunt <b>table</b> <b>knife</b> being used to eat a meal, a craft knife used in an art class, or switchblade with no reasonable practical or educational value. Consequently, these policies are sometimes derided as [...] "zero-intelligence policies".|$|E

Dick complied, beating the accent, Indian fashion, with stiff-legged hops and hand-slaps on thighs.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{alternatives}} to using a pastry blender.

60|$|While Kipps was rereading the begging {{letters and}} wishing {{he had the}} sound, clear common sense of Buggins to help him a little, the Parcels Post brought along the box from his uncle. It was a large, {{insecure}} looking case held together by a few still loyal nails, and by what the British War Office would have recognised at once as an Army Corps of string, rags and odds and ends tied together. Kipps unpacked it with a <b>table</b> <b>knife,</b> assisted at a critical point by the poker, and found {{a number of books}} and other objects of an antique type.|$|E

But we was both handy with our fists. We kep' at it for about half an hour. Smashed all the furniture, an' would have smashed the winders too, {{but there was only}} one, an' it was a skylight. In the middle of it the door was burst open, an' in rushed half a dozen bobbies, who {{put a stop to it}} at once.|$|E
50|$|Specialized steak knives {{emerged in}} America {{following}} World War II. Prior to World War I, all <b>table</b> <b>knives</b> were sharp, but required frequent upkeep—sharpening and polishing. With {{the decline in}} domestic workers (household servants), this upkeep became less feasible. Stainless steel became widespread following World War I, which did not require polishing, but did require sharpening due to manufacturing limits. Following World War II, serrated stainless steel steak knives were introduced which required neither polishing nor frequent sharpening, and proved an instant hit. In the 1950s heat treatment of stainless steel was introduced, allowing knives to remain sufficiently sharp without needing serrations, but by this point serrated steak knives had become well-established and continued to be used.|$|R
5000|$|A short {{dough is}} one that is crumbly or mealy. The {{opposite}} of a short dough is a [...] "long" [...] dough or dough that stretches. Vegetable shortening (or butter, or other solid fats) can produce both types of dough; the difference is in technique. To produce a short dough, which is commonly used for tarts, the shortening is cut into the flour with a pastry blender, pair of <b>table</b> <b>knives,</b> fingers, or other utensil until the resulting mixture has a fine, cornmeal-like texture. For a long dough, the shortening is cut in only until the pea-sized crumbs are formed, or even larger lumps may be included. After cutting in the fat, the liquid (if any) is added and the dough is shaped for baking.|$|R

60|$|As I wish {{to confine}} myself {{in this chapter}} to the primary point of the plain {{existence}} of sanity and insanity, I will not be led along any of the attractive paths that open here. I shall endeavour {{to deal with them}} in the next chapter. Here I confine myself to a sort of summary. Suppose a man's throat has been cut, quite swiftly and suddenly, with a <b>table</b> <b>knife,</b> at a small table where we sit. The whole of civil law rests on the supposition that we are witnesses; that we saw it; and if we do not know about it, who does? Now suppose all the witnesses fall into a quarrel about degrees of eyesight. Suppose one says he had brought his reading-glasses instead of his usual glasses; and therefore did not see the man fall across the table and cover it with blood. Suppose another says he could not be certain it was blood, because a slight colour-blindness was hereditary in his family. Suppose a third says he cannot swear to the uplifted knife, because his oculist tells him he is astigmatic, and vertical lines do not affect him as do horizontal lines. Suppose another says that dots have often danced before his eyes in very fantastic combinations, many of which were very like one gentleman cutting another gentleman's throat at dinner. All these things refer to real experiences. There {{is such a thing as}} myopia; there is such a thing as colour-blindness; there is such a thing as astigmatism; there is such a thing as shifting shapes swimming before the eyes. But what should we think of a whole dinner party that could give nothing except these highly scientific explanations when found in company with a corpse? I imagine there are only two things we could think: either that they were all drunk, or they were all murderers.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of a <b>table</b> <b>knife</b> is a blunt or rounded end.

[...] A member of the hotel's staff told Miller that the people {{involved}} in the violence, who were wearing hotel uniforms, did not in fact work for the hotel. Her attackers accused al-Obeidi of being a [...] "traitor to Gaddafi"; two women grabbed <b>table</b> <b>knives</b> to threaten both her and the journalists, one then throwing a blanket over al-Obeidi's head in an attempt to muffle her. She had specifically asked to speak to Reuters and The New York Times; Michael Georgy of Reuters was able to talk to her briefly before she was taken away. She was finally subdued, dragged out of the hotel, and driven in an unmarked car to an unknown location.|$|R

50|$|The {{extent of}} the Hawley Collection was matched by {{the extent of his}} {{knowledge}} regarding it. It comprises over 70,000 tools, mostly but not entirely from Sheffield, as well as catalogues and other documents. The tools include many examples of such things as planes, <b>table</b> <b>knives,</b> anvils, files, taps and dies, rules, micrometers, scissors, hammers, handsaws, and vernier and caliper gauges. He stored these in two garden sheds, then in his garage. The garage was eventually turned into a two-storey building to provide more space, and he also used his attic as well as space begged from other people.Hawley spread his knowledge among a team of volunteers who both assisted in cataloguing the collection and in some cases became experts in their own right. He also co-authored books on various aspects of the Sheffield steel industries and took part in many interviews that have since been transcribed.|$|R

50|$|Yoshida Metal Industry Co. Ltd. was {{established}} in 1954 as a western tableware manufacturer in Niigata prefecture famous for producing hollow handled <b>table</b> <b>knives</b> for Western markets. In 1960 Yoshikin introduced the Bunmei series of knives, traditional Japanese looking knives, that used a new alloy of steel, able to be sharpened like carbon steel, but {{with a mixture of}} molybdenum and vanadium that made the steel more resistant to rust (now known colloquially as Japanese steel). In 1983, Yoshikin hired a Japanese industrial designer, Komin Yamada, to create a modern designed knife that combined these two manufacturing techniques. With an almost unlimited budget he was able to fashion a series of kitchen knives which would appeal to the professional and amateur chief alike, be comfortable and easy to handle, and meet their most demanding requirements. In 1985 Global knives were then launched onto the international market, starting with Germany.|$|R
50|$|The {{horizontal}} shaft towards the chapel progressed 4 m (13 ft) before they hit rock {{too hard to}} dig. They then decided to dig upwards towards the chapel floor. From here the tunnel continued underneath the wooden floor of the chapel for a distance of 13.5 m (44.3 ft). To do this, seven heavy oak timbers in the floor, measuring 0.5 m (1.3 ft) square, had to be cut through. Homemade saws, assembled from German <b>table</b> <b>knives,</b> were employed for this task. With this completed, the tunnel dropped vertically from {{the far corner of}} the chapel a further 5.2 m (17 ft). The tunnel then proceeded out towards the proposed exit with two further descents, separated by shafts in the tough stone foundations of the castle. The tunnel now ran a horizontal distance of 44 m (144 ft), reaching a final depth of 8.6 m (28.2 ft) below the ground.|$|R

5000|$|The {{origins of}} the company go back to {{approximately}} 1845 in Sheffield, the cutlery capital of England, where 100 years working within the electroplate trade began.

Tom Land took over the business from his father which had by then become Henry Land & Co dealing with silver plate & gilding.
