5|$|Alfie Karmal, {{the son of}} a Palestinian {{father and}} Greek mother, was <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than Mills when they met in 1986. Karmal bought her new clothes and Cartier jewellery, and paid for {{cosmetic}} surgery to her breasts. Karmal, who had moved into the computer industry, set up a model agency for her, ExSell Management, although it was not successful. In 1987, Mills went to live in Paris, telling Karmal that a cosmetics company had given her a modelling contract, but became the mistress of millionaire Lebanese businessman George Kazan for two years and took part in a photo session for a stills-only German sex education manual called Die Freuden der Liebe (The Joys of Love).|$|E
5|$|The {{summer after}} graduation, Baker toured Europe as a celebrity {{correspondent}} for The New York Times, where {{he wrote about}} events like the Henley Royal Regatta. Through his Princeton classmates, {{he was hired by}} Wall Street insurance firm Johnson & Higgins upon his return to the United States. Soon after, another Princeton graduate offered him a job at J.P. Morgan Bank. Hired onto a two-year trainee program, Baker earned about $20 per week. Baker befriended a rich New York socialite, Percy R. Pyne II, who had also attended St. Paul's and Princeton. Though <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than Baker, they quickly became friends and Pyne allowed Baker to stay at his house at 263 Madison Avenue. Pyne later introduced Baker to Jeanne Marie Scott, a socialite known as Mimi, to whom Baker was briefly engaged late in 1918. A quiet individual, Baker was embarrassed when bank executives brought important clients by his office to see him. He quickly tired of working in an office job, and looked for ways to alleviate his boredom.|$|E

In 1950 the two writers settled in Taormina, Sicily, in a house where the author D. H. Lawrence had once lived. <b>Ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than Capote, Dunphy {{was in many ways}} Capote’s opposite, as solitary as Capote was exuberantly social.

According to Deno John Geanakoplos, Michael's ancestry could be traced back to all three {{imperial}} houses that ruled the empire in the centuries before the capture of Constantinople in 1204 by the Fourth Crusade. His mother {{does not appear to have}} played a significant role in his early life; at least for a time he was brought up by his elder sister Martha, the wife of megas domestikos Nikephoros Tarchaneiotes, although she was only <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than he.|$|E

His superiors found uses for his talents, resulting in a series of transfers that brought him special training courses designed to produce a nucleus of officers to deal with the problems of military government after the Allies had defeated the Axis powers. He eventually secured an assignment with the Intelligence Corps and additional training. His military career continued with assignment to the War Office in Whitehall, where he was attached to the section known as Military Intelligence (Liaison), and later—for a short time—to the Cabinet Office to serve on the Secretariat of the Joint Intelligence Committee, securing promotions along the way.|$|E

25|$|By {{the spring}} of 1907 {{when he began to}} paint Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, until its {{completion}} later in the year, Picasso was vying with Matisse for the preeminent position of being the perceived new leader of Modern painting. Upon its completion the shock and the impact of the painting propelled Picasso into the center of controversy and all but knocked Matisse and Fauvism off the map, virtually ending the movement by the following year. In 1907 Picasso joined the art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (1884–1979). Kahnweiler was a German art historian, art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century. He became prominent in Paris beginning in 1907 for being among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, and especially his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Before 1910 Picasso was already being {{recognized as one of the}} important leaders of Modern art alongside Henri Matisse who had been the undisputed leader of Fauvism and who was more than <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than he was and his contemporaries the Fauvist André Derain and the former Fauvist and fellow Cubist, Georges Braque.|$|E
25|$|After her divorce, Maria Pavlovna {{continued}} to work in Paris, but she moved to Boulogne, the south west suburb of Paris, where many Russians had taken residence. She began an affair with the famous fashion designer Jean Patou, who was <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than her and with a large fortune. They lived with great luxury appearing together in Parisian society events and spending time in Biarritz, Deauville and on the French Riviera. Rumors of a possible marriage between them spread in 1925, but Patou, a consummated bachelor, was reluctant to change his lifestyle. In 1926, Kitmirs business began to decline. In 1928, as embroidery began {{to be out of}} fashion, Maria Pavlovva sold her workshop. Having suffered a defeat, but not surrendering, the grand duchess moved to London in the spring 1928 where she started selling her own perfume, Prince Igor, {{following in the footsteps of}} Chanel No. 5 and Patou's perfume Joy. Failings in advertising and distribution made that Prince Igor was not a success. Undeterred, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna emigrated to the United States hoping for a new start. On 8 December 1928, she set sail for America from Le Havre.|$|E

[...] Schottlaender was <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than Bond and had travelled, and the teenaged Bond became fascinated by him, breaking off her previous relationship. Under Schottlaender's tutelage, Bond's voice developed rapidly, and she soon became the leading contralto soloist at the Seel Street Benedictine Church (now known as St. Peter's Catholic Church) in the same city. Her father's enquiries revealed that Schottlaender was a [...] "bad lot", and he forbade any engagement until Bond was older.|$|E
500|$|Tankersley {{divorced}} Miller in 1951 {{to marry}} Garvin E. [...] "Tank" [...] Tankersley, {{an editor at}} the Washington Times-Herald <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than she was. Garvin Tankersley had started his news career as a photographer. He was the managing editor when he left the paper in 1952. The couple met while Bazy was running the Times-Herald, but Robert McCormick, Bazy's uncle and owner of the newspaper, considered Garvin Tankersley to be of unsuitable social status for Bazy because [...] "Tank" [...] was from a poor Lynchburg, Virginia, family. [...] McCormick also disapproved of her divorce. [...] Bazy saw the latter stance as hypocritical, given McCormick's own complicated personal life. McCormick's attempts to end the relationship ultimately prompted the couple to elope, and the Tankersleys were married for 45 years until Garvin's death in 1997.|$|E
500|$|The two {{defensive}} {{towers of}} the southern city gate appearing in the left foreground, {{are known to be}} much older than the painting but their history remains poorly documented. [...] The outer tower (Yttre Söderport) was built on an artificial island in the strait and was rebuilt in front of an expected attack by King Christian II of Denmark in the late 1520s. [...] In Blodbadstavlan ("The Bloodbath Painting"), an image <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than Vädersolstavlan, it appears with a cone-shaped roof seriously damaged during the Danish assault. [...] In Vädersolstavlan, the inner tower (Inre Söderport) is similar to the exterior tower, and both structures, together with the narrow bridge between them, match other historical sources. Additions younger than the 1530s, such as the reinforcements ordered by Gustav Vasa during the 1540s, are missing in the painting but present in engravings from 1560 to 1580, which confirms Vädersolstavlan is a credible contemporary document.|$|E

A source told the magazine: [...] "Tash sets her sights on somebody who isn't necessarily good for her." [...] They added that Natasha is in a reckless frame of mind, which leads to more conflict with her father. In an attempt to impress Ivan and to show how mature she is, Natasha sends him [...] "raunchy photos" [...] of herself.

500|$|Brigitte François-Sappey {{points out}} the {{frequency}} with which Alkan has been compared to Berlioz, both by his contemporaries and later. She mentions that Hans von Bülow called him [...] "the Berlioz of the piano", while Schumann, in criticising the Op. 15 Romances, claimed that Alkan merely [...] "imitated Berlioz on the piano." [...] She further notes that Ferruccio Busoni repeated the comparison with Berlioz in a draft (but unpublished) monograph, while Kaikhosru Sorabji commented that Alkan's Op. 61 Sonatine was like [...] "a Beethoven sonata written by Berlioz". Berlioz was <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than Alkan, but did not attend the Conservatoire until 1826. The two were acquainted, and were perhaps both influenced by the unusual ideas and style of Anton Reicha who taught at the Conservatoire from 1818 to 1836, and by the sonorities of the composers of the period of the French Revolution. They both created individual, indeed, idiosyncratic sound-worlds in their music; there are, however, major differences between them. Alkan, unlike Berlioz, remained closely dedicated to the German musical tradition; his style and composition were heavily determined by his pianism, whereas Berlioz could hardly play at the keyboard and wrote nothing for piano solo. Alkan's works therefore also include miniatures and (among his early works) salon music, genres which Berlioz avoided.|$|E
500|$|In 1934, Birkett {{acted as}} {{counsel for the}} second of the two Brighton trunk murders, a case which was {{described}} as [...] "his greatest triumph in a capital case". In June 1934, a woman's torso was found in a suitcase in Brighton railway station. The legs were discovered at King's Cross station the next day, but her head and arms were never found, and the case is still unsolved. A woman by the name of Violette Kaye had disappeared, and the appearance of the first woman's body prompted greater scrutiny on Kaye's case. On 14 July, they interviewed Toni Mancini, Kaye's boyfriend, who convinced them that the dead woman could not possibly be Kaye; the dead woman had been identified as around thirty five years old and five months pregnant, while Kaye was <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>older.</b> Kaye was last seen alive on 10 May looking distressed in the doorway to her house and had been scheduled to visit her sister in London who received a telegram on 11 May reading [...] "Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. Vi." [...] in block capitals. The post office clerks could not remember who sent it, but experts testified that the handwriting on the telegram had similarities to that on a menu written by Mancini. On 14 May, with the help of another man, Mancini moved his belongings from the house he shared with Kaye, which included a large trunk which was too heavy to move by hand. Mancini had told people that he had broken up with Kaye and she had moved to Paris, and that before she left he had beaten her. He later said to a friend, [...] "What is the good of knocking a woman about with your fists? You only hurt yourself. You should hit her with a hammer same as I did and [...] her up." [...] A hammerhead was later found in the rubbish at his old house.|$|E
