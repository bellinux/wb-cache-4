40|$|The {{effects of}} {{stacking}} interactions on the oxidation potentials of single strand oligonucleotides containing {{up to four}} consecutive adenines, alternated with <b>thymines</b> and cytosines in different sequences and ratios, have been determined by means of differential pulse voltammetry. Voltammetric measurements point toward the establishment in solution of structured oligonucleotide conformations, in which the nucleobases are well stacked altogether. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm that finding, indicating that single strands assume geometrical parameters characteristic of the B-DNA form.

40|$|Cations {{play a very}} {{important}} role in structural stabilization of various unusual DNA structures. Quadruplexes are a class of unusual DNA structures which are formed by number of single stranded DNA molecules associating by Hoogsteen base pairing. These structures are rich in guanines and there is strong evidence to support that they are formed at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. G-quadruplex structures are intimately related to the monovalent cations like sodium and potassium, which are physiologically abundant. The role of these monovalent cations and the effect of substituting terminal <b>thymines</b> with adenines was investigated by multinuclear NMR. The role of terminal <b>thymines</b> in G-quadruplex structure has been established before, but the substitution of <b>thymines</b> and adenines has been dealt here for the first time. The exchange kinetics of cation e. g. 23 Na+ from the quadruplex core is determined by the terminal nucleotides present in the oligonucleotide sequence. The sequences d(AAGGGGA), d(AGGGGA) and d(AAGGGGAA) were used to investigate the exchange kinetics of cations from the quadruplex core. Cations bind to the quadruplex structures in namely two ways, weak electrostatic binding and specific binding inside. The flanking adenines slow down the exchange kinetics of the cations from the quadruplex core. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{nucleobases}} {{are classified}} into two types: the purines, A and G, being fused five- and six-membered heterocyclic compounds, and the pyrimidines, the six-membered rings C and T. A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, uracil (U), usually takes {{the place of}} <b>thymine</b> in RNA and differs from <b>thymine</b> by lacking a methyl group on its ring. In addition to RNA and DNA, many artificial nucleic acid analogues have been created to study the properties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe study {{addresses}} interconnected {{issues related}} to two major types of cycloadditions between adjacent <b>thymines</b> in DNA leading to cyclobutane dimers (T Ts) and (6 - 4) adducts. Experimental results are obtained for the single strand (dT) 20 by steady-state and time-resolved optical spectroscopy, {{as well as by}} HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry. Calculations are carried out for the dinucleoside monophosphate in water using the TD-M 052 X method and including the polarizable continuum model; the reliability of TD-M 052 X is checked against CASPT 2 calculations regarding the behavior of two stacked <b>thymines</b> in the gas phase. It is shown that irradiation at the main absorption band leads to cyclobutane dimers (T Ts) and (6 - 4) adducts via different electronic excited states. T Ts are formed via 1 ππ* excitons; [2 + 2] dimerization proceeds along a barrierless path, in line with the constant quantum yield (0. 05) with the irradiation wavelength, the contribution of the 3 ππ* state to this reaction being less than 10 %. The formation of oxetane, the reaction intermediate leading to (6 - 4) adducts, occurs via charge transfer excited states involving two stacked <b>thymines,</b> whose fingerprint is detected in the fluorescence spectra; it involves an energy barrier explaining the important decrease in the quantum yield of (6 - 4) adducts with the irradiation wavelength...|$|R

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits, each composed of: a five-carbon sugar (2'-deoxyribose), a phosphate group, {{and one of the}} four bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and <b>thymine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two {{chains of}} DNA twist {{around each other}} to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar {{backbone}} spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to <b>thymine</b> and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and <b>thymine</b> align to form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, NASA {{scientists}} reported that, for {{the first}} time, complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and <b>thymine,</b> have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites.

40|$|An oligodeoxyribonucleotide, d(GCTCACAAT-X-ATTGTGAGC), where X {{represents}} a hexaethylene glycol chain, was studied using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Its conformation and conformational stability {{were compared to}} those of compounds where X was replaced by four <b>thymines</b> and to the duplex of same sequence without loop.

In both cases the duplex region of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide exhibits the same conformation. In similar conditions the oligodeoxyribonucleotide with a four <b>thymines</b> loop forms exclusively a hairpin structure. Comparison between the thermodynamic parameters (delta H, delta S, delta G) associated with the formation {{of the structure of the}} three compounds are presented. In the case of the compound with the hexaethylene glycol chain it is shown that the large increase in its melting temperature (by about 35 degrees C in our experimental conditions) when compared to the non looped structure is mainly due to the fact that its melting process is intramolecular (monomolecular) whereas the other one is bimolecular...|$|R
50|$|Origins in {{budding yeast}} {{are defined by}} the {{autonomously}} replicating sequence (ARS), a short stretch of DNA (100-200 bp) that can initiate replication when transferred to any sequence of DNA. The ARS contains several specific sequence elements. One {{of these is the}} A element (ACS), an 11 bp consensus sequence rich in adenines and <b>thymines</b> that is essential for initiation. Single base-pair mutations in the ACS can abolish initiation activity. The ORC, a component of the initiation complex, binds the ACS in vivo throughout the cell cycle, and in vitro in an ATP dependent manner. When a few of these sequences are deleted, DNA is still copied from other intact origins, but when many are deleted, chromosome replication slows down dramatically. Still, presence of an ACS sequence is not sufficient to identify an origin of replication. Only about 30% of ACS sequences present in the genome are the sites of initiation activity. Origins in fission yeast contain long stretches of DNA rich in <b>thymines</b> and adenines that are important for origin function, but do not exhibit strong sequence similarity.|$|R
5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} usually develop {{resistance to}} linezolid {{as the result}} of a point mutation known as G2576T, in which a guanine base is replaced with <b>thymine</b> in base pair 2576 of the genes coding for 23S ribosomal RNA. This is the most common mechanism of resistance in staphylococci, and the only one known to date in isolates of E. faecium. Other mechanisms have been identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae (including mutations in an RNA methyltransferase that methylates G2445 of the 23S rRNA and mutations causing increased expression of ABC transporter genes) and in Staphylococcus epidermidis.|$|E
5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or <b>thymine</b> (T) — a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined {{to one another in}} a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|E
5|$|In a DNA double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to <b>thymine</b> in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{complete}} {{sequence of the}} mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Atelura formicaria (Hexapoda: Zygentoma) is described. The molecule is 15. 205 bp in length {{and it is the}} third complete mt genome sequenced from the Zygentoma. The genome organization conforms with the putative ancestral insect gene arrangement. All protein coding genes use standard initiation codons (methionine and isoleucine). The exception is nad 4 that starts with GTG, a codon used for this purpose in other insect species. A peculiar strand skew bias is observed, given that the PCGs encoded on the J-strand contain more <b>thymines</b> than adenines and more cytosines than guanines. This trend in nucleotide composition has been observed also in the “firebrat” Thermobia domestica (Zygentoma, Lepismatidae), but differs from that of the majority of hexapod species, including Tricholepidion gertschi (Zygentoma, Lepidotrichidae), where adenines and cytosines outnumber <b>thymines</b> and guanines. The presence of structural elements in the control region is also discussed, with emphasis on their potential implications in the regulation of replication and/or transcription of the mitochondrial genome.

5|$|To furnish a {{functional}} oligonucleotide, all the protecting groups {{have to be}} removed. The N-acyl base protection and the 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection may be, and is often removed simultaneously by treatment with inorganic bases or amines. However, the applicability of this method {{is limited by the}} fact that the cleavage of 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection gives rise to acrylonitrile as a side product. Under the strong basic conditions required for the removal of N-acyl protection, acrylonitrile is capable of alkylation of nucleic bases, primarily, at the N3-position of <b>thymine</b> and uracil residues to give the respective N3-(2-cyanoethyl) adducts via Michael reaction. The formation of these side products may be avoided by treating the solid support-bound oligonucleotides with solutions of bases in an organic solvent, for instance, with 50% triethylamine in acetonitrile or 10% diethylamine in acetonitrile. This treatment is strongly recommended for medium- and large scale preparations and is optional for syntheses on small scale where the concentration of acrylonitrile generated in the deprotection mixture is low.|$|E
5|$|DNA can {{be damaged}} by many sorts of mutagens, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include {{oxidizing}} agents, alkylating agents and also high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of DNA damage produced {{depends on the}} type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing <b>thymine</b> dimers, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks. A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage. Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations, insertions, deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal translocations. These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. DNA damages that are naturally occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging.|$|E
5|$|Translesion {{synthesis}} (TLS) is a DNA {{damage tolerance}} process {{that allows the}} DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as <b>thymine</b> dimers or AP sites. It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases (i.e. DNA polymerase IV or V, from the Y Polymerase family), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The polymerase switching {{is thought to be}} mediated by, among other factors, the post-translational modification of the replication processivity factor PCNA. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, Pol η mediates error-free bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation, whereas Pol ι introduces mutations at these sites. Pol η is known to add the first adenine across the T^T photodimer using Watson-Crick base pairing and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using Hoogsteen base pairing. From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death. In short, the process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication. For example, Human DNA polymerase eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine-thymine intra-strand crosslink, GT, although can cause targeted and semi-targeted mutations. Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in Escherichia coli by replicating a GT-modified plasmid in E. coli with specific DNA polymerase knockouts. Viability was very low in a strain lacking pol II, pol IV, and pol V, the three SOS-inducible DNA polymerases, indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases.|$|E
