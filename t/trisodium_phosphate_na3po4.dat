50|$|Sodium {{phosphide}} is the {{inorganic compound}} with the formula Na3P. It {{is a black}} solid. It {{is often described as}} Na+ salt of the P3− anion. Na3P is a source of the highly reactive phosphide anion. It {{should not be confused with}} sodium <b>phosphate,</b> <b>Na3PO4.</b>|$|R

50|$|Products sold as TSP substitute, {{containing}} {{soda ash}} and zeolites, are promoted {{as a direct}} substitute. However, sodium carbonate is not as strongly basic as <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> making it less effective in demanding applications.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the activity {{as a catalyst}} of sodium phosphate compounds to produce methyl esters of rapeseed oil. The {{research shows that the}} transesterification of rapeseed oil by methyl alcohol could be efficiently catalyzed by both anhydrous and hydrated <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> while polytrisodium phosphate has only a negligible catalytic activity. <b>Trisodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> catalysts are less active than sodium hydroxide due to the lower ability to form sodium methoxide. However, these catalysts can lead to decreasing the number of technological stages and the amount of unwanted waste products. The experimental data are interpreted by using a kinetic model showing that a first-order reaction with respect to glycerides concentration is adequate to describe the reaction.

5000|$|<b>Trisodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> was at {{one time}} {{extensively}} used in formulations {{for a variety of}} consumer grade soaps and detergents, and the most common use for <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> has been in cleaning agents. The pH of a 1% solution is 12 (i.e., very basic), and the solution is sufficiently alkaline to saponify grease and oils. In combination with surfactants, TSP is an excellent agent for cleaning everything from laundry to concrete driveways. This versatility and low manufacturing price made TSP the basis for a plethora of cleaning products sold in the mid-20th century. TSP is still sold and used as a cleaning agent but since the late 1960s its use has diminished in the United States and many {{other parts of the world}} because, like many phosphate-based cleaners, it is known to cause extensive eutrophication of lakes and rivers once it enters a water system.

40|$|Treatments of tubers with {{chemical}} disinfectants (70 % ethanol, 1 % sodium hypochlorite, 2 % copper sulphate, 5 % peracetic acid, 10 % hydrogen peroxide, 1 % MennoClean (benzoic acid), 5 % <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> and 0. 2 % caffeine) were evaluated {{for control of}} blackleg caused by ‘D. solani’. All disinfectants effectively killed bacteria in axenic cultures within 5 min and all, except hydrogen peroxide and <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> were able to kill ‘D. solani’ in spiked potato extracts. Treatments with all disinfectants except <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> reduced the pathogen populations on the periderm of tubers previously inoculated by dipping in a suspension of ‘D. solani’, when the disinfectant was applied for at least 15 min. However, in replicated greenhouse experiments, treatments with all disinfectants except hydrogen peroxide and caffeine resulted in phytotoxicity, reducing sprouting of tubers with 10 – 100 %. Sodium hypochlorite and MennoClean were selected for further studies. Treatments of inoculated tubers with these disinfectants prevented developing of soft rot symptoms on tubers when subjected to favourable rotting conditions. In replicated greenhouse experiments, inoculated tubers treated with sodium hypochlorite and MennoClean reduced the blackleg disease incidences from 50 % to 0 % and to 5 %, respectively, and symptomless infection of potato stems from 93 % to 0 % and to 5 %, respectively.

40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 617 – 622 The {{effectiveness}} of treatments for {{the reduction of}} Listeria monocytogenes surface-inoculated in chicken breast meat was investigated.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to monitor the {{antibacterial}} effect of seven phosphate salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0. 1 - 2. 0 % (wt v; 1) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA 68 and HEXA 70, <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values...|$|R
