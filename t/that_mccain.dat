5|$|The Senate Ethics Committee did not pursue, {{for lack}} of jurisdiction, any {{possible}} ethics breaches in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because they occurred while McCain was in the House. The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said that it too lacked jurisdiction, because McCain {{was no longer in}} the House. It said it did not require <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> amend his existing financial disclosure forms for his House years, on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> had now fully reimbursed Keating's company.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 2000s (decade), the {{increased}} Indian gaming <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> had helped bring about was a $23billion industry. He was twice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, in 1995–1997 and 2005–2007, and his Committee helped expose the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal. By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that would limit creation of off-reservation casinos, as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos.|$|E

5|$|After 1999, {{the only}} member of the Keating Five {{remaining}} in the U.S. Senate was John McCain, who had an easier time gaining re-election in 1992 than he anticipated. He survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press. McCain subsequently ran for president in 2000 and became the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. During the 2000s, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated the contention <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target. Glenn's inclusion in the investigation has been attributed to Republicans who were angered by the inclusion of McCain, as well as committee members who thought that dropping Glenn (and McCain) would make it look bad for the remaining three Democratic Senators.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the earlier}} {{opposition}} from conservatives, in April 2008, {{there were signs}} that the Republican Party base was coalescing behind McCain's candidacy. A CBS News/New York Times poll showed <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> was viewed favorably by 78 percent of conservatives, and unfavorably by only 18 percent. This was the same percentage who had an unfavorable opinion of George W. Bush {{at the same time}} in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Lipstick on a pig: Obama {{used this}} phrase to insinuate that any changes <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> was advocating from the {{policies}} of George W. Bush would only be slight modifications of Bush's policies but the underlying policies would be the same, and in Obama's opinion, bad. Some called it sexist, claiming it was a reference to Sarah Palin, who cracked a joke during the Republican convention that {{the only difference between}} a hockey mom and a pit bull is lipstick.|$|E
25|$|In February 2009, a judge {{rejected}} motions made by {{the legal}} team for McCain and the Republican National Committee to dismiss the Browne lawsuit which charged possible copyright infringement, false endorsement and violation of Browne's right of publicity. The case was {{settled out of court}} for an undisclosed sum in July 2009, with the McCain campaign, the Ohio Republican Party, and the Republican National Committee issuing a joint apology for using the song. Their statement declared <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> himself had been unaware of the use and did not condone it.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} {{results have}} not been released, and some media have reported <b>that</b> John <b>McCain</b> won, <b>that</b> Ron Paul took second, and that Mitt Romney took a distant third. A slate of uncommitted delegates running on a pro-life platform was the overall winner.|$|R

5000|$|Bruce Merrill, {{professor}} {{of media and}} mass communications at Arizona State University, claimed, [...] "I really think <b>that</b> <b>McCains</b> negativism, the attack mode was {{one that does not}} play well with women and independents." [...] Many observers felt that Obama had to simply avoid stumbles or mistakes in order to succeed in the debate. This was reflected in another professors sentiments: [...] "I didnt think Obama was as comfortable this time as he was in the other two debates, but I didnt really hear any gaffe, any major mistake," [...] said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Sabato added, [...] "he might even be judged the winner." [...] Times Mark Halperin graded McCains performance an A- and Obamas performance a B.|$|R
25|$|In May 2007, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> had missed 42 consecutive votes (five straight weeks) in the Senate while he was conducting his presidential campaign. From March to May, McCain only attended three-floor votes in the Senate, though none of McCain's missed votes altered a bill's fate. According to Washington Post statistics, McCain missed more votes than any Senator including Tim Johnson, who missed many votes after suffering a brain hemorrhage in December 2006. As of August 2008, McCain had missed 63.8% of votes in the 110th Congress during his campaign. Because of their majority status, Senate Democrats could sometimes delay votes {{in order to accommodate}} the schedules of Democratic presidential candidates.|$|E
25|$|George W. Bush {{had become}} {{increasingly}} unpopular by 2006. Polls consistently showed that his approval ratings among American voters had averaged around 30 percent. In March 2008, Bush endorsed McCain at the White House, but Bush {{did not make}} a single appearance for McCain during the campaign. Bush appeared at the 2008 GOP convention only through a live video broadcast. He chose not to appear in person due to disaster events in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav. Although he supported the war in Iraq, McCain made an effort to show that he had disagreed with Bush on many other key issues such as climate change. During the entire general election campaign, Obama countered by pointing out in ads and at numerous campaign rallies <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> had claimed {{in an interview that he}} voted with Bush 90% of the time, and congressional voting records supported this for the years Bush was in office.|$|E
500|$|DeConcini later charged <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> had {{leaked to}} the press {{sensitive}} information about the investigation that came {{from some of the}} closed proceedings of the Ethics Committee. McCain denied doing so under oath, although several press reports concluded <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> {{had been one of the}} main leakers during that time. The GAO investigator later said, [...] "There is absolutely no doubt in my mind <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> made those leaks." [...] Vice chair Rudman stated in his 1996 autobiography <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> and his staff were responsible for some of the leaks, but later repudiated the assertion.|$|E
25|$|On March 4, 2008, Huckabee {{withdrew from}} seeking the {{candidacy}} {{as it became}} apparent he would lose in Texas, where {{he had hoped to}} win, and <b>that</b> John <b>McCain</b> would get the 1,191 delegates required to win the Republican nomination.

50|$|Often {{concerned}} with problems regarding West Florida, {{he had a}} major role in 1810 in negotiations which led to the peaceful occupation of part of <b>that</b> territory. <b>McCain</b> (1967) concludes <b>that</b> Holmes' success was not based on brilliance, but upon kindness, unselfishness, persuasiveness, courage, honesty, diplomacy, and intelligence.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the most}} Republican {{district}} in Wisconsin. George W. Bush carried the district in 2004 with 63% of the vote. The 5th District was the only district in Wisconsin <b>that</b> John <b>McCain</b> won in 2008, giving 57.73% of the vote to McCain and 41.28% to Barack Obama.|$|R

500|$|McCain {{finally did}} {{announce}} he would campaign for Bush, {{in a joint}} appearance with him on May 9, but {{did not use the}} actual word [...] "endorse" [...] until reporters pressed him to do so. [...] The Guardian characterized the endorsement as [...] "tepid" [...] and said <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> [...] "betrayed little outward enthusiasm" [...] during the appearance, while The New York Times wrote that [...] "there was a tight, grudging quality to the event," [...] and <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> had been [...] "looking a bit like a teenager forced to attend a classical music concert." [...] McCain also {{made it clear that he}} was not interested in a vice-presidential nomination.|$|E

500|$|McCain {{was upset}} by the notorious smear tactics against {{her husband in the}} South Carolina primary that year. [...] These {{included}} allegations involving her adopted daughter Bridget that she found [...] "despicable", as well as insinuations <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> herself was currently a drug addict. [...] Though deeply wounded by the attacks for a long time, Cindy McCain eventually forgave those responsible. [...] She was chosen as the chair of the Arizona delegation to the 2000 Republican National Convention.|$|E
500|$|The {{battle between}} Bush and McCain for South Carolina has entered U.S. {{political}} lore {{as one of}} the nastiest, dirtiest, and most brutal ever. [...] On the one hand, Bush switched his label for himself from [...] "compassionate conservative" [...] to [...] "reformer with results", as part of trying to co-opt McCain's popular message of reform. [...] On the other hand, a variety of business and interest groups <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> had challenged in the past now pounded him with negative ads.|$|E
500|$|In the end, McCain won the {{election}} easily with 60 {{percent of the vote}} to Kimball's 40percent. [...] A New York Times profile at the time said <b>that</b> <b>McCain</b> seemed [...] "poised to emerge as a significant figure in national politics". [...] At the same time, McCain's increasing involvement in Arizona state party politics caused resentment {{on the part of some}} other Republicans. [...] This led to McCain falling out with Congressman Bob Stump and powerful state legislator Jane Hull.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{analyses}} of the two candidates' plans came to widely varying predictions of their costs and effects. A comparison by The Tax Policy Center, a project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute estimated that Obama's proposals could cost $1.6 trillion over 10 years, while the tax-related provisions of McCain's proposals could cost $1.3 trillion over the same period. A comparison by The Lewin Group, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, published in October 2008, found <b>that</b> the <b>McCain</b> plan would {{reduce the number of}} uninsured by 21.1 million and cost $2.05 trillion over 10 years, while the Obama plan would reduce the uninsured by 26.6 million and increase federal spending by $1.17 trillion over the same period. [...] Estimates prepared by HSI Networks found <b>that</b> the <b>McCain</b> plan would reduce the uninsured by 27.5 million at an annual cost of $287 billion, and the Obama plan would reduce the uninsured by 25.5 million at an annual cost of $452 billion.|$|R
