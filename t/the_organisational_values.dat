It is also {{available}} at: [URL] hold a prominent place in both business ethics and organisational theories, {{and there is a}} detectable shift from management by instructions and objectives to management by values (Dolan and Garcia, 1999). Some organisations now devote significant energy to integrating values and beliefs into their business practices, which requires a clear and thorough understanding of <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> in the first place. Many believe that organisations should have values that both reflect the collective values of all employees and align with individual values (Sawhney, 2002; Peat, 2003; Jaffe and Scott, 1998). However, there persists considerable confusion about how organisational values should be developed. While many organisations have values statements, most were generated by those in a leadership position, which often fail to relate to the employees’ personal values. This paper presents a values study conducted in an organisation in the UK construction industry. By utilising a questionnaire survey instrument developed upon the Schwartz’s theoretical framework of human values (Schwartz, 1992), employees’ values profiles were collected and analysed. A follow-up workshop facilitated the identification and sharing of the common values, established the linkage between individual and organisational values, and as a result, a set of values statements were developed by the employees themselves. This bottom up approach made <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> explicit in an understandable and useful way, and improved the congruence between individuals and the organisation...|$|E

40|$|The generic {{pharmaceutical}} value chain {{model has been}} employed to describe both the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries till now. This research investigates <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>value</b> chain in Australian biotechnology companies {{in order to assess}} the appropriateness of the pharmaceutical value chain to small-and medium-sized biotechnology companies. The main theme of the research is: Can a generic model of <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>value</b> chain be defined for the biotechnology industry? Emanating from the literature, two research propositions were developed. RP 1 : there are eight major definable elements/activities of <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>value</b> chain for <b>the</b> biotechnology industry. RP 2 : Coverage of the elements in the biotechnology value chain ranges from focused to broad. A multiple case study methodology was used to explore these propositions. To develop a number of case studies, data was collected from senior managers of small and medium Australian biotechnology companies using an interview instrument, as well as from publicly available documentation and through observation. The results were analysed using cross-case comparisons. The results showed that an aggregation of the value chains of each organisation can be reduced to these eight definable elements that constitute the biotechnology value chain: basic research, applied research, development, verification and validation, prototype development, clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing. However, the findings also indicate that these major elements of the value chain need to be further reduced into sub-activities or sub-tasks to cater for the unique differences between biotechnology companies. Generally, the findings were consistent with the literature. However, a wider sampling, including international biotechnology organisations should be studied. The major contribution of this research is {{in the development of a}} value chain model, including general sub-tasks, for the Australian biotechnology industry...|$|R

40|$|Organisations {{are faced}} with the reality of having to compete on the global market. It has {{therefore}} become critical now more than ever, for managers of these organisations to adopt strategies that will ensure competitive advantage and sustainability into the future. Knowledge has been identified as a strategic asset that can be leveraged to gain this competitive advantage. Unfortunately, the nature of organisations prevents them from having the ability to hire new individuals each time a knowledge gap is identified. Strategic alliances have identified as platforms where knowledge possessed by an alliance partner can be accessed by the other party through the process of knowledge transfer. In order for this process to be effective, both the teaching and the learning partner have to have certain organisational values that promote the transfer of knowledge. This study investigated <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> that promoted knowledge transfer in strategic alliances {{within the context of the}} construction industry. An additional dimension of knowledge context, i. e. whether knowledge is technical or non-technical, was also investigated to assess if it had a bearing on <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> required for knowledge transfer. The study also sought to establish how tensions caused by conflicting values were managed in the context of strategic alliances. The research took the form of an exploratory qualitative study where twelve managers of EPCM/construction companies were interviewed. The insights drawn from the respondents then formed the basis of the research findings. The research identified willingness to learn, willingness to teach, relationship, trust and quality focus as the top five most cited organisational values that are perceived to promote knowledge transfer in strategic alliances. The conflicting organisational values of adaptability and predictability were found to promote technical and non-technical contexts, respectively, and a model was developed on how to effectively manage tensions between alliance partners. Recommendations were then made to managers and academics. Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2014. zkgibs 2015 Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) MBAUnrestricte...|$|E

Selecting and controlling SDMP is a key of management success. SDMP involves the roles of participation as well as cognitive style that play in the decision making process. <b>Organisational</b> process-oriented <b>values</b> (OPV) act as the major factor in determining the degree of participation of S D M P within an organisation. With a comprehensive review of previous relevant studies, discussion of <b>the</b> nature of <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> and <b>the</b> impact of the environment on S D M P, a conceptual model is presented for studying the determinants of the relationship between O PV and S D M P. Methods of cross-cultural comparative survey and interview were used as instruments in this research. 440 questionnaires were distributed among managers in eight organisations of both China and Australia.

Specifically, organisational values were identified as powerful discourses that were key to framing coaches' and managers' organisational experiences, and also through which managers and coaches influence those experiences. The research utilised a case study approach of two Regional Sport Organisations in New Zealand. Commonalities and contradictions experienced by coaches and their managers were analysed. Additionally, analysis across the two organisations was undertaken. It was found that coaches and their managers do not just reflect their organisational values.

Cited reasons for these mixed results include the way control is operationalised and also the potential effects of secondary moderators in the relationship among job demand, job control, and employee adjustment. Towards addressing these issues, the present study assessed the secondary moderating effects of subjective fit with organisational culture and values in the D-CM. Participation in decision-making {{was used as the}} measure of job control. Moderated multiple regression analyses revealed three significant interactions in a sample of 119 employees. The results revealed a three-way interaction between role overload, participative control, and subjective fit on physiological symptoms and psychological health. Further analyses demonstrated a significant interaction between role conflict, participative control, and subjective fit on intentions to leave. In all interactions, participative control buffered the negative effects of the stressors on levels of employee adjustment only when employees’ subjective fit with <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> was high.

40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} the systems, {{dynamics and}} conditions of international cooperation/non-cooperation {{in the international community}} that is embodied through international/regional institutions and organisations. As Robert Cooper describes, the international community consists of the three worlds in which the differences between them may be confrontational in international cooperation. While the post-modern civilisation and values are introduced into the institutions and organisations for international peace and security, the state actors from the pre-modern and modern civilisations and values are vigorously defending the traditional version of state sovereignty. Then, all these are equally the member of the international community and, as Robert Axelrod¿s Prisoner Dilemma game sets, neither state actors nor structural actors of international relations can escape from it. Therefore, it is hoped that, as Axelrod¿s theory suggests, the closed community, in the end, produces cooperation and a positive peace for a better future for all. In the case studies, the OSCE faces a number of non-cooperative state actors, like Russia. An anti-OSCE civilisation exists and is resisting <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>values,</b> while it is staying in the framework. Thus, the organisation is suffering from defectors and free-riders. Knowing the limitation of the organisation, it still has a space for improvement and a useful function which is to provide a long term process to make a non-cooperate actor cooperative...|$|E

This raised two crucial methodological issues for the study. To ensure that the study was objective, reliable and valid, I had to take different approaches. Firstly, as the Head of Training, my role allowed me to quickly get to the core of the problem and I was able to generate extensive amount of crucial data.

Secondly, I had to use extensive collaborative approach to counteract the possibility of subjectivity which I encountered as an inside researcher. The collaborative approach produced Volume II, which is the study's tangible outcome.

40|$|Background: Botswana has a {{shortage}} of health care workers, especially in primary healthcare. Retention and high performance of employees are closely linked to job satisfaction and motivation, which are both highest where employees’ personal values and goals are realised. Aim: The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate employees’ personal values, and the current and desired organisational culture of the district health services as experienced by the primary health care workers. Setting: The study was conducted in the Ngamiland and Mahalapye health districts. Method: This was a cross sectional survey. The participants were asked to select 10 values that best described their personal, current organisational and desired organisational values from a predetermined list. Results: Sixty and 67 health care workers completed the survey in Mahalapye and Ngamiland districts, respectively. The top 10 prevalent organisational values experienced in both districts were: teamwork, patient satisfaction, blame, confusion, job insecurity, not sharing information and manipulation. When all the current values were assessed, 32 % (Mahalapye) and 36 % (Ngamiland) selected by health care workers were potentially limiting organisational effectiveness. <b>The</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> desired by health care workers in both districts were: transparency, professional growth, staff recognition, shared decision-making, accountability, productivity, leadership development and teamwork. Conclusions: The experience of the primary health care workers in the two health districts were overwhelmingly negative, which is likely to contribute to low levels of motivation, job satisfaction, productivity and high attrition rates.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development of}} management in financial services and its implications on managers' activities and socialisation. The thesis uses gender and emotional labour as the main themes for the discussion of management in the financial services. The thesis reports on two ethnographic case studies within two UK retail banks. Analyses are based on data derived from interviews, observations and documents. Both the literature and data suggest that management {{in the service sector}} centres around the management of organisational cultures. Managers must disseminate <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> in order to extract excellent customer service from the front-line staff. Managers themselves are acculturated into the organisation and its values, in order to more easily acculturate their staff. The data indicates that although management appears to have been feminised, masculine values still dominate. Managers are socialised into organisational cultures in which human relations rhetoric looms large and both male and female managers employ `feminine' management styles. Confusingly however, male managers' skills seem to be valued more and male-dominated business areas receive greater kudos. A disjunction between rhetoric and reality is thus evident. In addition, both management and emotional labour are presented as gendered in sociological literature. The data indicates that although management styles and practices are perceived to be gendered, there is little evidence to support the stereotypes. Both men and women can be seen to be performing emotional labour too, but it is the expectations of others and their different life experiences that can lead to gender differences in the way that emotional labour is displayed.

Construction Management and Economics, 26 (10), pp. 1009 - 1028]. Construction Management and Economics is available online at: [URL] have held a prominent place in business ethics and organisational theories in recent years. Some organisations now aim to integrate values into their business practices, which requires a thorough understanding of <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>values.</b> However, whilst many believe organisational values should reflect the collective values of the staff, the majority of values statements are generated by senior management with little examination of employees’ personal values. The difficulties surrounding the development of an organisation’s values are exacerbated by the dearth of literature offering practical guidance. The case study presented has been conducted in a UK construction company using Schwartz’s theoretical framework of human values as a starting point and framing device. Employees’ values profiles were collected and analysed through an organisational-wide values survey. Follow-up workshops and post workshop activities facilitated the sharing of common values and helped staff representatives develop their own organisational values statements, independent of the senior management, before a final stage of negotiation with them. The findings support the argument that the shaping of collective organisational values should be based on a clear understanding and communication of employees’ personal values, and Schwartz’s circumplex model of values and associated survey instrument are helpful framing devices to initiate and structure such a debate. Compared to the usual management-imposed approach, this bottom-up process could make organisational values explicit in a more understandable and useful way, and improve values congruence between individuals and host organisations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} an {{increasingly}} popular, but little studied organisational communication practice, {{the deployment of}} corporate values messages {{as a means of}} ‘framing’ reality, and of achieving ‘shared meaning’ in multicultural workplaces, and asks if such practices, based on ethnocentric approaches to business communication, are likely to be effective in culturally diverse contexts. Using a business discourse perspective, and approaching culture as dynamic systems of meaning, the study presents a rich case of values communication in a European multinational, by exploring in detail the meanings employees derive from <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> messages, and the relationship between these meanings and the cultural context in which they are constructed. Findings point to two main conclusions: Firstly, that universal values messages do generate multiple employee meanings, but these do not derive from distinct cultural memberships, such as ethnicity or nationality, but rather from the complex interaction between message texts, organisational cultural frames and discourses and cultural identities constructed during interpretation by message users. This finding offers support for a non-essentialist approach to culture in intercultural business communication research, which locates culture not in distinct external influences on communicative action, but in a complex and holistic ‘interculturality’ - the process and outcomes of interacting dynamic cultures, cultural texts, and the communicative action itself. Secondly, findings show that, if the message texts trigger shared cultural frames, shared meanings will also emerge, despite apparent cultural diversity among message readers. This finding challenges the view of much current intercultural and cross-cultural communication scholarship, that the cultural diversity of business audiences is likely to render universal communication practices in multinational businesses ineffective. Instead, it suggests that explicit universal values texts in multinational organisations may indeed contribute to the generation of shared meaning, although this will be mediated by existing, implicit, cultural ‘texts’.

40|$|Total Quality Management (TQM) is {{sometimes}} {{considered to be}} a continuously evolving management system consisting of values, methodologies and tools, the aim of which is to increase external and internal customer satisfaction with a reduced amount of resources. Whether TQM improves the performance of and strengthens values within organisations has been discussed for several years. One way of working with TQM and its values, methodologies and tools is to participate in a quality award process. The purpose of this thesis is to describe and explain <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>value</b> of participating in quality award processes. This thesis is limited to Swedish organisations, and consists of an extended summary and five appended papers on the subject, each with a different aim and methodology. The work described in one paper investigates the financial performance of quality award recipients compared with competitors and branch indices. Two of the papers illuminate participation in in-company quality award processes regarding experiences and organisational performance. Two of the papers describe <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>value</b> of participation in the Swedish Quality Award process. The main conclusion of the thesis, which is in agreement with earlier published results, is that, if companies successfully implement TQM, the financial performance is affected positively. Good examples are also identified of the application of methodologies and tools, based on participation in a quality award process, in order to improve organisational performance within a number of areas. The results of this thesis {{have not been able to}} show strong evidence proving that <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> performance of company units which have worked with in-company quality awards, but have not yet successfully implemented TQM, are affected by this work. However, such units experience that working with in-company quality awards has positive effects on the customers as well as the employees. The same is also true of organisations participating in a national quality award process. In particular, the main value of participation in a national quality award process is improved customer orientation, process orientation and improvement work. On the other hand, the main drawbacks are the resource-demanding activities involved, in particular during the phase of description of activities, and the elaborate model used for participation in the quality award process.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the research question: Is Schein’s theory useful {{for understanding the}} values of Christian organisations? The research method used is {{a case study of}} ‘Across’. Across is a Christian mission organisation working in South Sudan, which was founded in 1972 after the Addis Ababa Agreement brought to an end the First Sudanese Civil War (1955 - 1972). Schein’s theory of organisational culture states that ‘the essence of a group's culture is its pattern of shared, basic taken-for-granted assumptions’. In this thesis these ‘basic assumptions’ are referred to by using the term organisational values. According to Schein organisational values manifest themselves at the level of ‘observable artifacts’ and ‘shared espoused values’. Schein then sees that the task of the researcher is to ‘decipher’ these two elements so as to identify the actual, underlying organisational values. After reflecting theologically on the appropriateness of using such a theory in a Christian context the research method then leads to a two stage process being followed. Firstly, to analyse <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> of Across from the founding of Across in 1972 until 2005, when the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983 - 2005) came to an end. The steps in this first stage of the process are to identify the actual organisational values of Across, to look at the factors that caused these values to emerge in Across, and then to track how significant an influence these organisational values were on the organisational behaviour of Across. The Across organisational values identified and selected for study can be summarised in the terms: partnering; integrating (integral mission); focusing on ‘the South’, and identifying with the Sudanese. The second stage in the process is to evaluate how useful Schein’s theory has been in understanding Across, and to assess whether Schein’s theory would therefore be useful in understanding other Christian organisations. The conclusion of this research is that Schein’s theory of organisational culture is useful in understanding the values of Christian organisations, and that this understanding can enable the leaders of Christian organisations to lead more effectively...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{shortage}} of nurses {{willing to work}} in rural Australian healthcare settings continues to worsen. Australian rural areas have a lower retention rate of nurses than metropolitan counterparts, with more remote communities experiencing an even higher turnover of nursing staff. When retention rates are lower, patient outcomes {{are known to be}} poorer. This article reports a study that sought to explore the reasons why registered nurses resign from rural hospitals in the state of New South Wales, Australia. METHODS: Using grounded theory methods, this study explored the reasons why registered nurses resigned from New South Wales rural hospitals. Data were collected from 12 participants using semi-structured interviews; each participant was a registered nurse who had resigned from a rural hospital. Nurses who had resigned due to retirement, relocation or maternity leave were excluded. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and imported into NVivo software. The constant comparative method of data collection and analysis was followed until a core category emerged. RESULTS: Nurses resigned from rural hospitals when their personal value of how nursing should occur conflicted with the hospital's organisational values driving the practice of nursing. These conflicting values led to a change in the degree of value alignment between the nurse and hospital. The degree of value alignment occurred in three dynamic stages that nurses moved through prior to resigning. The first stage, sharing values, was a time when a nurse and a hospital shared similar values. The second stage was conceding values where, due to perceived changes in a hospital's values, a nurse felt that patient care became compromised and this led to a divergence of values. The final stage was resigning, a stage where a nurse 'gave up' as they felt that their professional integrity was severely compromised. The findings revealed that when a nurse and organisational values were not aligned, conflict was created for a nurse about how they could perform nursing that aligned with their internalised professional values and integrity. Resignation occurred when nurses were unable to realign their personal values to changed organisational values - <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> changed due to rural area health service restructures, centralisation of budgets and resources, cumbersome hierarchies and management structures that inhibited communication and decision making, out-dated and ineffective operating systems, insufficient and inexperienced staff, bullying, and a lack of connectedness and shared vision. CONCLUSIONS: To fully comprehend rural nurse resignations, this study identified three stages that nurses move through prior to resignation. Effective retention strategies for the nursing workforce should address contributors to a decrease in value alignment and work towards encouraging the coalescence of nurses' and hospitals' values. It is imperative that strategies enable nurses to provide high quality patient care and promote a sense of connectedness and a shared vision between nurse and hospital. Senior managers need to have clear ways to articulate and imbue organisational values and be explicit in how these values accommodate nurses' values. Ward-level nurse managers have a significant responsibility to ensure that a hospital's values (both explicit and implicit) are incorporated into ward culture...|$|E

The {{primary purpose}} of the present study was to {{identify}} whether <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> culture of <b>the</b> Transmission Division of Eskom is aligned to its stated values. In seeking to reach this objective, it was necessary to assess the gap between espoused and practised <b>organisational</b> <b>values.</b> <b>The</b> study also sought to identify <b>the</b> Transmission Division’s <b>organisational</b> culture. A correlation between the stated <b>values</b> and identified <b>organisational</b> culture was calculated and this was used to infer whether the values that the organisation espouses are aligned to <b>the</b> current <b>organisational</b> culture. <b>The</b> study made use a self-administered questionnaire sent via email to all the Transmission Division employees (N= 1793) of whom 182 responded. The questionnaire comprised sections covering biographical aspects, <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> as well as questions on <b>organisational</b> culture. In <b>the</b> questionnaire, biographical aspects were provided by the Transmission Division’s human resources department and those for <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> were derived from both literature and Eskom’s value statement. Questions on organisational culture were taken from Cameron and Quinn’s (2006) Organisational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI). Data on <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> was subjected to quantitative analysis whilst data relating to organisational culture was interpreted by following Cameron and Quinn’s (2006) Competing Values Framework (CVF). The present study found that there is a gap between observed and espoused or stated <b>organisational</b> <b>values.</b> By using <b>the</b> Cameron and Quinn (2006) framework of organisational culture, which identifies hierarchy, ‘adhocracy’, market and clan’ as <b>the</b> ‘four distinct <b>organisational</b> culture types, <b>the</b> study found that respondents experience the current Transmission Division’s organisational culture to be predominantly hierarchical. A general inference drawn in this study is that <b>the</b> current hierarchical <b>organisational</b> culture is misaligned to <b>the</b> espoused <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> of ‘integrity’, ‘customer satisfaction’, ‘innovation’ and ‘excellence’. The study makes recommendations to the Transmission Division about how to address this misalignment and areas that require further investigation are suggested...|$|R

40|$|M. A. (Labour Relations) Never {{before has}} South Africa {{undergone}} as many changes as {{is currently the}} case. With the abolition of apartheid, the looming prospect of affirmative action legislation {{and the need to}} foster a positive economic growth rate, South African human resource managers are faced with unprecendented challenges. The biggest of these challenges is the effective management of human resources in a diverse organisational environment, which has, until recently focussed almost exclusively on the development of white employees. In order to increase the competitiveness of South African organisations and to generate income for the economy, human resource management policies and systems have to be adapted. These adaptions should focus on the needs of black employees, especially in <b>the</b> area of <b>organisational</b> culture, which was traditionally based exclusively on the values of white management. In view of the above it is the goal of this study to create a system of value management to integrate the traditional cultural values of employees with <b>the</b> core <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> of a specific hotel complex. The study is a combined literature study and an empirical enquiry. In the empirical enquiry <b>the</b> core <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> of <b>the</b> hotel complex are investigated, in support of the hypothesis that South African human resource management policies are not sufficiently cognisant of the traditional values of employees. Subjects such as the nature of traditional Batswana cultural values and a value management model for <b>the</b> integration of <b>organisational</b> and cultural <b>values</b> will furthermore be addressed in this study...|$|R
40|$|Theories within {{organisation}} {{and management}} studies have offered several concepts and models which indicate that <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> are important factor for organisational success, including reputation building. Nevertheless, existing theory is still inadequate to explain <b>the</b> link between <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> and organisation’s reputation {{because it does not}} account for the enabling factors that underlies the two concepts. This study argues that <b>the</b> implementation of <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> is an important organisational action for acquiring positives perceptions of <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> which influences employee behaviour and shapes organisational reputation. It specifically shows and elucidates the enabling mechanisms that reinforce <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> to impact on employee perceptions and behaviour. This is important because when employees share and exemplify the values in their work, they are likely to behave in ways that support the organisation’s strategy which impacts on external perceptions and build reputation. This study employed a qualitative approach through a single in-depth case study. It reflects that the understanding of ‘what is going on’ within organisation is most appropriately achieved by building concepts and constructs from empirical studies. By using semi-structured interviews, focus groups and non-participant observations, the data develops and evolves through the responses and behaviours of participants. Employees were selected through purposive sampling and the snow-balling technique was used to reach customers. The data were structured and coded using thematic analysis. The findings revealed that the process of aligning <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> and employee values is significant for understanding how <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> influence employee behaviours, which in turn enable the organisation to build its reputation. The data suggest that four remediation phases: aware, articulate, accept and act, are important for explaining how a gap between <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> and employee values can be reduced. This remediation process enabled the senior management team and employees to understand how their perceptions and reactions towards <b>the</b> implementation of <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> impact upon attitudes and behaviours. The findings suggest that <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> can be reinforced through various social influences. Social interactions can occur in different forms including the involvement of leaders of the management team in creating, exampling and communicating values as well as through expanding the employee’s role in enacting values through empowerment and trust building. However, the findings emphasise that the process of cascading and instilling values through a top-down or hierarchical is no feasible. Instead, it is a hybrid approach that requires employee buy-in and involvement especially in communicating and enacting <b>organisational</b> <b>values.</b> This is an important insight because employees regularly interact with each other which provide a valuable platform to persuade and influence other colleagues to embrace <b>organisational</b> <b>values.</b> Additionally, <b>the</b> findings also build on the reputation literature by demonstrating the role of reciprocity and mimicking in behaviour as the consequences of social interactions within the organisation. The opportunity to regularly interact with colleagues enables employees to want to reciprocate in return for what they have received in the workplace. This tacit understanding of reciprocity for mutual benefit and the tendency to imitate other’s behaviour improves employee perceptions of organisations which in turn contribute towards reputation building. The study advances current understandings in <b>the</b> <b>organisational</b> reputation literature by providing a unique theoretical and empirical insight into how <b>organisational</b> <b>values</b> can impact on reputation building. It also highlights the important role of internal mechanisms for shaping both internal perceptions and behaviour as well as external perceptions of organisations...|$|R
