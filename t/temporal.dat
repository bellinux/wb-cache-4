5|$|A study – {{conducted}} by He et al. – used a mechanistic modelling approach {{to study the}} three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. They tried to study the factors that underlie variability in <b>temporal</b> patterns, and the patterns of mortality and morbidity. Their analysis suggests that <b>temporal</b> variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation and the variation in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically plausible values.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of evolution, the skull has been {{modified}} in most diapsids from the original version evident in the fossil record. However, all the original features are preserved in that of the tuatara; it has two openings – a <b>temporal</b> fenestra {{on each side of}} the skull, with complete arches. In addition, the upper jaw is firmly attached to the skull. This makes for a very rigid, inflexible construction. Testudines (turtles and tortoises) have anapsid skulls – they lack any <b>temporal</b> fenestrae, are sometimes considered to be the most primitive among amniotes, though evidence strongly indicates they may have lost the <b>temporal</b> openings rather than never having had them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Temporal</b> Agent Daniels informs Captain Archer {{that three}} Reptilians have {{traveled}} {{back in time}} to Detroit, Michigan, to the year 2004, where they intend to produce a bio-weapon to annihilate Humans. The Xindi Council had banned the use of bio-weapons, forcing the Reptilians to take extraordinary measures. Daniels sends Archer and Sub-Commander T'Pol {{back in time to}} investigate, and provides Archer with <b>temporal</b> tags to bring back anything foreign to that time-frame.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} in the novel are integral to its understanding. Not only do they highlight the <b>temporal</b> and political context of voodoo and other forces, but they also allow Carpentier to surpass <b>temporal</b> and spatial limitations to reach the ultimate reality of life: the universal essence that lies in every human being.|$|E
25|$|The brain {{analyzes}} the <b>temporal</b> (rhythmic) components {{of music in}} two ways: (1) it segments the ongoing sequences of music into <b>temporal</b> events based on duration, and (2) it groups those <b>temporal</b> events to understand the underlying beat to music. Studies on rhythmic discrimination reveal that the right <b>temporal</b> auditory cortex is responsible for <b>temporal</b> segmenting, and the left <b>temporal</b> auditory cortex is responsible for <b>temporal</b> grouping. Other studies suggest the participation of motor cortical areas in rhythm perception and production. Therefore, a lack of involvement and networking between bilateral <b>temporal</b> cortices and neural motor centers may contribute to both congenital and acquired amusia.|$|E

50|$|The head is {{not very}} wide, and the snout is blunt. The eye is {{surrounded}} by a circumorbital ring of 5-7 scales. There are 6 supralabials and 9 sublabials. The <b>temporals</b> number 2+3 or sometimes 2+2, with the first and second upper <b>temporals</b> being as long together as the first lower one. Loreals: 1+1. Midbody there are 15 rows of weakly keeled dorsal scales that have a velvety texture. The anal scale is single. There are 128-152 ventral scales. The subcaudals number 18-22 in males and 17-19 in females.|$|R
25|$|The {{difference}} between A-theorists and B-theorists {{is often described}} as a dispute about <b>temporal</b> passage or 'becoming' and 'progressing'. B-theorists argue that this notion is purely psychological. Many A-theorists argue that in rejecting <b>temporal</b> 'becoming', B-theorists reject time's most vital and distinctive characteristic. It is common (though not universal) to identify A-theorists' views with belief in <b>temporal</b> passage.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} ventral pathway being {{important}} for visual processing, {{it is also}} important for processing auditory information. During processing, when sound waves enter the ear, this information is transduced into an unanalyzed auditory object. The subcortical auditory pathway then relays the information to the auditory cortex in the dorsal superior <b>temporal</b> gyrus (dSTG). In the dSTG, it is then divided into its constituent phones. These phones are then recognized into phonetic words in the superior <b>temporal</b> sulcus (STS). The information first enters the ventral stream at the posterior middle <b>temporal</b> gyrus and the posterior inferior <b>temporal</b> sulcus p(MTG+ITS). Here the auditory words are converted into semantic words. These words are then converted into a semantic phrase by the first combinatorial net at the anterior portion of the middle <b>temporal</b> lobe and then converted into a syntactic noun phrase at the second combinatorial net. This second combinatorial net is location in the anterior inferior <b>temporal</b> gyrus.|$|E
25|$|Lesions (or {{the absence}} of) in {{associations}} between the right <b>temporal</b> lobe and inferior frontal lobe. In nine of ten tone-deaf people, the superior arcuate fasciculus {{in the right}} hemisphere could not be detected, suggesting a disconnection between the posterior superior <b>temporal</b> gyrus and the posterior inferior frontal gyrus. Researchers suggested the posterior superior <b>temporal</b> gyrus was {{the origin of the}} disorder.|$|E

25|$|When {{measuring}} behavior, {{there are}} both dimensions {{of behavior and}} quantifiable measures of behavior. In applied behavior analysis, the quantifiable measures are a derivative of the dimensions. These dimensions are repeatability, <b>temporal</b> extent, and <b>temporal</b> locus.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{arachnoid}} cysts {{occurring in}} the middle fossa are accompanied by underdevelopment (hypoplasia) or compression of the <b>temporal</b> lobe. The exact role that <b>temporal</b> lobe abnormalities play {{in the development of}} middle fossa arachnoid cysts is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 80% of <b>temporal</b> lobe {{seizures}} produce auras {{that may}} lead to micropsia or macropsia. They are a common feature of simple partial seizures and usually precede complex partial seizures of <b>temporal</b> lobe origin.|$|E

25|$|EEG testing can {{diagnose}} {{patients with}} medial <b>temporal</b> lobe epilepsy.

25|$|The right {{superior}} <b>temporal</b> gyrus was {{the most}} significantly activated area during the processing happiness. The right superior <b>temporal</b> gyrus increasingly responds to an increasingly happy stimuli, while the left pulvinar increasingly responds to increasingly fearful stimuli. The right pulvinar is activated during aversive conditioning.|$|E
25|$|The temple (superficial <b>temporal</b> artery).|$|E
50|$|It has {{one pair}} of internasals; the {{posterior}} parts are narrow. One loreal, preocular, postocular and three <b>temporals</b> are found. Of the 9 supralabials, 4 and 6 connect with the eye. Ventrals number 131-146, and the undividedsubcaudals are 73-93 in count. The midbody consists of 19 rows of scales. The dorsal scales are strongly keeled and rough.|$|R
50|$|Midbody {{scales are}} in 19 rows (rarely 21) with 175-203 ventrals. There are 51-65 paired subcaudals and the anal shield is entire.

25|$|The {{disturbance}} was <b>temporal</b> in the example, but {{can also}} be spatial. Transition to turbulence can occur over a rough surface or over an irregular shape, such as an aircraft spoiler. All whistle mechanisms described here are created by <b>temporal</b> disturbances that are {{in one of the}} three classes.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of new episodic memories requires the medial <b>temporal</b> lobe, {{a structure that}} includes the hippocampus. Without the medial <b>temporal</b> lobe, one is able to form new procedural memories (such as playing the piano) but cannot remember the events during which they happened (See the hippocampus and memory).|$|E
