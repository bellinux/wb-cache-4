5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E

Getting his old job back, he was also part of the football team of the Factory. Weakened after the labor years, he died on the football field after he was severely faulted.|$|E

There was a quickening of the conscience and an appeal to generous and self-forgetful ends.|$|R
2500|$|These men {{strongly}} influenced Cousin's philosophical thought. To Laromiguière he attributes {{the lesson of}} decomposing thought, even though the reduction of it to sensation was inadequate. Royer-Collard taught him that even sensation is subject to certain internal laws and principles which it does not itself explain, which are superior to analysis and the natural patrimony of the mind. De Biran made a special study of the phenomena of the will.

I survey the facts: in the last 40 years {{we have learned that}} discount rates vary dramatically. Most views of the world changed 100 %: we thought 100 % of the variation in market dividend yields was due to variation in expected cashflows; now we know 100 % is due to variation in discount rates. We thought 100 % of the cross-sectional variation in expected returns came from the CAPM, now we think that’s about zero and a zoo of new factors describes the cross section. I show how time-series, cross-section, regression, and portfolio approaches are really the same, and think about how the empirical project can achieve a needed unification. I survey theories. I break discount-rate theories into categories. Frictionless theories include macro, both consumption and investment-focused, and behavioral approaches.

40|$|Extract] I've {{always been}} {{conscious}} of the anomaly - sharply pointed out by Michael Barber in EWS 44. 3 (Winter 2014) - of my challenging Antony Beevor's version of what Robert Laycock and Evelyn Waugh did during the evacuation of Crete. After all, Mr Beevor is a celbrity military historian and I am probably the least martial person on the planet. But ipse dixi went out early in the Middle Ages, and this argument is not about Gallagher versus Beevor and Barger but about what actually happened during {{the last night of}} the evacuation of Crete, 31 May / 1 June 1941, and whether Waugh told the truth about it. Though pre-emptive, I must say that it is an argument between fact and guesswork. In Brief Lives: Evelyn Waugh (London: Hesperus, 2013), Mr Barber makes it only too plain that he is unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evacuation of Crete, in which he is not alone; and that prompts me to offer the following brief outline of events as they relate to Evelyn Waugh...|$|R

I have shown in a former chapter what a number of well-marked and singular varieties the thorn (Crataegus oxycantha) has produced: yet this tree has been subjected to hardly any cultivation. In Staffordshire I carefully examined a large number of two British plants, namely Geranium phaeum and pyrenaicum, which have never been highly cultivated. These plants had spread spontaneously by seed from a common garden into an open plantation; and the seedlings varied in almost every single character, both in their flower and foliage, to a degree which I have never seen exceeded; yet they could not have been exposed to any great change in their conditions.|$|E

40|$|Symplectic {{geometry}} can {{be traced}} back to Lagrange and his work on celestial mechanics and has since then been a very active field in mathematics, partly because of the applications it offers but also because of the beauty of the objects it deals with. I this thesis we begin by <b>the</b> <b>simplest</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> symplectic geometry. We give the definition of a symplectic space and of the symplectic group, Sp(n). A symplectic space is the data of an even-dimensional space and of a form which satisfies a number of properties. Having done this we give a definition of the Lagrangian Grassmannian Lag(n) which consists of all n-dimensional subspaces of the symplectic space on which the symplectic form vanishes. We carefully study the topology of these spaces and their universal coverings. It is of great interest to know how the elements of the Lagrangian Grassmannian intersect each other. A lot of efforts have therefore been made to construct intersection indices for elements of Lag(n). They have gone under many names but have had a sole purpose, namely to give us a way to determine how these elements intersect. We show how these elements are constructed and extend the definition to paths of elements of Lag(n) and Sp(n). We end this thesis by extending the definition of an index defined by Conley and Zehnder bu using the properties of the Leray index. Their index plays a significant role in the theory of periodic Hamiltonian orbit...|$|R
