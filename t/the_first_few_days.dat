5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> after hatching. While the chicks are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they are older, the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.|$|E

She then {{graduates}} to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence {{is suggested by the}} high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.|$|E

Stanisław Hejmowski, the lawyer who defended them, was later repressed for his statement that the government's actions had led {{to the death of}} innocent civilians. The government failed in its attempts to coerce the detainees into stating that they were provoked by foreign (Western) secret services; nonetheless, this became the official line of the government for years to come.|$|E
5|$|Amongst {{local media}} outlets, only Apple Daily and Ming Pao ran {{coverage}} on their front pages initially, while other local newspapers carried only brief pieces about a missing person. Television viewers remarked that TVB {{did not run}} the story during its prime time news programmes for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> after news of the Lee Bo disappearance broke. Lee Bo's disappearance spurred renewed interest about Lam Wing-kee, and his family received a police visit the same day after chief executive CY Leung spoke publicly on the case.|$|E

5|$|Channel 4 {{was also}} accused of showing too many studio {{segments}} during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> of the Games rather than live events, and for missing several notable events involving British athletes, including a swimming heat where Eleanor Simmonds {{set a new}} personal best and almost beat the world record, Sarah Storey winning her eleventh Paralympic medal, and Great Britain's opening wheelchair basketball game against Germany. Channel 4 noted that time was needed during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> to explain Paralympic events and the classification system to viewers, {{and that it was}} operating three additional channels' worth of live coverage throughout the Games. The broadcaster also stated that it had to make editorial decisions on which events to air during periods where a large number of events were in progress. The amount of live coverage was also affected by Olympic Broadcasting Services, who did not send cameras or provide official television coverage for sports such as cycling, the marathon, and shooting. Channel 4's news department did send its own cameramen to film the affected events for highlights, but was unable to broadcast them live.|$|E
5|$|Painful {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs {{is common}} during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation {{is known as}} dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E

Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> {{in addition to}} antibiotics {{to help with the}} burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection. However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood). Acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used for fevers. There is no good evidence for the use of cranberry products for treating current infections.|$|E

After 3–4days, the parents switch to fish small {{enough for the}} young birds to swallow whole. By four weeks of age, the young can eat the same food—of the same size—as their parents do. Young birds may be fed for some time after fledging; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland lakes in the United Kingdom, hundreds of kilometres from any breeding areas.|$|E
5|$|For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> {{the newborn}} is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs {{the support of}} its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E

However, the difference between admission time and commencing SPRINT was generally very short, with a median delay for this cohort of 1.9 hours. Within 6 hours of admission, 81 % of the cohort had commenced SPRINT. Hence, these results are applicable to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> hours and <b>days</b> of ICU stay.|$|R

40|$|We report direct {{evidence}} for asymmetry {{in the early}} phases of SN 1987 A via optical spectroscopy of five fields of its light echo system. The light echoes allow <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>days</b> of <b>the</b> explosion to be reobserved, with different position angles providing different viewing angles to the supernova. Light echo spectroscopy therefore allows a direct spectroscopic comparison of light originating from {{different regions of the}} photosphere during the early phases of SN 1987 A. Gemini multi-object spectroscopy of the light echo fields shows fine-structure in the H-alpha line as a smooth function of position angle on the near-circular light echo rings. H-alpha profiles originating from the northern hemisphere of SN 1987 A show an excess in redshifted emission and a blue knee, while southern hemisphere profiles show an excess of blueshifted H-alpha emission and a red knee. This fine-structure is reminiscent of the "Bochum event" originally observed for SN 1987 A, but in an exaggerated form. Maximum deviation from symmetry in the H-alpha line is observed at position angles 16 and 186 degrees, consistent with the major-axis of the expanding elongated ejecta. The asymmetry signature observed in the H-alpha line smoothly diminishes as a function of viewing angle away from the poles of the elongated ejecta. We propose an asymmetric two-sided distribution of 56 Ni most dominant in the southern far quadrant of SN 1987 A as the most probable explanation of the observed light echo spectra. This is evidence that the asymmetry of high-velocity 56 Ni in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>days</b> after explosion is correlated to the geometry of the ejecta some 25 years later.
