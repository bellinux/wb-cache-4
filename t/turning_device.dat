5000|$|Another old-style {{variation}} that spawned from {{games like}} Quake was the SDF-SPACE layout. In this layout, [...] = turn left, [...] = forward, [...] = turn right, space = backpedal, [...] = strafe left and [...] = strafe right. This layout allows the player to aim with the mouse while strafing (sidestepping), turning and running or backpedalling {{all at once}} creating slightly more complex movements. This variation is not favoured any longer for two main reasons. First, because many players deem the turn commands useless because the mouse {{can act as a}} <b>turning</b> <b>device,</b> and so they assign [...] and [...] to the sidestep commands and leave the turn commands unassigned. The second, and probably more prominent reason is, in assigning both the turn and strafe commands, performing movements and dodges can be much more confusing, so newcomers tend to not prefer this key setup. Though no longer widely used, many FPS veterans and tournament players still employ this key setup.|$|E
50|$|Windmill Hill Mill is a {{post mill}} on a two-storey roundhouse. She has four patent sails {{carried on a}} {{cast-iron}} windshaft and was winded by a tailpole. Winding is now computer-controlled, with an automatic <b>turning</b> <b>device</b> installed that receives information about the wind direction from sensors mounted on the mill. The wooden brake-wheel is of clasp-arm construction, with oak arms and an elm rim. It has 104 cogs and drives a stone nut with twelve cogs. The tail wheel is of cast iron, with 130 cogs. The mill drove two pairs of millstones, arranged head and tail. The headstones are Peak stones and the tailstones are French Burrs. The body of the mill is 21 ft long and 12 ft wide, the largest surviving post mill by floor plan in the United Kingdom. It is 50 ft high to the roof, the second tallest post mill in England. The roundhouse is 22 ft in diameter and has a single-storey lean-to extension of part of its circumference.

40|$|LecturePg. 75 - 84 Recently, {{synthesis}} gas compressor drive steam turbines have required upgrading {{to increase efficiency}} and reliability for saving both {{operation and maintenance costs}} in many ammonia plants. This paper introduces the latest practical technologies to achieve very high performance. Examples include a highly unique assembly of integral shrouded blades, a new profile design procedure for both fluid loss reduction and increased strength against high-speed and high-stage power. Finite-element and computational fluid dynamics analysis results of new blades and nozzles are discussed while comparing experimental data from a cascade test and a rotating blades shaker test. These results are shown in terms of actual loss distribution, efficiency measurement, and vibration/stress mode on rotating blades including design criteria. Other useful applications of new technologies to reduce steam leakage and increase last stage blade performance are introduced.

40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the dynamic mechanical properties of a binder, used in composite propellants, with increasing amount of different solid fillers. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) is performed to determine the region of glass-rubber transition temperature (Tg). Further parameters {{were obtained from the}} description of the loss factor curves (tanδ) with models based on exponentially modified Gauss (EMG) distribution function. Polyurethane binders employing the polyol HTPB and diisocyanate were filled with 20, 40, and 60 mass-% of ammonium perchlorate (AP), aluminum (Al) or cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) particles, using fine and coarse mean sizes. A special <b>turning</b> <b>device</b> manufactured by Fraunhofer ICT was installed inside the curing oven in order to avoid sedimentation during curing. The cured composites were characterized by DMA in torsion mode from - 100 °C to 70 °C. The good homogeneous distribution of fillers in the samples was evaluated by computational X-ray micro-tomography. The data on tanδ showed a complex structure describable at first with 2 overlapping peaks. The peak at lower temperatures is due to mobility of unrestricted binder parts (Tgunr) and the second broader peak at high temperature is due to mobility of restricted binder parts (Tgres). Results of tanδ, calculated areas of EMG curves and apparent activation energies of the distinct relaxation processes indicate that Al particles have higher interaction with HTPB-based polyurethane than AP and RDX. Probably Al is bonded to the binder network via isocyanate coupling with OH groups present in the surface. Ammonium perchlorate and cyclotrimethylene trinitramine particle sizes and its morphology influenced the viscoelastic properties. AP and RDX cause more changes in intensity of first peak of loss factor than Al. Increasing amount of these both particles enhances storage (G’) and loss (G”) shear moduli.

40|$|A high-turning {{transonic}} {{stator blade}} row suitable for an existing highly-loaded diagonal compressor stage {{with a total}} pressure ratio of 6. 0 was designed and optimized. The flow entering the <b>turning</b> <b>device</b> with M_ 1 = 1. 06 and #beta#_ 1 = 155. 2 has to be truned by more than 60 degrees and diffused to leave the blade row at a low subsonic exit Mach number. Thereby the total pressure losses should be kept as low as possible. The geometric concept chosen is a tandem cascade consisting of a transonic blade row with a mean flow turning of nearly 10 degrees followed by a subsequent high-turning subsonic cascade. The blade number ratio of the two blade rows was selected to be 1 : 2 (transonic to subsonic). Design and optimization have been performed using a modern Navier-Stokes flow solver under 2 D assumptions by neglecting sidewall boundary-layer effects. During the design process is {{was found to be}} necessary to guide the wake of the low turning transonic blade near the blade suction surface of the subsequent high turning cascade. Furthermore it is advantageous to enlarge the blade spacing of the wake passage in relation to the neighbouring one of the high turning part. The optimized design geometry of the tandem cascade was tested in the transonic cascade windtunnel of the DLR in Cologne. At design flow conditions the experiments confirmed the design target in any aspect. A flow turning of more than 60 degrees, a static pressure ratio of 1. 75, and a low total pressure loss coefficient of 0. 15 have been measured.

40|$|Recently, it {{was found}} that the second peak of the loss factor curve {{determined}} by DMA of HTPB bonded composite propellants and high explosives can change significantly in intensity and shape with composition. Composite propellants with AP connected via bonding agents to the binder matrix can show a pronounced second peak, whereas HMX and RDX produce a weaker peak and with high content, it can show only as shoulder attached to the first peak at lower temperatures. The second peak is also much more sensitive to ageing and to de-wetting. This means interaction between filler and matrix influence the appearance of the peak. Therefore, a more detailed investigation was started to elucidate the influences of fillers on the loss factor curve. Polyurethane binders made from polyol HTPB and isocyanate IPDI were filled with 20, 40 and 60 mass-% of ammonium perchlorate (AP), aluminum (Al) or RDX, using fine and coarse particles. For obtaining the cured elastomer, a special <b>turning</b> <b>device</b> constructed and manufactured at Fraunhofer ICT was installed inside the curing oven in order to avoid sedimentation of the fillers during curing. The cured composites were characterized by DMA in torsion mode from - 100 °C to + 70 °C, and the quality of distribution of fillers was evaluated by X-ray micro-tomography, which showed homogenous distribution of the filler particles in the samples. The part of loss factor tanδ at lower temperatures originates from the glass-rubber transition of the binder parts, which are unrestricted in mobility, defined so as comparison for the second broader peak at the high temperature side, which is caused by binder parts restricted in mobility. The temperatures at each maximum are called Tgunr and Tgres, respectively. The results are: AP and RDX cause more changes in intensity of the first main peak in tanδ than Al particles. The maximum temperature Tgunr is nearly not changed by any of the fillers. The changes in tanδ intensity determined from baseline corrected loss factor curves and modelled by EMG (exponentially modified Gauss) distributions indicate that Al has a stronger interaction with HTPB binder than AP and RDX particles. The particle sizes of AP and RDX and their shapes effect the viscoelastic properties. Increasing content of AP and RDX increase the storage modulus G’ and somewhat the loss modulus G’’, but as a whole tanδ intensity is lowered in the main peak...|$|E
