5|$|The same {{elements}} from <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> {{appear in the}} Pyramid Texts recur in funerary texts written in later times, such as the Coffin Texts from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE) and the Book of the Dead from the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BCE). Most of these writings were made for the general populace, so unlike the Pyramid Texts, they link Osiris with all deceased souls, not exclusively with royalty.|$|E
5|$|Given this, it {{is unfortunate}} that the Cypria—the part of the Epic Cycle that covers the period of the Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative of his story remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and many do not tally with the form of <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> scholars now believe to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E

5|$|The art {{historian}} Hendrik Frederik Wijnman disproved <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> Ruisdael died a poor man, supposedly {{in the old}} men's almshouse in Haarlem. Wijnman showed {{that the person who}} died there was in fact Ruisdael's cousin, Jacob Salomonszoon. Although there is no record of Ruisdael owning land or shares, he appears to have lived comfortably, even after the economic downturn of the disaster year 1672. His paintings were valued fairly highly. In a large sample of inventories between 1650 and 1679 the average price for a Ruisdael was 40 guilders, compared to an average of 19 guilders for all attributed paintings. In a ranking of contemporary Dutch painters based on price-weighted frequency in these inventories, Ruisdael ranks seventh; Rembrandt ranks first.|$|E

5000|$|This {{view was}} {{asserted}} {{for the first}} time by the bible scholar William Robertson Smith. The scholar Meletinsky notes that Smith introduced the concept [...] "dogmatically." [...] In his Lectures on the Religion of the Semites (1889), Smith draws a distinction between ancient and modern religion: in modern religion, doctrine is central; in ancient religion, ritual is central. On the whole, Smith argues, ancients tended to be conservative with regard to rituals, making sure to pass them down faithfully. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> <b>that</b> justified those rituals could change. In fact, according to Smith, many of <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> <b>that</b> have come down to us arose [...] "after the original, nonmythic reason ... for the ritual had somehow been forgotten." ...|$|R
5000|$|... a) According to the {{classification}} of Creation Myths by Charles Long, this <b>myth</b> belongs to <b>the</b> category of 'De Deo' myths; <b>that</b> is, <b>the</b> <b>myths</b> <b>that</b> posit <b>that</b> <b>the</b> whole creation was by an All Knowing and All Powerful God. From this point of view, {{it is interesting to}} observe that most of <b>the</b> creation <b>myths</b> in <b>the</b> Vedas as well as folk epics fall into the categories of 'De Deo' or 'Cosmic Egg' myths.|$|R

25|$|If {{there is}} no {{documentation}} of the myth occurring, yet the MythBusters were still able to duplicate it very closely to how the myth was described (such as <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> pirates wore eye patches {{in order to keep}} their night vision, or an untrained pilot being talked through landing an airplane).|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} National Armed Forces, {{it was one}} of the {{military}} resistance organizations that refused to join the structures of the Polish Underground State or its military arm, the Home Army.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> {{all members}} of the Andorran Army are ranked as {{officers}} is popularly maintained in many works of reference. In reality, all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as officers, or non-commissioned officers, because the other ranks are considered to be the rest of the able-bodied male population, who may still be called upon by the Sometent to serve, although such a call has not been made in modern times.|$|E
25|$|David Harland, {{the former}} head of UN Civil Affairs in Bosnia, claimed at the trial of General Dragomir Milošević in ICTY, that he was {{responsible}} for the creation of <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> UNPROFOR was unable to determine who had fired the mortar shells that caused the second Markale massacre. <b>The</b> <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> has survived for more than ten years, Harland said, was created because of a “neutral statement” made by General Rupert Smith, the UNPROFOR commander. On the day of the second Markale attack, General Smith stated “it is unclear who fired the shells, although at that time he already had the technical report of UNPROFOR intelligence section, determining beyond reasonable doubt that they were fired from VRS positions at Lukavica”. Harland himself had advised General Smith to make “a neutral statement in order not to alarm the Serbs who would be alerted to the impending NATO air strikes against their positions had he pointed a finger at them”, which would have jeopardized the safety of UN troops in the territory under VRS control or on positions where they might have been vulnerable to retaliatory attacks by Serb forces.|$|E
25|$|For Sonja Weinberg, as {{distinct}} from economic and religious anti-Judaism, antisemitism in its modern form shows conceptual innovation, a resort to 'science' to defend itself, new functional forms and organisational differences. It was anti-liberal, racialist and nationalist. It promoted <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> Jews conspired to 'judaise' the world; it served to consolidate social identity; it channeled dissatisfactions among victims of the capitalist system; and it {{was used as a}} conservative cultural code to fight emancipation and liberalism.|$|E

25|$|After World War II, George Schaller {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{researchers}} to go into the field and study primates. In 1959, he conducted a systematic study of the mountain gorilla in the wild and published his work. Years later, at the behest of Louis Leakey and the National Geographic, Dian Fossey conducted a much longer and more comprehensive study of the mountain gorilla. When she published her work, many misconceptions and myths about gorillas were finally disproved, including <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> gorillas are violent.|$|E
25|$|The 5,000th Lightning built, a P-38J-20-LO, 44-23296, {{was painted}} bright {{vermilion}} red, {{and had the}} name YIPPEE painted {{on the underside of}} the wings in big white letters as well as the signatures of hundreds of factory workers. This and other aircraft were used by a handful of Lockheed test pilots including Milo Burcham, Jimmie Mattern and Tony LeVier in remarkable flight demonstrations, performing such stunts as slow rolls at treetop level with one prop feathered to dispel <b>the</b> <b>myth</b> <b>that</b> the P-38 was unmanageable.|$|E
25|$|In July and August 1958, {{and again}} the {{following}} year, Mark was a scientific adviser to the United States delegation at the Conference of Experts on Detection of Nuclear Explosions.

He was committed to preventing nuclear weapons proliferation.
