5|$|Young Como started {{helping his}} family at age 10, working {{before and after}} school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to the}} money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E
25|$|The {{legality}} of the switch hit was questioned when first introduced, but cleared by the International Cricket Council as legal. The shot is risky because a batsman is less proficient in the other handedness and is more likely <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in the execution of his shot.|$|E
25|$|In the Monaco Grand Prix, Montoya did not {{reproduce}} {{his previous}} form {{and had to}} be satisfied with qualifying seventh. In the race, he made one position at the start. He then tried to pressure teammate Ralf Schumacher <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> but it was he himself who made the mistake, by sliding into the barriers on the Swimming Pool section on lap 3.

25|$|The activist rounds {{up all of}} {{the peasants}} but is terrified <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> He has not {{received}} any mandates from management and is worried about both underachieving and overachieving, fearing that the peasants will use smaller animals like goats in order to prop up capitalism. Chiklin and Voschev find an old man laying on the ground. He is trying to will himself to death, claiming that his soul disappeared when his horse was taken into collectivization. They leave for a literacy class taught by the activist, who teaches women and young girls how to write socialist words and slogans. Chiklin finds out that the local priest has been providing the activist with a list of names of the people who enter the church to pray. He punches the priest on principle.|$|E
25|$|Over {{four years}} later, Light {{is able to}} garner most of the world's support, {{reaching}} the point where his followers have begun to worship Kira as a literal deity. But two young men, Mello and Near, both raised as potential successors to L begin to separately investigate the case that took the life of their predecessor. Near heads the SPK (Special Provision for Kira), an American investigation team composed of CIA and FBI agents, while Mello teams up with the Mafia. Although Mello dies working separate from Near, his actions lead Teru Mikami, a man selected by Light to kill criminals using another Death Note, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> that results in Light's capture by Near, the SPK and Japanese police. Seeing that Light has finally lost, he is killed when Ryuk writes his name in his own Death Note, just as the Shinigami had warned when they first met.|$|E

40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} utilize gamification to increase student engagement, motivation and achievement in the classroom {{with varying degrees of}} accomplishment. This research attempts to review of existing literature on the subject as well as the implementation of gamification on Language course. It aims to get better understanding of how gamification can efficiently be used in education. This analysis reveals that the underlying fact that make games engaging are already utilized in pedagogical practices. There are two important recommendations from this research. First, use gamified learning scenario as an activity, to encourage students trying new things and avoiding fear <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistakes.</b> Secondly, the gamification in education setting needs students to participate deliberately to ensure the gamification retains the game-like nature...|$|R

500|$|After being heavily {{recruited}} by several colleges around the country, Solo attended the University of Washington from 1999 to 2002 where she majored in speech communications. With the Huskies, she switched permanently to goalkeeper under {{the lead of}} head coach Lesle Gallimore and goalkeeper coach and former national team player, Amy Griffin. Solo described the transition in her memoir, [...] "In high school, I had been the forward who won games. It was a huge mental adjustment to learn that {{my job was to}} save games. To anticipate what was needed. Before, I would stand in goal, the ball would come toward me, and I'd use my athletic ability to make the save. But thanks to Amy's tutelage and my time with the national team, I was becoming a much better tactical goalkeeper. I learned how to read my opponents' runs toward goal, how to position my defenders, how to see the angles... The intellectual side also made goalkeeping so much more interesting. It wasn't just ninety minutes of waiting for my defense <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> It was ninety minutes of tactics and strategy. The personality traits that had been shaped by my childhood—resilience and toughness—were assets at the position." ...|$|E
500|$|Daavettila {{graduated}} from Michigan Tech in 2008 and tried {{out for the}} Flint Generals of the International Hockey League (IHL). He appeared in two games for the Generals {{at the end of}} the season (for only about three shifts), and did not register a point. Daavettila had not originally planned to pursue a professional hockey career, but said [...] "When I got one skate with Flint, it kind of sparked my interest and I decided to give it a try". During the off-season, Daavettila worked for a structural engineering firm in Saginaw, Michigan. He used vacation time at the start of the next hockey season later in 2008 to try out for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Muskegon Lumberjacks (IHL), though he was rejected by both teams. Tryouts with two more IHL teams, the Kalamazoo Wings and the Bloomington PrairieThunder, did not result in a contract either. Daavettila assumed his hockey career was over and went back to his engineering job, but he continued to skate a couple times a week. He had left an impression on Kalamazoo coach Nick Bootland, however, who called Daavettila back in March 2009 after his team was depleted by injuries. [...] "You could see he had a skill set," [...] said Bootland. [...] "But I thought the way he held on to the puck, he was going to get himself killed. ... You kept thinking he was going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> Then he'd pop a guy for a breakaway." ...|$|E

2500|$|Li Cunxu {{was said}} to be intelligent, brave, and alert even in his youth. [...] In or around 902, seeing his father's {{distress}} at years of losses against archrival Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), he pointed out that his father's public display of distress would merely distress the troops and the people as well, and that it was better to lie low and wait for Zhu <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> before trying to react, allowing the troops and the people to rest for the time. [...] He also spoke to Li Keyong about what he saw as the issue of the ethnically Shatuo soldiers pillaging the civilian populace—although Li Keyong was unwilling to curb the soldiers' behaviors at that time, pointing out that if he did, the soldiers might scatter and be unable to be gathered again.|$|E

Eventually, via an elaborate plan that sees Light relinquish ownership of his Death Note, thus temporarily losing all memory of it, and the forced help of his second Death Note possessing fiancée Misa Amane's Shinigami Rem, L dies.

25|$|The bowler also varies {{the amount}} of loop and pace {{imparted}} to various deliveries to try to cause the batsman <b>to</b> misjudge and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> <b>As</b> the crease has a width, the bowler can change the angle from which he delivers to the batsman {{in an attempt to}} induce a misjudgement.|$|R
2500|$|The aim of fast bowling is {{to deliver}} the ball in such a fashion as to cause the batsman <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> This is {{achieved}} by making the hard cricket ball deviate from a predictable, linear trajectory at a speed that restricts {{the amount of time}} in which the batsman can compensate for it. For deviation caused by the ball's stitching (the seam), the ball will bounce off the pitch and deflect either away from the batsman's body, or inwards towards them. Swing bowlers on the other hand also use the seam of the ball but in a different way. To 'bowl swing' is to induce a curved trajectory of the cricket ball through the air. Swing bowlers use a combination of seam orientation, body position at the point of release, asymmetric ball polishing, and variations in delivery speed to affect an aerodynamic influence on the ball. The ability of a bowler to induce lateral deviation or 'sideways movement' obviously make it difficult for the batsman to address the flight of the ball accurately. [...] Beyond this ability to create an unpredictable path of ball trajectory, the fastest bowlers can be equally potent by simply delivering a ball at such a rate that a batsman simply fails to react either correctly, or at all. A typical fast delivery has a speed in the range of [...]|$|E
2500|$|After the game, Lyle Blackwood {{criticized the}} referee's ruling of Freddie Solomon's fumble as an {{incomplete}} pass. [...] "You don't want {{the game to}} hinge on that play, but you never know," [...] Blackwood said. [...] "I could have taken the ball up the sideline. That's a 14-point swing." [...] However, other Dolphins were not convinced. [...] "We were dominated {{to the point where}} one play didn't make much of a difference," [...] said Dolphins coach Don Shula. [...] "Our major objective was to contain Montana, and we did a terrible, terrible job of it," [...] added defensive coach Chuck Studley. Even Reggie Roby, who averaged only 39.3 yards per punt and didn't place any of his 6 punts inside the 20, took some responsibility for the loss. [...] "I was trying to kill the ball, and I kicked it bad," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't hit one well. I was scared – scared <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> It was the worst game of my life, counting high school, college, counting everything." [...] Meanwhile, in the 49ers' locker room, Joe Montana had his own explanation for the win. [...] "As far as my own game, well, I'd have to admit it was pretty close to the best I've ever played. I didn't throw anything I didn't have confidence in. We got in sort of a groove. Once you get going like that you gain confidence, and it carries over to the defense, and then back to the offense. It's a snowball kind of thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{fight that}} would be called [...] "The Dance in Detroit", both Severn and Shamrock circled each other with little to no contact for a {{combined}} total of almost thirty minutes. [...] "I took {{the center of the}} ring understanding that I was going to be fighting for my life and Dan never came at me," [...] Shamrock said. Severn later said that his strategy was to purposely not engage with Shamrock and wait for the fans to boo, hoping that the booing would affect Shamrock psychologically and force him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> that Severn could capitalize on. Finally, after over 15 minutes of stalling, Severn shot for a takedown, but was unsuccessful and following a brief scramble, Shamrock put Severn on his back in full mount. Shamrock held the mount for close to five minutes, throwing open fist palm strikes to Severn's head and an occasional closed fist punch to the body. Shamrock felt as though he would have damaged Severn badly and perhaps finished him from this position of full mount if he was allowed to punch Severn in the face with a closed fist. Severn eventually gave his back in an attempt to get out and the risk paid off as Shamrock slid off Severn's back and onto his back in full guard. Severn landed a headbutt to open a cut above Shamrock's eye and followed with elbow strikes and punches from Shamrock's guard. Shamrock eventually got back to his feet and after six more minutes stalling, the fight went to a judges decision. The judges gave a split decision win to Dan Severn, which upset Shamrock because he felt as though Severn had broken the rules by utilizing the banned closed fist punches to the head and headbutts. Chants of [...] "boring!" [...] and [...] "Let's go Red Wings!" [...] were echoed throughout the arena during the fight. Shamrock later stated that going through with this fight was the biggest regret of his fighting career.|$|E
