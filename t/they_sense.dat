5|$|European roller chicks vomit {{a bright}} orange, foul smelling liquid when <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> danger. This repels {{prospective}} predators and may alert {{their parents to}} danger: they respond by delaying their return.|$|E
5|$|Spiders often attach {{highly visible}} silk bands, called decorations or stabilimenta, to their webs. Field {{research}} suggests that webs with more decorative bands captured more prey per hour. However, a laboratory study showed that spiders reduce the building of these decorations if <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> the presence of predators.|$|E
5|$|Emus drink infrequently, but ingest {{large amounts}} when the {{opportunity}} arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to go without water for several days. In the wild, they often share water holes with kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend {{to wait for the}} other animals to leave before they quench their thirst.|$|E
60|$|Thaka and Numgo and Gunto, {{disturbed}} by the growlings of the two young bulls, looked up half apathetic, half interested. They were sleepy, but <b>they</b> <b>sensed</b> a fight. It would break the monotony of the humdrum jungle life they led.|$|R
50|$|Many {{participants}} expressed feeling {{tensions between}} adhering {{to a time}} frame that felt right to the individual, while acknowledging the expectations that <b>they</b> <b>sensed</b> from their {{friends and family members}} in regards to what an appropriate relationship and re-marriage time frame would be.|$|R
50|$|During {{the years}} Clear Channel {{operated}} AM 1220, the Goldmans remained residents of Santa Clarita {{and committed to}} the Valley. Their children attended local schools and they remained active with many local charities and organizations. <b>They</b> <b>sensed</b> {{a need for a}} local station, and approached Clear Channel to repurchase AM 1220.|$|R
5|$|When Buffy is on patrol, she laments in {{song about}} how uninspired her life has become ("Going Through the Motions"). The {{next morning at}} the Magic Box, the gang reveal that they also sang that evening. Led by Giles, the gang theorizes about {{the cause of the}} singing; <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> no {{immediate}} danger but agreeing that by working together they can overcome anything ("I've Got a Theory/Bunnies/If We're Together"). Buffy learns that the whole town is affected when she looks outside the shop to see a large group (led by series writer and producer David Fury) singing and dancing about how a dry-cleaning service got their stains out ("The Mustard").|$|E
5|$|Most turbellarians have pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), {{one pair}} in most species, but two or even three pairs in some. A few large species have many eyes in {{clusters}} over the brain, mounted on tentacles, or spaced uniformly {{around the edge}} of the body. The ocelli can only distinguish the direction from which light is coming and enable the animals to avoid it. A few groups have statocysts, fluid-filled chambers containing a small, solid particle or, in a few groups, two. These statocysts are thought to be balance and acceleration sensors, as that is the function they perform in cnidarian medusae and in ctenophores. However, turbellarian statocysts have no sensory cilia, and how <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> the movements and positions of the solid particles is unknown. On the other hand, most have ciliated touch-sensor cells scattered over their bodies, especially on tentacles and around the edges. Specialized cells in pits or grooves on the head are probably smell sensors.|$|E
25|$|As taste senses both harmful and {{beneficial}} things, all basic tastes {{are classified as}} either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> have on our bodies. Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons.|$|E
50|$|Jack {{gets the}} blue blobs {{up to the}} lab, where <b>they</b> <b>sensed</b> a larger power source and go after it instead of him. Then he runs back to the docks. He bursts into the sub as the klaxon sounds, {{just in time to}} see all the {{scientists}} sink and lose all their energy. The ship is caught in a loop, and its power is draining away.|$|R

50|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} the First World War, two ideological currents ran throughout European youth: fascist nationalism and revolutionary Marxism. A small group of enlightened youths criticised the extremist positions and slogans and concluded {{that they would not}} endure reality. At the same time, <b>they</b> <b>sensed</b> the danger caused by the separation and division of people into two opposing camps, fighting each other. They then considered an obligation to create a youth movement.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the drone}} is highly {{specialized}} to perform one function, mating and continuing {{the propagation of}} the hive, it is not completely without side benefit to the hive. All bees, when <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> the hive's temperature deviating from proper limits, either generate heat by shivering, or exhaust heat by moving air with their wingsâ€”behaviours which drones share with worker bees.|$|E
25|$|Mitsuha {{wakes up}} in Taki's body at the shrine. Although <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> each other's presence, they are {{separated}} by three years. However, when twilight falls, they return to their own bodies and meet. They attempt to write each other's names on their hands so they will remember each other, but twilight passes and Mitsuha disappears before she can write hers.|$|E
25|$|Bedwetting alarms: Physicians also {{frequently}} suggest bedwetting alarms which sound a loud tone when <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> moisture. This can help condition {{the child to}} wake at the sensation of a full bladder. These alarms are considered effective, with study participants being 13 {{times more likely to}} become dry at night. There is a 29% to 69% relapse rate, however, so the treatment may need to be repeated.|$|E
60|$|There was a silence--as far, at least, {{as he and}} {{she were}} concerned. In the outer world, beyond the piece of scenery under whose shelter they stood, {{stirring}} things, loud and exciting things, seemed to be happening. Some sort of an argument {{appeared to be in}} progress. The rasping voice of Mr. Goble was making itself heard from the unseen auditorium. These things <b>they</b> <b>sensed</b> vaguely, but <b>they</b> were too occupied with each other to ascertain details.|$|R

25|$|There can {{be unique}} {{challenges}} {{in the treatment of}} BPD, such as hospital care. In psychotherapy, a client may be unusually sensitive to rejection and abandonment and may react negatively (e.g., by harming themselves or withdrawing from treatment) if <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> this. In addition, clinicians may emotionally distance themselves from individuals with BPD for self-protection or due to the stigma associated with the diagnosis, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy and a cycle of stigmatization to which both patient and therapist can contribute.|$|E
25|$|Self-verification theory {{predicts that}} when people {{interact}} with others, {{there is a general}} tendency for them to bring others to see them as they see themselves. This tendency is especially pronounced when they start out believing that the other person has misconstrued them, apparently because people compensate by working especially hard to bring others to confirm their self-views. People will even stop working on tasks to which they have been assigned if <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> that their performance is eliciting non-verifying feedback.|$|E
25|$|Pharaoh ant colonies {{appear to}} prefer {{familiar}} nests to novel nests while budding. This suggests {{the ability for}} colonies to remember certain qualities of their living space. However, if the novel (unfamiliar) nest is of superior quality, the colony may initially move toward the familiar, but will eventually select the unfamiliar. The colony assumes the familiar nest is preferable, unless <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> better qualities in the novel nest. This decision-making process seeks to minimize the time the colony is without a nest while optimizing the nest the colony finally chooses.|$|E

25|$|The {{goal of a}} trafficker is to turn a {{human being}} into a slave. To do this, {{perpetrators}} employ tactics {{that can lead to}} the psychological consequence of learned helplessness for the victims, where <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> that they no longer have any autonomy or control over their lives. Traffickers may hold their victims captive, expose them to large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in isolation, or withhold food or sleep. During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, guilt and self-blame, anger and rage, and sleep disturbances, PTSD, numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of learned helplessness.|$|E
25|$|In {{heteroecious}} species, the aphids spend winter on tree or bush primary hosts; in summer, they {{migrate to}} their secondary host on a herbaceous plant, then the gynoparae {{return to the}} tree in autumn. The pea aphid has a primary host of a perennial vetch and secondary of the annual pea. This is likely due to the decline of food quality in trees during the summer, as well as overcrowding amongst aphids which <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> when they bump into each other too often. The heteroecious life cycle (which is mainly linked to consumption of angiosperms and represents 10% of all aphids) {{is believed to have}} evolved from the ancestral autoecious form (on conifers); this is believed to have reverted to the ancestral form in some species that were once heteroecious.|$|E
25|$|Eggs: The name {{given to}} the Derlavaian {{equivalent}} of bombs and shells, eggs are thin metal shells filled with magical energy which burst, or explode, when they impact a target or are triggered by an appropriate spell. A variety of uses for eggs are seen in the series. Armies launch them like shells from magically powered 'egg-tossers', which may be standalone devices or mounted on ley-line ships or behemoths. Dragons can carry eggs beneath their bellies for their fliers to drop on enemy forces or cities. Eggs may also be buried {{in the ground and}} enchanted to explode like landmines if <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> pressure, or can be buried along ley lines and set to explode if a ley line caravan passes over them, which simultaneously destroys the caravan and overloads the ley line's controlling spells. Leviathan riders also use eggs for mining enemy ships. Later in the series, the Algarvian army develops a hand held egg which can be thrown like a hand grenade; these eggs are encased in small pottery sugar bowls rather than metal shells.|$|E
5000|$|Lodestar was an {{experimental}} progressive rock band formed in 1996 by Heitham Al-Sayed (Lead Vocalist), John Morgan (Drums) and [...] "Haggis" [...] (Sound Engineer) after <b>they</b> left <b>Senser.</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{the laser}} group, the local {{anesthesia}} {{was carried out}} by the topical application of TAC 20 gel (20 % lidocaine, 4 % articaine, 2 % phenylephrine) to the area. Immediately after the beginning of the operation and also during the surgery, patients would be asked about their sensed pain and discomfort. If <b>they</b> <b>sensed</b> any pains, <b>they</b> would receive infiltration injection of 2 % lidocaine plus 1 : 100, 000 epinephrine, upon their request until the surgery was performed under complete local anesthesia. In the laser group, no patient asked for extra anesthesia.|$|R
5000|$|According to Inoki, Ali and {{his entourage}} had signed on expecting the fight to be an {{exhibition}} rather than a real contest. It was only {{when they went to}} see Inoki train six days before the fight, and saw him use a series of brutal drop-kicks and violent grapples on sparring partners, that <b>they</b> <b>sensed</b> it would be a legitimate fight. Inoki alleges he was asked by Ali [...] "OK, so when do we do the rehearsal?", with Inoki replying: [...] "No, no. This isn't an exhibition. It's a real fight!" ...|$|R
25|$|These ants {{exhibit a}} wide variety of behaviours, such as {{building}} rafts when <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> that water levels are rising. They also show necrophoric behaviour, where nestmates discard scraps or dead ants on refuse piles outside the nest. Foraging takes place on warm or hot days, although they may remain outside at night. Workers communicate by a series of semiochemicals and pheromones which are used for recruitment, foraging, and defence. They are omnivores and eat dead mammals, arthropods, insects, seeds, and sweet substances such as honeydew from hemipteran insects with whom they have developed relationships. Predators include arachnids, birds and many insects including other ants, dragonflies, earwigs, and beetles. The ant is a host to parasites and to a number of pathogens, nematodes, and viruses which have been viewed as potential biological control agents. Nuptial flight occurs during the warm seasons, and the alates may mate for as long as 30 minutes. Colony founding can be done via a single queen or a group of queens, who will later contest for dominance once the first workers emerge. Workers can live for several months while queens can live for years; colony numbers can vary from 100,000 to 250,000 individuals. Two forms of society in the red imported fire ant exist: polygynous colonies (nests with multiple queens) and monogynous colonies (nests with one queen).|$|E
500|$|Guinea pigs {{can learn}} complex paths to food, and can {{accurately}} remember a learned path for months. Their strongest problem-solving strategy is motion. While guinea pigs can jump small obstacles, {{most of them}} are poor climbers, and are not particularly agile. They startle extremely easily, and either freeze in place for long periods or run for cover with rapid, darting motions when <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> danger. Larger groups of startled guinea pigs [...] "stampede", running in haphazard directions as a means of confusing predators. When excited, guinea pigs may repeatedly perform little hops in the air (known as [...] "popcorning"), a movement analogous to the ferret's war dance. They are also very good swimmers.|$|E
500|$|Black's fourth album, No Time to Kill was {{released}} {{almost a year}} after The Hard Way. [...] The album received mixed reviews. [...] The Houston Chronicle noted that Black's duet with Wynonna Judd, [...] "A Bad Goodbye", was [...] "precisely the kind of radio-ready, big-production ballad that record companies tend to force on their artists when <b>they</b> <b>sense</b> that their careers are in trouble....t sticks out like a sore thumb in his body of work." [...] On the other hand, a review in Time magazine thought the duet helped Black show his emotions more intensely. Some reviewers also noted that {{in some of the}} more serious songs on the album, Black's voice sounded strained.|$|E
