5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in 1918, Moltke, {{along with}} most of the High Seas Fleet, was interned at Scapa Flow pending a {{decision}} by the Allies as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the fleet. The ship met her end when she was scuttled, along with the rest of the High Seas Fleet in 1919 to prevent them from falling into British hands.

The ship met her end in 1919 when German caretaker crews scuttled their ships to prevent their division among Allied navies.

5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament contingent on the satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this reason that the West German government was sympathetic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour.|$|E
5|$|Austria {{is closely}} linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> {{prominent}} Russian diplomat and statesman Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov. He arrived in Vienna in 1833 {{as an adviser}} to the embassy, and, from 1854 to 1856, he led the Russian diplomatic mission. Gorchakov became Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austrian court at the most difficult period for Russia during the Crimean War, during which time he was able to preserve diplomatic relations with Austria and helped to overcome the international isolation of the Russian Empire and reinforced Russia's status as a great power. The Vienna Conference in 1855 was the first presence of Gorchakov in an international forum, and his performance in representing Russia at the Paris Conference of 1856 saw Alexander II appoint him as Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E

5|$|The {{survivors}} at the shingle, many facing combat for {{the first}} time, found themselves relatively well-protected from small arms fire, but still exposed to artillery and mortars. In front of them lay heavily mined flats exposed to active fire from the bluffs above. Morale naturally became a problem. Many groups were leaderless and witnesses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> neighboring troops and landings coming in around them. Wounded men on the beach were drowning in the incoming tide and incoming landing craft were being pounded and set ablaze.|$|E
5|$|After Richard's death, King John of England {{failed to}} {{effectively}} defend Normandy against Philip's ongoing campaigns between 1202 and 1204. Château de Falaise fell to Philip's forces, {{as well as}} castles from Mortain to Pontorson while Philip simultaneously besieged Rouen, which capitulated to French forces on 24June 1204, effectively ending Norman independence. Philip laid siege to Château Gaillard, which was captured after a long siege from September 1203 to March 1204. As Philip continued the siege throughout the winter and King John {{made no attempt to}} relieve the castle, {{it was only a matter}} of time before the castellan was forced to capitulate. The main source for the siege is Philippidos, a poem by William the Breton, Philip's chaplain. As a result, modern scholars have paid little attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the civilians of Les Andelys during the siege.|$|E
5|$|Although such a {{long-range}} {{attack on a}} state far from {{the centre of the}} Empire may seem extraordinary (the last time the Empire had attempted anything on this scale was the failed invasion of Sicily over one hundred and twenty years earlier), it can be explained in terms of Manuel's foreign policy, which was to use the Latins to ensure the survival of the Empire. This focus on the bigger picture of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt: it was believed that {{in the context of the}} wider struggle between the crusader states and the Islamic powers of the east, control of Egypt would be the deciding factor. It had become clear that the ailing Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt held the key <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the crusader states. If Egypt came out of its isolation and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad-Din, the crusader cause was in trouble.|$|E

5|$|Several large {{stones are}} set in the ground near gates or at points outside the walls of Ambohimanga. Rulers would stand atop these stones, each {{identified}} by distinct names, to deliver speeches to the public. To the south were the stones called Ambatomasina and Ambatomenaloha, while Ambatorangotina was situated to the northwest. The latter stone was of particular importance: here the twelve leaders of the Ambatofotsy clan first declared their rejection of Andrianjafy's rule and their allegiance to his nephew, Andrianampoinimerina. Upon taking the throne, Andrianampoinimerina used this site to first declare new laws and decrees that would later be announced throughout the kingdom. This was also the main site at Ambohimanga for dispensing justice. After Andrianampoinimerina's succession to the throne, he sacrificed a black zebu whose mother had died, named Lemainty ("black one"), with repeated spear thrusts; after its death, the animal was cut into pieces and buried on the site. Lemainty was thereafter regularly invoked in royal speeches and decrees to allude <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> those who misguidedly sought to forsake the protection of their guardian, the sovereign, and his laws.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Civil War and First and Second World Wars in the 20th century caused {{damage to}} many castle keeps across Europe; in particular, the famous keep at Coucy was {{destroyed}} by the German Army in 1917. By the late 20th century, however, the conservation of castle keeps formed part of government policy across France, England, Ireland, and Spain. In the 21st century in England, most keeps are in ruins and form part of the tourism and heritage industries, rather than being used as functioning buildings – the keep of Windsor Castle being a rare exception. This is contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> bergfried towers in Germany, large numbers of which were restored as functional buildings in the late 19th and early 20th century, often as government offices or youth hostels, or the modern conversion of tower houses, which in many cases have become modernised domestic homes.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the U class is complex as it is linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the 2-cylinder K ("River") class 2-6-4 tank locomotives. The design work had for a new {{passenger}} 2-6-0 with 6ft (1.83 m) driving wheels was complete by 1927, when the involvement of a K class locomotive in the Sevenoaks rail crash presented an opportunity to bring forward construction of the class. The K class tank engines were the passenger counterpart to the N class 2-6-0 mixed-traffic design, and were noted for rough-riding over the cheaply laid track of the former SECR. The class was withdrawn from service, and the inquiry that followed determined that the rough-riding contributed to the crash. Its recommendation was that the K class should be rebuilt to 2-6-0 tender locomotives, using tried and tested features used by Maunsell and his assistant, the former GWR engineer Harold Holcroft on the N class.|$|E
