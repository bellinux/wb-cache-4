FSL constructs can then be printed onto solid surfaces using a standard desktop printer and are being used to develop prototype diagnostic assays (Bovin et al, 2011). The constructs can be printed as words or in desired patterns. FSL constructs comprising ABO blood group antigens or biotin as the functional head groups (F) have been printed onto silica, nitrocellulose and paper. The printed constructs have then been used to identify antibodies in different biological samples. The inkjet printing of FSL constructs provides the advantage that multiple antibodies can be identified and quantified in the same reaction well.

40|$|The {{ability to}} modify/visualize {{biological}} surfaces, and then study the modified cell/virion {{in a range}} of in vitro and in vivo environments is essential to gaining further insight into the function of specific molecules or the entire entity. Studies of biological surface modification are generally limited to genetic engineering of the organism or the covalent attachment of chemical moieties to the cell surface 1, 2. However these traditional techniques expose the cell to chemical reactants, or they require significant manipulation to achieve the desired outcome, making them cumbersome, and they may also inadvertently affect the viability/functionality of the modified cell. A simple method to harmlessly modify the surface of cells is required. Recently a new technology, KODE Technology has introduced a range of novel constructs consisting of three components: a functional head group (F), a spacer (S) and a lipid <b>tail</b> (<b>L)</b> and are known as Function-Spacer-Lipid or FSL constructs 3. The spacer (S) is selected to provide a construct that is dispersible in water, yet will spontaneously and stably incorporate into a membrane. FSL construct functional moieties (F) so far include a range of saccharides including blood group-related determinants, sialic acids, hyaluronan polysaccharides, fluorophores, biotin, radiolabels, and a range of peptides 3 - 12. FSL constructs have been used in modifying embryos, spermatozoa, zebrafish, epithelial/endometrial cells, red blood cells, and virions to create quality controls systems and diagnostic panels, to modify cell adhesion / interaction / separation / immobilization, and for in vitro and in vivo imaging of cells/virions 3 - 12...|$|E
40|$|Transposable {{elements}} (TEs) are DNA sequences {{capable of}} mobilizing and multiply within the genome {{of a host}} organism in both somatic and germ found in many species. In humans, comprise approximately 45 % of the genetic material and, therefore, is not an insignificant fact, since although {{not part of the}} coding DNA (1. 5 %) are the largest source of variability among humans. TEs are divided into class I elements or retrotransposons (LTR as retroviruses and non-LTR as LINE, SINE and SVA) and class II or DNA transposons. This work is a review of TEs in humans, particularly LINE- 1 retrotransposons (L 1) and their impact on the human genome as well as the most characteristic disease-causing mutations caused directly by these, not in trans by other elements as Alu or SVA. The reason to focus only on the L 1 retrotransposon mutagenesis is because they are the most abundant elements in whole human genome (16. 9 %), in addition to being the only currently active and autonomous elements, unlike Alu or SVA, which are active but non-autonomous.

40|$|Vasopressin binding to the V 2 {{receptor}} in renal principal cells {{leads to}} activation of protein kinase A, phosphorylation of aquaporin 2 (AQP 2) at Ser 256, and the translocation of AQP 2 to the apical membrane, resulting in {{concentration of the}} urine. In contrast, phorbol ester-induced activation of protein kinase C pathway leads to ubiquitination of AQP 2 at Lys 270 and its internalization to multivesicular bodies, where it is targeted for lysosomal degradation or stored for recycling. Because {{little is known about}} the regulation of AQP 2 trafficking, we used the carboxy-terminal tail of constitutively nonphosphorylated AQP 2 (S 256 A) as a bait for interacting proteins in a yeast two-hybrid assay. We isolated lysosomal trafficking regulator-interacting protein 5 (LIP 5) and found that LIP 5 interacted with the proximal carboxy-terminal <b>tail</b> (<b>L</b> 230 -D 243) of AQP 2 in vitro but not with AQP 3 or AQP 4, which are also expressed in principal cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed that LIP 5 co-localized with AQP 2 in principal cells. LIP 5 binding occurred independent of the state of Ser 256 phosphorylation or Lys 270 ubiquitination. LIP 5 has been shown to facilitate degradation of the EGF receptor; here, LIP 5 seemed to bind this receptor. Knockdown of LIP 5 in mouse renal cells (mpkCCD) reduced the phorbol ester-induced degradation of AQP 2 approximately two-fold. In summary, LIP 5 binds cargo proteins and, considering the role of LIP 5 in protein sorting to multivesicular bodies, plays a role in the degradation of AQP 2, possibly by reducing the formation of late endosomes...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The oleanane triterpene saponin PX- 6518, {{with known}} potent in vitro and in vivo {{activity}} against Leishmania donovani, was investigated for its spectrum against the cutaneous species Leishmania mexicana, Leishmania panamensis and Leishmania major. Methods: In vitro activity {{was based on}} the reduction of amastigotes in primary peritoneal mouse macro-phages. BALB/c mice were injected with 2 × 106 amastigotes in the base of the <b>tail</b> (<b>L.</b> panamensis and L. major) or the foot (L. mexicana) and subcutaneously treated with PX- 6518 [1 – 10 mg/kg body weight (BW) ] or Pentostamw (250 mg/kg BW SbV eq). Evolution of skin lesions was monitored in a prophylactic dose-finding study, and early curative [6 weeks post-infection (pi) ] and late curative (. 8 – 10 weeks pi) studies. Results: While moderate susceptibility to PX- 6518 was obtained in vitro (IC 50 : 1 – 4 mg/mL), excellent in vivo activity was demonstrated. In the prophylactic study (six administrations on alternate days, starting at 1 day pi), PX- 6518 was 100 % effective at 1 mg/kg BW against L. mexicana and L. panamensis, whereas L. major lesions could be prevented at 2 mg/kg BW. In the early curative (1 mg/kg BW once a week for 4 weeks) and late curative (1 mg/kg BW twice a week for 4 weeks) studies, PX- 6518 completely healed L. mex-icana and L. panamensis lesions, whereas L. major lesions were reduced by 50 %. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that PX- 6518 possesses potent and broad-spectrum prophylactic and curative efficacy against cutaneous leishmaniasis in the BALB/c mouse model.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{three different}} models of N non-intersecting Brownian motions {{on a line}} segment [0,L] with absorbing (model A), periodic (model B) and reflecting (model C) boundary conditions. In these three cases we study a properly normalized reunion probability, which, in model A, can also be interpreted as the maximal height of N non-intersecting Brownian excursions on the unit time interval. We provide a detailed derivation of the exact formula for these reunion probabilities for finite N using a Fermionic path integral technique. We then analyse the asymptotic behavior of this reunion probability for large N using two complementary techniques: (i) a saddle point analysis of the underlying Coulomb gas and (ii) orthogonal polynomial method. These two methods are complementary {{in the sense that}} they work in two different regimes, respectively for L≪ O(√(N)) and L≥ O(√(N)). A striking feature of the large N limit of the reunion probability in the three models is that it exhibits a third-order phase transition when the system size L crosses a critical value L=L_c(N) ∼√(N). This transition is akin to the Douglas-Kazakov transition in two-dimensional continuum Yang-Mills theory. While the central part of the reunion probability, for L ∼ L_c(N), is described in terms of the Tracy-Widom distributions (associated to GOE and GUE depending on the model), the emphasis of the present study is on the large deviations of these reunion probabilities, both in the right [L ≫ L_c(N) ] and the left [L ≪ L_c(N) ] tails. In particular, for model B, we find that the matching between the different regimes corresponding to typical L ∼ L_c(N) and atypical fluctuations in the right <b>tail</b> <b>L</b> ≫ L_c(N) is rather unconventional, compared to the usual behavior found for the distribution of the largest eigenvalue of GUE random matrices.

40|$|I° Abstract: E 3 {{ubiquitin}} ligases give specificity to the ubiquitylation {{process by}} selectively binding substrates. Recently, their function {{has emerged as}} a crucial modulator of T-cell tolerance and immunity. However, substrates, partners and mechanism of action for most E 3 ligases remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified the human T-cell co-receptor CD 8 a-chain as binding partner of the ligand of Numb proteins X 1 (LNX 1 p 80 isoform) and X 2 (LNX 2). Both LNX mRNAs were found expressed in T cells purified from human blood, and both proteins interacted with CD 8 a in human HPB-ALL T cells. By using an in vitro assay and a heterologous expression system we showed that the interaction is mediated by the PDZ (PSD 95 -DlgA-ZO- 1) domains of LNX proteins and the cytosolic C-terminal valine motif of CD 8 a. Moreover, CD 8 a redistributed LNX 1 or LNX 2 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, whereas, remarkably, LNX 1 or LNX 2 promoted CD 8 a ubiquitylation, downregulation from the plasma membrane, transport to the lysosomes, and degradation. Our findings highlight the function of LNX proteins as E 3 ligases and suggest a mechanism of regulation for CD 8 a localization at the plasma membrane by ubiquitylation and endocytosis. II° Abstract: Familial exudative vitreorethinopaty (FEVR) is an hereditary ocular disorder caused by an insufficient vascularization of the periferal retina during development. The resulting hypoxia actives a compensatory vascularization but the new vessels are prone to rapture causing exudates and bleeding followed by scarring, retinal detachment and blindness. Mutations in Frizzled 4 (Fz 4), a member of the cell surface Wnt family receptors, were found in many FEVR patients. In a autosomal dominant form of FEVR (the most frequent and henceforth referred as Fz 4 -FEVR), the deletion of two nucleotides leads to the synthesis of a completely different and truncated cytosolic <b>tail</b> (<b>L</b> 501 fsX 533). This receptor is retained in the ER and somehow traps Fz 4 by oligomerization, thus performing its dominant effect. We confirmed the ER retention of Fz 4 -FEVR in transfected cells and observed the formation of oligomers of high molecular weigth in a time dependent manner, suggesting that oligomerization plays a role in the localization of the mutant. Interestingly, when we replaced the cytosolic tail of the G glycoprotein coded by the ts- 045 mutant strain of VSV (VSVG) with the tail of wilde-type or mutant receptor, the chimeric VSVG-Fz 4 -FEVR was completely retained in the ER, whereas VSVG-Fz 4 exited from the ER. Thus, the Fz 4 -FEVR tail is sufficient to determine ER localization. In addition, performing a competition experiment, we found that overexpression of a peptide coding FEVR tail resulted in the recovery of the cell surface expression of Fz-FEVR, suggesting that its retention in the ER is protein-mediated. Most importantly, we found with a proteomic approach a new interactor of both Fz 4 wt and Fz 4 -FEVR, the αB-Crystallin protein. This interaction was not tail dependent, suggesting that the three cytosolic loops of the receptor may be involved. αB-Crystallin overexpression promoted cell surface expression of Fz 4 -FEVR and prevented its dominant negative effect on the wild-type counterpart. Thus, αB-Crystallin might represent an important tool to contrast FEVR. Current effort is focused to identify the specific interactor(s) responsible of the retention in the ER of Fz 4 -FEVR in order to identify others possible therapeutic target(s) ...|$|E

40|$|The Escherichia coli autoregulatory ribosomal protein L 20 {{consists}} of two structurally distinct domains. The C-terminal domain is globular {{and sits on the}} surface of the large ribosomal subunit whereas the N-terminal domain has an extended shape and penetrates deep into the RNA-rich core of the subunit. Many other ribosomal proteins have analogous internal or terminal extensions. However, the biological functions of these extended domains remain obscure. Here we show that the N-terminal <b>tail</b> of <b>L</b> 20 is important for ribosome assembly in vivo. Indeed, a truncated version of L 20 without its N-terminal tail is unable to complement the deletion of rplT, the gene encoding L 20. In addition, this L 20 truncation confers a lethal-dominant phenotype, suggesting that the N-terminal domain is essential for cell growth because it could be required for ribosome assembly. Supporting this hypothesis, partial deletions of the N-terminal tail of the protein are shown to cause a slow-growth phenotype due to altered ribosome assembly in vivo as large amounts of intermediate 40 S ribosomal particles accumulate. In addition to being a ribosomal protein, L 20 also acts as an autogenous repressor. Using L 20 truncations, we also show that the N-terminal <b>tail</b> of <b>L</b> 20 is dispensable for autogenous control...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{systematic}} attempt to investigate two conjectures about {{the distribution of}} company rates of profit: {{that it should be}} log-normal (Gibrat 1931), and that it should be gamma distributed (Farjoun and Machover 1983). A large set of company accounts data is analysed, and partial support found for Gibrat and for a generalised version of Farjoun and Machover. The analysis includes a demonstration of different empirical distributions for different profit rate measures, a demonstration of power law tails in all measures of the profit rate, and a demonstration of size effects (differences in tail weights) in financial ratios. Annual variation in the overall skewness and kurtosis of profit rate distributions is shown to be dominated by variation in the power law <b>tails.</b> <b>L</b> -moments, a recent innovation in robust methods to deal with extreme values, are used in conjunction with a size-weighted sampling scheme to identify possible models for distributions of the profit rate at the capital level. Farjoun and Machover derive their hypothesis from a particular conception of the process of capitalist competition. A rival conception, that of Glick (1985), is tested using company accounts data and shown to be vulnerable to criticism concerning the scope of its data set, the test statistic employed, and its choice of profit rate measure. More fundamentally, it is also dependent on doubtful premises about the within-industry distribution of profit rates, as L-moment analysis demonstrates.
