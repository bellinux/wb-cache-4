The model has evolved over the years to incorporate institutional power relationships (i.e., police-citizen, boss-employee) and informal ones (i.e. man-woman, rich-poor, adult-youth, parent-child).

500|$|In 1883, the Royal College of Music {{was set up}} {{to replace}} the {{short-lived}} and unsuccessful National Training School for Music (NTSM). Neither the NTSM nor the longer-established Royal Academy of Music had provided adequate musical training for professional orchestral players, and the founder-director of the college, George Grove, was determined that the new institution should succeed in doing so. His two principal allies in this undertaking were the violinist Henry Holmes and Stanford. In a study of the founding of the college, David Wright notes that Stanford had two main reasons for supporting Grove's aim. The first was his belief that a capable college orchestra was essential <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>students</b> of composition the chance to experience the sound of their music. His second reason was the severe contrast between the competence of German orchestras and the performance of their British counterparts. He accepted Grove's offer of the posts of professor of composition and (with Holmes) conductor of the college orchestra. He held the professorship {{for the rest of his}} life; among the best known of his many pupils were Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams, John Ireland, Frank Bridge and Arthur Bliss.|$|E
500|$|Vocational programs, {{known as}} Career and College Tech Prep classes, are {{available}} at the school and through the Six District Educational Compact, which includes the Cuyahoga Falls, Hudson, Stow-Munroe Falls, Tallmadge, and Woodridge school districts. [...] The compact, established in 1969, combines and shares the vocational programs and resources of member schools and allows students to participate in the programs that are offered at each of the schools even if the program is at another building. [...] There are 25 programs, six of which are College Tech Prep Initiative programs that allow students to earn both high school and college credits. [...] The remaining 19 programs are Career Programs designed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>students</b> training and work experience. [...] College Tech Prep programs housed at Roosevelt include programs in athletic healthcare and fitness, manufacturing and engineering, landscape horticulture, and teaching. [...] Career Programs housed at Roosevelt include two business-related programs, computer-aided design and manufacturing technologies, construction and remodeling, cosmetology, electronics, health technology, marketing, and out-of-school internships. [...] Additional programs available through the compact that are housed at other schools include aviation, culinary arts, theater arts, automotive repair and technology, banking and finance, and early childhood educational aide training. [...] Each program also has co-curricular component, meaning they have both in-class and outside requirements and responsibilities that are factored into the student's overall grade. [...] One example is the Roosevelt chapter of DECA, {{which is part of the}} marketing education program. [...] In 2016, DECA members representing Roosevelt advanced to the international competition for the 30th consecutive year.|$|E
