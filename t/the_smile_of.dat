5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for his second}} film, Enam Djam di Jogja (Six Hours in Yogyakarta), Ismail recalled Djajakusuma to Jakarta. For the film, Djajakusuma helped Ismail adapt the General Assault of 1 March 1949 for the screen. Production was completed on a low budget; Djajakusuma later recalled that their camera had to be powered by a car battery. Despite this and other difficulties, Djajakusuma stayed on after the film's completion, completing another work for Perfini, Dosa Tak Berampun (Unforgivable Sin), later that year. Ismail served as director for this film, {{about a man who}} leaves his family after he is transfixed by <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> <b>of</b> a waitress.|$|E

2500|$|His two {{immediate}} successors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, {{later recalled}} the warm {{qualities of the}} late pontiff in several addresses. In Italy, he is remembered with the appellatives of [...] "Il Papa del Sorriso" [...] (The Smiling Pope) and [...] "Il Sorriso di Dio" [...] (<b>The</b> <b>smile</b> <b>of</b> God).

2500|$|Hazlitt {{concludes with}} a note—in line with his {{practise}} in The Spirit of the Age—on Moore's personal character, observing that [...] "Mr. Moore is in private life an amiable and estimable man." [...] Hazlitt's resentment, however, of Moore's dissuading Byron from participating in Hunt's periodical, to which Hazlitt had also contributed, increasingly colours his account as he winds down to a conclusion. Moore, Hazlitt asserts, wants to have things both ways, identifying with the people and with liberal causes, {{yet at the same}} time moving in aristocratic circles above the masses. While he stands fast by his patriotic beliefs and [...] "vindicates his own dignity" [...] (thereby preventing his ever being accepted in royal circles), Moore [...] "has been ... accustomed to the society of Whig Lords, and ... enchanted with <b>the</b> <b>smile</b> <b>of</b> beauty and fashion ... [...] "There is", [...] Hazlitt claims, [...] "a little servility and pandering to aristocratic pride" [...] in Moore's actions, and Moore is too ready to [...] "advise a Noble Peer to get as fast as possible out of a certain publication ... [...] "Does Mr. Moore," [...] Hazlitt disappointedly wonders aloud, [...] "insist on the double claim of birth and genius as a title to respectability in all advocates of the popular side—but himself?" ...|$|E
