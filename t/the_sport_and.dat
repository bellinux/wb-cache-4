40|$|In {{order to}} ensure the {{satisfaction}} of the users, the hotels are expanding their offer with various <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> recreational facilities. <b>The</b> basic requirements for the realisation of <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> recreational programmes are expert staff, adequate space and interesting programme. The aim {{of this paper is}} to determine the satisfaction of the users with certain aspects of the quality of <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> recreational offer in four Novi Sad hotels. There were 98 respondents involved in the research. The results showed that there are significant differences in the evaluation of the quality in terms of prices, working hours, programme content and the hotel accessibility. The results also showed that the hotel rank is not related to the users’ satisfaction with the quality of <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> recreational facility offer. Constant innovations of the locales and their equipment, the personalisation of <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> recreational programmes, hiring expert staff <b>and</b> <b>sports</b> animators but also adjusting all of the offer elements to the local population is essential to achieve users’ satisfaction with <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> recreational offer and generate the income for the organisation – hotel...|$|R

5|$|On May 18, 2017 sources {{confirmed}} that Cotto had parted ways with promoter Roc Nation Sports. One {{of the main}} reasons for the split was due to not having an opponent lined up even though he mentioned 2017 would be his last year in <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> he would like to have had two fights. A fight with Japanese boxer Yoshihiro Kamegai (27-3-2, 24 KOs) was penciled in for June 24, but fell through. HBO also did not back the fight.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} greeted warmly by the {{majority}} of the boxing community, with many experts believing the Rocky character is still a key symbol of <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> that the boxing scenes were the most realistic of any film.

5|$|Wales did not field an {{international}} team until the IRFB, {{supported by the}} RFU, recommended that the WFU be readmitted into the organisation in February 1898.

Gould accepted the ruling but returned to rugby as a referee and Welsh international selector. The compromise prevented a long term split in <b>the</b> <b>sport,</b> <b>and</b> by 1901 the IRFB added laws to the game banning professionalism to clarify their authority on the issue.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the more}} {{original}} castings was Anette Sagen, the world's leading female ski jumper, {{in her first}} film role. Sagen, 22 at the time, played the part of 70-year-old Owe's ski jumping mother, although in a younger incarnation. Hamer had already considered Sagen for the role, when he ran into her by chance at the Holmenkollen Ski Museum. Without knowing to whom he was talking, Hamer mentioned that he was shooting a film in this location, and was planning to ask Anette Sagen to be in it. The reason the theme of ski jumping was chosen was that Hamer's own mother performed <b>the</b> <b>sport,</b> <b>and</b> the film {{has been described as}} a tribute to all female ski jumpers. Sagen herself had also earlier been involved in a controversy over women's access to professional venues and competitions. Incidentally, Sagen and Owe are also both from the Norwegian town of Mosjøen.|$|E

In the 1940 biographical film Knute Rockne, All American documenting the life of famous Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, Cedar Point is featured at a pivotal point in the story. In 1913, Knute works as a lifeguard on a beach at Cedar Point, {{where he and his}} college roommate Gus Dorais worked on the forward pass. The concept, which was first used in a scrimmage game at Cedar Point, would revolutionize <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> the film would later be preserved in the Library of Congress National Film Registry. In 2004, an independently-produced film, Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind: Infestation From Mars, was shot at several historic locations around Sandusky including Cedar Point. Dick Kinzel, CEO of Cedar Fair at the time, had a brief speaking role in the film.|$|E
5|$|Forti {{graduated}} to Formula One as a constructor and entrant in , but its first carthe Forti FG01proved to be uncompetitive, {{and the team}} failed to score a point. Despite this setback, Forti was committed to a three-year deal with Diniz, which was broken when Pedro moved to the Ligier team prior to the 1996 season, taking most of the team's sponsorship money with him. Nevertheless, Forti continued to compete in <b>the</b> <b>sport,</b> <b>and</b> produced the much-improved FG03 chassis, before succumbing to financial problems mid-season after an ultimately fruitless deal with a mysterious entity known as Shannon Racing. The team competed {{in a total of}} 27Grands Prix, scoring no points, and is recognised as one of the last truly privateer teams to race in an era when many large car manufacturers were increasing their involvement in the sport.|$|E
5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, {{which has been}} divided into three classes since 1997: 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Former classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and Sidecar. The premier class is MotoGP, which was {{formerly known as the}} 500cc class. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship in existence. The motorcycles used in MotoGP are purpose built for <b>the</b> <b>sport,</b> <b>and</b> are unavailable for purchase by the general public because they cannot be legally ridden on public roads. From the mid-1970s to 2002, the top class of GP racing allowed 500cc with a maximum of four cylinders, regardless of whether the engine was a two-stroke or four-stroke. Rule changes were introduced in 2002, to facilitate the phasing out of two-stroke engines.|$|E
