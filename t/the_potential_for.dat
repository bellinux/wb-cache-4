5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, a {{tropical}} storm watch was posted along of the Gulf Coast of Florida from Pensacola to Cedar Key on August15. Later that day, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning that extended from Fort Walton Beach to Yankeetown. The warning was discontinued for areas west of Apalachicola, and by 12:00UTC on August16, all tropical cyclone warnings and watches were lifted. Initially, the public advisories issued by the National Hurricane Center on the storm warned primarily of heavy rain, as Beryl was expected to remain a weak cyclone. However, when the storm slowed in forward motion and <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> intensification increased, the advisories emphasized <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> coastal flooding. Tornado watches were issued for parts of Florida. Flash flood watches and warnings were also declared for parts of the state.|$|E

5|$|Nations and {{international}} businesses face {{an array of}} financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk is <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies {{and their impact on}} normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the host country. Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> unanticipated developments in a host country to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.|$|E
