Some {{lamented the}} use of poor white Southerners, and {{one-dimensional}} black victims, and Granville Hicks labeled the book [...] "melodramatic and contrived". When the book was first released, Southern writer Flannery O'Connor commented, [...] "I think for a child's book it does all right. It's interesting that all <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>that</b> are buying it don't know they're reading a child's book. Somebody ought to say what it is." [...] Carson McCullers apparently agreed with the Time magazine review, writing to a cousin: [...] "Well, honey, one thing {{we know is that}} she's been poaching on my literary preserves." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{woman looked}} down, {{probably}} with an inward anxiety between {{the fear of}} asking too much and the folly of asking too little. She said, tentatively: [...] "Some of <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>that</b> come over from the hotels say they {{pay as much as}} twenty dollars a week." ...|$|E

60|$|Now Tom he got {{all that}} notion out of Walter Scott's book, {{which he was}} always reading. And it WAS a wild notion, because in my opinion he never could've raised the men, and if he did, as like as not he would've got licked.

6000|$|Something in {{the tone}} of her {{ejaculation}} increased Spindler's embarrassment, but it also made him desperate.

60|$|He {{looked at}} me with a signal in his eye; and the five chiefs {{looked at me}} civilly enough, but kind of pointed; and the people looked at me and craned and jostled.

6000|$|... "You know {{during the}} war we had the Undesirable Element, the Reds and walking delegates and just the plain common grouches, dead to rights, and so did we {{for quite a while}} after the war, but folks forget about the danger and that gives these cranks a chance to begin working {{underground}} again, especially a lot of these parlor socialists. Well, it's up to <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>that</b> do a little sound thinking to make a conscious effort to keep bucking these fellows. Some guy back East has organized a society called the Good Citizens' League for just that purpose. Of course the Chamber of Commerce and the American Legion and so on do a fine work in keeping the decent people in the saddle, but they're devoted to so many other causes that they can't attend to this one problem properly. But the Good Citizens' League, the G. C. L., they stick right to it. Oh, the G. C. L. has to have some other ostensible purposes--frinstance here in Zenith I think it ought to support the park-extension project and the City Planning Committee--and then, too, it should have a social aspect, being made up of the best people--have dances and so on, especially {{as one of the best}} ways it can put the kibosh on cranks is to apply this social boycott business to folks big enough so you can't reach 'em otherwise. Then if that don't work, the G. C. L. can finally send a little delegation around to inform folks that get too flip that they got to conform to decent standards and quit shooting off their mouths so free. Don't it sound like the organization could do a great work? We've already got some of the strongest men in town, and of course we want you in. How about it?" ...|$|E
