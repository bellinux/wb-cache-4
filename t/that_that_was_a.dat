Guaiacol, instead of a full creosote solution, was suggested by Hermann Sahli in 1887; he argued it had the active chemical of creosote and had the advantage of being of definite composition and of having a less unpleasant taste and odor. A number of solutions of both creosote and guaiacol appeared on the market, such as phosphotal and guaicophosphal, phosphites of creosote and guaiacol; eosot and geosot, valerinates of creosote and guaicol; phosot and taphosot, phosphate and tannophospate of creosote; and creosotal and tanosal, tannates of creosote. Creosote and eucalptus oil were also a remedy used together, administered through a vaporizor and inhaler. Since then, more effective and safer treatments for tuberculosis have been developed.|$|E

The exhibit was described as [...] "a fictional secret society of African-American intellectuals, a cross between Mensa and the Masons" [...] <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> challenge to either condemn or endorse.|$|E
500|$|When Pee-wee's fame started growing, Reubens {{started to}} move away from the spotlight, keeping his name under wraps and making all his public {{appearance}} and interviews in character while billing Pee-wee as playing himself; Reubens was trying to [...] "get the public to think <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> real person". Later on he would even prefer his parents be known only as Honey Herman and Herman Herman. In the early and mid-1980s, Reubens made several guest appearances on Late Night with David Letterman as Pee-wee Herman which gave Pee-wee an even bigger following. During the mid-1980s, Reubens traveled the United States with a whole new The Pee-wee Herman Show, playing notably at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Caroline's in New York City and, in 1984, in front of a full Carnegie Hall.|$|E

500|$|Pinkner {{thought the}} added musical element {{improved}} the episode, {{because it gave}} insights into each of the characters' psyches. According to Wyman and Pinkner, the [...] "episode {{was supposed to be}} a fantastical episode in the first place, and so the music supports the storytelling". Wyman continued in a different interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "Noirs traditionally are morality tales, and that's kind of what we're doing. We felt <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great way to get across Walter's mind frame and where his head is at right now, with his son missing". Other cast members also praised the added music. John Noble wrote [...] "It really deepened and blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking. We get [...] fractured take on the world and his condition now that Peter has left. The music really supports the storytelling". He added, [...] "It is like a mind-trip of Walter's. It is Walter trying to grapple with the fact that his son is gone". Jasika Nicole continued: [...] "I have a musical theater background, so I've been waiting for some moment in some realm of where I am in TV and film for this to happen and, you know, of course, when Glee came on the air I was like, 'Great, that was my chance,' and I'm in this show, which I love this show, but I'm never going to sing and dance in this show. And I did! It's so awesome!" [...] Swerling called it [...] "the longest and possibly most difficult episode of the season" [...] to create.|$|E

2500|$|Burns was in {{financial}} difficulties {{due to his}} want of success in farming, and to {{make enough money to}} support a family he took up a friend's offer of work in Jamaica. Burns was to be the bookkeeper for Charles Douglas who ran the Springbank estate for his brother, the Earl (?) of Mure. [...] The estate was about 1.5 miles SSW of Port Antonio, Portland parish, on the NE coast of Jamaica. [...] It may have been Springbank, but it is now Spring Bank Rd that leads to the ruins of the great house. [...] It has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> position for a single man, and that he would live in rustic conditions, not likely to be living in the great house at a salary of £30 per annum. The position that Burns accepted was as a bookkeeper on a slave plantation. Burns's egalitarian views were typified by [...] "The Slave's Lament" [...] six years later, but in 1786 there was little public awareness of the abolitionist movement that began about that time.|$|E

Usher also said <b>that</b> the work <b>was</b> like the dichotomy of Raymond v. Raymond, distinguishing one world from another, as in [...] "playing the nice guy" [...] or [...] "showing the other side." [...] Before official release, the song was leaked onto the Internet in December 2009.|$|R
