5|$|During {{the course}} of his work on 20/20, Stossel {{discovered}} Reason magazine, and found that the libertarian ideas of its writers made sense to him. Stossel was named co-anchor of 20/20 in May 2003, while he was writing his first book, Gimme a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became <b>the</b> <b>Scourge</b> <b>of</b> the Liberal Media, which was published in 2004. In it, he details his start in journalism and consumer reporting, and how he evolved to harbor libertarian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Erinys– The {{daughter}} of Thanatos. After {{the destruction of}} Atlantis, Erinys searched for Kratos, killing various Spartans as a warning for Kratos to stop his quest to find Deimos. Erinys eventually found Kratos in the Mounts of Aroania, and after a land battle, an aerial battle ensued as Erinys shape shifted into an enormous bird before being killed by Kratos, after which, Kratos took her power, <b>the</b> <b>Scourge</b> <b>of</b> Erinys.

5|$|Soul Rangers, {{players who}} have failed to become Harbingers, are {{described}} as miserable, skeletal scavengers, <b>the</b> <b>scourge</b> <b>of</b> The Other Side. Soul Rangers hunt down other players and steal their keystones. Soul Rangers were created during the game's development. Brett Clements wanted to introduce characters that players {{did not want to}} become, but he later found that players enjoyed the anarchic role of the Soul Ranger. The final character in the game is the Gatekeeper, whose job is to make sure the other characters cannot escape from The Other Side to the real world. The Gatekeeper's character is based on the old cemetery gatekeepers, whose job was to guard cemeteries from grave robbers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1967/68 season, John left Llanelli {{and joined}} Cardiff, where he formed a {{partnership}} with Gareth Edwards. Although John and Edwards later became <b>the</b> <b>scourge</b> <b>of</b> New Zealand, their first international pairing had an inauspicious start. On 11 November 1967, the pair played their first international together, facing Brian Lochore's touring New Zealand team. Edwards, like John, had two international games to his name, paired with Watkins {{in the final two}} matches of the 1967 Five Nations Championship. John regained his international place after Watkins had switched to professional rugby league just the month before, joining Salford for a club record fee of £16,000. Wales had an error-strewn game, in a match played in a cutting, rain-laden wind which turned the pitch into a muddy field. Wales captain Norman Gale won the toss and chose to play the first half into the gale, and finished the half 8–0 down. John raised Welsh hopes with an early dropped goal, his first international points, but a panicked blind back pass from Wales' number8, John Jeffery, gifted Bill Davies an easy try. The game ended 13–6 to New Zealand, with Edwards looking uncomfortable throughout, and John's kicking inaccurate, there was little to suggest the pair would become one of the great half-back pairings in rugby history.|$|E
5|$|Stossel {{has written}} three books. Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became <b>the</b> <b>Scourge</b> <b>of</b> the Liberal Media is a 2005 {{autobiography}} from Harper Perennial documenting {{his career and}} philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism. It describes his opposition to government regulation, his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel– Why Everything You Know Is Wrong, {{which was published in}} 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue. On April 10, 2012, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published Stossel's third book No, They Can't: Why Government Fails– But Individuals Succeed. It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does.|$|E

5|$|The series plot {{revolves}} around Sheriff Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith) {{and his life}} in sleepy, slow-paced fictional Mayberry, North Carolina. Sheriff Taylor's level-headed approach to law enforcement makes him <b>the</b> <b>scourge</b> <b>of</b> local moonshiners and out-of-town criminals, while his abilities to settle community problems with common-sense advice, mediation, and conciliation make him popular with his fellow citizens. His professional life, however, {{is complicated by the}} repeated gaffes of his inept deputy, Barney Fife (Don Knotts). Barney is portrayed as Andy's cousin in the first, second, and sixth episodes, but is never again referred to as such. Andy socializes with male friends in the Main Street barber shop and dates various ladies until a schoolteacher becomes his steady interest in season three. At home, Andy enjoys fishing trips with his son, Opie (Ronny Howard), and quiet evenings on the front porch with his maiden aunt and housekeeper, Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier). Opie tests his father's parenting skills season after season, and Aunt Bee's ill-considered romances and adventures cause her nephew concern.|$|E

25|$|The fleet {{arrived in}} Portsmouth on the 28th of August, and the ships were {{thoroughly}} searched {{when they arrived}} by the Queens troops, {{a consequence of the}} mass theft from the Madre de Deus two years earlier. Dom Nuno Velho Pereira and Dom Braz Correia had survived the explosion of the Chagas and were brought ashore as prisoners, where the Earl treated them well and entertained them for a whole year as his guests. They were then ransomed for 2500 ducats each; Pereira paid for both making Cumberland's 1594 expedition gain at least some reward. With this money the Earl then decided to finance and build a new, larger ship, rather than borrowing from the Queen; the new ship was launched in 1595 and was named by the Queen <b>the</b> <b>Scourge</b> <b>of</b> Malice.|$|E

25|$|During the Blitzkrieg {{operations}} of Fall Gelb and Fall Rot, as in Poland, {{it was the}} Stuka that stood out. The Stukas took a heavy toll of Allied Naval and Ground forces.

Although lightly armed, slow and unmaneuverable the Luftwaffe had established virtual air superiority and Stukas were to operate without much opposition. Regarded as 'flying artillery' the Stukas responded to Panzer Divisions calls by clearing up pockets of resistance along the axis of advance. The Stukas operated virtually at {{the limits of their}} range, until the introduction of the Ju 87R which provided extended range. Over 120 Stukas were destroyed or damaged during the campaign (mostly to ground fire), which represented nearly one-third of the Stuka-arms strength.|$|E
