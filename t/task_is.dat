5|$|In {{psychological}} assessments, the birthday-number {{effect has}} been exploited to measure implicit self-esteem. The Number Preference <b>Task</b> <b>is</b> often used {{in combination with the}} more popular Letter Preference Task, sometimes jointly called the Initials and Birthday Preference Task (IBPT). The most popular method to measure implicit self-esteem is the Implicit Association Test.|$|E

40|$|Synthesized {{auditory}} {{displays and}} speech recognizers {{were used in}} two experiments to de-velop guidelines for their implementation in military aircraft. In the first experiment, the competition between encoding and response modalities of concurrent <b>tasks</b> <b>was</b> examined. The memory search <b>task</b> <b>was</b> more susceptible to competition for visual encoding, whereas the tracking task bore the greater impact from shared manual responding. The second ex-periment examined competition between tasks for encoding and response modalities and the optimum assignment of modalities to a given task. A simulated flight <b>task</b> <b>was</b> performed concurrently with either a spatial task (target acquisition) or a verbal task (memory). Best performance and least interference with the flight <b>task</b> <b>were</b> obtained when the spatial <b>task</b> <b>was</b> displayed visually and responded to manually and also when the verbal <b>task</b> <b>was</b> dis-played auditOrily and responded to with speech...|$|R
5|$|Dead reckoning, {{in animals}} usually known as path integration, means the putting {{together}} of cues from different sensory sources within the body, {{without reference to}} visual or other external landmarks, to estimate position relative to a known starting point continuously while travelling on a path {{that is not necessarily}} straight. Seen as a problem in geometry, the <b>task</b> <b>is</b> to compute the vector to a starting point by adding the vectors for each leg of the journey from that point.|$|E

5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given {{direct access to the}} celebrity will record the colours of the hair and eyes, and over 500 precise body measurements are referenced. Most important is to capture the look of the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next <b>task</b> <b>is</b> to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human hair is then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E
5|$|In the A-not-B task, {{children}} are shown an object hidden at Location A within their reach, and are then prompted {{to search for}} the object at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, the object is hidden in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Typically, children younger than one year old search for the object under Location A, where the object was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the object in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B <b>task</b> <b>is</b> a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; the {{birthday}} {{is associated with}} the self, and hence the numbers in the birthday are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other contexts. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter effect, has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference <b>Task</b> <b>is</b> used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
30|$|Four task types namely text reconstruction, translation, jigsaw and disctogloss <b>tasks</b> <b>were</b> {{selected}}. The {{reason why}} these <b>tasks</b> <b>were</b> selected is that studies {{related to the}} research on language engagement in task based instruction include these task types. Therefore, to make comparability possible between potential of these task types in language engagement {{reported in the literature}} and their potential in task engagement investigated in this research, the same <b>tasks</b> <b>were</b> selected {{to be included in the}} present study.|$|R

5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; {{the name is}} {{associated}} with the self, and hence the letters of the name are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other words. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to birthdays: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as frequent exposure and early mastery, have been ruled out. In psychological assessments, the Name Letter Preference <b>Task</b> <b>is</b> widely used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
5|$|Not all parallelization {{results in}} speed-up. Generally, as a <b>task</b> <b>is</b> split up into {{more and more}} threads, those threads spend an {{ever-increasing}} portion of their time communicating with each other. Eventually, the overhead from communication dominates the time spent solving the problem, and further parallelization (that is, splitting the workload over even more threads) increases rather than decreases {{the amount of time}} required to finish. This is known as parallel slowdown.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{is closely}} related to concurrent computing—they are frequently used together, and often conflated, though the two are distinct: it is possible to have parallelism without concurrency (such as bit-level parallelism), and concurrency without parallelism (such as multitasking by time-sharing on a single-core CPU). In parallel computing, a computational <b>task</b> <b>is</b> typically broken down in several, often many, very similar subtasks that can be processed independently and whose results are combined afterwards, upon completion. In contrast, in concurrent computing, the various processes often do not address related tasks; when they do, as is typical in distributed computing, the separate tasks may have a varied nature and often require some inter-process communication during execution.|$|E

5|$|Soft & Cuddly is {{a horror}} arcade {{adventure}} game released for the ZX Spectrum home computer, developed by John George Jones {{and published by}} The Power House. It was released in September 1987 in the United Kingdom and in early 1988 in Spain. The player assumes {{the role of a}} man armed with a laser gun and a jet pack, whose mother, the Android Queen, has been dismembered. The player's <b>task</b> <b>is</b> to locate the scattered body parts of the Android Queen and sew her back together.|$|E
5|$|Strange studies {{under the}} Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient {{books in the}} library that is now guarded by the master Wong. Strange learns that Earth is {{protected}} from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London, and Hong Kong, which are all connected and accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' <b>task</b> <b>is</b> to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life.|$|E
5|$|The Letter Preference <b>Task</b> <b>is</b> the second-most popular {{method to}} measure {{implicit}} self-esteem, surpassed {{only by the}} Implicit Association Test. The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task. There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all {{the letters of the}} alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the rating scales (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).|$|E
