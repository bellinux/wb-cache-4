5|$|Sophie {{was one of}} Mozart 's pups seen on Meerkat Manor. She had two {{brothers}} and one sister named Sparkle. Only one of her brothers was given a name and he was called Spud. They were born some time after Tosca, Mozart's sister, gave birth to three pups. Their uncle Yossarian decided to move their pups who {{were only a few}} days old. He brought each up above ground and started to move them to a new burrow. The babysitters followed him and carried each pup. The Whiskers returned and Yossarian dropped the pup he was carrying, who was Sophie's sister. Her sister got left behind and died later that night. The other pups were moved to the new burrow. One day, while being babysat by Yossarian, Mitch, Sophie's other uncle, viciously attacked her without warning. Yossarian failed to stop the assault and simply waited until Mitch was proud of the beating. Afterwards, little Sophie {{was in a state of}} shock, but thankfully Tosca gave Sophie a comforting cuddle. Sophie didn't re-appear in the series until much later, when she was older. She was seen babysitting a litter, but was finding <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a handful. That was the last time Sophie was mentioned in Season 1. In this season and up until season 3, she was played by Tina Sparkle since the real Sophie was the one Youssarian unintentionally killed.|$|E
25|$|After {{five years}} of {{extraordinary}} success, Walls's business partnership with Henson ended in September 1927 during the run of Thark, and from October the Aldwych farces were presented by the firm of Tom Walls and Reginald Highley Ltd. By 1930, Walls was losing interest in the theatre, turning {{his attention to the}} cinema. He did not appear in the last three of the twelve Aldwych farces, which had disappointing runs. The last of <b>them,</b> <b>A</b> <b>Bit</b> of a Test in 1933, ran for 142 performances, compared with runs of more than 400 performances for some of the earlier productions.|$|E
500|$|The Allies {{were confronted}} with an {{interior}} covered with rainforest and tall mountains where wheeled vehicles could not operate. The Australian Army {{was forced to}} rely on air transport and native carriers, two modes of transportation that it had never used before. Thousands of Papuans were conscripted to help the war effort. Trucks and jeeps carried stores, ammunition and rations {{only part of the}} way; pack animals and a flying fox (zip-wire) took <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> further. The rest of the journey was completed on the backs of Papuan carriers, who struggled over the mountains lugging heavy loads. The environment posed the danger of endemic tropic diseases, particularly dysentery, scrub typhus and malaria. Medical units had to combat these, while caring for the sick and wounded, many of whom had to walk back to the base area along the Kokoda Track. Often the Papuan carriers had to carry the wounded on the way back, earning them the sobriquet of [...] "Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels".|$|E

500|$|The show's sound {{production}} team had two major special effects to create for the episode: the mole creature, and Olivia's superhearing. They decided to voice the creature using Automated Dialogue Replacement (ADR) [...] "because his range of actions and emotions {{was simply too}} broad for a library monster vocal set to cover". Sound editor Bruce Tanis cut [...] "creepy moans and breaths" [...] when the creature was heard but not seen, and added [...] "a layer of vicious attack growls and wounded screams" [...] for when it died. Tanis commented that the actor voicing the creature placed pieces of orange in his mouth {{in order to have}} [...] "a slobbery, sputtering voice". For Olivia's scenes with superhearing, Tanis made ordinary, far off items like phones, typewriters, and cars [...] "sound a little beefier than normal and kept <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more up in the mix than they usually would be," [...] as these things were not in the same room as her. The sound editors wanted to emphasize that the various sounds she hears could be coming from anywhere, such as next door, or a block away, or could perhaps be all inside her head. Torv later noted in a BuddyTV interview that while shooting, she was unsure whether her newfound abilities were permanent or temporary, to which the writers replied that [...] "apparently it's just something that comes and goes". After expressing her confusion, they responded [...] "Oh that's good, Olivia's confused too".|$|E
2500|$|According to Stefanakis {{the lyrics}} {{in the chorus}} about being In {{the middle of a}} dream relate to two main ideas: [...] "I'm dreaming if I thought my friends would rush to my defence ... he has been betrayed by those he felt would be loyal..." [...] and [...] "Reality check. Let down by chick? Double whammy. Let down by friends". The next part I lost my shirt relates to [...] "a level of {{personal}} irresponsibility" [...] and links {{with the rest of the}} line I pawned my rings where [...] "ings are symbols of love, family, togetherness and eternity ... he has sold all this. He has nothing". Stefanakis states that Kelly's [...] "writing draws on known sayings, metaphors and platitudes and gives <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a twist! It's humorous, but it's also poignant".|$|E
2500|$|The video {{opens in}} a Mad Max-esque desert setting, where a posse of {{well-muscled}} girls stands before {{a group of}} somewhat nonplussed boys. At first, they look like they're going to perform for the boys, like the Spice Girls in [...] "Say You'll Be There" [...] or maybe taunt <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> like Janet Jackson and her crew in [...] "You Want This". But there's another story here, {{having to do with}} the juxtapositions of the post-apocalyptic environment, the athletic survivor-girls wielding their martial-arts sticks, and the song's lyrics. The lyrics concern Mýa's query to her man, wondering why another girl is calling his phone [...] "after midnight". This caller, narrates Mýa, is [...] "Saying come over / Cause she's all alone / I could tell it was your ex / By your tone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "She {{does not}} teach <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like Miss James," [...] said Jessie. [...] "She makes their sums into a story, and their {{spelling}} lessons too. It {{is like a}} game." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} would do <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of harm," [...] said Mrs. Grantly. [...] "But {{there would be no}} chance of that, seeing that Griselda's husband never comes to us." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Trot positively. [...] "There's {{been enough}} {{patching}} in this country, and I won't {{have any more}} of it. The old Boolooroo and the six stuck-up Princesses will be punished enough by being put out of the palace. The people don't like <b>'em</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit,</b> so they'll be outcasts and wanderers, and that will make 'em sorry they were so wicked an' cruel when they were powerful.

6000|$|... 'I mustn't do that, but I'll buzz one of <b>'em</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> for you,' said Sam. He {{pounded on}} the sound-bow of the biggest bell, and waked a hollow groaning boom that ran {{up and down the}} tower like creepy {{feelings}} down your back. Just when it almost began to hurt, it died away in a hurry of beautiful sorrowful cries, like a wine-glass rubbed with a wet finger. The pendulum clanked--one loud clank to each silent swing.|$|R
6000|$|The gates fell partly {{across the}} trench. [...] "Now, lads, push <b>them</b> back <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> if you can; if not, knock the part over the ditch to pieces; it's half- smashed already." ...|$|R
