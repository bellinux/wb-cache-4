5|$|During {{the decay}} of plutonium, three types of {{radiation}} are released—alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation. Either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including radiation sickness, genetic damage, cancer, and death. The danger increases {{with the amount of}} exposure. Alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of human skin. Beta radiation can penetrate human skin, but cannot go all the way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Gamma radiation can go all the way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

5|$|The main {{structure}} of an insect's digestive {{system is a}} long enclosed tube called the alimentary canal, which runs lengthwise <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally from the mouth to the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} {{function}} in locomotion, the tube feet act as accessory gills. The water vascular system serves to transport oxygen from, {{and carbon dioxide}} to, the tube feet and also nutrients from the gut to the muscles involved in locomotion. Fluid movement is bidirectional and initiated by cilia. Gas exchange also takes place through other gills known as papulae, which are thin-walled bulges on the aboral surface of the disc and arms. Oxygen is transferred from these to the coelomic fluid, which acts as the transport medium for gasses. Oxygen dissolved in the water is distributed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> mainly by the fluid in the main body cavity; the circulatory system may also play a minor role.|$|E
5|$|Concepts {{related to}} force include: thrust, which {{increases}} the velocity of an object; drag, which decreases the velocity of an object; and torque, which produces changes in rotational speed of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is the internal mechanical stress. Such internal mechanical stresses cause no accelation of that body as the forces balance one another. Pressure, the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate. Stress usually causes deformation of solid materials, or flow in fluids.|$|E

2500|$|Red {{blood cells}} (RBCs), also called erythrocytes, {{are the most}} common type of blood cell and the vertebrate's {{principal}} means of delivering oxygen (O2) to <b>the</b> <b>body</b> tissues—via blood flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> circulatory system. [...] RBCs take up oxygen in the lungs, or gills of fish, and release it into tissues while squeezing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>body's</b> capillaries.|$|R
5|$|In the chaetonotidans, the {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} {{a single pair of}} protonephridia, which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal, usually in the midsection of the body. In the macrodasyidans, there are several pairs of these opening {{along the side of the}} body. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation. Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum. These cells, termed cyrtocytes, connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct.|$|E
5|$|Most {{ingested}} uranium is excreted during digestion. Only 0.5% {{is absorbed}} when insoluble forms of uranium, {{such as its}} oxide, are ingested, whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5%. However, soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> whereas insoluble uranium compounds, especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs, pose a more serious exposure hazard. After entering the bloodstream, the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay {{for many years in}} bone tissue because of uranium's affinity for phosphates. Uranium is not absorbed through the skin, and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin.|$|E
5|$|Paul Broca {{associated}} {{regions of}} the brain with specific functions, in particular language in Broca's area, following work on brain-damaged patients. John Hughlings Jackson described {{the function of the}} motor cortex by watching the progression of epileptic seizures <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Carl Wernicke described a region associated with language comprehension and production. Korbinian Brodmann divided {{regions of the}} brain based on the appearance of cells. By 1950, Sherrington, Papez, and MacLean had identified many of the brainstem and limbic system functions. The capacity of the brain to re-organise and change with age, and a recognised critical development period, were attributed to neuroplasticity, pioneered by Margaret Kennard, who experimented on monkeys during the 1930-40s.|$|E

5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{invertebrates}} have notably complex brains: arthropods (insects, crustaceans, arachnids, and others), and cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and similar molluscs). The brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of the animal. Arthropods have a central brain, the supraesophageal ganglion, with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing. Cephalopods {{such as the}} octopus and squid have the largest brains of any invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Alan Turing, {{and later}} the {{mathematical}} biologist James Murray, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a reaction-diffusion system. The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a morphogen, resulting {{in the growth of}} a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the morphogen is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be feedback control of the production of the morphogen itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of morphogen as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create standing wave patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the morphogen, and that itself diffuses <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> more quickly than the morphogen, resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a chemical oscillator.|$|E
5|$|Early writers {{combined}} ctenophores with cnidarians into {{a single}} phylum called Coelenterata on account of morphological similarities between the two groups. Like cnidarians, the bodies of ctenophores consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells {{on the outside and}} another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, however, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only a single cell deep. Ctenophores also resemble cnidarians in relying on water flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> cavity for both digestion and respiration, as well as in having a decentralized nerve net rather than a brain. However, genomic studies have suggested that the neurons of Ctenophora, which differ in many ways from other animal neurons, evolved independently from those of the other animals, and increasing awareness {{of the differences between the}} groups has persuaded more recent authors to classify the two as separate phyla. The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores.|$|E

5|$|Maryland's Senate {{consists}} of Senators elected from 47 Senate districts. While each Senator {{has the power}} to introduce and vote on bills and make motions on the floor, various committees, caucuses, and leadership positions help to organize the work of the Senate. Senators elect a President of the Senate, who serves as the presiding officer of the chamber. They also elect a President Pro Tempore, who presides over the chamber when the President is absent. The President of the Maryland Senate has significant influence over legislation that passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> through both formal means, such as his ability to appoint committee chairs and leaders of the majority party, and informal means that are less easily defined. These powers place the President of the Maryland Senate among the strongest state legislature presiding officers in the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle is}} noted for the heavy death toll among the Dutch commanders. Philip of Nassau was mortally wounded at the {{beginning}} of the action, shot at point blank range <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> with an harquebus, his robes being set on fire. Robert Vere, brother of the English colonel Horace Vere, was slain by a lance thrust in the face. The drossaard of Zallandt and Count Ferdinand Kinsky were also killed. Count Ernst of Solms was seriously wounded and captured. Together with Philip, he was carried to Rheinberg, where both soldiers were visited by Mondragón and their Catholic cousins, the Van den Bergh brothers, and treated by the Spanish surgeons. Despite all the attentions, both Dutch commanders died of the wounds they had sustained; Nassau the night after the battle, and Solms three days later. Count Ernst Casimir was captured and ransomed for 10,000 florins. Mondragón dispatched him to Maurice of Nassau with the bodies of the dead counts, which were buried with honours at Arnhem.|$|E
