5|$|When rehearsals {{opened in}} September 1955, Rodgers {{assembled}} {{the cast and}} told them that he was going into the hospital for a minor operation. In fact, Rodgers had been diagnosed with cancer of the jawbone. He spent the weekend before the operation writing one final song for Pipe Dream. The surgery required removal of part of the jawbone and tongue, and some of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> nodes. The operation took place on September 21, 1955; within ten days of the operation he was back in the theatre watching rehearsals, though for some time only as a spectator.|$|E
5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> deep {{inguinal}} <b>lymph</b> nodes drain superiorly to <b>the</b> external iliac <b>lymph</b> nodes, then to <b>the</b> pelvic <b>lymph</b> {{nodes and}} on to <b>the</b> paraaortic <b>lymph</b> nodes.|$|R
50|$|The lymphatic vessels {{follow the}} arteries in a {{retrograde}} fashion. The anterior lymphatic vessels drain into <b>the</b> pancreatoduodenal <b>lymph</b> nodes located along the superior and inferior pancreatoduodenal arteries {{and then into}} <b>the</b> pyloric <b>lymph</b> nodes (along <b>the</b> gastroduodenal artery).The posterior lymphatic vessels pass posterior {{to the head of}} the pancreas and drain into <b>the</b> superior mesenteric <b>lymph</b> nodes. Efferent lymphatic vessels from <b>the</b> duodenal <b>lymph</b> nodes ultimately pass into <b>the</b> celiac <b>lymph</b> nodes.|$|R
50|$|Lymph nodes {{are present}} {{throughout}} the body, are more concentrated near {{and within the}} trunk, and are divided {{in the study of}} anatomy into groups. Some lymph nodes can be felt when enlarged (and occasionally when not), such as <b>the</b> axillary <b>lymph</b> nodes under <b>the</b> arm, <b>the</b> cervical <b>lymph</b> nodes of <b>the</b> head and neck and <b>the</b> inguinal <b>lymph</b> nodes near <b>the</b> groin crease. Some lymph nodes can be seen, such as <b>the</b> tonsils. Most <b>lymph</b> nodes however lie within the trunk adjacent to other major structures in the body - such as <b>the</b> paraaortic <b>lymph</b> nodes and <b>the</b> tracheobronchial <b>lymph</b> nodes.|$|R
5|$|The thyroid {{itself is}} {{examined}} by {{observation of the}} gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner. The gland moves {{up and down with}} swallowing because of its attachments to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In a healthy person the gland is not visible yet is palpable as a soft mass. Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able to be felt. If a goitre is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider tapping {{the upper part of the}} chest to check for extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton's sign), listening to the gland with a stethoscope for bruits, testing of reflexes, and palpation of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> nodes in the head and neck. A medical examination of the thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic signs such as weight gain or loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations – such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Grave's disease.|$|E

25|$|The {{region of}} <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> node called the {{paracortex}} immediately surrounds the medulla. Unlike the cortex, which has mostly immature T cells, or thymocytes, the paracortex has {{a mixture of}} immature and mature T cells. Lymphocytes enter <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> nodes through specialised high endothelial venules found in the paracortex.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> scrotum <b>lymph</b> drains {{initially}} into <b>the</b> superficial inguinal <b>lymph</b> nodes, {{this then}} drains into <b>the</b> deep inguinal <b>lymph</b> nodes. <b>The</b> deep inguinal <b>lymph</b> nodes drain into the common iliac which ultimately releases <b>lymph</b> into <b>the</b> cisterna chyli.|$|R
40|$|Gut wall emigrating {{cells have}} been {{characterized}} in <b>the</b> intestinal <b>lymph.</b> <b>The</b> intestinal <b>lymph</b> duct was cannulated in 6 -month-old minipigs. Under non-restraining conditions <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph</b> from <b>the</b> mesenteric <b>lymph</b> nodes was collected in seven normal animals. Lymph coming directly from <b>the</b> gut (afferent <b>lymph)</b> was also collected in 18 pigs after resection of <b>the</b> mesenteric <b>lymph</b> node chains 3 months previously. <b>The</b> intestinal <b>lymph</b> flow was similar {{in both groups}} (around 18 ml/h). The lymphoid cell yield was 1. 2 +/- 1. 0 x 10 (6) /h in control animals, while in mesenteric lymph node resected pigs it was around 20 times higher (26. 2 +/- 17. 6 x 10 (6) /h). In <b>the</b> gut-derived <b>lymph</b> 76. 5 +/- 8. 8 % T lymphocytes were observed (CD 4 +, 48. 1 +/- 15. 5 %; CD 8 +, 53. 6 +/- 12. 7 %). The percentage of immunoglobulin-positive cells was lower (IgM+, 10. 1 +/- 4. 5; IgA+, 1. 7 +/- 1. 1). In 14 mesenteric lymph node resected pigs a mean of 5. 6 +/- 3. 1 x 10 (8) lymphocytes from <b>the</b> gut <b>lymph</b> were labelled in vitro with a fluorescent dye and retransfused. The labelling index of fluorescent cells in <b>the</b> intestinal <b>lymph</b> increased rapidly and remained {{at a high level}} until 44 h after cell transfusion. A four-to-ten times lower labelling index was found in <b>the</b> spleen, various <b>lymph</b> nodes and Peyer's patches. Most of the recovered lymphocytes were T cells. This model provides access to the cell pool leaving the gut wall, thus allowing an examination of its role in the gastrointestinal tract and other mucosal-lined organs...|$|R
50|$|Some {{of their}} efferents pass to <b>the</b> retroaortic <b>lymph</b> nodes, but <b>the</b> {{majority}} unite to form <b>the</b> intestinal <b>lymph</b> trunk, which enters the cisterna chyli.|$|R
25|$|A lymph {{follicle}} is a dense {{collection of}} lymphocytes, the number, size and configuration of which change {{in accordance with}} the functional state of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> node. For example, the follicles expand significantly when encountering a foreign antigen. The selection of B cells, or B lymphocytes, occurs in the germinal center of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> nodes.|$|E
25|$|The {{substance}} of a lymph node consists of lymphoid follicles in an outer portion called the cortex. The inner {{portion of the}} node is called the medulla, which is surrounded by the cortex on all sides except for a portion known as the hilum. The hilum presents as a depression {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> node, causing the otherwise spherical lymph node to be bean-shaped or ovoid. The efferent lymph vessel directly emerges from <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> node at the hilum. The arteries and veins supplying <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> node with blood enter and exit through the hilum.|$|E
25|$|During {{an immune}} response, {{professional}} antigen-presenting cells (APCs) endocytose foreign material (typically bacteria or viruses), which undergoes processing, then travel from the infection site to <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> nodes. Once at <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> nodes, the APC begin to present antigen peptides that {{are bound to}} Class II MHC, allowing CD4+ T cells that express the specific TCRs against the peptide/MHC complex to activate.|$|E
25|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} of the testes {{follows the}} testicular arteries back to <b>the</b> paraaortic <b>lymph</b> nodes, while <b>lymph</b> from <b>the</b> scrotum drains to <b>the</b> inguinal <b>lymph</b> nodes.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} fasting {{on the cell}} output through <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph</b> from <b>the</b> popliteal <b>lymph</b> nodes of adult rabbits were studied along with the nodal changes. The most {{striking}} effects of acute fasting is a marked decrease in the cell output through <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph.</b> This is chiefly due {{to a reduction in}} <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph</b> flow. <b>The</b> cellular content of <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph</b> remains almost unchaged, although the nodal weight is much reduced by fasting. The reduction in the nodal weight, on the other hand, runs almost paralled to the decrease in the cell output through <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph.</b> After stimulating <b>the</b> node by the subcutaneous injection of sheep blood into the foot-pad, simulatneously with the initiation of fasting, the cell output through <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph</b> is increased to a great extent. This is due to the increase not only in the cellular content of efferent lymph but also in <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph</b> flow. <b>The</b> weight of the node is also much increased as compared with that of the opposite side. The nodal weight rises almost parallel with the increase in cell output, so that the cell output per unit weight of nodal tissue remains almost unchanged even after the stimulation with antigen. The cellular content of <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph</b> consists almost exclusively of small lympho cytes in normal and fasted rabbits. After the stimulation with antigen, larger pyroninophilic lymphocytes, especially huge immature blast cells (lympogonia or immunoblasts) defenitely appear in <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph</b> in large numbers even in the fasted rabbits. Based upon these findings, the effects of fasting on the immune cellular proliferation are discussed...|$|R
25|$|It {{is common}} for {{patients}} diagnosed with melanoma to have chest X-rays and an LDH test, {{and in some cases}} CT, MRI, PET and/or PET/CT scans. Although controversial, sentinel lymph node biopsies and examination of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> nodes are also performed in patients to assess spread to <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> nodes. A diagnosis of melanoma is supported by the presence of the S-100 protein marker.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} of lymph node transfer usually is performed {{together with a}} DIEP flap breast reconstruction. This allows for both the simultaneous treatment of the arm lymphedema {{and the creation of}} a breast in one surgery. <b>The</b> <b>lymph</b> node transfer removes the excess lymphatic fluid to return form and function to the arm. In selected cases, <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> nodes may be transferred as a group with their supporting artery and vein, but without the associated abdominal tissue for breast reconstruction.|$|E

25|$|The lymphatic vessels, {{also called}} lymph vessels, conduct lymph between {{different}} parts of the body. They include the tubular vessels of <b>the</b> <b>lymph</b> capillaries, and the larger collecting vessels–the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct (the left lymphatic duct). <b>The</b> <b>lymph</b> capillaries are mainly responsible for the absorption of interstitial fluid from the tissues, while lymph vessels propel the absorbed fluid forward into the larger collecting ducts, where it ultimately returns to the bloodstream via one of the subclavian veins. These vessels are also called the lymphatic channels or simply lymphatics.|$|E
40|$|Viable {{bacteria}} {{were not}} cultured from <b>the</b> mesenteric <b>lymph</b> nodes, spleens, or livers of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice.

These indigenous E. coli also were cultured from <b>the</b> mesenteric <b>lymph</b> nodes of 96 % of gnotobiotic mice monoassociated with E. coli but from none of <b>the</b> mesenteric <b>lymph</b> nodes of SPF mice inoculated with the E. coli. Furthermore, viable E. coli were detected in <b>the</b> mesenteric <b>lymph</b> nodes of these monoassociated gnotobiotes for as long as 112 days after inoculation. Indigenous Lactobacillus acidophilus also translocated to <b>the</b> mesenteric <b>lymph</b> nodes of gnotobiotic mice monoassociated with L. acidophilus. Apparently, there are mechanisms active in SPF mice inhibiting translocation of indigenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to <b>the</b> mesenteric <b>lymph</b> nodes, spleens, and livers, whereas these mechanisms are either absent or reduced in gnotobiotic mice. Indigenous E. coli maintained higher population levels in the gastrointestinal tracts of the gnotobiotes compared with their population levels in SPF mice, suggesting that high bacterial population levels might promote translocation of certain bacteria from the gastrointestinal lumen to <b>the</b> mesenteric <b>lymph</b> nodes. Gnotobiotic and SPF mice, therefore, provide experimental models for determining the nature of the mechanisms operating to confine indigenous bacteria to the gastrointestinal tract in normal, healthy animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{antigenic}} and non-antigenic stimulations {{on the cell}} output through <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph</b> from <b>the</b> popliteal <b>lymph</b> nodes of adult rabbits were studied. The chief results obtained are as follows: 1. The cell output through <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph</b> flow is greatly increased by antigenic stimulations and the magnitute of increase in the cell output runs almost parallel {{to that of the}} increase in nodal weight. 2. Heterograft causes a marked increase in the cell output from regional lymph node, whereas homograft hardly produces such an effect. 3. Complete Freund's adjuvant with Mycobacteria also increases the cell output from lymph node to a considerable extent, whereas incomplete Freund's adjuvant without Mycobacteria is less effective. 4. However, when injected with bovine gamma-globulin, incomplete Freund's adjuvant also produces a marked increase in the cell output from <b>lymph</b> node. 5. <b>The</b> increase in the cell output from lymph node produced by antigenic stimulation is defenitely accompanied by the appearance of large pyroninophilic blast cells in <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph.</b> In contrast, complete Freund's adjuvant or incomplete Freund's adjuvant alone is not able to elicit an appearance of these cell in <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph.</b> 6. An incresse in cell output through <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph</b> from <b>the</b> regional <b>lymph</b> node, and <b>the</b> occurrence of large pyroninophilic cells in <b>the</b> efferent <b>lymph,</b> particularly <b>the</b> latter, are considered to be specific to antigenic stimulation. Therefore, these reactions may be used as measures to test the antigenecity of stimulating agents...|$|R
