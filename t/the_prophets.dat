5|$|It is {{believed}} in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, divine wisdom, {{is the source}} of the souls of <b>the</b> <b>Prophets</b> and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called Hikmah and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees. Although the Imam is not the recipient of a divine revelation, he has a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as al-Jafr and al-Jamia. Imamate, or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the strategic plan of <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> Muhammad for Islamicjerusalem and the preparations that led to the first Muslim Fath of Islamicjerusalem, which took place after the death of <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> Muhammad.   <b>The</b> relationship of <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> Muhammad with Islamicjerusalem has been generally limited {{to the study of the}} virtues of that region according to the ahadith (traditions) of <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> Muhammad.   This thesis concentrates on the actual role of <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> Muhammad in paving the way for the Muslims to take over that region after his death.   However, the thesis deals with <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> Muhammad, according to the Muslim sources, as a <b>Prophet,</b> and therefore, <b>the</b> relationship of the divinely revelation with these preparations and this plan is not neglected, especially that Prophethood was the main character of <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> Muhammad that has been neglected in studying his acts and movements in this context. The stages of the strategic plan for the Fath of Islamicjerusalem can be divided into three stages: first, the divinely preparation and mobilisation of <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> Muhammad and <b>the</b> Muslims for the Fath of Islamicjerusalem, which was through Qur'anic concentration on the importance of Islamicjerusalem, and manifest this relationship through praying towards Islamicjerusalem.   Second, the turning point that led <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> Muhammad to realise the centrality of Islamicjerusalem, and this was through the Night Journey.   Third, the practical steps taken by <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> Muhammad, supported by divine revelation, toward paving the way for the Muslims to initiate the campaigns that led to the Fath of Islamicjerusalem after his death, and this manifested in studying <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> Muhammad’s military movements on the route of Islamicjerusalem, in addition to key documents granted or sent by <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> Muhammad to numerous parties in or around Islamicjerusalem.

5|$|The work {{commenced}} {{at the end}} of {{the building}} furthest from the altar, with the latest of the narrative scenes, and progressed towards the altar with the scenes of the Creation. The first three scenes, from the story of Noah, contain a much larger number of small figures than the later panels. This is partly because of the subject matter, which deals with the fate of Humanity, but also because all the figures at that end of the ceiling, including <b>the</b> <b>prophets</b> and Ignudi, are smaller than in the central section. As the scale got larger, Michelangelo's style became broader, the final narrative scene of God in the act of Creation was painted in a single day.|$|E
5|$|According to Cockerell, {{the side}} of the façade that is to the south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each {{contained}} a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that those to the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of the Old Testament while those to the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop are identifiable by their attributes. In the second zone, above each pair of standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel in relief, some of which have survived. Between the gables of the niches are quatrefoils that contain a series of narratives from the Bible, with the Old Testament stories to the south, above <b>the</b> <b>prophets</b> and patriarchs, and those from the New Testament to the north. A horizontal course runs around the west front dividing the architectural storeys at this point.|$|E

5|$|According to Ibn Kathir, Uzair lived {{between the}} times of King Solomon {{and the time of}} Zachariah, father of John the Baptist. Some Quranic {{commentators}} viewed Uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach the people the forgotten laws of God. He is sometimes identified as the protagonist in the Quranic story of the man who slept for a hundred years (2:259). Some Islamic scholars held Uzayr to be one of <b>the</b> <b>prophets.</b> However, Islamic tradition also reports that God expunged Uzayr from the list of prophets because he refused to believe in qadar (predestination). Ibn Hazm, al-Samaw'al and other scholars put forth the view that Uzair (or one of his disciples) falsified the Torah, and this claim became a common theme in Islamic polemics against the Bible. Many aspects of later Islamic narratives show similarity to Vision of Ezra, an apocryphal text which seems to have been partially known to Muslim readers.|$|E

A hard-working teacher despite poor pay, within several years Sudirman had become headmaster despite not having a teacher's certificate. As a result, his monthly wages quadrupled from three gulden to twelve and a half. As headmaster, Sudirman worked on numerous administrative duties, including finding middle ground between feuding teachers. A coworker later recalled that Sudirman was a moderate, democratic leader. He was also active in fundraising, both {{for the needs of}} his school and the construction of others.|$|E
5|$|Gaza is also {{mentioned}} in the Hebrew Bible as the place where Samson was imprisoned and met his death. <b>The</b> <b>prophets</b> Amos and Zephaniah {{are believed to have}} prophesied that Gaza would be deserted. According to biblical accounts, Gaza fell to Israelite rule, from the reign of King David in the early 11th century BCE. When the United Monarchy split in about 930 BCE, Gaza became a part of the northern Kingdom of Israel. When the Kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians under Tiglath-Pileser III and Sargon II around 730 BCE, Gaza came under Assyrian rule. In the 7th century, it again came under Egyptian control, but during the Persian period (6th-4th centuries BCE) it enjoyed a certain independence and flourished. In 529 BCE, Cambyses I unsuccessfully attacked Gaza and later, around 520 BCE, the Greeks established a trading post in Gaza. The first coins were minted on the Athens model around 380 BCE.|$|E
