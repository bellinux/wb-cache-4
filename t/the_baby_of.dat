5|$|Terri Schuester (née Del Monico) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Fox musical comedy-drama series Glee. The character is portrayed by actress Jessalyn Gilsig, and {{has appeared in}} Glee from its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Terri was developed by Glee creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. She is introduced as the wife of glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison). Her storylines have seen her experience a false pregnancy, attempt to adopt <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> pregnant glee club member Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron), and become involved in a love triangle between herself, Will and school guidance counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays).|$|E

25|$|A Cochrane review {{suggests}} that active management (use of uterotonic drugs, cord clamping and controlled cord traction) {{during the third}} stage of labour reduces severe bleeding and anemia. However, the review also found that active management increased the mother's blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and pain. In the active management group more women returned to hospital with bleeding after discharge, {{and there was also}} a reduction in birthweight due to infants having a lower blood volume. The effects on <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> early cord clamping was discussed in another review which found that delayed cord clamping improved iron stores longer term in the infants. Although {{they were more likely to}} need phototherapy (light therapy) to treat jaundice, the improved iron stores are expected to be worth increasing the practice of delayed cord clamping in healthy term babies. For preterm babies (babies born before 37 weeks) a review of the research found that delaying cord clamping by 30–45 seconds increased the amount of blood flow to the baby. This is important as increased blood volume in the baby made them less likely to develop some serious complications. Much of the research around this subject is poor quality so further, larger research projects are likely to produce more reliable results.|$|E
40|$|Skinfold {{thickness}} {{measurements were}} made at biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac sites on both sides on 265 full-term newborn infants. The mothers were classified as thin (25), normal (179), or obese (61) {{on the basis of}} their triceps skinfold thicknesses. At all skinfold sites <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obese mothers were significantly fatter than <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> normal mothers, and <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> normal mothers were significantly fatter than those of the thin mothers. There was a highly significant positive correlation between maternal triceps thickness and <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> sum <b>of</b> skinfold thicknesses. Hypertension was common during the pregnancies of the obese mothers and was associated with a significant reduction in the babies' skinfold thicknesses. When each of the 61 obese mothers were matched for parity, blood pressure, and smoking habit with 61 non-obese mothers <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obese mothers still had significantly greater skinfold thicknesses than <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> non-obese mothers...|$|R

40|$|Nine {{hundred and}} seventy-three white women {{attending}} an antenatal clinic completed a questionnaire on parity, social class, smoking habits, {{and consumption of}} alcohol and coffee. Forty-nine per cent said they were non-drinkers and none <b>of</b> their <b>babies</b> had a major congenital abnormalities; whereas 1. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> women who did consume alcohol had major abnormalities. <b>The</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> women who said they drank more than an average of 20 ml alcohol a day had significantly smaller head circumferences than <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> non-drinkers in some gestational age groups. Maternal serum gamma-glutamyltransferase levels predicted abnormal fetal outcome in the 3 women in whom they were raised. There is no safe level of alcohol consumption in pregnancy and even moderate 'social' drinking is associated with abnormal fetal outcome...|$|R

500|$|The Simpsons are {{a family}} {{who live in a}} fictional [...] "Middle America" [...] town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety {{inspector}} at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another. The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed Snowball II in [...] "I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot". Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes.|$|E
500|$|Three {{years later}} it is {{revealed}} in [...] "William", that he survived the gunshot, but was subjected to horribly disfiguring experiments at the hand of his father.

The motivation or repercussions of his actions are never fully explained. He testified for the defense during Mulder's murder trial in [...] "The Truth". He also revealed during the trial that Teena Mulder {{was having an affair}} with the [...] "Cigarette Smoking Man", and that he and Fox Mulder are half-brothers.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> Australian Aboriginal {{mothers have}} higher overall {{perinatal}} mortality rates than <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> Caucasian mothers. They {{are also more}} likely to be preterm and of low birth weight. This study used Poisson regression models to adjust the perinatal mortality rates for differences in the gestational age and birth weight distributions of Aborigines and Caucasians. The intriguing finding was that full-term Aboriginal neonates (the group at lowest absolute risk) fare particularly poorly in comparison with Caucasian (adjusted relative risk: 2. 9; 95 % confidence interval; 1. 5 to 5. 5). Possible explanations for this phenomenon are explored...|$|R

500|$|As a supergroup, Black Country Communion's {{style is}} often {{described}} as a mix of various different sounds and influences. Particular significance is attributed to the band's mix of blues rock (attributed primarily to Bonamassa's work within the genre) and hard rock (originating from Hughes's previous work with Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, and from Bonham's tie with Led Zeppelin via his father John), with some critics going as far as to claim that the group's sound is based on [...] "the vintage Deep Purple template". In reviews for the band's second album, a number of critics compared the sound of the group to that of Led Zeppelin – Eduardo Rivadavia of website AllMusic noted that the album [...] "sounds like <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> drummer Jason Bonham", while Paul Cole of the Sunday Mercury claimed that it is [...] "haunted by the spirit of Zeppelin". Hughes has dubbed the group [...] "a rock and roll band in the true sense of the word".|$|E
500|$|Matt Groening first {{conceived}} Maggie and {{the rest}} of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights for his life's work, Groening decided to go in another direction, and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family. <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> the family was named Maggie after Groening's youngest sister. Maggie then made her debut with the rest of the Simpsons family on April 19, 1987 in the short [...] "Good Night". In 1989, the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons, a half-hour series that would air on the Fox Broadcasting Company. Maggie {{and the rest}} of the family remained the main characters on this new show.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Liz {{thinks she}} may be {{pregnant}} and is horrified when she discovers it is most likely <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> her ex-boyfriend, Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters). After several pregnancy tests, she tells a visiting Jack that the positive tests {{are a result of}} her eating [...] "Sabor de Soledad" [...] ("Taste of Loneliness" [...] in Spanish) cheese puffs, which contain bull semen. Nevertheless, she tells Jack that she is ready to have a child and wants to adopt. Kenneth learns of an opportunity to be an NBC page at the Beijing Olympics, however, head page Donny Lawson (Paul Scheer) tries {{to make sure that he}} does not submit his essay on time. Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) helps him complete his essay, but Donny stalls Kenneth by forcing him to deliver paper. Pete shoots Donny in the leg with an arrow, and Kenneth delivers his essay in time. Tracy's invention, the world's first pornographic video game, is nearly complete. He gives Frank, who has helped him, the prototype copy of the game.|$|E

500|$|On July 16, 1999, tragedy {{struck the}} Kennedy family again when [...] John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s [...] Piper Saratoga light {{aircraft}} {{crashed into the}} Atlantic Ocean {{off the coast of}} Martha's Vineyard. The accident killed Kennedy, his wife, and sister-in-law. As patriarch, Ted consoled his extended family along with President Clinton at the public memorial service. He paraphrased William Butler Yeats by saying of his nephew: [...] "We dared to think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But like his father, he had every gift but length of years." [...] Ted now served as a role model for Maria Shriver, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Joseph Patrick Kennedy II, and other family members. The Boston Globe wrote of the changed role: [...] "It underscored the evolution that surprised so many people who knew the Kennedys: Teddy, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> the family, who had grown into a man who could sometimes be dissolute and reckless, had become the steady, indispensable patriarch, the one the family turned to in good times and bad." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{attending}} UCLA, {{which did}} not have a public speaking team, Cartwright continued training as a voice actress with Butler. She recalled, [...] "every Sunday I'd take a 20-minute bus ride to his house in Beverly Hills for a one-hour lesson and be there for four hours... They had four sons, they didn't have a daughter and I kind of fitted in as <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> the family." [...] Butler introduced her to many of the voice actors and directors at Hanna-Barbera. After she met the director Gordon Hunt, he asked her to audition for a recurring role as Gloria in Richie Rich. She received the part, and later worked with Hunt on several other projects. At the end of 1980, Cartwright signed with a talent agency and landed a lead role in a pilot for a sitcom called In Trouble. Cartwright described the show as [...] "forgettable, but it jump-started my on-camera career". She graduated from UCLA in 1981 with a degree in theater. During the summer, Cartwright worked with Jonathan Winters as part of an improvisation troupe at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio.|$|E
500|$|Angelo {{was forced}} to help Nicole {{give birth to a}} baby boy, George, and she handed him over to Marilyn {{immediately}} as agreed. She then tried to stay away, however it became obvious he needed her when he struggled without her. Marilyn then became obsessed with Nicole having the power to take her new son back. It was then revealed that Nicole would struggle to switch off her mothering instinct after giving George away. Nicole came to visit the baby and Marilyn caught her breastfeeding George, while she was alone with him. Symons called the scenes [...] "volatile." [...] Nicole was unaware that Marilyn has reservations about her spending time with <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> <b>Of</b> the breastfeeding scene, Symons stated: [...] "Marilyn is shocked and offended, and this cuts to the very core of her worries - that she doesn't have the same natural mothering instincts as George's birth mother. Without a doubt, Marilyn thinks Nicole is overstepping the mark. She feels that a boundary has been overstepped and it could put a big strain on their relationship." [...] After the incident, Nicole is asked by Marylin, {{to stay away from the}} baby. James defended Nicole stating: [...] "I think it's hard to not bond, but this is Marilyn's baby, and Nicole is so young and wants very much to give Marilyn and Sid this gift." ...|$|E
