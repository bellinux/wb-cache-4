25|$|Gassing is {{the process}} of passing yarn, as {{distinct}} from fabric very rapidly through a series of Bunsen gas flames in a gassing frame, in order <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> the projecting fibres and make the thread round and smooth and also brighter. Only the better qualities of yarn are gassed, such as that used for voiles, poplins, venetians, gabardines, many Egyptian qualities, etc. There is a loss of weight in gassing, which varies' about 5 to 8 per cent., so that if a 2/60's yarn is required 2/56's would be used. The gassed yarn is darker in shade afterwards, but should not be scorched.|$|E
25|$|On June 13, 2012, Dallas, a {{continuation}} of the 1978 original series premiered on the cable network, TNT. The revived series, which was canceled after three seasons in 2014, delivered solid ratings for the channel. In 2012, Nick at Nite debuted a primetime soap opera, Hollywood Heights, which aired episodes five nights a week (on Monday through Fridays) {{in a manner similar to}} a daytime soap opera, instead of the once-a-week episode output common of other primetime soaps. The series, which was an adaptation of the Mexican telenovela Alcanzar una estrella, suffered from low ratings (generally receiving less than one million viewers) and was later moved to sister cable channel TeenNick halfway through its run <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> the remaining episodes.|$|E

50|$|Aircraft {{efficiency}} {{increases with}} height. Burning fuel decreases {{the weight of}} an aircraft which may then choose to increase its flight level to further improve fuel consumption. For example, an aircraft {{may be able to}} reach FL290 early in a flight, but step climb to FL370 later in the route after weight has decreased due <b>to</b> fuel <b>burn</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R
25|$|On September 21, 2005, JetBlue Flight 292, an Airbus A320 {{discovered}} {{a problem with}} its landing gear as it took off from Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, California. It flew in circles for three hours <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> fuel, then landed safely at Los Angeles International Airport on runway 25L, balancing on its back wheels as it rolled {{down the center of}} the runway. Passengers were able to watch their own coverage live from the satellite broadcast on JetBlue in-flight TV seat displays of their plane as it made an emergency landing with the front landing gear visibly becoming damaged. Because JetBlue did not serve LAX at the time, the aircraft was evaluated and repaired at a Continental Airlines hangar.|$|E
25|$|Fusion {{splicing}} is {{done with}} a specialized instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves {{before and after the}} splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice loss estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.|$|E
500|$|It {{was thought}} that the failure had been caused by there being too much {{remaining}} superstructure, and {{attempts were made to}} clean out the large quantity of oil that had spilled out during the attempt to raise her. [...] The decision was made <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> the oil, but the fire spread and had to be brought back under control. She was again patched up and pumped with air, breaking the surface on 29 November. The Bremse was eventually considered too unsafe to tow to Rosyth for scrapping, as had been done with the other ships Cox had salvaged, and instead she was taken to Lyness on 30 November 1929 and broken up there.|$|E
50|$|Fox had {{originally}} scheduled the remaining six episodes {{of the series}} <b>to</b> be <b>burned</b> <b>off</b> Sundays at 7 and 7:30. On May 1, however, Fox cancelled those plans. In January 2013, the unaired episodes began to air in international markets, with three episodes premiering on TV2 in New Zealand and another three on Nine in Australia.|$|R

50|$|Powder coating {{can also}} be removed by a burning off process, in which parts are put into a large {{high-temperature}} oven with temperatures typically reaching an air temperature of 300 - 450 °C. The process takes about four hours and requires the parts to be cleaned completely and re-powder coated. Parts made with a thinner-gauge material need <b>to</b> be <b>burned</b> <b>off</b> at a lower temperature to prevent the material from warping.|$|R
500|$|Writing for Media Life Magazine, Tom Conroy {{felt the}} stoner comedy played to the series' strengths—a rarity, he felt, among comedians relying on such humor {{while under the}} {{influence}} themselves. While he dubbed the twins' humor [...] "as lazy and aimless" [...] as their animated counterparts at times, he concluded that [...] "its genial vibe makes it a pleasant way <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> a quarter hour." [...] Reviewing both the series and Golan the Insatiable, Erik Adams of The A.V. Club felt [...] the [...] "horizons" [...] of Lucas Bros. were broader than that of Golan, given that its [...] "slacker vibe so readily goes with the surreal flow."

500|$|Booth {{failed to}} pass 20 {{in the first six}} innings of the Test series. With Australia 10 up after three Tests, a draw in the Fourth Test was {{sufficient}} to retain the urn. Booth regained his touch with three scores beyond fifty in four innings leading up to the Fourth Test, including 132 against Middlesex. When the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Fourth Test, Booth made a [...] "courtly" [...] 98 in a 219-run partnership with Simpson. The Australians batted for more than two days <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> any chance of an England victory. Booth then scored 193 not out, his highest for the summer, in Australia's 7/315 declared against Yorkshire, setting up the tourists' victory. He made 74 in the Fifth Test and ended the series with 210 runs at 42.00. Along with Simpson and Lawry, Booth was one of three Australians to accumulate more than 1,500 first-class runs for the English summer.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the vessel}} {{was no longer}} {{seaworthy}} and could not move under its own power, even if freed from the beach, {{the focus of the}} operation changed. Oil from the ship's fuel tanks continued to pose an environmental hazard, a situation exacerbated by both the ship's structural failure and continuing pounding from the surf. In order to mitigate the situation, the Unified Command decided to set the fuel tanks on fire in order <b>to</b> <b>burn</b> <b>off</b> the oil. The first attempt was made on February 10. Napalm and other incendiary devices were used to ignite the fuel, but only one of the diesel tanks was burned effectively. A second attempt was made on February 11 when US Navy explosive experts placed 39 shaped charges to breach the top of the fuel tanks from within the cargo holds. 2,280liters of napalm and nearly 180kg of plastic explosives were also used to ignite the fuel on board. The ship burned for approximately 33hours. Additional smaller-scale attempts were made to burn more oil over the next two days, with limited success. The total amount of oil that was burned is estimated to be between [...] The structural stress caused by the fire, combined with continued severe weather, caused the vessel to break into two sections around midnight on February 11.|$|E

2500|$|Steel (with {{a carbon}} content between pig iron and wrought iron) was first {{produced}} in antiquity as an alloy. Its process of production, Wootz steel, was exported before the 4th century BC to ancient China, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Archaeological evidence {{of cast iron}} appears in 5th century BC China. New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century. During the Industrial Revolution, new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel, creating {{a new era of}} greatly increased use of iron and steel that some contemporaries described as a new Iron Age.
