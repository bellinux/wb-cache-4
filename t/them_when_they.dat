She trained with Mihai and Silvia Brestyan at a club called Gymnastics and More, and followed <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> opened their own facility in Ashland, Massachusetts. The Brestyans served as Sacramone's coaches {{for the rest of her}} career.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E
5|$|Emma Goldman {{was born}} on June 27, 1869. Her father used {{violence}} to punish his children, beating <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> disobeyed him. He used a whip on Emma, the most rebellious of them. Her mother provided scarce comfort, rarely calling on Abraham to tone down his beatings. Goldman later speculated that her father's furious temper was at least partly a result of sexual frustration.|$|E
5|$|However, as the Channel Islands lacked {{strategic}} significance, the Allies bypassed <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> invaded Normandy. As a result, the German garrisons stationed on {{the islands}} did not surrender until 9 May 1945—one day after Victory in Europe Day. The garrison on Alderney did not surrender until 16 May. Because most of the German garrisons surrendered peacefully, the Channel Islands are host {{to some of the}} best-preserved Atlantic Wall sites.|$|E

5|$|In August, Ibrahim renewed the {{offensive}} {{and he sent}} a group of regular soldiers down the coast and they reached Kariopoli before they retreated. Ibrahim sent a force of 8,000 men down to Polytsaravo {{and on the way}} they destroyed a tower that was opposing <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> reached Polytsaravo, they were faced by the Maniots in their forts. The Egyptians and the Ottomans were forced to retreat with significant losses. This was the last time Mani was invaded during the War for Independence, as Greece was liberated in 1828.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Amy Pond, Rory and River Song are {{summoned to}} Utah, United States, by the Eleventh Doctor, who is {{killed by a}} mysterious figure in a space suit. The dead Doctor is {{revealed}} to be an older self, after his younger version returns. They try {{to understand what the}} future Doctor said and are sent to Washington D.C. The team deals with the Silence, a race of aliens with the ability to make people forget their encounter with <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> look away.|$|E
5|$|In time, the {{ineffectiveness}} of the CIP {{began to}} concern the Eisenhower administration, who {{were worried about}} the lack of industrialization. The corruption that permeated the initiative remained a problem. The rural peasants of Vietnam, who comprised more than 80% of the population, were unaffected by the aid package except for the resentment that it instilled in <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> observed the relative affluence of their city counterparts compared to their own impoverished state. However, the program was credited with transforming the textile industry, as 25,000 sewing machines were imported {{in the first year of}} its operation.|$|E

5|$|Lavelli {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Hudson, Ohio, a small town in the northeastern part of the state. Both of his parents were Italian immigrants. His father Angelo Lavelli was a {{blacksmith}} who made shoes for horses on nearby farms. As a child, he practiced catching by throwing baseballs against walls and trying to catch <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> bounced back. He liked to have friends throw ping-pong balls at him {{to see if he could}} catch them.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats {{are covered}} with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black in color, with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray in color. The fur has two layers, which helps {{protect them from the}} cold water. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are {{slightly}} flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> walk on land, their tails drag on the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize.|$|E
5|$|The English Great Horse was valued {{during the}} reign of Henry VIII, when stallions {{measuring}} less than 'fifteen handfuls' could not be kept, but the increasing role of gunpowder brought an end to the use of heavy horses in battle. Oliver Cromwell's cavalry favoured lighter, faster mounts and the big horses began to be used for draught work instead. During the 16th century, Dutch engineers brought Friesian horses with <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> came to England to drain the fens, and these horses probably had a significant influence on what became the Shire breed.|$|E

5|$|The local Cathars held {{a special}} place in their {{religion}} for horses, especially through their belief in the transmigration of souls. There was also a belief in Pamiers that knights took their horses with <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> died. In the 12th century, the Cathar princess Esclarmonde of Foix climbed to the fortress of Château de Montségur {{on the back of a}} small, sure-footed black horse. In the 14th century, the same small black horses are mentioned as accompanying the armies of Gaston III, Count of Foix.|$|E
5|$|The {{margin of}} the Empress Eudocia's copy of the Iliad has a note {{summarizing}} a Hellenistic poet who tells a different story of Orion's birth. Here the gods Zeus, Hermes, and Poseidon come to visit Hyrieus of Tanagra, who roasts a whole bull for <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> offer him a favor, he asks {{for the birth of}} sons. The gods take the bull's hide and ejaculate or urinate into it and bury it in the earth, then tell him to dig it up ten months later. When he does, he finds Orion; this explains why Orion is earthborn.|$|E
5|$|When the 3rd Infantry {{landed at}} Licata, Sicily, on 10 July, Murphy was a {{division}} runner. On a scouting patrol, he killed two fleeing Italian officers near Canicattì. Sidelined with illness {{for a week}} when Company B arrived in Palermo on 20 July, he rejoined <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were assigned to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement, {{while the rest of}} the 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello en route to the Allied capture of the transit port of Messina.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a captive}} from Barcoor, {{pregnant}} women often gave birth en route, and their babies {{had to be}} borne bundled about <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> rested, the infants were suspended in cradles from the branches of trees. If anyone happened to die they were buried on the spot. Captives were not given any rations, and {{when the time came}} to move on, those who had not finished cooking had to leave behind their rice and the cooking pots. The Barcoor Manuscript along with other British Government records suggest that 20,000 captives (one-third of the total) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and ill treatment by soldiers. The journey to Seringapatam took six weeks. By 1787, some 30,000 captives, half the original number, had perished.|$|E
5|$|Another change made in Emerald is the {{addition}} of Team Magma's base {{on the side of}} Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pokémon Groudon is found here, rather than in the Cave of Origin. Even though the locations of the legendary Pokémon are different, Team Magma still makes the mistake of taking the blue orb to Groudon, while Team Aqua still makes the mistake of taking the red orb to Kyogre. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, watching them battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up with <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> get to the Battle Frontier.|$|E
5|$|Exton {{submitted}} {{his report}} to Madeleine's Fund in November 2008, but the fund told Exton {{that the report}} and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between {{the company and the}} fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, and in part because the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors. The fund passed the e-fits to the police—the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> became involved in August 2011—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of suspects in her book, Madeleine (2011), although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial.|$|E
