40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{implications}} of the Swedish tax reform of 1994, by explicitly modeling some unusual features of the tax code such as the Annell deduction and the <b>tax</b> <b>equalization</b> <b>reserve</b> (SURV). The paper is about the effects of tax policy on corporate investment and financial structure. Financial preferences are derived using pairwise comparisons, and the weighted average cost of capital is evaluated. This is done by allowing for endogenous adjustment in the firm's financial choices. This paper demonstrates how theoretical and numerical analysis can be combined to evaluate the overall effects of simultaneous changes in several tax parameters. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive overview of existing methods of mitigating double taxation of corporate income within a standard {{cost of capital}} model. Two of the most well-known and most utilized methods, the imputation and the split rate systems, do not mitigate double taxation in corporations where the marginal investment is financed with retained earnings. However, all methods are effective when the marginal investment is financed with new share issues. The corporate tax rate, fiscal allowances, allocation to periodization funds and allocation to <b>tax</b> <b>equalization</b> <b>reserves</b> (or allowance for corporate equity) are effective instruments, independent {{of the sources of}} financing. The paper also discusses why so many different methods have been employed in mitigating double taxation. Corporate Taxation; Double Taxation; Cost of Capital...|$|R

In particular, it asks the question whether fiscal equalization schemes can mitigate inefficient tax competition.

40|$|The {{equalization}} criterion {{is important}} {{in relation to the}} real estate tax. The amount that the taxpayer must pay to the government should be commensurate with the current market value of the asset. In several European Countries, including Italy, the real estate tax is based on cadastral incomes, which often do not express the assets real market value. The evaluation model proposed in this study, developed following the evaluation logic of typical values procedure, aims to get to <b>tax</b> <b>equalization</b> by revising <b>tax</b> rates according to market information properly collected from datasets provided by private or public agencies.

40|$|A {{traditional}} {{method of}} dealing with solvency and <b>equalization</b> <b>reserves</b> in insurance is {{to make use of}} the classical ruin probability models. An analogy of a well-known physical model, known as the Feynman Path-integrals for imaginary times, is introduced in order to model the solvency of an insurance portfolio incorporating cycles. The aim is to construct a probabilistic model describing probability densities for the surplus of a portfolio in such a way that the classical trajectory satisfying a 2 nd order differential equation is obtained as an expected trajectory. The advantage of this approach is that analytical expressions can be obtained for solvency margins and that the effects of pure solvency and the effect of cyclic behavior can be separated. In other words, a clear distinction is made between the classical idea of solvency and the <b>equalization</b> <b>reserves</b> due to cyclic trends.
