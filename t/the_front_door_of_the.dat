5|$|In Pittsburgh, two FBI agents, Angus Stedman (Lawrence LeJohn) and James Leeds (Kevin McClatchy), are {{observing a}} house when Leeds falls asleep. When he awakes, he discovers that <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house is open. The two agents {{investigate}} and stumble upon a {{room filled with}} dead bodies. Suddenly, a man wielding an axe and possessing a third eye murders both agents with {{a blow to the}} head.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Mulder shows Scully some tracks by <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{house that}} appear to be human. Based on the weight distribution, however, the assailant evidently travels on the balls of its feet rather than from heel to toe. Additionally, that the {{creature}} lured the mother out of the house {{in order to get to}} Louis suggests to Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature.|$|E
5|$|Laura and L. D. {{were due}} to be arraigned on May 25. Between 11:30 and midnight on May 24, a group of between a dozen and 40 men arrived at the jail. They entered it through <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheriff's office. Payne, the jailer, said he had left it {{unlocked}} to let in a detective from McAlester, who was looking for an escaped prisoner. He said the men bound, gagged and blindfolded him at gunpoint, took his keys, and cut the telephone line. He was unable to identify them.|$|E

5|$|On October 22, Schlesselman and Cowart {{shot at a}} {{glass window}} on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allen Baptist Church in Brownsville, Tennessee. The two men bragged to a female friend about the shooting; the friend told her mother, who {{notified}} the Haywood County Sheriff's Department. Investigators traced the shell casings to Schlesselman and Cowart, and notified the Crockett County Sheriff's Department, who took the pair into custody after spotting the Swastikas, slurs and 88 and 14 numbers on their car.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor prepares {{some food}} and blindfolds The Man. He leads The Man to {{a part of}} the {{hospital}} where a woman is kept, and gives her the food. The Brute sets fire to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospital, though The Doctor and The Man extinguish the flames. The Man and The Doctor go to bring food to the woman again, and The Man gives her a wrapped gift. They then catch The Brute attempting to saw through the iron bar gate, though are able to scare him off.|$|E
5|$|Somehow King {{walked in}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jail {{and a few}} minutes later out the back. King had {{arranged}} with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the Nugget) to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. On March 19, King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.|$|E

5|$|The Everett Station complex also {{includes}} a bus station with 26 bus bays that serve as a major transfer station for routes from Snohomish County. Everett Transit operates {{the majority of its}} bus routes out of their 12 bus bays on Smith Avenue. Community Transit has six routes at the station, serving as the terminus for local service from Smokey Point, Marysville, Snohomish, Lake Stevens, and Monroe; CT also debuted their Swift bus rapid transit service in 2009, with Everett Station as the northern terminus of the route along the Highway 99 corridor to Shoreline. Sound Transit runs three of its ST Express bus routes out of Everett Station, with peak-only, limited-stop service to Seattle and Bellevue, as well as all-day service to Seattle via Lynnwood Transit Center, along Interstate 5 and Interstate 405. Skagit Transit runs a weekday inter-county express route (Route 90X) from the station to the Skagit Transportation Center in Mount Vernon and Chuckanut Park & Ride in Burlington; Island Transit also runs a peak-only weekday express route (Route 412C) from Everett Station to Stanwood and Camano Island. Paratransit to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station building is provided by Community Transit and Everett Station through the Dial a Ride program.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground. As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up and}} makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher in a classroom who's stricken with fear and closes the door, realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. As the boy makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman about the boy, who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes that the door is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that the boy has escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by {{one of the men who}} pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E

25|$|In 1871, two stone lions {{were placed}} at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Avenue Building, {{as symbols of}} {{guardianship}} of the peopleâs money.

A project to restore the lions began in September 2009 and was completed in June 2013. The two new exact replica lions were created by Master Carver Nicolas Fairplay. The original lions sit inside the Fourth Avenue building.|$|E
25|$|The Museum at Casa Armstrong Poventud {{presents}} the latest architectural and artistic taste in vogue {{at the end}} of the 19th century in Europe. For example, heavy use of glass on doors and windows. The glass decor used in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residence, for instance, is almost identical to those used in the Crystal Palace at the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations in England years earlier. The floral and natural motifs in the residence, are also characteristic of those comprising the new artistic expression of the Victorian Era evident in Europe and the United States in the first decades of the 20th century.|$|E
