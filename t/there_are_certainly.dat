However, over 96% of the nation has health insurance with varying degrees of care available.|$|E

25|$|The {{interiors}} of the Tudor style building have evolved considerably {{along with the}} style, often becoming truer to the replicated era than were the first examples of the revival style. At Ascott House, Devey's great masterpiece constructed throughout {{the last twenty years}} of the 19th century, the only internal concessions to the Tudor age are the low ceilings necessitated through the external Tudor theme. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> no beam ceilings, low narrow doorways or inglenook fireplaces heating small rooms: the large airy rooms are in fact more redolent of the 18th century than the 16th. Cragside is slightly more true to its theme, although the rooms are very large, some contain Tudor style panelling, and the dining room contains are monumental inglenook, but this is more in the style of Italian renaissance meets Camelot than Tudor. While in the cottages at Mentmore the interiors are no different from those of any lower middle-class Victorian small household.|$|E
500|$|Defending {{along an}} over-extended front, the Serbian Supreme Command decided to abandon Belgrade. The city was {{evacuated}} on 29/30 November. The Austro-Hungarians entered {{the city on}} 1 December, prompting yet more celebrations in Vienna. The Serbian people withdrew alongside their army and many retreated to Niš, where news of Belgrade's fall was greeted [...] "impassively", {{as it had been}} [...] "expected {{since the beginning of the}} war". Albin Kutschbach, a German agent in Niš, reported: [...] "More refugees are arriving by the day, and despite many people being sent on south, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> still 60,000 people here." [...] Germany responded to the capture of Belgrade with delight and sent a congratulatory telegram to the Austro-Hungarian leadership. The Austro-Hungarians ascertained that their war with Serbia would soon be over and began preparing for the country's occupation. On 2 December, the anniversary of Franz Joseph's 66th year on the throne, Potiorek wrote that he was [...] "laying town and fortress Belgrade at His Majesty's feet".|$|E
500|$|The 12th-century chronicler William of Malmesbury records a story, {{in which}} shortly after Urse was {{appointed}} sheriff, he encroached on the cemetery {{of the cathedral}} chapter of Worcester Cathedral. Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, pronounced a rhyming curse on Urse, declaring [...] "Thou are called Urse. May you have God's curse." [...] Ealdred had been Bishop of Worcester before becoming archbishop, and still retained {{an interest in the}} diocese. Gerald of Wales, a late 12th- and early 13th-century writer, wrote that Wulfstan uttered the curse after Urse had attempted to have Wulfstan deposed as bishop. Gerald goes on to relate that Wulfstan stated he would only relinquish his episcopal staff to the king who had granted it, William I's predecessor, Edward the Confessor. Gerard then reports that Wulfstan proceeded to work a miracle at Edward's tomb, a miracle so impressive that King William confirmed Wulfstan in his episcopate. Although Urse did not succeed in removing Wulfstan, and although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> embellishments added in Gerald's story, it is clear that Urse and Wulfstan were the main powers in Worcestershire, and were thus great rivals.|$|E

500|$|Peggy and Frank {{were married}} {{on-screen}} on 1 April 1999. A [...] "hen night" [...] was thrown for Windsor with the show's make-up team, and the BBC threw a [...] "massive" [...] {{party in the}} show's Albert Square to celebrate the event. Actors Windsor and Reid joined fellow stars, celebrities and TV executives for a celebration on the programme's set in Elstree, Hertfordshire. Windsor admitted {{she had been so}} nervous before filming the wedding she was sick on set. She commented, [...] "I broke out in spots and threw up in the vestry. I was very nervous – we were both very nervous. The day you stop getting nervous you can hold your hands up. It shows you care." [...] The soap wedding was filmed in Harrow, North West London in February 1999. A BBC spokesman commented: [...] "It {{is one of the best}} weddings Walford has ever seen but it is not problem free. There are a lot of people who do not want to see Frank and Peggy married – Grant being one of them – and it remains to be seen whether they will get through the day without a major upset. And as if the wedding is not gripping enough, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> shocking revelations back at the Vic." [...] In the eventual episode, it was actually Grant Mitchell who persuaded his mother to marry Frank – with whom he had been feuding following his accidental killing of wife Tiffany – after Peggy was having second thoughts, thinking that Frank was only marrying her out of pity. Nearly 20 million viewers watched Peggy and Frank marry.|$|E

2500|$|David Baldwin {{identifies}} Robin Hood {{with the}} historical outlaw Roger Godberd, who was a die-hard supporter of Simon de Montfort, which would place Robin Hood around the 1260s. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> parallels between Godberd's career and that of Robin Hood as he appears in the Gest. John Maddicott has called Godberd [...] "that prototype Robin Hood". Some problems with this theory are {{that there is no}} evidence that Godberd was ever known as Robin Hood and no sign in the early Robin Hood ballads of the specific concerns of de Montfort's revolt.|$|E

2500|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> {{times when}} some of these words: host, army, company, band are used outside of this context.

At times, army can mean a singular fighting force of no set size, as can company, or host. Within the context of most battle, or war, descriptions these terms are generally consistent throughout the canon. [...] More modern military terms such as battalion and regiment see occasional use, but are not widespread.|$|E

[...] In Mechelen and Elewijt, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> some dubious allegations among the Bryce Committee witnesses.

2500|$|To Scaliger, the {{publication}} of Scaliger Hypobolimaeus was crushing. Whatever his father Julius had believed, Joseph had never doubted {{himself to be a}} prince of Verona, and in his Epistola had put forth all that he had heard from his father. He wrote a reply to Scioppius, entitled Confutatio fabulae Burdonum. In the opinion of Pattison, [...] "as a refutation of Scioppius it is most complete"; but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> grounds for dissenting from this judgment. Scaliger purported that Scioppius committed more blunders than he corrected, claiming that the book made untruthful allegations; but he did not succeed in adducing any proof either of his father's descent from the La Scala family, or of any of the events narrated by Julius prior to his arrival at Agen. Nor does Scaliger attempt a refutation of the crucial point, namely, that William, the last prince of Verona, had no son Nicholas, who would have been the alleged grandfather of Julius.|$|E
2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "Much {{like the}} first season of the fairytale show, it looks like we'll spend most of 5A looking back at what {{actually}} happened in those missing six weeks, how Emma became the Dark One, {{and what it means}} for Storybrooke. It'll be interesting to see where this season lands overall. Last year, we spent months entombed in a Frozen arc that seemed to stretch on for so long, it made even the warmest of fans feel icy. Putting Emma in the spotlight as the Dark One seems like an attempt to bring some focus back to the show's themes as well as its central characters, despite the fact <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> going to be many new ones popping in (and out) over the season. And hey, if we learned anything from last season's Queens of Darkness, it's that maybe we'll at least get some awesome wardrobe changes for Emma. Some darker eyeliner? Strappy awesome three inch stilettos? The possibilities are endless… [...] " ...|$|E

2500|$|In Norman times a small castle was {{established}} at Bossiney, probably before the Domesday Survey of 1086; Bossiney and Trevena were {{established as a}} borough in 1253 by Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall. In Domesday Book <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> two manors in this parish (for a probable third see Trethevy). Bossiney (which included Trevena) was held from the monks of Bodmin by the Earl of Cornwall: there was land for 6 ploughs and [...] of pasture (before the Conquest it had been held from the monks by Alfwy). The monks of Bodmin held Treknow themselves: there was land for 8 ploughs and [...] of pasture. Tintagel {{was one of the}} 17 Antiqua maneria of the Duchy of Cornwall. The parish feast traditionally celebrated at Tintagel was 19 October, the feast day of St Denys, patron of the chapel at Trevena (the proper date is 9 October but the feast has moved forward due to the calendar reform of 1752). The market hall and the site of the fair were near the chapel.|$|E
2500|$|Due to a {{wide range}} of media {{coverage}} and large scale steroid scandals fans and experts have continued to bring the games integrity into question. Major League Baseball is a game of statistics. The entirety of a player's career is based upon the consistency and credibility of the numbers and accolades acquired during the period in which they played. [...] "Their real impact has been at the margins: <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> some scrubs who wouldn't be in the majors without the juice, and we have ample evidence that at the other end of the scale, drugs can take Hall of Famers and all-time greats and help them perform at historically unprecedented levels" [...] (La-Times). When it comes to this topic generally there are two trains of thought. Many do not see the harm with this type of substance use because it makes the game more exciting and allows athletes to reach untested potentials. On the other side of the argument many fans and experts believe the game has lost its purity because of this drug use. More recently an issue has arose with high-caliber players who have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs are not being voted for on a hall of fame ballot. This fact has brought many to question the game's integrity. No matter the statistics and achievements produced by the certain player prior to drug use, a positive test for steroids has shown to discredit the athletes integrity and career entirely.|$|E
