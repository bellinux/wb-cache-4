Johansson had five releases in 2004, three of which—the teen heist film The Perfect Score, the drama A Love Song for Bobby Long, and the drama A Good Woman—were critical and commercial failures.

Variety David Rooney wrote that Johansson's and Travolta's portrayals rescued the film. Johansson earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama nomination for the film.|$|E

He was gifted with extraordinary athleticism, even compared with other professional athletes, and skills in areas that bode well for basketball.|$|E

A Persian-born physician, alchemist and philosopher, he is most famous for his medical works, but he also wrote botanical and zoological works, as well as books on physics and mathematics.

Many of his books were translated into Latin, and he remained one of the undisputed authorities in European medicine well into the 17th century.|$|E
25|$|Wardle, though {{mainly a}} {{classical}} orthodox left-arm finger-spinner, was probably <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>versatile</b> {{of all the}} great spin bowlers, and he was capable both of originality and accuracy. His ability to bowl left-arm wrist spinners that turned and bounced much more sharply, made him preferred over Tony Lock in his heyday. Wardle is the only English bowler to master this unusual style, and it gave him many of his greatest successes, notably in South Africa in 1956/1957, where he achieved the feat of taking 100 wickets in a season outside England. He was able, when circumstances allowed, to bowl the chinaman and did so at the highest level.|$|E
25|$|Western special {{operations}} forces are considered strategic assets with core missions including FID and UW. They may have other capabilities relevant to specific situations, such as demining. United States Army Special Forces are among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>versatile</b> organizations, but not all their capabilities may be needed for a specific FID situation. For example, the most urgent need might be for public health specialists or airfield construction crews, which operate on a level far beyond the medical or engineering specialists of a US Special Forces unit. Public health or construction organizations, however, have limited or no self-defense capability and will need protection in insecure areas.|$|E

He finished third in the world championships of 1996 and 1998.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>versatile</b> among dialkylboranes is 9-BBN. It exists {{predominantly}} as a dimer. It can be distilled without decomposition at 195°C (12mm Hg). Such property allows 9-BBN {{to react}} at 60–80°C, and most alkenes react within one hour in such temperature range. Even tetrasubstituted alkenes undergo hydroboration with 9-BBN at elevated temperature. As mentioned before, 9-BBN has excellent regioselectivity in hydroboration of alkenes. It is {{more sensitive to}} subtle steric differences than Sia2BH, because the rigid hetereocyclic substituents prevent internal rotation to relieve steric hindrance in the transition state. Reflecting its greater sensitivity to electronic factors, 9-BBN is more reactive towards alkenes than alkynes.|$|E
