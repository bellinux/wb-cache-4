5|$|After dark, the 48th Battalion {{took over}} the line from the {{remainder}} of the 9th Division. The 47th Battalion was still on its right, and on the left was the British V Corps. The 48th Battalion occupied a small salient between Albert and Dernancourt. During the night, desultory artillery and machine gun fire was directed at the battalion's positions. In the early morning light of 28 March, the forward two companies could make out German infantry advancing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog.</b> They approached without the coverage of a barrage, and in quite close formation, some had their rifles slung. The men of the 48th Battalion quickly brought their weapons to bear and the Germans stopped advancing. A minor break through on the right-flanking 47th Battalion was quickly dealt with and thirty prisoners taken. During the day, the Germans advanced another eight times, each time more cautiously and with a little more fire support. But each time the Australians beat them back. By evening the Germans appeared to have withdrawn, and the 48th Battalion had suffered the loss of 62 men. That night and the next two days passed relatively quietly, with Leane rotating his companies through the front line posts, with characteristic care not to create congestion in the forward areas. The battalion was relieved on the night of 30 March.|$|E
5|$|During England’s second innings, Joe Hardstaff, Jr. {{fell for}} 43, lofting Ernie Toshack to Hassett {{on the leg}} side to end a {{partnership}} of 93 with Denis Compton. The ball looped {{up in the air}} and travelled half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog.</b> Australia eventually finished off the hosts for 441, leaving them a target of 98 on the final afternoon. Australia proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell. Bradman came in and was out for a duck. This left Australia at 2/48, at which point dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and it appeared that rain might save England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. The tourists reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes tied the scores with a swept boundary, but ran off the field with a souvenir stump, believing that the match was over. He returned to the field when he noticed the crowd reaction; Hassett hit the winning run to end with an unbeaten 21.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, Compton edged to the slips {{from the}} bowling of Miller, but Johnson spilled the catch. Hardstaff fell for 43, lofting Toshack to Hassett {{on the leg}} side, having put on 93 with Compton. The ball looped {{up in the air}} and {{travelled}} half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog.</b> Barnett came in and together with Compton added 21 runs in 33 minutes before edging Johnston to Miller, who completed a difficult catch in slips. Yardley came out to bat at 264/5 and Compton drove Miller square for four, provoking the bowler's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and Miller's next delivery slipped out of his hand and cleared Compton's head on the full to some jeering in the crowd. Such a ball is known as a beamer and is illegal because of the physical danger it poses to the batsman. Compton and Yardley put on a 57-run partnership in 66 minutes before Johnston held a return catch to dismiss Yardley for 22. England reached stumps at 345/6, just one run ahead of Australia, with Compton on 154 and Evans on 10. During the day, Johnston bowled the most overs, 30.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} innings, Bradman thought that rain might come so he {{utilised}} Toshack to bowl defensive leg theory. He did so {{to slow the}} scoring so that England {{would not have a}} lead by the time the rain came to create a sticky wicket, otherwise Australia would have been forced to chase a target on a difficult pitch with irregular bounce and pace. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless the light was so poor as endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced proceedings to continue as they posed no injury threat to the batsmen. Early on the fourth morning, Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly while bowling to Hutton and Denis Compton, but Bradman opted to have Miller take the new ball in the fifth over of the day {{as soon as it was}} available, taking Toshack off. Later, Toshack was used defensively while Miller attacked from the other end. Bradman's response to a boundary being hit from Toshack was to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions, and scoring was slow as Toshack bowled accurately. Toshack took the wicket of Joe Hardstaff junior for 43, who holed out to Hassett on the leg side, having supported Denis Compton in a partnership of 93. The ball looped up in the air and travelled half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog.</b> Toshack ended with 1/60 from 33 overs as Australia were one bowler short after an injury to Lindwall had prevented him from bowling since the first afternoon. England were bowled out for 441 and Australia reached the target of 98 with eight wickets in hand.|$|E

25|$|A pilot cutter {{cruising}} in {{the vicinity}} of Lundy Island had encountered Montagu a short time earlier. The battleship had stopped engines, come abreast, and hailed from the bridge requesting a distance and bearing for Hartland Point on the mainland of England. Though the cutter supplied these accurately, the voice from the battleships bridge replied that they must be wrong and that the pilot cutter must have lost her bearings. As Montagu restarted her engines and began to move ahead, the cutter shouted back that on her present course Montagu would be on Shutter Rock within ten minutes, and a short time later the sound of the battleship running aground carried <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog.</b>|$|E
25|$|At 12:02 Yavuzs first {{artillery}} officer {{could make}} out the Russian ships <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> and ordered the crew to target Evstafi. The first salvo overshot the ship, though one shell pierced the center funnel and caused splinter damage to the wireless antennae. The Ottomans' third salvo scored two hits on Evstafi. The first one disabled the forward starboard 6-inch casemated gun and caused casualties among its crew. The second shell penetrated the casemate armour, setting fire to some 6-inch cartridges and detonating in the officers' galley, causing severe damage while some splinters penetrated the deck and went into the boiler room below. A near miss caused extensive splinter damage to an unarmoured part of the ship, destroying a bulkhead in the infirmary.|$|E
50|$|A critic from The Age, 2 September 1924, wrote—One {{would imagine}} {{from the little}} scenes that Miss Beckett has gathered, {{in the name of}} Australian art, that Australia was in a continual state of fog - all kinds of fogs - pink, blue, green and grey with an {{occasional}} mist that surely was never on land or sea.

25|$|Geary's {{expected}} dawn {{crossing of}} Lookout Creek was delayed by high water until 8:30a.m. First {{to cross the}} footbridge was Cobham's brigade, followed by Ireland's, which formed to Cobham's left and {{became the center of}} Geary's battle line. Candy's brigade then extended the Union left down {{to the base of the}} mountain. Whitaker's brigade followed in the rear. From 9:30 to 10:30 a.m, Geary's skirmishers advanced <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> and mist that obscured the mountain. Contact was made with Walthall's pickets 1 mile southwest of Lookout Point. The Confederates were significantly outnumbered and could not resist the pressure, falling back but leaving a number behind to surrender. Hooker ordered an artillery bombardment to saturate the Confederate line of retreat, but the effect was minimized because of poor visibility and the fact that the two forces were almost on top of each other.|$|E
25|$|When Stevenson {{heard the}} {{fighting}} between Walthall and Geary, he ordered Pettus to take three regiments {{from the summit}} to assist Jackson. By this time, Moore's Alabamians were moving up amidst Walthall's retreating men, and they fired on Ireland's New Yorkers from 100 yards. Unable to see {{the size of the}} force resisting it <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog,</b> the Union men retreated beyond a stone wall. Moore's 1,000 men took positions in the rifle pits facing the wall and waited for the inevitable counterattack. Ireland's men were too exhausted to make an immediate move. As Whitaker's brigade arrived after 1 p.m., they stepped over Ireland's men and rushed into the attack. Candy's brigade was moving up the mountain side on Whitaker's left, followed by the brigades of Woods and Grose. Moore {{could see that he was}} being significantly outflanked on the right and chose to fall back rather than be surrounded.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after daybreak, Union cavalry (a {{company of}} Ringgold Cavalry) crossed the ford on the South Branch {{at the north}} end of Hanging Rocks pass and its columns marched onto the pike below the {{awaiting}} Confederate militamen. Initially, the Confederates atop the rocks lied flat trying to ascertain <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> whether the approaching cavalry were their returning scouting party. The Union troops at the base of Hanging Rocks were naturally suspicious of the strategic location and were on high alert as they crossed the ford and made their way onto the pike. The Union troops noticed heads of the Confederate militamen peering over the cliffs and fired upon them. The Confederates responded to the firing by hurling the boulders onto the road below causing the Union cavalry to hastily retreat down the pike and across the ford. In their hasty retreat, several of the Union cavalry ran over their infantrymen forcing them into the river, where at least five drowned.|$|E

25|$|Eugene {{proceeded}} {{to take the}} Banat fortress of Timișoara (Temeswar in German) in mid-October 1716 (thus ending 164 years of Turkish rule), before turning {{his attention to the}} next campaign and to what he considered the main goal of the war, Belgrade. Situated at the confluence of the Rivers Danube and Sava, Belgrade held a garrison of 30,000 men under Mustapha Pasha. Imperial troops besieged the place in mid-June 1717, {{and by the end of}} July large parts of the city had been destroyed by artillery fire. By the first days of August, however, a huge Turkish field army (150,000–200,000 strong), under the new Grand Vizier, Halil Pasha, had arrived on the plateau east of the city to relieve the garrison. News spread through Europe of Eugene's imminent destruction; but he had no intention of lifting the siege. With his men suffering from dysentery, and continuous bombardment from the plateau, Eugene, aware that a decisive victory alone could extricate his army, decided to attack the relief force. On the morning of 16 August 40,000 Imperial troops marched <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog,</b> caught the Turks unawares, and routed Halil Pasha's army; a week later Belgrade surrendered, effectively bringing an end to the war. The victory was the crowning point of Eugene's military career and had confirmed him as the leading European general. His ability to snatch victory at the moment of defeat had shown the Prince at his best.|$|E

25|$|According to Nawaz, {{nationalism}} hinders {{the fight}} against Islamist extremism, and democratic states must adopt a transnational outlook to combat this challenge.

Nawaz is also a critic of far-right movements that have emerged in Europe, and accuses them of harbouring disdain for ordinary Muslims. According to him, far-right xenophobes and Islamists agree upon one thing: the impossibility of Muslim and non-Muslim cohabitation in Europe. As a solution, he proposes the assertion of liberalism which can shine <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fogs</b> of these extremes.|$|R

500|$|Oxford retraced {{his steps}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> {{back to the}} fight. His group arrived, unexpectedly, at Montagu's rear. Obscured by the fog, Oxford's [...] "star with rays" [...] badge was mistaken by Montagu's men, who {{believed}} it was Edward's [...] "sun in splendour". They assumed their allies were Edward's reserves and unleashed a volley of arrows. Oxford and his men immediately cried treachery; as staunch Lancastrians, they were wary of Montagu's recent defection. They struck back and began withdrawing from the battle. Their shouts of treason were taken up and spread quickly throughout the Lancastrian line, breaking it apart as men fled in anger, panic and confusion. As the fog started to dissipate, Edward saw the Lancastrian centre in disarray and sent in his reserves, hastening its collapse. Cries of Exeter's demise from a Yorkist axe resounded across the battlefield from the Lancastrian left, and amidst the confusion, Montagu was struck in his back and killed by either a Yorkist or one of Oxford's men.|$|E
500|$|Due to unusual heat in Buffalo in May 1975, {{portions}} of game three, {{which is known}} as [...] "The Fog Game", were played in heavy fog.
