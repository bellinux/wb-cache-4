5000|$|Concavenator was a {{medium-sized}} (roughly 6 meters (20 feet) long) primitive carcharodontosaurian dinosaur possessing several unique features. Two extremely tall vertebrae {{in front of}} the hips formed a tall but narrow and pointed crest (possibly supporting a hump) on the dinosaur's back. The function of such crests is currently unknown. Paleontologist Roger Benson from Cambridge University speculated that one possibility is that [...] "it is analogous to head-crests used in visual displays", but the Spanish scientists who discovered it noted it could also be a <b>thermal</b> <b>regulator.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{circular}} {{air inlet}} behind the reduction gear has a de-icing device using hot air. The compressor's two axial stages use blisks. The shaft runs on ball bearings. Air {{flow through the}} annular combustion chamber is S-wise, with fuel being added in radial direction by a rotating atomizer disc. The blades of the three-stage turbine's wheels, also blisks, are air-cooled from the inside. The jet nozzle is fixed with an interior cone. Auxiliary drives are mounted on a mounting plate behind the inlet, which also has the connections for starter motor/generator, oil and fuel pumps, engine speed control and tachometer. There are also optional drives for an AC generator and a hydraulic pump. The whole engine is mounted at three points, two trunnions {{on the right and}} left front of the turbine casing and one on its underside to the rear. Speed control is effected automatically by governing the injection volume, with a <b>thermal</b> <b>regulator</b> allowing for short-term overloads.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} several {{proposed}} reasons for {{the size of the}} flowers of S. gigantea. First, it is possible that they are large to attract the flies that pollinate it. The largeness and color of the flower combined with the carrion smell may serve to make the flies think that it is a dead carcass and be more likely to visit it. It has also been proposed that these large flowers could work as <b>thermal</b> <b>regulators,</b> much like the large ears of a Fennec fox.|$|R
50|$|Technical grade sheet mica {{is used in}} {{electrical}} components, electronics, in atomic force microscopy and as window sheets. Other uses include diaphragms for oxygen-breathing equipment, marker dials for navigation compasses, optical filters, pyrometers, <b>thermal</b> <b>regulators,</b> stove and kerosene heater windows, radiation aperture covers for microwave ovens, and micathermic heater elements. Mica is birefringent and is therefore commonly used to make quarter and half wave plates. Specialized applications for sheet mica are found in aerospace components in air-, ground-, and sea-launched missile systems, laser devices, medical electronics and radar systems. Mica is mechanically stable in micrometer-thin sheets which are relatively transparent to radiation (such as alpha particles) while being impervious to most gases. It is therefore used as a window on radiation detectors such as Geiger-Müller tubes.|$|R
30|$|Growing {{awareness}} regarding greenhouse {{emissions and}} rising demand for energy savings are major factors boosting {{growth of the}} global high-performance insulation materials market. High-performance insulation processes are in high demand in the industrial sector, mainly due to its natural ability to regulate temperature. This {{is a very important}} attribute, as this helps avoid costs related to artificial <b>thermal</b> <b>regulators</b> such as air conditioners and heaters. Energy usage during insulation processes is minimal, which helps to cut down on associated production costs. However, some of the disadvantages associated with the usage of high-performance insulation processes are high set up and maintenance costs and relatively low service life. High-performance insulation materials need periodic maintenance, as majority of the materials are made of aerogel and ceramic fiber (Yurkov 2005; Skalkin 2006).|$|R

After the completion of Jehl's first assignment, Edison noticed Jehl's work ethic and he was so impressed that he gave Jehl a job to work more closely with him. Jehl worked on the electric light during the laboratory stage of development. Jehl was responsible for performing many experiments and tests; however, some of the most important were those that were related to the electric meter for the central stations. Edison had given Jehl specific instructions to keep him informed daily with the tests and experiments that he conducted and the results obtained. With the results that Edison received from Jehl, he was able to make informed decisions on how to create things, like the <b>thermal</b> <b>regulator</b> for the meter.|$|E

40|$|Lightweight {{materials}} are more viable {{for use in}} invariably hot or cold climates than in temperate climates. However, {{it is possible to}} use lightweight construction systems and specifically membranes even in housing buildings in temperate climate areas, if their properties are well explored, allowing better environmental performance and cost effectiveness than conventional solutions. In the outer skin and in dividing elements, architectural membranes can be used as <b>thermal</b> <b>regulators,</b> for heating (promoting a greenhouse effect or insulating) and cooling (shading or even evaporative cooling). A lightweight prototype module is proposed and presented here. Using this module as a reference, four construction solutions are compared in their economic aspects: a conventional heavyweight solution with hollow brick, a lightweight conventional solution with LSF technology, a lightweight solution in cross-laminated timber and a proposed lightweight solution with a membrane. Today’s market is not ready for widespread building construction with lightweight solutions, although these present advantages such as the relative reduction of waste on the construction site, less time spent on construction, {{and at the same time}} lower transport and labor costs. The results shown in this paper allow us to conclude that, in the Portuguese context, the new solutions are economically competitive as concerns PEC and labor costs. In countries with higher wages, these alternative technologies using lightweight {{materials are}} more efficient and profitable. In Portugal, with growing consciousness of sustainability issues and more companies exploring these solutions, it is possible to achieve a high level of acceptance...|$|R
30|$|The most {{noteworthy}} binding of Hsf 1 was on uncharacterized orf 19.1486, {{which showed}} maximum differential binding intensity under iron-deprived conditions. Earlier, the protein codded by orf 19.1486 {{has been shown}} to possess a life-span regulatory factor domain regulated by Sef 1, Sfu 1, and Hap 43. Additionally, in cells lacking the iron regulator Sef 1, the expression of orf 19.1486 is reported to be down regulated (Chen et al. 2011). Hence, this orf appears to be a common target of both the major regulator of iron homeostasis, Sef 1 and also the <b>thermal</b> stress <b>regulator</b> Hsf 1, however, this remains to be explored.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play {{important}} roles in regulating the expression of protein-coding genes by directing the degradation and/or repression of the translation of gene transcripts. Growing evidence shows that miRNAs are indispensable player in organismal development with its regulatory role in the growth and differentiation of cell lineages. However, the roles of miRNA-mediated regulation in environmental adaptation of organisms are largely unknown. To examine this potential regulatory capability, we characterized microRNAomes from the brain of zebrafish raised under normal (28 °C) and cold-acclimated (10 °C, 10 days) conditions using Solexa sequencing. We then examined the expression pattern of the protein-coding genes under these two conditions with Affymetrix Zebrafish Genome Array profiling. The potential roles of the microRNAome in the transcriptomic cold regulation in the zebrafish brain were investigated by various statistical analyses. Results Among the total 214 unique, mature zebrafish miRNAs deposited on the miRBase website (release 16), 175 were recovered in this study. In addition, we identified 399 novel, mature miRNAs using multiple miRNA prediction methods. We defined a set of 25 miRNAs differentially expressed under the cold and normal conditions and predicted the molecular functions and biological processes that they involve through Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of their target genes. On the other hand, microarray analysis showed that genes related to mRNA processing and response to stress were overrepresented among the up-regulated genes in cold-stress, but are not directly corresponding {{to any of the}} GO molecular functions and biological processes predicted from the differential miRNAs. Using several statistical models including a novel, network-based approach, we found that miRNAs identified in this study, either individually or together, and either directly or indirectly (i. e., mediated by transcription factors), only make minor contribution to the change in gene expression patterns under the low-temperature condition. Conclusions Our results suggest that the cold-stress response of mRNA expression may be governed mainly through regulatory modes other than miRNA-mediated regulation. MiRNAs in animal brains might act more as developmental <b>regulators</b> than <b>thermal</b> adaptability <b>regulators.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Time-resolved static tester {{measurements}} and dynamical continuous write power measurements (DC-write) {{were performed to}} analyze the rapid melting and solidification dynamics of quaternary AgInSbTe phase change films with different Sb/Te ratios. Significant differences in the crystallization kinetics have been observed for the different materials. As it is now well known, the Sb-rich compositions show a more pronounced crystallization ability. The related crystallization processes are investigated thanks to numerical simulations by considering a polymorphic crystalline growth {{process in which the}} temperature dependent atomic mobility via the viscosity plays a crucial role. Surprising results have also been observed concerning the optical properties of the molten phase of the Sb-richest composition. The reflectivity values seem to indicate a drop of the imaginary part of the refractive index upon melting and we will see that this remarkable behavior of the optical properties versus (melting) temperature seems to act like a <b>thermal</b> <b>regulator</b> of the structure avoiding a drastic overheating during writing...|$|E
40|$|Progress in {{understanding}} climate variability and change depends on {{our knowledge of}} the transport mechanisms and energy and matter (e. g. freshwater and chemical components) exchanges among the different components of the climate system. Through their energy and mass interactions with the other components of the climate system (atmosphere, cryosphere, biosphere and lithosphere) the oceans act as important pacemakers of climate variability in a wide spectrum of frequencies, from interannual to glacial time scales. The oceans, for instance, store and transport around heat through convection and advection, the latter by means of eddies at different spatial scales in ocean currents. Therefore, heat exchanged at the surface and stored for varying durations and released in different places; thereby ameliorating temperature changes with a <b>thermal</b> <b>regulator</b> effect over continents and contributing substantially to variability of climate on different time scales.

40|$|The {{climate system}} {{consists}} of the ¯ve components atmosphere, ocean, cryophere, bio-sphere and lithosphere. In order to understand climate and its changes on timescales from decades to several 100, 000 years, {{we need to focus}} on physical and geochemical processes particularly in the ¯rst four components. This chapter gives an introduction to the ocean component of the climate system. We ¯rst discuss the climatic relevance of the ocean not only as a <b>thermal</b> <b>regulator</b> but also as an important pacemaker of climate change. The dynamical principles of the large-scale ocean circulation are pre-sented, and °ow regimes relevant to climatic changes are explained. We then review results from models and observations that suggest that the cause for abrupt climatic changes, which are so abundant in the paleoclimatic record, is found in the ocean. The physical mechanisms for multiple equilibrium states of the thermohaline circulation are discussed. The ocean is also a pacemaker of decadal-to-century time scale variability.

40|$|Cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin {{are both}} microtubule-based {{molecular}} motors but are structurally and evolutionarily unrelated. Under standard conditions, both move with comparable unloaded velocities toward either the microtubule minus (dynein) or plus (most kinesins) end. This similarity {{is important because}} it is often implicitly incorporated into models that examine the balance of cargo fluxes in cells and into models of the bidirectional motility of individual cargos. We examined whether this similarity is a robust feature, and specifically whether it persists across the biologically relevant temperature range. The velocity of mammalian cytoplasmic dynein, but not of mammalian kinesin- 1, exhibited a break from simple Arrhenius behavior below 15 degrees C just above the restrictive temperature of mammalian fast axonal transport. In contrast, the velocity of yeast cytoplasmic dynein showed a break from Arrhenius behavior at a lower temperature (similar to 8 degrees C). Our studies implicate cytoplasmic dynein as a more thermally tunable motor and therefore a potential <b>thermal</b> <b>regulator</b> of microtubule-based transport. Our theoretical analysis further suggests that motor velocity changes can lead to qualitative changes in individual cargo motion and hence net intracellular cargo fluxes. We propose that temperature can potentially be used as a noninvasive probe of intracellular transport...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and manufacture of injection molds for high quality technical parts are complex tasks involving {{the knowledge of}} the injection molding process and the material changes induced by processing. In the case of some specific shapes (boxes, tubular fittings), the shrinkage is partially restricted by the mold. The molding shrinks against the core, inserts or pins. Thus, upon ejection, {{it will be necessary to}} overcome the frictional forces resulting from the shrinkage. The knowledge of the ejection force is a useful contribution to optimizing the design of molds with these features, and to guaranteeing the structural integrity of the moldings. A study on the effect of conditions on the ejection force required for deep tubular moldings is described for the cases of three common thermoplastic polymers. The studies were based on tubular moldings (60 mm diameter, 146 mm length, and 2 mm. thickness).

30|$|Among the {{possible}} geographical {{influences on the}} evolution of the Asian monsoon, the presence of the Paratethys sea seems most significant. The Paratethys was a shallow sea covering much of central Asia during the early Paleogene. Ramstein et al. (1997) used an AGCM with a paleogeography of 10  Ma both with and without the TP (although their TP at 10  Ma is smaller and lower than the modern TP) and 30  Ma with and without the Paratethys. The model used present-day insolation, SST, and pCO 2 values to evaluate the effects of the TP and Paratethys on monsoon evolution. The results revealed that the Paratethys acted as a <b>thermal</b> <b>regulator</b> and allowed an oceanic climate to develop over northern Eurasia. Shrinkage of the Paratethys resulted in a continental climate with larger-amplitude annual temperature variations. The enhancement of continental warming during summer as a result of disappearance of the Paratethys increased the thermal gradient between central Asia and the Indian Ocean, leading to an increase in ISM precipitation over the southern flank of the Himalaya (Ramstein et al. 1997). The decrease {{in the area of the}} Paratethys also allowed for the development of the Siberian High and thus intensification of the EAWM. Ramstein et al. (1997) concluded that the retreat of the Paratethys played an important role in the evolution of Asian monsoon intensity as did the uplift of the TP.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the behavioural responses of two gobiid fish species to temperature {{to determine if}} differences in behaviour and ventilation rate might explain any apparent vertical zonation. A survey of the shore at Manly, Moreton Bay revealed Favonigobius exquisitus to dominate the lower shore and Pseu-dogobius sp. 4 the upper shore. These species were exposed {{to a range of}} temperatures (15 – 40 C) in aquaria for up to 6 h. At 20 C F. exquisitus exhibited a mean gill ventilation rate of 26 ± 1. 4 bpm (beats per minute) differing significantly from Pseudogobius, which ventilated at a fivefold greater rate of 143 ± 6 bpm. The ventilation rate in F. exquisitus underwent a fivefold increase from normal local water temperature (20 C) to high temperature (35 C) conditions, whereas that of Pseudogobius did not even double, suggesting that Pseudogobius sp. is a better <b>thermal</b> <b>regulator</b> than F. exquisitus. While both species emerged from the water at high temperatures (> 30 C) the behaviours they exhibited while im-mersed at high temperature were quite different. F. exquisitus undertook vertical displacement movements we interpret as an avoidance response, whereas Pseudogobius sp. appeared to use a coping strategy involving movements that might renew the water mass adjacent to its body. The thermal tolerances and behaviours of F. exquisitus and Pseudogobius sp. are in broad agreement with their vertical distribution on the shore...|$|E
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes strains {{belonging}} to phylogenetic lineage II (serotypes 1 / 2 a, 1 / 2 c, and 3 a) carry a lineage-specific genome segment encoding a putative sigma subunit of RNA polymerase (lmo 0423, herein {{referred to as}} sigC), a gene of unknown function (lmo 0422) similar to the padR family of regulators, and a gene {{that is similar to}} the rodA-ftsW family of cell wall morphology genes (lmo 0421). To understand the function of this set of genes, their expression patterns and the effects of null mutations in the lineage II L. monocytogenes strain 10403 S were examined. The data are consistent with the three genes comprising an operon (the sigC operon) that is highly induced by temperature upshift. The operon is transcribed from three different promoters, the proximal of which (P 1) depends upon sigC itself. Null mutations in sigC or lmo 0422 increase the death rate at lethal temperatures and cause loss of thermal adaptive response, whereas the lmo 0421 mutation causes only a loss of the adaptive response component. Only the sigC mutation affects transcription from the P 1 promoter, whereas ectopic expression of lmo 0422 from the PSPAC promoter complements the individual lmo 0422 and sigC null mutations, showing that lmo 0422 is the actual thermal resistance regulator or effector while sigC provides a mechanism for temperature-dependent transcription of lmo 0422 from P 1. Our genetic and phylogenetic analyses are consistent with lmo 0422 —renamed lstR (for lineage-specific <b>thermal</b> <b>regulator)</b> — and sigC comprising a system of thermal resistance that was ancestral to the genus Listeria and was subsequently lost during divergence of the lineage I L. monocytogenes population...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{object of}} the present {{invention}} {{is to provide a}} simple, reliable, and lightweight coupling that will also have an efficient thermal interface. A further {{object of the}} invention is to provide a coupling that is capable of blind mating with little or no insertion forces. Another object of the invention is to provide a coupling that acts as a <b>thermal</b> <b>regulator</b> to maintain a constant temperature {{on one side of the}} coupling. Another object of the invention is to increase the available surface area of a coupling thus providing a larger area for the conduction of heat across the thermal interface. Another object of the invention is to provide a fluidic coupling that has no fluid passing across the interface, thus reducing the likelihood of leaks and contamination. The foregoing objects are achieved by utilizing, as in the prior art, a hot area (at an elevated temperature as compared to a cold area) with a need to remove excess heat from the hot area to a cold area. In this device, the thermal interface will occur not on a planar horizontal surface, but along a non-planar vertical surface, which will reduce the reaction forces and increase the thermal conductivity of the device. One non-planar surface is a surface on a cold pin extending from the cold area and the other non-planar surface is a surface on a hot pin extending from the hot area. The cold pin is fixed and does not move while the hot pin is a flexible member and its movement towards the cold pin will bring the two non-planar surfaces together forming the thermal interface. The actuating member for the device is a shape-memory actuation wire which is attached through an aperture to the hot pin and through another aperture to an actuation wire retainer. By properly programming the actuation wire, heat from the hot area will cause the actuation wire to bend the hot wire. Heat from the hot area will cause the actuation wire to bend the hot pin towards the cold pin forming the coupling and the desired thermal interface. The shape-memory actuation wire is made of a shape-memory-effect alloy such as Nitinol...|$|E

En el secano de la zona central del país el momento más crítico para {{los animales}} se presenta en el período final de otoño, especialmente cuando las lluvias se retrasan y se termina el forraje disponible del período anterior, por ello es de gran importancia estudiar acciones que permitan acelerar la emergencia de la pradera. Se plantea como hipótesis, que al aumentar la altura del remanente de la pradera, se adelanta la emergencia de plántulas, dado que aumenta la temperatura y se favorecen las condiciones microambientales. Dado lo anterior, {{en este estudio}} se planteó como objetivos, caracterizar los efectos de la altura de remanente sobre la temperatura, cuantificar los efectos de la altura del remanente sobre la velocidad de emergencia de las especies constituyentes de la pradera anual de clima mediterráneo y por último, relacionar los cambios de temperatura del suelo con la velocidad de emergencia. Se utilizaron parcelas de 1 m², donde se establecieron 4 tratamientos: sin remanente, con 4, 8 y 12 cm. de altura de remanente. Cada tratamiento tuvo 10 repeticiones. Las mediciones fueron {{realizadas}} una vez a la semana, durante los meses de junio, julio y agosto, comenzando la primera medición con la primera lluvia efectiva del año, evento que se produjo el día 13 de junio. Las variables a medir fueron: temperatura de suelo, emergencia y altura de plántulas. La emergencia y altura de plántulas, se contabilizó en subparcelas de 40 x 40 cm. Los resultados obtenidos, señalan que la emergencia de plántulas se vio favorecida en los tratamientos con remanente, adelantando su emergencia en una semana en relación al testigo. Los mejores resultados se obtuvieron en el tratamiento con una altura de 8 cm de remanente, en donde se contabilizaron un mayor número de plántulas y con mayor altura, en relación a los demás tratamientos. El remanente genera condiciones microambientales, actuando como regulador térmico, lo que favorece la emergencia en Poáceas. Las Geraniáceas, en cambio, se vieron favorecidas en suelos sin remanente, principalmente porque necesitan de mayor cantidad de luz y de temperaturas más altas para su emergencia. The {{study carried out on}} the Experimental Station Germán Greve belonging to the Faculty(Power) of Agronomic Sciences, Maipú's Corner, Metropolitan Region (33 º 28 'S and 70 º 51 ' O), during the period understood(included) between(among) the term(end) of the summer period, previous to the first effective rain of the year and the first stage of emergency and growth of the meadow, this is, from February, 2007 to August, 2007. In the dryness of the central zone of the country the most critical moment for the animals appears in the final autumn period, specially when the rains are late and there finishes the available forage of the previous period, for it it(he,she) performs great importance to study actions(shares) that allow to accelerate the emergency of the meadow. It(He,She) appears as hypothesis, which on having increased the height of the remnant of the meadow, goes forward the emergency of plántulas, provided that it(he,she) increases the temperature and the microenvironmental conditions are favored. In view of the previous thing, in this study it(he,she) appeared as aims(lenses), to characterize the effects of the height of remnant on the temperature, to quantify the effects of the height of the remnant on the emergency speed of the constituent species(kinds) of the annual meadow of Mediterranean climate and finally, to relate the changes of temperature of the soil to the emergency speed. There were in use plots of 1 m ², where 4 treatments were established: without remnant, with 4, 8 and 12 cm. Of height of remnant. Every treatment had 10 repetitions. The measurements were realized once a week, during June, July and August, beginning the first measurement with the first effective rain of the year, event that took place(was produced) on June 13. The variables to measuring were: temperature of soil, emergency and height of plántulas. The emergency and height of plántulas, cm was assessed in subplots of 40 x 40. The obtained results, they indicate that the emergency of plántulas sees favored in the treatments with remnant, advancing his(her,your) emergency in one week in relation to the witness. The best results were obtained in the treatment by a height of 8 cm of remnant, where a major number was assessed of plántulas and with major height, in relation to other treatments. The remnant generates microenvironmental conditions, operating as <b>thermal</b> <b>regulator,</b> which favors the emergency in Poaceas.
