After seeing Qingdao he wrote: [...] "A Chinaman {{can not live}} up to a thing, he always drags it down." [...] He characterized the sights of Beijing as [...] "rubberneck stations" [...] for tourists and described the palaces of the Forbidden City as [...] "very trashy-looking" [...] and [...] "not worth mentioning". He visited a section of the Great Wall of China near Beijing, which did impress him, but his overall conclusion of the Chinese was very negative: [...] "They smell of all the baths they didn't <b>take.</b> <b>The</b> <b>trouble</b> with China is, there are too many chinks here." ...|$|E
500|$|Interviewed by Oriana Fallaci in 1965, Connery {{identified}} {{where he}} had altered the character for the films, saying [...] "I said to the producers that the character had one defect, there was no humor about him; to get him accepted, they'd have to let me play him tongue-in-cheek, so people could laugh. They agreed, and there you are: today Bond is accepted {{to such an extent}} that even philosophers <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> to analyze him, even intellectuals enjoy defending him or attacking him. And even while they're laughing at him, people take him terribly seriously". Connery went on to add that [...] "Bond is important: this invincible superman that every man would like to copy, that every woman would like to conquer, this dream we all have of survival. And then one can't help liking him". After the pressures of five films in six years, Connery left the role after the 1967 film You Only Live Twice saying, [...] "It became a terrible pressure, like living in a goldfish bowl... that was part of the reason I wanted to be finished with Bond. Also I had become completely identified with it, and it became very wearing and very boring".|$|E

500|$|Dumville, {{commenting on}} these {{attempts}} {{to establish the}} historicity of the poem in 1988, said, [...] "The case for authenticity, whatever exactly we mean by that, is not proven; {{but that does not}} mean that it cannot be." [...] Likewise, Patrick Sims-Williams concluded in 2016 that, 'evaluating the supposed proofs that poems in the Books of Aneirin and Taliesin cannot go back to the sixth century, we have found them either to be incorrect or to apply to only a very few lines or stanzas that may be explained as additions. It seems impossible to prove, however, that any poem must go back to the sixth century linguistically and cannot be a century or more later'. The fact that the great majority of the warriors mentioned in the poem are not known from other sources has been put forward by several authors as an argument against the idea that the poem could be a later composition. The poems which are known to be later [...] "forgeries" [...] have clearly been written for a purpose, for example to strengthen the claims of a particular dynasty. The men commemorated in Y Gododdin do not appear in the pedigrees of any Welsh dynasty. Breeze comments, [...] "it is difficult to see why a later poet should <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> to commemorate men who, but for the poem, would be forgotten".|$|E

Milo has had difficulties in school with mathematics and problem solving; his reaction to this encounter is to protest that averages are not real. [...] The partial child enlightens Milo that there is beauty in math beyond the tedium of learning an endless set of rules, [...] "one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, {{is that many of the}} things which can never be, often are". Late in the book, Princess Reason counsels Milo, who has much learning ahead of him, not to be discouraged by its complexity, [...] "You must never feel badly about making mistakes... as long as you <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> to learn from them. For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons". An index card in the Juster papers sets forth the germ of the princess' [...] "memorable" [...] counsel to Milo, [...] "Quite often the road to Rhyme + Reason is through the right mistakes." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Peng {{developed}} a personal dislike for Mao's {{efforts to promote}} his own image in Chinese popular culture as a perfect, infallible hero singularly responsible for the Communist victories of his time. In 1955–56 Peng {{was involved in a}} large number of efforts to moderate Mao's popular image, developing into a personal campaign. Peng's preference for modesty and simplicity led Peng to oppose Mao's efforts to develop his personality cult. In 1955 a draft copy of a book, The Military History of the PVA, was submitted to Peng so that he could edit and authorize it. In the preface of the book it was stated that [...] "the military victories of the PVA" [...] were won [...] "under the correct leadership of the CCP and of Comrade Mao Zedong": Peng authorized the text after removing the phrase [...] "and of Comrade Mao Zedong". In 1956 an anonymous Chinese citizen wrote a letter to Peng condemning the practices of hanging portraits of Mao in public places and singing songs in praise of Mao: Peng sent this letter to Huang Kecheng, his chief of staff, to be widely distributed. Peng successfully opposed efforts to place a bronze statue of Mao in the Beijing Military Museum, saying: [...] "why <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> to put it up? What is put up now will be removed in the future." [...] When greeted by a group of soldiers who shouted [...] "Long Live Chairman Mao!" [...] (literally [...] "10,000 years for Chairman Mao"), Peng addressed the soldiers, saying: [...] "You shout '10,000 years for Chairman Mao!' – does he, then, live for 10,000 years? He will not even live for 100 years! This is a personality cult!" [...] When one of Peng's political commissars suggested to him that the song The East is Red (a song that idealizes Mao, which Mao later had sung in place of the Chinese national anthem during the Cultural Revolution) be widely taught throughout the PLA, Peng angrily rejected the suggestion, saying [...] "That is a personality cult! That is idealism!" [...] Later in 1956 a group of soldiers visited Peng in order to request an audience with the Chairman, but Peng rejected them, saying: [...] "He is an old man, what is so beautiful about him?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to preparing monographs on Fouquet, Vlaminck and Rufino Tamayo, Mr Perls wrote catalogues raisonnés for the artists Chaim Soutine and Jules Pascin. He also wrote an impassioned letter to The New York Times in 1939, defending the representational work by Picasso that was, at the time, being savaged by critics of an {{exhibition at the}} Museum of Modern Art. In the letter he wrote: [...] "If the public would <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> {{to spend as much}} time in the presence of Picasso’s art as they spend in the presence of good music, they would come to like it just as much,". The couple dealt primarily in modern works from the School of Paris, but also represented Alexander Calder beginning in 1954.|$|E
2500|$|Efraim Karsh, {{professor}} of Mediterranean Studies at King's College London, writes that Morris engages in what Karsh calls [...] "five types of distortion". According to Karsh, Morris [...] "misrepresents documents, resorts to partial quotes, withholds evidence, makes false assertions, and rewrites original documents... tells of statements never made, decisions never taken, events {{that never happened}} ... at times [...] does not even <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> to provide evidence..... He expects his readers to take on trust his assertions that fundamental contradictions exist between published accounts and the underlying documents.....he systematically falsifies evidence. Indeed, there is scarcely a document {{that he does not}} twist. This casts serious doubt on the validity of his entire work." [...] In addition he claimed to expose a serious gap between Morris’ text and the original diary of Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel.|$|E
2500|$|I'd place Pollock {{along with}} Hofmann and Morris Louis {{in this country}} among the very {{greatest}} painters of this generation. I actually don't think there was anyone in the same generation in Europe quite to match them. Pollock didn't like Hofmann's paintings. He couldn't make them out. He didn't <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> to. And Hofmann didn't like Pollock's allover paintings, nor could most of Pollock's artist friends make head or tail out of them, {{the things he did}} from 1947 to '50. But Pollock's paintings live or die in the same context as Rembrandt's or Titian's or Velázquez's or Goya's or David's or ...or Manet's or Ruben's or Michelangelo's paintings. There's no interruption, there's no mutation here. Pollock asked to be tested by the same eye that could see how good Raphael was when he was good or Piero when he was good.|$|E
