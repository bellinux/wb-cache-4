40|$|This fall 2000 {{season was}} marked by a very {{westerly}} flavor to the passerine migration with many sightings of western warblers, vireos, and flycatchers in western Nebraska. Most notably, Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers and Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Vireos were seen in good numbers. Additionally, three sightings of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> and five of Dusky Flycatcher added to the excitement. In this note, we report this fall 2 ̆ 7 s sightings of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> and comment {{on the status of}} this species in Nebraska. On 26 August 2000, Dinsmore observed a Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Vermivora virginiae) along the north side of Oliver Reservoir. He studied the bird at close range from 9 : 52 - 10 : 05 a. m. as it foraged with a large flock of migrant passerines. The identification of the bird as a Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> was straightforward. Features noted included the generally dull gray/brown plumage, slightly paler underparts with a very dull yellowish or buff patch {{at the center of the}} breast and bright yellow undertail coverts, conspicuous white eyering. plain, unmarked wings, and the nearly constant sideways flicking of the tail. On the basis of the brown tones to the plumage, dusky underparts, lack of a rufous cap, and only a faint hint of a yellow/buff breast patch, he concluded that the bird was an immature female Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> (see Dunn and Garrett 1997). Fontaine saw this individual briefly on 27 August in the same general area. On 27 August 2000, Fontaine observed a Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> along the gravel road South of exit 1 off Interstate 80 in southwestern Kimball County. The bird was seen shortly after sunrise from 6 : 45 - 6 : 50 a. m. foraging in a stand of Limber Pine approximately 15 meters from the roadside. The Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> was in the company of a loose flock of migrants composed of Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, Blue-gray Gnatcatchers, and a Brown Thrasher.

40|$|Despite this cool, wet spring, warbler enthusiasts {{were thrilled}} {{by one of}} the best showings in years, with Chestnut-sided, Magnolia, Black-throated Green, Blackburnian, and Mourning Warblers leading the charge. Swallows also as a group arrived early, {{including}} a record early Barn Swallow, and record early Western Tanagers (yes, more than one) appeared, surprisingly, in the east. There were no reports of mortality due to cold or excessive moisture; apparently food sources were unaffected. The large incursion of Purple Finches and the smaller one of Mountain Chickadees continued into the spring period, with impressive totals. Identification of Catharus thrushes is more difficult in the field than field guides might indicate because of the tendency of birds to stay in areas where lighting is inconsistent and often subpar for viewing. Thus reports without details earlier than late April are difficult to evaluate; also adding to the problems this spring was a higher than usual number of Hermit Thrushes. Some exciting rarities were reported; most exciting was Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s first Grace 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler,</b> a bird well-documented with photos. Others were two Black-throated Gray Warblers, a Golden-crowned Sparrow, and several other species considered casual in occurrence.

40|$|Aims:  To {{compare the}} {{susceptibility}} of a 3 -day-old biofilm and planktonic Salmonella to disinfectants at different exposure times. We hypothesize that Salmonella biofilms are more resilient to disinfectants compared to planktonic Salmonella. Methods and Results:  The susceptibility of planktonic cells to disinfectants was tested by {{a modified version}} of the Council of Europe suspension test EN 1276. Salmonella biofilms were formed using the Calgary Biofilm Device. Results show that 3 -day-old Salmonella biofilms are less susceptible to the disinfectants benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine gluconate, citric acid, quaternary ammonium compounds, sodium hypochlorite (SH) and ethanol, compared to planktonic Salmonella. Surprisingly, the results also demonstrate that low concentrations of SH were more effective against a 3 -day-old biofilm compared to high concentrations of SH. Conclusions:  While all the disinfectants evaluated were able to reduce biofilm-associated cells at concentrations and contact times sufficient to eliminate planktonic cells, there were still sufficient viable cells remaining in the biofilm to cause further contamination and potential infection. Significance and Impact of the Study:  Protocols for the use of chemical disinfectants need to include biofilm susceptibility testing. There is a requirement for an effective and standardized tool for determining the susceptibility of biofilms to disinfectants. H. S. Wong, K. M. <b>Townsend,</b> <b>S.</b> G. Fenwick, R. D.

40|$|Accepted {{manuscript}} online: 15 DEC 2015 Information on fracture biomechanics {{has implications}} in materials research and clinical practice. The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze the influence of non-carious cervical lesion (NCCL) size, restorative status and direction of occlusal loading on the biomechanical behavior of mandibular premolars, using finite element analysis (FEA), strain gauge tests and fracture resistance tests. Ten buccal cusps were loaded on the outer and inner slopes to calculate the strain generated cervically. Data were collected for healthy teeth at baseline and progressively at three lesion depths (0. 5 mm, 1. 0 mm and 1. 5 mm), followed by restoration with resin composite. The magnitude and distribution of von Mises stress and maximum principal stress were simulated at all stages using FEA, and fracture strength was also determined (n = 7 per group). There were significant effects of the lesion size and loading directions on stress, strain and fracture resistance (p< 0. 05). Fracture resistance values decreased with increase in lesion size, but returned to baseline with restorations. Combined assessment of computer-based and experimental techniques provide an holistic approach to characterize the biomechanical behaviour of teeth with both unrestored and restored NCCLs.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{amount of}} work reporters put into their reports is tremendous. Putting the {{information}} into a readable format which preserves it for future use is a challenge, but always interesting. Reporters can report on their own forms if preferred; some do now, often because of computerized record-keeping systems. I [Ross Silcock] enter the data into my computer, and so almost anything is fine, as long as I can read it. It {{is not necessary to}} list every species, although {{it is difficult to know}} whether your dates of arrival, high counts, etc. are significant until compared with the others submitted. Perhaps the best way to save time and work reporting is to plan your system so that it is simple to report when the time comes. NOTABLE EVENTS There are several highlights among the data presented below. A long list of rarities included Eurasian Wigeon, Oldsquaw, Gyrfalcon, King Rail, Snowy Plover, Red Knot, Ruff (first Nebraska record), Thayer 2 ̆ 7 s Gull, Iceland Gull, Lesser Black-backed Gull, Great Black-backed Gull, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker, Cape May Warbler, Worm-eating Warbler, Connecticut Warbler, MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> (specimen in Lancaster County), Hooded Warbler, and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow.

If there was an overall theme, {{it would be the}} widespread occurrences of species that would not be expected to linger into late December and January. Several species of waterbirds, notably Blue-winged Teal, scoters, Ruddy Duck, Common Loon, and Homed and Red-necked Grebes were in this category. Large numbers of Western Grebes were still at Lake McConaughy in early January, and surprisingly late individuals of Black-crowned Night-Heron and Plegadis ibis were located. Mourning Doves were in good numbers in the southeast, and, among passerines, Hermit Thrushes were in good numbers, also. Late surprises among sparrows included Clay-colored, Chipping, and Field. Other daringly late passerines included two (!) Ruby-crowned Kinglets at Ogallala in February, and a Wilson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> in December in Scotts Bluff Co.

40|$|In most respects, {{this was}} a routine spring. While a few rarities and several {{interesting}} reports appeared, perhaps most interesting was {{the arrival of the}} electronic age. Foremost was the start-up of 2 ̆ 2 NEBIRDS, 2 ̆ 2 the Nebraska Birding Listserver set up and operated by Robert Price at Kearney. This resource should greatly enhance communication and collective learning amongst birders in the state. We have culled several reports from observations submitted to NEBIRDS, and several reporters now contact us by email. We urge observers to forward their email addresses; if we have questions on their reports, communication would be easy! Submit reports and comments to Ross Silcock by email at silcock@sidney. heartland. net. We also gather sightings reported to the Nebraska Birdline, operated by Loren and Babs Padelford at Bellevue; these reports are placed on the Internet through BIRDCNTR, a service of the National Bird Hotline Cooperative. We should note here that this report contains unverified observations as well as documented observations. And now to the birds! Considerable discussion has taken place about a very 2 ̆ 2 slow 2 ̆ 2 warbler migration, 2 ̆ 2 slow 2 ̆ 2 for birders, meaning low numbers of birds, While this is true, most species were indeed found, although very low numbers were found of Magnolia, Black-throated Green, Blackburnian, and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, and those that were reported occurred rather late in the migration period. Usually when we do not see many migrating warblers it means they have made long, non-stop flights with beneficial tailwinds right over us to their breeding ranges. Much has been made of the scarcity of migrant warblers this spring in the eastern United States, with blame allocated to habitat loss in the tropical wintering ranges, to forest fragmentation in the breeding ranges (in particular with the result of allowing cowbird access to deep-woods birds), and to extensive smoke encountered while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. The smoke, from major fires in Mexico, may have contributed to a slower migration for some species, but we will have to be patient (a human generation or two?) to see what if anything is actually happening. Joel Jorgensen, who did weekly surveys of the eastern Rainwater Basin in April and May, gathered important shorebird data. These data are presented in the relevant shorebird species accounts. Although few early and late dates were set, a few amazing high counts occurred during the report period: for example, 39 Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Grebes, 236 Horned Grebes, and 1, 732 McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspurs.
