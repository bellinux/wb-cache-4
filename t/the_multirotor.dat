40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{effective}} vision-based navigation method that allows a multirotor vehicle to simultaneously reach a desired goal pose in the environment while constantly facing a target object or landmark.

Instead, we compute the optimal trajectory by solving a non-linear optimization problem that minimizes the target re-projection error while meeting the UAV's dynamic constraints.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the recovery of}} a fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a net suspended by multirotor UAVs. Motivated by marine fixed-wing UAV operations from ships, where limited landing space and harsh weather conditions often are present, a dynamically controlled net is presented. Traditionally a net {{is located on the}} ship-deck, introducing challenges such as heave motion and turbulence near the net. The concept presented in this thesis gives the possibility to move the net away from the ship and optimize the landing trajectory of the fixed-wing UAV according to the current weather conditions. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>multirotors</b> can carry <b>the</b> net at a certain speed along the desired landing trajectory, hence, reducing the relative velocity and the impact forces of the impact. A mathematical model of the interconnected multi-body system is presented, emphasizing the impact dynamics. Furthermore, a two-folded preliminary control system architecture is presented, subdivided into the transport and the recovery phase. The transport phase consist of the transportation of a suspended net with multirotors along a desired path, and in the actual recovery phase the net is controlled according to the fixed-wing UAV landing trajectory. The transportation is performed using a Line-Of-Sight (LOS) guidance law in combination with a reference generator. While the recovery phase utilize a modified pure-pursuit guidance law for cross-track control in combination with a desired along-track velocity trajectory, instructed by the approaching fixed-wing UAV.

40|$|Abstract — <b>The</b> <b>multirotor</b> {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{are experiencing}} a currently growing interest {{due to their}} high maneuverability, simplified mechanics and vertical takeoff and landing capability. Also for these reasons, <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> UAVs are suitable test-bed platforms for different position tracking control techniques. This paper solves the problem of safely controlling the position tracking of a multirotor UAV by using a linear state-space model predictive controller (MPC) formulation. The optimization is performed by replacing the original conic constraint set by a circumscribed pyramidal space that renders a linear set of inequalities on the total thrust vector. In order to improve the design efficiency of such kind of control systems, the present work uses a low-cost software-in-the-loop (SIL) simulation scheme for performance evaluation of control law for quadricopter. The scheme consists of two computers interconnected by an Ethernet network using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Basically, one computer runs MATLAB/Simulink while the other runs X-Plane.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the question of}} designing robust and flexible controllers to enable autonomous operation of a multirotor UAV with an attached slung load for general cargo transport. This is achieved by following an experimental approach; real flight data from a slung load multirotor coupled system is used as experience, allowing for a computer software to estimate the pose of the slung in order to propose a swing-free controller that will dampen the oscillations of the slung load when <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> is following a desired flight trajectory. The thesis presents the reader with a methodology describing the development path from vehicle design and modelling over slung load state estimators to controller synthesis. Attaching a load via a cable to {{the underside of the}} aircraft alters the mass distribution of the combined "airborne entity" in a highly dynamic fashion. The load will be subject to inertial, gravitational and unsteady aerodynamic forces which are transmitted to the aircraft via the cable, providing another source of external force to <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> platform and thus altering the flight dynamic response characteristics of the vehicle. Similarly the load relies on the forces transmitted by <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> to alter its state, which is much more difficult to control. The principle research hypothesis of this thesis is that the dynamics of the coupled system can be identified by applying Machine Learning techniques. One of the major contributions of this thesis is the estimator that uses real flight data to train an unstructured black-box algorithm that can output the position vector of the load using the vehicle pose and pilot pseudo-controls as input. Experimental results show very accurate position estimation of the load using the machine learning estimator when comparing it with a motion tracking system (2...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{feasibility}} of a multirotor controller system which can dynamically change the arm configuration of a multirotor. Currently most of <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> systems have to be powered down, rewired, and programmed with new firmware, to configure how many arms/motors they use to fly.

40|$|Objective of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} the design and realisation phases of a multirotor {{to be used for}} low risk and cost aerial observation. Starting point of this activity was a wide literature study related to the technological evolution of multirotors design and to the state of the art. Firstly the most common multirotor configurations were defined and, according to a size and performance based evaluation, the most suitable one was chosen. A detailed computer aided design model was drawn as basis for the realisation of two prototypes. The realised multirotors were "X-shaped" octorotors with eight coaxially coupled motors. The mathematical model of <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> dynamics was studied. "Proportional Integral Derivative" and "Linear Quadratic" algorithms were chosen as techniques to regulate the attitude dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>multirotor.</b> These methods were tested with a nonlinear model simulation developed in the Matlab Simulink environment. In the meanwhile the Arduino board was selected as the best compromise between costs and performance and the above mentioned algorithms were implemented using this platform thanks to its main characteristic of being completely "open source". Indeed <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> was conceived to be a serviceable tool for the public utility and, at the same time, to be an accessible device for research and studies. The behaviour of the physical multirotor was evaluated with a test bench designed to isolate the rotation about one single body axis at a time. The data of the experimental tests were gathered in real time using a custom Matlab code and several indoor tests allowed the "fine tuning" of the controllers gains. Afterwards a portable "ground station" was conceived and realised in adherence with the real scenarios users needs. Several outdoor experimental flights were executed with successful results and the data gathered during the outdoor tests were used to evaluate some key performance indicators as the endurance and the maximum allowable payload mass. Then the fault tolerance of the control system was evaluated simulating and experimenting the loss of one motor; even in this critical condition the system exhibited an acceptable behaviour. The reached project readiness allowed to meet some potential users as the "Turin Fire Department" and to cooperate with them in a simulated emergency. During this event <b>the</b> <b>multirotor</b> was used to gather and transmit real time aerial images for an improved "situation awareness". Finally the study was extended to more innovative control techniques like the neural networks based ones. Simulations results demonstrated their effectiveness; nevertheless the inherent complexity and the unreliability outside the training ranges could have a catastrophic impact on the airworthiness. This is a factor that cannot be neglected especially in the applications related to flying platforms. Summarising, this research work was addressed mainly to the operating procedures for implementing automatic control algorithms to real platforms. All the design aspects, from the preliminary multirotor configuration choice to the tests in possible real scenarios, were covered obtaining performances comparable with other commercial of-the-shelf platform...|$|E
