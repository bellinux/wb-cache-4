50|$|<b>Tiapride</b> is marketed {{under various}} trade names and is widely {{available}} {{outside of the}} United States. The most common trade name for <b>tiapride</b> is Tiapridal, which is used throughout Europe, Russia, as well as parts of South America, the Middle East, and North Africa. It is also sold under different names in Italy (Italprid, Sereprile), Japan (Tialaread, Tiaryl, Tiaprim, Tiaprizal), Chile (Sereprid), Germany (Tiaprid, Tiapridex), and China (<b>Tiapride).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Tiapride</b> {{has been}} found to cause excess {{prolactin}} levels in plasma, which can cause decreased libido, infertility and increased risk of breast cancer. This is because dopamine plays a primary role in regulating prolactin release by binding to D2 receptors on prolactin-secreting cells in the anterior pituitary. Thus, when <b>tiapride</b> blocks these receptors these cells are disinhibited and release more prolactin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tiapride</b> {{displays}} {{a relatively high}} regional selectivity for limbic areas. One study found that, in contrast with haloperidol, which displays equal affinity for receptors in the rat limbic system and striatum, <b>tiapride</b> shows over {{three times as much}} affinity for limbic areas than striatal areas. Another study in rats found tiapride's affinity for the septum, a limbic region, to be over thirty times as high as for the striatum.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tiapride's</b> {{selectivity}} for the limbic system, {{which is}} associated with emotion, could underlie its particular efficacy in treating these affective disorders. Moreover, its selectivity for the dopaminergic system is thought to account for its avoidance of the side effects typically associated with other neuroleptic drugs, such as chlorpromazine, which act {{on a number of}} neurotransmitter systems.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tiapride</b> is a {{drug that}} {{selectively}} blocks D2 and D3 dopamine receptors in the brain. It is used to treat a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders including dyskinesia, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, negative symptoms of psychosis, and agitation and aggression in the elderly. A derivative of benzamide, <b>tiapride</b> is chemically and functionally similar to other benzamide antipsychotics such as sulpiride and amisulpride known for their dopamine antagonist effects.|$|E
50|$|Efficacy at the D2 {{receptor}} is moderate, with 80 {{percent of}} receptors occupied {{even in the}} presence of excess <b>tiapride</b> concentrations.|$|E
50|$|Agitation and {{aggression}} are {{also associated with}} hyperdopaminergic activity. Antipsychotic drugs {{are the most common}} treatment for these symptoms, but often come with a host of side-effects including orthostatic hypotension and deficits in vigilance and attention. One clinical study in agitated elderly patients compared the effects of <b>tiapride,</b> haloperidol and placebo and found that while the two drugs had comparable efficacy superior to the placebo effect, <b>tiapride</b> had fewer and less severe side effects than haloperidol.|$|E
50|$|Dosages above {{approximately}} 300 mg/day risk inducing tardive dyskinesia. However, {{given the}} drug's fairly wide window of tolerable doses, dosages {{can often be}} titrated to obtain the desired effect without bringing about motor deficits. In general, <b>tiapride</b> is considered an atypical antipsychotic because of its low risk for extrapyramidal symptoms, such as akinesia and akathesia. These effects {{are thought to be}} reduced in <b>tiapride</b> relative to typical antipsychotics because of its selectivity for the limbic system over extrapyramidal areas that control movement.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tiapride</b> is {{primarily}} taken orally {{in the form}} of a tablet, but can also be administered via intravenous or intramuscular injection. A liquid oral formulation is also available for elderly patients with difficulty chewing solids. For all three methods of administration, the bioavailability of <b>tiapride</b> is approximately 75 percent. Peak plasma concentrations are attained between 0.4 and 1.5 hours following administration, and steady-state concentrations achieved 24 to 48 hours after beginning administration 3 times a day. It distributes rapidly and exhibits virtually no binding to plasma proteins, giving it a relatively high volume of distribution. Benzamide and its derivatives are highly water-soluble, and because of their polarity are believed to cross the blood-brain barrier via carrier-mediated transport. Elimination of <b>tiapride,</b> mostly in its original form, occurs through renal excretion with a half-life of 3 to 4 hours.|$|E
5000|$|Sulpiride is a {{substituted}} benzamide derivative and {{a selective}} dopamine D2 antagonist with antipsychotic and antidepressant activity. Other benzamide derivatives include metoclopramide, <b>tiapride,</b> and sultopride.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tiapride</b> is a {{dopamine}} D2 and D3 receptor antagonist. It is {{more selective}} than other neuroleptic {{drugs such as}} haloperidol and risperidone, which not only target {{four of the five}} known dopamine receptor subtypes (D1-4), but also block serotonin (5-HT2A, 2C), α1- and α2-adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors. Compared to these drugs, <b>tiapride</b> has a relatively moderate affinity for its target receptors, displacing 50 percent of 3H-raclopride binding at a concentration of 320 nM at D2 receptors and a concentration of 180 nM at D3 receptors.|$|E
50|$|While <b>tiapride</b> {{preferentially}} targets the {{limbic system}} over the striatum, its moderate antagonistic effect on striatal dopamine receptors makes it effective in treating motor deficits that involve this area, such as tardive dyskinesia and chorea. Tiapride's moderate efficacy at D2 receptors {{may explain why}} {{it is able to}} treat motor symptoms without the extrapyramidal symptoms caused by excess dopamine blockage, which are sometimes seen in haloperidol or chlorpromazine. One clinical study of patients with tardive dyskinesia associated with Parkinson's disease found that <b>tiapride</b> significantly improved motor abilities without affecting other parkinsonian symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Research {{in animal}} models and {{clinical}} studies in alcoholic patients {{have found that}} <b>tiapride</b> has anxiolytic effects. Dopamine hyperactivity has been linked with alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), suggesting that tiapride's antidopaminergic effects {{are the most likely}} mechanism for its clinical efficacy, although others believe some other mechanism might be involved. Alcoholic patients treated with <b>tiapride</b> at a dosage of 300 mg/day reported reduced psychological distress and improved abstinence from alcohol. In another study in which alcoholic patients were given titrated doses up to 800 mg/day, subjects showed significant improvements in ratings of withdrawal, craving, psychiatric symptoms and quality of life.|$|E
50|$|Recommended dosages of <b>tiapride</b> {{vary with}} {{clinical}} symptoms. In alcoholic patients, delirium or pre-delirium associated with alcohol withdrawal can be alleviated by administration of 400-1200 mg/day {{or up to}} 1800 mg/day if necessary. Tremors and other dyskinsias can be treated with 300-800 mg/day. For reducing agitation and aggression in elderly patients, 200-300 mg/day is recommended.|$|E
50|$|While <b>tiapride</b> {{does not}} affect {{positive}} symptoms of psychosis such as hallucinosis or delirium sometimes manifested in alcohol withdrawal syndrome, if combined with a drug such as carbamazepine that addresses those symptoms, it is ideal for treating alcohol dependency because its metabolism {{does not depend on}} liver function and it has low potential for abuse. This sets it apart from the benzodiazepines, which are contraindicated with alcohol and can be addictive. Moreover, tiapride's rapid onset makes intravenous or intramuscular injection prior to or during withdrawal episodes particularly effective.|$|E
50|$|Atypical {{antipsychotics}} are {{the second}} generation, {{and serve as}} an alternative method of treating tics. These medications have more selective dopamine blocking effects, or block serotonin with some blocking of dopamine. The medications in this class used to treat tics include risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, quetiapine, clozapine, aripiprazole, <b>tiapride,</b> and sulpiride. Atypical antipsychotics appear to have lower risks of neurological side effects such as tardive dyskinesia when used short-term, but longer trials are needed to confirm this. Some of the side effects associated with these medications are insomnia, weight gain, and school phobia. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and increased risk of diabetes are concerns with these medications. There is empirical support {{for the use of}} risperidone, and less support for the others.|$|E
40|$|Possible {{addiction}} to <b>tiapride</b> was sought in a 10 kg Beagle dog and an ordinary 12 kg dog using the substitution method suggested by J. J. Deglarez. <b>Tiapride</b> at {{a dose of}} 30 mg/kg {{was not able to}} interrupt the state of hyperexcitability triggered off by sudden morphine withdrawal. One may consider that <b>tiapride</b> is completely lacking in addictive properties. SCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{construction}} and electrochemical response {{characteristics of a}} poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) membrane selective electrode for the determination of <b>tiapride</b> (TPD) are described. The sensing membrane comprised an ion-pair formed between the protonated drug and tetraphenylborate (TPB-) in a plasticized PVC matrix. The influence of membrane composition on the electrode response was studied. The electrode showed a fast, stable and Nernstian response over a wide <b>tiapride</b> concentration range (1 x 10 - 5 - 1 x 10 - 2 M) with a slope of 57. 5 ± 0. 2 mV dec- 1 of concentration, a detection limit of 4. 3 x 10 - 6 ± 2. 5 x 10 - 7 M, a wide working pH range (2 - 8) and a fast response time (< 5 s).

40|$|A double-blind, placebo-controlled, {{crossover}} {{trial was}} carried out in 29 patients with Huntington's chorea to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerance of high doses of <b>tiapride</b> in the management of neurological symptoms. Patients were allocated at random into 3 groups to receive 3 g <b>tiapride</b> daily for two periods of 3 weeks either preceded, interrupted or followed by a 3 -week period on placebo. Patients were assessed on entry {{and at the end of}} each treatment period using a battery of tests designed to measure choreatic movements, motor skills, recognition and reaction times, and mental state. Twenty-three patients completed the trial; only 2 of the 6 drop-outs withdrew because of drug-related side-effects (sedation and extrapyramidal signs). The results showed that <b>tiapride</b> treatment significantly improved choreatic movements and motor skills and these findings were supported by the objective psychometric measurements. Overall evaluation of effectiveness by the physician and patients indicated the significant superiority of <b>tiapride</b> over placebo. Treatment was generally well tolerated and although there were significantly more reports of sedation and extrapyramidal signs whilst patients were receiving <b>tiapride,</b> these effects were rated as mild in most cases and did not interfere with treatment. © 1984 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

40|$|The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) {{channel is}} {{important}} for repolarization in human myocardium and is a common target for drugs that prolong the QT interval. We studied the effects of two antipsychotics, <b>tiapride</b> and sulpiride, on hERG channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes and also on delayed rectifier K+ currents in guinea pig cardiomyocytes. Neither the amplitude of the hERG outward currents measured {{at the end of}} the voltage pulse, nor the amplitude of hERG tail currents, showed any concentration-dependent changes with either <b>tiapride</b> or sulpiride (3 ~ 300 µM). However, our findings did show that <b>tiapride</b> increased the potential for half-maximal activation (V 1 / 2) of HERG at 10 ~ 300 µM, whereas sulpiride increased the maximum conductance (Gmax) at 3, 10 and 100 µM. In guinea pig ventricular myocytes, bath applications of 100 and 500 µM <b>tiapride</b> at 36 ℃ blocked rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr) by 40. 3 % and 70. 0 %, respectively.

However, neither <b>tiapride</b> nor sulpiride significantly affected the slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (IKs) at the same concentrations.

40|$|The parabrachial complex {{has been}} related to the {{processing}} of both rewarding and aversive signals. This pontine area is activated after the gastrointestinal administration of rewarding nutrients, in taste aversion learning, {{and in response to}} the reinforcing and aversive effects of some drugs of abuse. Electrical stimulation of this region can induce, in different animals, preference or aversion behaviors towards a place in a rectangular three‑chamber maze task. This study examined the effect of <b>tiapride,</b> a D 2 /D 3 receptor antagonist, on the aversive or rewarding effects induced by electrical stimulation of the external lateral parabrachial subnucleus (NLPBe). As previously observed, administration of <b>tiapride</b> interrupted the aversive effect induced by NLPBe electrical stimulation. However, in contrast to the effects of dopamine antagonists on other rewarding systems, <b>tiapride</b> did not impair the place preference induced by NLPBe stimulation, an activation effect that is subject to tolerance. <b>Tiapride</b> administration also appeared to have no effect on the horizontal motor activity (crossings) of the electrically stimulated animals.

40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this trial}} was to compare {{lorazepam}} with non-benzodiazepine medications such as pregabalin and <b>tiapride</b> {{in the treatment of}} alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). These drugs were chosen for their inhibitorial effects on the hypersecretion of neurotransmitters usually observed in AWS. Craving reduction and improvement of psychiatric symptoms were the secondary end-points. Methods One hundred and ninety subjects affected by current alcohol dependence were considered consecutively: 111 were enrolled and divided into three groups of 37 subjects each. Within a treatment duration of 14 days, medication was given up to the following maximum doses (pregabalin 450 mg/day; <b>tiapride</b> 800 mg/day; lorazepam 10 mg/day). Withdrawal (CIWA-Ar), craving [visual analogue scale (VAS); Obsessive and Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) ], psychiatric symptoms [Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL- 90 -R) ] and quality of life (QL-index) rating scales were applied. Results On the CIWA-Ar score, all the groups showed a signiﬁcant reduction between times (P < 0. 001) with a higher reduction for the pregabalin group (P < 0. 01) on items regarding headache and orientation. Retention in treatment was lower in the <b>tiapride</b> group (P < 0. 05), while the number of subjects remaining alcohol free was higher in the pregabalin group (P < 0. 05). Signiﬁcant reduction between baseline {{and the end of the}} treatment was found in all the groups at the OCDS and the VAS for craving, at the SCL- 90 -R and QL-index (P < 0. 001). Discussion All the medications in the trial showed evidence of safety and efﬁcacy in the treatment of uncomplicated forms of AWS, with some particular differences. The efﬁcacy of pregabalin was superior to that of <b>tiapride,</b> used largely in research trials and, for some measures, to that of the ‘gold standard’, lorazepam. Accordingly, pregabalin may be considered as a potentially useful new drug for treatment of AWS, deserving further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Treballs Finals de Grau d'Enginyeria Química, Facultat de Química, Universitat de Barcelona, Curs: 2015 - 2016, Tutors: Jaume Giménez i Daniel HaranakaOver {{the last}} few years the {{increasing}} appearance in wastewater of a variety of organic compounds known as emerging pollutants has been revealed. They are organic compounds with high molecular weight and highly persistent and toxic such as pharmaceutical compounds, personal care products, industrial surfactants or additives. Urban and industrial wastewaters, which contain emerging pollutants in concentrations of μg/L or ng/L, are treated in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, these processes typically include biological treatments not able to completely degrade molecules of these pollutants due to their highly complex structure and stability. In recent decades there have been major advances in techniques able to remove such contaminants or increase the biodegradability of samples containing them to subsequently apply biological treatments. Among these techniques are the Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), which are based on the formation of oxidizing species, such as hydroxyl radicals, capable of oxidizing pollutant molecules. In this work it has been studied the degradation of the pharmaceutical compound <b>Tiapride,</b> an antipsychotic used to treat mental illnesses. The techniques studied has been Photolysis, UV/H 2 O 2, UV/Fe 2 +, Fenton, Photo-Fenton and Heterogeneous Photocatalysis in a reactor with BLB lamps. Degradation and mineralization of the compound, BOD 5, COD, SUVA, toxicity and biodegradability of the solutions of <b>Tiapride</b> have been monitored during the different processes. Among the Advanced Oxidation Processes studied, Photo-Fenton has been the one that achieved best results.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{studies have}} shown a strong link between Toxoplasma gondii {{infection}} and psychiatric disorders, especially schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (odd ratio ≈ 2. 7 for each disorder). Antipsychotic drugs and mood stabilizers may have anti-toxoplasmic activity that potentially {{may be associated with}} better effectiveness in these disorders, but previous results have been few in number and conflicting. We therefore sought to determine which daily prescribed antipsychotics and mood stabilizer have the best anti-toxoplasmic activity during the development phase of the parasite. In the present study, we examined the effects of commonly used antipsychotic drugs (amisulpride, cyamemazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, levomepromazine, loxapine, olanzapine, risperidone and <b>tiapride)</b> and one mood-stabilizing agent (valproate) on toxoplasmic activity. We replicated that fluphenazine has a high anti-toxoplasmic activity, but {{it does not seem to}} be a phenothiazine-specific class effect: indeed, we found that another first-generation antipsychotic, zuclopenthixol, has a high anti-toxoplasmic activity. Valproate, <b>tiapride</b> and amisulpride have no anti-toxoplasmic activity on parasite growth, and the other antipsychotic drugs showed low or intermediate anti-toxoplasmic activity. As it is not possible to know the intracellular concentrations of antipsychotics in the brain, further clinical studies are warranted to determine whether these in vitro findings have potential implications in treatment of toxo-positive patients with schizophrenia. These findings may be potentially relevant for the choice of the first-line antipsychotic drug or mood stabilizer in previously infected patients...|$|E

40|$|The dopaminergic {{system is}} {{involved}} in learning and participates in the modulation of cortical excitability (CE). CE has been suggested as a marker of learning and use-dependent plasticity. However, results from separate studies on either motor CE or motor learning challenge this notion, suggesting opposing effects of dopaminergic modulation upon these parameters: while agonists decrease and antagonists increase CE, motor learning is enhanced by agonists and disturbed by antagonists. To examine whether this discrepancy persists when complex motor learning and motor CE are measured in the same experimental setup, we investigated the effects of dopaminergic (DA) antagonism upon both parameters and upon task-associated brain activation. Our results demonstrate that DA-antagonism has opposing effects upon motor CE and motor sequence learning. <b>Tiapride</b> did not alter baseline CE, but increased CE post training of a complex motor sequence while simultaneously impairing motor learning. Moreover, <b>tiapride</b> reduced activation in several brain regions associated with motor sequence performance, i. e. dorsolateral PFC, supplementary motor area, Broca's area, cingulate and caudate body. Blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) intensity in anterior cingulate and caudate body, but not CE, correlated with performance across groups. In summary, our results do not support a concept of CE as a general marker of motor learning, since they demonstrate that a straightforward relation of increased CE and higher learning success {{does not apply to}} all instances of motor learning. At least for complex motor tasks that recruit a network of brain regions outside motor cortex, CE in primary motor cortex is probably no central determinant for learning success...|$|E
