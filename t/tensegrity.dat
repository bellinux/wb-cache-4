25|$|The first {{permanent}} air supported membrane domes {{were the}} radar domes {{designed and built}} by Walter Bird after World War II. Their low cost {{eventually led to the}} development of permanent versions using teflon-coated fiberglass and by 1985 the majority of the domed stadiums around the world used this system. <b>Tensegrity</b> domes, patented by Buckminster Fuller in 1962, are membrane structures consisting of radial trusses made from steel cables under tension with vertical steel pipes spreading the cables into the truss form. They have been made circular, elliptical, and other shapes to cover stadiums from Korea to Florida. Tension membrane design has depended upon computers, and the increasing availability of powerful computers resulted in many developments being made in the last three decades of the 20th century. The higher expense of rigid large span domes made them relatively rare, although rigidly moving panels is the most popular system for sports stadiums with retractable roofing.|$|E

40|$|We use {{the ideas}} of stress theory and <b>tensegrities</b> to answer some {{questions}} in discrete geometry. In particular, we classify 3 -realizable graphs and we show some results related to the Kneser-Poulsen conjecture in hyperbolic space. A graph is d-realizable if, for every configuration of its vertices in EN, there exists another corresponding configuration in E d with the same edge lengths. A graph is 2 -realizable {{if and only if}} it does not have K 4 as a minor. We show that a graph is 3 -realizable if and only if it does not have K 5 or K 2, 2, 2 as a minor. Kneser and Poulsen independently conjectured that the volume of the union of balls in Euclidean space will not decrease under an expansion. Csikós proved that this is true in Euclidean space under a continuous expansion, and Connelly and Bezdek proved it for the Euclidean plane (not necessarily a continuous expansion). It is still an open question for higher dimensions. The conjecture can also be stated for balls in hyperbolic space. Csikós proved that it is true under a continuous expansion in hyperbolic space, but it is still an open question for a non-continuous expansion in hyperbolic space. We show that the conjecture holds for 4 balls in 3 -dimensional hyperbolic space...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{structural}} entities is formulated as a nonlinear program. In the nonlinear program {{the objective is}} the compliance (or stiffness under load) of a structure. Constraints are due to equi-librium conditions, signature of forces, failure conditions like yield and buckling, minimum length requirements and available material. Nonlinear constraints make this {{problem difficult to solve}} for realistic design problems using standard tools (Sequential Quadratic Programming: SQP) for non-linear programming. Using techniques like scaling of design variables and constraints to bring the singular values of the constraint Jacobian in a narrower range and closer to 1, introducing additional design variables to make the constraints more linear, and employing sparsity of the Jacobian of the constraints, the problem can be solved without intervention for planar (small) problems, but not readily for spatial (large) problems. Some results in the design of a special class of structures, namely <b>tensegrities,</b> illustrate the problems. This bad scalability and lack of robustness are disadvantages of using standard tools, like SQP, to solve large nonlinear programs, which {{we would like to see}} redressed in the current tools, or alleviated in future ones. Using constraint satisfaction programs, it may be possible to more closely follow the curved manifolds of the constraints. A multi-phase procedure, including a global optimization phase, may be a feasible approach for large scale problems, because it may avoid badly conditioned area’s in the design space...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{can be divided into}} two parts. The first one is to propose an extension of the force density method (FDM) (H. J. Schek, 1974), a form-finding method for prestressed cable-net structures. The second one is to present a review of various form-finding methods for tension structures, in the relation with the extended FDM. In the first part, it is pointed out that the original FDM become useless when it is applied to the prestressed structures that consist of combinations of both tension and compression members, while the FDM is usually advantageous in form-finding analysis of cable-nets. To eliminate the limitation, a functional whose stationary problem simply represents the FDM is firstly proposed. Additionally, the existence of a variational principle in the FDM is also indicated. Then, the FDM is extensively redefined by generalizing the formulation of the functional. As the result, the generalized functionals enable us to find the forms of tension structures that consist of combinations of both tension and compression members, such as <b>tensegrities</b> and suspended membranes with compression struts. In the second part, it is indicated the important role of three expressions used by the description of the extended FDM, such as stationary problems of functionals, the principle of virtual work and stationary conditions using Nabla symbol. They can be commonly found in general problems of statics, whereas the original FDM only provides a particular form of equilibrium equation. Then, to demonstrate the advantage of such expressions, various form-finding methods are reviewed and compared. As the result, the common features and the differences over various form-finding methods are examined. Finally, to give an overview of the reviewed methods, the corresponding expressions are shown in the form of three tables. Comment: Revised version of already published paper for J.
