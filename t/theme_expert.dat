Objective: The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand facilitators and barriers to engaging in healthy lifestyles faced by low-income African American children and their families. Methods: This qualitative study used semi-structured focus group interviews with eight African American children clinically identified as overweight or obese (BMI > 85) and their parents. An expert panel provided insights in developing culturally appropriate intervention strategies. Results: Child and parent focus group analysis revealed eleven barriers and no definitive facilitators for healthy eating and lifestyles. Parents reported confusion regarding what constitutes nutritional eating, varying needs of family members in terms of issues with weight, and difficulty in engaging the family in appropriate and safe physical activities; {{to name a few}} <b>themes.</b> Community <b>experts</b> independently suggested that nutritional information is confusing and, often, contradictory. Additionally, they recommended simple messaging and practical interventions such as helping with shopping lists, meal planning, and identifying simple and inexpensive physical activities.

40|$|Donkeys {{have been}} useful helpers to people {{especially}} at transporting burdens and in agriculture {{for thousands of}} years. Nowadays they make livelihoods of rural as well as urban inhabitants over all continents easier. The use of donkeys in agriculture and transport is vanishing in developing countries due to the mechanization. We know only little about how and why people keep breeding of donkeys in developing countries. Theoretical part of the thesis tries to summarize previous basic knowledge about breeding and using donkeys. It focuses on domestication of donkeys, their use in history {{in different parts of}} the world, current position of donkeys and partly on relations between men and animals from the view of Human-Animal Studies. A research in a part of Polabí lowland is added. The main practical aim of the thesis is to take a look at the phenomenon of breeding donkeys in the Czech Republic in the present and bring any findings about why do people breed donkeys in modern times in this developing country.

To this aim, the existing prior ELT (English Language Teaching) research on exemplary teachers’ practices were reviewed and the typical class management strategies used were extracted. Moreover, 20 ELT specialists including teacher educators, university professors of applied linguistics, mentor teachers and language institute supervisors were selected through purposive snowball and convenience sampling methods, and were interviewed. Since they were directly dealing with teachers as trainers, supervisors, and mentors, they were considered as qualified informants. There were finally 4 themes and 3 sub-themes extracted from the qualitative content analysis of the interviews, which were {{presented in this paper}} along with sample extracts of the actual interview content. The <b>themes</b> included: <b>expert</b> teachers’ identification power, use of external control, use of preventive management strategies and monitoring student behavior. The 3 sub-themes of the second theme were: clarification of expectations, use of body language and establishing rules and routines.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. October 2015. Major: Educational Psychology. Advisors: Joan Garfield, Robert delMas. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 195 pages. This study chronicles {{the creation of}} an assessment tool that quantifies cognitive transfer outcomes for introductory statistics students. Literature suggested that outcomes associated with cognitive transfer are closely aligned with statistical thinking and are indicative of students’ ability to apply learning to novel scenarios beyond the classroom. No assessment tool had been developed and published for the purpose of measuring cognitive transfer outcomes among statistics students. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the Introductory Statistics Understanding and Discernment Outcomes (I-STUDIO) assessment tool may effectively serve this purpose. The assessment tool was developed according to a rigorous protocol of expert feedback and iterative piloting. Data were collected and analyzed from a nationwide sample of nearly 2, 000 students attending a wide variety of post-secondary institutions, and the I-STUDIO instrument was found to measure both forward-reaching and backward-reaching high road transfer outcomes with good psychometric properties. Data analysis indicated high reliability and diverse validity evidence. This evidence included confirmatory factor analysis models with compelling alignment to the theoretical model and analysis of qualitative <b>themes</b> among <b>expert</b> feedback. Analysis of scoring consistency also showed strong inter-rater agreement. Although the sample size of the scored responses is somewhat small by convention for item response theory, a graded response model generally showed good item functioning. Furthermore, the data suggested that the I-STUDIO assessment estimated student ability with consistent precision across a wide range of above-average and below-average students. Teachers and researchers can use I-STUDIO for comparing outcomes of alternative curricula. Additionally, the I-STUDIO instrument can be used to measure the effect of curriculum changes designed to improve transfer outcomes. Furthermore, the instrument and scoring rubric were designed to accommodate diverse curricula for the purpose of refining course outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{widespread}} roll-out {{of voluntary}} medical male circumcision (VMMC) {{has been accompanied}} by reports of VMMC recipients, particularly men who are married or cohabiting, resuming sexual intercourse before the recommended healing period of six weeks. This behaviour carries an increased risk of transmission of STIs and HIV, particularly for the female partner. At the same time, it is unrealistic to assume that an already over-burdened health system will be able to provide repeated, intense messaging that recent recipients of VMMC may need to help them navigate the post-operative period sexually. There is an urgent need to develop culturally appropriate messages and innovative delivery strategies for behaviour modification in the post-operative period and the longer term for medically circumcised men. Methods: As a step to better understand the behaviour of the VMMC patients during the six-week recovery period, we conducted eight single-gender focus groups with males who had undergone VMMC in the previous six months and their partners. (Study 1) Armed with this information, we strove to create a contextually-relevant message regime by using a staggered qualitative methodology: (1) focus group discussions with 52 recently circumcised men and their partners to develop initial voice messages (2) thematic analysis and expert consultation to select the final messages for pilot testing, and (3) cognitive interviews with 12 recent VMMC patients to judge message comprehension and rank the messages. The message content and phasing were guided by the theory of planned behaviour, the health action process approach and the action research approach. (Study 2) For the next two years, this intervention was evaluated using a two-armed, randomized, single-blind, controlled design. This sample was collected at 12 clinics in urban areas in Western Cape Province, South Africa. Patients were followed up at 42 days after enrolment. (Study 3) As a final measure, the usability of the platform was evaluated. At follow-up, 597 participants completed questionnaires regarding the usability and user experience of the mobile audio platform. Usability was measured with the System Usability Scale (SUS). Five focus groups with a total of 25 patients were also conducted. The scale’s multidimensionality was shown with the emergence of three trends that explained more than 65 % of the total variance of the scale. (Study 4) Results: The primary motivation to VMMC uptake included religious injunction and hygiene reasons and protection against sexually transmitted infections not necessarily HIV. Both men and women felt that sex was important to maintain the relationship. (Study 1) We received 245 messages with 42 <b>themes.</b> <b>Expert</b> review and cognitive interviews with more patients resulted in 42 messages with a clear division in terms of needs and expectations between the initial wound-healing recovery phase (weeks 1 – 3) and the adjustment phase (weeks 4 – 6). Participants were more positive and salutogenic than public health experts were. (Study 2) The randomised controlled trial found a slightly larger positive effect in the Intervention Group (28. 0 %) than in the Control Group (32. 3 %)) bot not significant (p= 0. 071). (Study 3) Participants gave the platform an overall usability score of 62. 80 (SD 13. 41). Most of them were positive about the messages. (Study 4) Conclusions: VMMC counselling needs {{to take into account the}} real-life factors of the circumcised men. Due to systematic, social and cultural factors, there is a real risk that men in this population may initiate sex before complete healing has occurred. (Study 1) Consultation with potential mHealth recipients and using classic behavioural theories are vital to the success of a programme. (Study 2) Early resumption of sex after VMMC is common, warranting better counselling. M-Health technology is a potential tool but it should be complemented by other methods. (Study 3) The results suggest that the audio messaging system has good usability, user experience and user acceptance...|$|R

40|$|Historic {{preservation}} is {{a significant}} issue for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) seeking to safeguard important historic places, preserve unique cultural practices, and receive official recognition of civic contributions. However, few sites associated with AAPI history and cultures have been recognized as landmarks. There has been substantial movement forward by federal agencies and national organizations in developing a more inclusive and diverse approach to traditional standards and policies in order to reflect the growing numbers of underrepresented sociocultural groups, including AAPIs. 	To addresses these issues, federal leadership in the Department of the Interior and National Park Service launched the Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Initiative and Theme Study. The theme study, “Finding a Path Forward: Asian American/Pacific Islander National Historic Landmarks Theme Study,” is intended {{to help in the}} identification of buildings, structures, sites, objects, and districts associated with Asian and Pacific Islander history in the United States, and facilitate their designation as NHLs and their listing in the National Register of Historic Places. As part of the theme study, the Asian American/Pacific Islander <b>Theme</b> Study <b>Experts</b> Panel was established {{under the auspices of the}} National Park Service Advisory Board. The Experts Panel was created to provide advice on the structure of AAPI Theme Study, and identify potential essay authors and major sources of information. 	This dissertation explores the challenges and opportunities that arise when engaging citizen participation from diverse and traditionally underrepresented groups in federal historic preservation programs. The goal is to understand the political climate that lead to the initiative, the types of citizen participation that lead to the development of federal historic preservation efforts, and ultimately, support better efforts in documenting and recognizing historical and cultural contributions of AAPIs in the US through the NHL and National Register programs. The rationale is if scholars and practitioners can better understand how to document, identify, and preserve historic sites, we can significantly impact historic preservation outcomes by increasing the number of national/federal designations associated with underrepresented groups and improving historic preservation approaches to be more inclusive of and relevant to these groups...|$|R

40|$|The Mixture of Experts (ME) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{ensemble}} methods used in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. This algorithm stochastically partitions the input space of a problem into a number of subspaces, experts becoming specialized on each subspace. To manage this process, <b>theME</b> uses an <b>expert</b> called gating network, which is trained together with the other experts. In this chapter, we propose a modified version of the ME algorithm which first partitions the original problem into centralized regions and then uses a simple distance-based gating function to specialize the expert networks. Each expert contributes to classify an input sample according to the distance between the input and a prototype embedded by the expert. The Hierarchical Mixture of Experts (HME) is a tree-structured architecture which can be considered a natural extension of the ME model. The training and testing strategies of the standard HME model are also modified, based on the same insight applied to standard ME. In both cases, the proposed approach does not require to train the gating networks, as they are implemented with simple distance-based rules. In so doing the overall time required for training a modifiedME/ HME system is considerably lower. Moreover, centralizing input subspaces and adopting a random strategy for selecting prototypes permits to increase at the same time individual accuracy and diversity of ME/HME modules, which in turn increases the accuracy of the overall ensemble. Experimental results on a binary toy problem and on selected datasets from the UCI machine learning repository show the robustness of the proposed methods compared to the standard ME/HM...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Floods are {{the most}} common hazard to cause {{disasters}} and have led to extensive morbidity and mortality throughout the world. The impact of floods on the human community is related directly to the location and topography of the area, as well as human demographics and characteristics of the built environment. Objectives: The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the health impacts of disasters and the underlying causes of health impacts associated with floods. A conceptual framework is developed that may assist with the development of a rational and comprehensive approach to prevention, mitigation, and management. Methods: This study involved an extensive literature review that located > 500 references, which were analyzed to identify common <b>themes,</b> findings, and <b>expert</b> views. The findings then were distilled into common themes. Results: The health impacts of floods are wide ranging, and depend on a number of factors. However, the health impacts of a particular flood are specific to the particular context. The immediate health impacts of floods include drowning, injuries, hypothermia, and animal bites. Health risks also are associated with the evacuation of patients, loss of health workers, and loss of health infrastructure including essential drugs and supplies. In the mediumterm, infected wounds, complications of injury, poisoning, poor mental health, communicable diseases, and starvation are indirect effects of flooding. In the long-term, chronic disease, disability, poor mental health, and poverty-related diseases including malnutrition are the potential legacy. Conclusions: This article proposes a structured approach to the classification of the health impacts of floods and a conceptual framework that demonstrates the relationships between floods and the direct and indirect health consequences...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{cooperation}} between researchers from three areas of vocational {{education and training}} (VET) and lifelong learning research. It aims to identify several new and emerging issues that will be crucially relevant to VET research in the post-Lisbon decade. The paper begins by exploring the main drivers currently influencing European VET systems and draws up four scenarios for 2010 - 20, each {{of which may be}} a plausible outcome for future European governance, and by extension, VET governance. The contributors then explore the nature of uncertainty in the demand and supply sides of European and local labour markets, suggesting that research into the impact of these uncertainties will need to examine how individuals adapt to new situations, as well as the impact on the nature and structure of VET supply. The paper also attempts a forward looking analysis of innovative teaching and learning in VET – developing twin <b>themes</b> of supporting <b>expert</b> learners and a scholarship of teaching and learning in VET. There will clearly remain important and urgent items of unfinished business in European and national VET policy and implementation in 2010. This paper argues strongly that these are still important for Europe’s future economic, social and environmental ambitions, that the achievement of currently agreed priorities will remain a vital political issue, and that research should have an important role in overcoming identified barriers and achieving success in these respects. The paper identifies several issues that remain underresearched. These include meeting the learning needs of older workers and diverse migrant communities. Finally, the paper identifies five new issues that VET research should concentrate on. Since so much policy and research attention at European level focused on the period from 2000 to 2010, this paper intends to make a contribution to opening the debate on European VET research priorities in the decade that will follow...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Physical {{activity}} {{is important for}} the health of all human beings. Although it is important to develop good health promotion programs for children to increase participation in physical activity, to date there appear to be no programs based on what kids value beyond health and physical activity itself. This study proposed to create a scale with strong content and face validity that could uncover what any given population of children value in life regardless of their participation in physical activity and that experts feel could be related to physical activity. These findings will allow the development of targeted health promotion programs to increase children's participation in regular physical activity. Method In this study, a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches was used. Data were gathered from seven experts in the field, sixty-seven children in grades three to five, five parents, and three teachers. From these data response groupings were created and sent to four experts to be given single word names. The resulting nine theme names were re-worked into "child-friendly" language. Four children were then asked to discuss theme names to see if they liked and understood them. The next step involved asking children and experts to rank order the nine themes, the children in general and the experts in terms of relevance to physical activity. From these results, possible versions of the scale were then created using the combined expert/children rankings. Each version was examined for content validity. Two versions of a scale resulted. These were sent to experts, parents, teachers and children in order to determine which one they liked better and to suggest any foreseeable problems. Once this information was collected, a beta (final prototype) version of the scale was created. Results. Nine common theme names were created from the response groupings. All four children agreed that they did understand and like each of the nine <b>theme</b> names. <b>Experts</b> and teachers agreed that full coverage of the content had been achieved. Children suggested a single wording change from "Being Accepted" to "Being Included". Five themes were selected for inclusion. The beta version of the scale included 12 forced choice statements, the first ten comparing all themes against one another followed by two anchor statements. Conclusion. At the outset it was recognized that it is essential to know what children think is important in their lives in order to serve as potential benefits in the development of effective physical activity promotion programs. This study developed a scale which could be used to determine what a population of children feel is important in order to focus health promotion programs for physical activity. The scale has strong face and content validity...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2018 Bioenergy is {{a rapidly}} growing subsector of the {{emerging}} global bioeconomy, {{with the potential to}} create a substantial number of jobs and mitigate climate change. In order to develop bioenergy into a viable industry, capable of providing valuable energy and employment, there is an immediate need for a skilled workforce prepared for the impending challenges of this interdisciplinary field. However, programs providing training for these positions are limited, and there is currently a lack of research-based guidance for the creation of new educational programs. To meet this need, it is necessary to identify and prioritize the topics that should be included in a college-level bioenergy curriculum and determine best practices for bioenergy education. In order to gain insight into expert and academia priorities and how they can be applied in an academic program, two Delphi studies, combined with a case study of an existing minor degree program at Oregon State University, were implemented. During the first Delphi study, an iterative, mixed-methods approach used to reach group consensus, 12 bioenergy experts in both educational and employment sectors provided open-ended responses to the following question: Keeping in mind the future of a commercial bioenergy industry, what content knowledge should a student have upon completion of a college-level bioenergy curriculum? Responses were qualitatively coded into <b>themes,</b> and <b>experts</b> were asked to rate the importance of each theme using a five-point Likert-type scale during two subsequent rounds. The final round resulted in the following 13 themes, listed in order of importance: Energy Basics, Types of Bioenergy, Environmental Impacts (including Life Cycle Analysis), Current Technologies, Societal Issues, Logistics, Policy, Biomass Composition, Non-Bioenergy-Specific Fundamentals, Biomass Production, Conversions, Bioenergy Market, and Business-Related Knowledge. The second, two-round, modified Delphi study asked 47 experts to use the same scale to rate these 13 themes, and they were welcome to suggest additional items, resulting in the addition of Bioproducts. Academia and industry responses were then compared, which revealed that their priorities were well aligned. Alumni interviews and current student surveys were conducted to evaluate the bioenergy minor at OSU. Analysis of these responses provided input from the students’ perspective. Findings indicated that students value the required research experience and the interdisciplinary nature of the minor degree, among other qualities of the program. Bioenergy is an interdisciplinary, complex, and evolving field. The Delphi studies distilled numerous technologies and associated topics into a college-level curriculum framework, while the case study examined an existing minor degree program and illustrated how the program has transformed based on student feedback. Results are intended to bolster emerging bioenergy training programs {{to meet the needs of}} future employers. The combination of methods provided a curriculum framework and example of an existing program, both of which may be adapted for region-specific technologies to support a forthcoming bio-based economy...|$|R
40|$|Background: Demographical {{changes have}} stimulated a {{coordination}} {{reform in the}} Norwegian health care sector, creating new working practices and extending coordination within and between primary and hospital care, increasing the need for inter-municipal cooperation (IMC). This study aimed to identify challenges to coordination and IMC in the Norwegian health care sector {{as a basis for}} further theorizing and managerial advice in this growing area of research and practice. Methods. A Delphi study of consensus development was used. Experts in coordination and IMC in health care services were selected by the healthcare manager or the councillor in their respective municipalities. In the first round, an expert panel received open-ended questions addressing possible challenges, and their answers were categorized and consolidated as the basis for further validation in the second round. The expert panel members were then asked to point out important statements in the third round, before the most important statements ranked by a majority of the members were rated again in the fourth round, including the option to explain the ratings. The same procedure was used in round five, with the exception that the expert panel members could view the consolidated results of their previous rankings as the basis for a new and final rating. The statements reaching consensus in round five were abstracted and <b>themed.</b> Results: Nineteen <b>experts</b> consented to participate. Nine experts (47 %) completed all of the five rounds. Eight statements concerning coordination reached consensus, resulting in four themes covering these challenges: different culture, uneven balance of power, lack of the possibility to communicate electronically, and demanding tasks in relation to resources. Three statements regarding challenges to IMC reached consensus, resulting in following themes: coopetition, complex leadership, and resistance to change. Conclusions: This study identified several important challenges for coordination and it supports previous research. IMC in health care services deals with challenges other than coordination, and these must be addressed specifically. Our study contributes to extended knowledge of theoretical and practical implications in the field of coordination and IMC in health care sector...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The Internet has {{provided}} an unprecedented opportunity for psychotropic medication consumers, a traditionally silenced group in clinical trial research, to have voice by {{contributing to the}} construction of drug knowledge in an immediate, direct manner. Currently, there are no systematic appraisals of the potential of online consumer drug reviews to contribute to drug knowledge. The purpose of this research was to explore the content of drug information on various websites representing themselves as consumer- and expert-constructed, and as a practical consideration, to examine how each source may help and hinder treatment decision-making. ^ Methodology. A mixed-methods research strategy utilizing a grounded theory approach was used to analyze drug information on 5 exemplar websites (3 consumer- and 2 expertconstructed) for 2 popularly prescribed psychotropic drugs (escitalopram and quetiapine). A stratified simple random sample was used to select 1, 080 consumer reviews from the websites (N= 7, 114) through February 2009. Text was coded using QDA Miner 3. 2 software by Provalis Research. A combination of frequency tables, descriptive excerpts from text, and chi-square tests for association were used throughout analyses. ^ Findings. The most frequently mentioned effects by consumers taking either drug were related to psychological/behavioral symptoms and sleep. Consumers reported many of the same effects as found on expert health sites, but provided more descriptive language and situational examples. Expert labels of less serious on certain effects were not congruent with the sometimes tremendous burden described by consumers. Consumers mentioned more than double the <b>themes</b> mentioned in <b>expert</b> text, and demonstrated a diversity and range of discourses around those themes. ^ Conclusions. Drug effects from each source were complete relative to the information provided in the other, but each also offered distinct advantages. Expert health sites provided concise summaries of medications’ effects, while consumer reviews had the added advantage of concrete descriptions and greater context. In short, consumer reviews better prepared potential consumers for what it’s like to take psychotropic drugs. Both sources of information benefit clinicians and consumers in making informed treatment-related decisions. Social work practitioners are encouraged to thoughtfully utilize online consumer drug reviews as a legitimate additional source for assisting clients in learning about treatment options. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the development, implementation {{and evaluation of}} a methodological framework for a narrative based approach to practice development and person-centred care in residential aged care settings. The study is underpinned by practice development, person-centred care and narrative methodologies. Narrative focuses on a way of being, paying attention to past present and future, and also {{as a way of}} doing, as the means through which action is understood and made meaningful. Carried out between 2010 and 2014 and underpinned by theories of narrative inquiry, person-centred care, practice development and action research, this study is guided by the philosophical perspectives of Heidegger (1962). Forty six interviews, collected as part of a national research programme, (Person-Centred Care Practice Development Programme 2007 - 2010), were analysed for key themes by myself, four focus groups of 12 clinical nurse managers and two independent <b>experts.</b> <b>Themes</b> were also derived from a focus group of eight residents who explored person-centredness and narrative. Combined, this analyses led to a single set of themes that were used to develop a Framework of Narrative Practice. This framework consists of four pillars, prerequisites, care processes, care environment and narrative aspects of care. The framework further includes three narrative operational elements, narrative knowing, narrative being and narrative doing. Working with the four foundational pillars and the three narrative elements enabled staff to ‘work in a storied way’ and provide person-centred outcomes and a narrative informed philosophy of care for older adults. Using an action research approach with work-based learning groups, the framework was implemented in two residential care settings that were comprised of 37 residents and 38 staff. Three action cycles (1) narrative practice and culture identification, (2) developing narrative practice and (3) working in a storied way emerged during the implementation. Using these action cycles, staff developed action plans to address areas where changes could improve practice and quality of life for the residents. These plans included communication/intercommunication, homely environment, having more going on with and for the residents and meals and mealtimes. By taking account of their biography, the framework confirmed the identity of older people. Three key areas emerged, however, that warranted further conceptualisation. These were, how staff and residents responded to change (narrative being), development of shared understandings (narrative knowing) and intentional action (narrative doing) ...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{design of}} {{environments in which}} people with {{dementia}} live should be understandable, reinforce personal identity and maintain their abilities. The focus on supporting people with dementia to live well has omitted considering the needs or wishes for a supportive physical environment {{of those who are}} nearing the end of their lives. Using a combination of focus groups and a Delphi survey, this study explored the views of people with dementia, family carers and professionals on what aspects of the physical environment would be important to support a good quality of life to the very end. Methods Three focus groups were carried out in three cities along the East Coast of Australia using a discussion guide informed by a literature review. Focus groups comprised recently bereaved family carers of people with dementia (FG 1), people with dementia and family carers of people with dementia (FG 2) and practitioners caring for people with dementia nearing or {{at the end of their}} lives (FG 3). Focus group conversations were audio-recorded with participants 2 ̆ 7 consent. Audio files were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically to identify environmental features that could contribute to achieving the goal of providing a comfortable life to the end. A list of design features derived from analysis of focus group transcripts was distributed to a range of experts in the dementia field and a consensus sought on their appropriateness. From this, a set of features to inform the design of environments for people with dementia nearing the end of life was defined. Results Eighteen people took part in three focus groups: two with dementia, eleven current or recently bereaved family carers and five practitioners. There were differences in opinion on what were important environmental considerations. People with dementia and family carers identified comfort through engagement, feeling at home, a calm environment, privacy and dignity and use of technology to remain connected as important. For practitioners, design to facilitate duty of care and institutional influences on their practice were salient <b>themes.</b> Twenty one <b>experts</b> in the dementia field took part in the survey to agree a consensus on the desirable features derived from analysis of focus group transcripts, with fifteen features agreed. Conclusions The fifteen features are compatible with the design principles for people with dementia who are mobile, but include a stronger focus on sensory engagement. We suggest that considering these features as part of a continuum of care will support good practice and offer those with dementia the opportunity to live well until the end and give their families a more positive experience in the last days of their lives together...|$|R
