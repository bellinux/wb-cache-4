Objective: To investigate the prognostic value of serum protein S- 100 and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) concentrations for predicting (a) memory impairment at discharge; (b) in-hospital death, after resuscitation from out-of- hospital cardiac arrest. Methods: In a prospective study of 143 consecutive survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, serum samples were obtained within 12, 24 - 48 and 72 - 96 {{hours after the}} event. S- 100 and NSE concentrations were measured. Pre-discharge cognitive assessment {{of patients}} (n = 49) was obtained by the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT). The relationship between biochemical brain marker concentrations and RBMT scores, and between marker concentrations {{and the risk of}} in-hospital death was examined. Results: A moderate negative relationship was found between S- 100 concentration and memory test score, at all time points. The relationship between NSE and memory test scores was weaker. An S- 100 concentration greater than 0. 29 ?g/l at time B predicted moderate to severe memory impairment with absolute specificity (42. 8 % sensitivity). S- 100 remained an independent predictor of memory function after adjustment for clinical variables and cardiac arrest <b>timing</b> <b>indices.</b> NSE and S- 100 concentrations were greater in patients who died than in those who survived, at all time points. Both NSE and S- 100 remained predictors of in- hospital death after adjustment for clinical variables and cardiac arrest <b>timing</b> <b>indices.</b> The threshold concentrations yielding 100 % specificity for in-hospital death were S- 100 : 1. 20 ?g/l (sensitivity 44. 8 %); NSE 71. 0 ?g/l (sensitivity 14. 0 %). Conclusions: Estimation of serum S- 100 concentration after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest can be used to identify patients at risk of significant cognitive impairment at discharge.

Drivers will plan trajectory based on their visual data. On the other hand, autonomous intersection management is a fully autonomous system. Technically, autonomous intersection management relies on the communication between vehicles and the intersection manager. It will replace the traffic light with the intersection manager as well as replacing the typical vehicle with the autonomous vehicle. The intersection manager has the ability to communicate wirelessly with every incoming vehicle. Likewise, the vehicle also has the same feature, in order to transmit and receive information to intersection manager. The responsibility of the intersection manager is that it will prioritize the <b>timing</b> <b>index,</b> corresponding to the occupied space and tell a vehicle when it can pass through the intersection, based on the incoming, requested message from vehicles. In the same way, an autonomous vehicle will follow the policy from the intersection manager strictly and accurately. The trajectory will be planned based on the returned, available <b>timing</b> <b>index</b> from the intersection manager. The management mechanism is similar to the personal, virtual traffic signal. Every vehicle will get the personal <b>timing</b> <b>index</b> from the intersection manager and drive according to the received policy.

30|$|For threshold-based estimator, {{which refers}} to the {{correlation}} difference, when threshold goes larger, the MSE gets smaller. That is because if we choose a larger threshold, fewer timing samples will be achieved after correlation difference. Therefore, the samples that are more close to the right timing sample are chosen. Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that the overall timing operation goes {{in some kind of}} rules, but the specific value is with some degree of random, which means that correlation difference will get a relatively large value that is not always over the threshold. Therefore, the existing and uniqueness of timing cannot be guaranteed. No matter with different thresholds, or in different SNR environments, it is always with a big MSE. Thus, it would not work if we want to get a <b>timing</b> <b>index</b> just by catching samples exceeding a predefined threshold.|$|E
30|$|From the {{simulation}} {{we can see}} that the channel models are of randomness and multipath effect, so that the difference result corresponding to the right <b>timing</b> <b>index</b> is not always the maximum one. What's worse, when a threshold is selected, quantity of difference result exceeding threshold may be more than one or none on the contrary. For example, if we set the threshold as 60, the algorithm could obtain more than one timing samples in the situation of Figure 5 A, C, D. When we set a larger threshold, maybe the difference results are out of range, and no sample could be found out. Therefore, threshold is a key point for timing. And threshold should change as the channel environment changing. Meanwhile, we should notice that the features of correlation difference for preamble pattern 3 (or equivalently 4) are not distinct.|$|E

A critical concern when responding to a question is the timing of the response.

This paper presents an analysis of how different semantic and pragmatic features affect the response times to questions in two different data sets of spontaneous human-human dialogues: the Swedish Spontal Corpus and the US English Switchboard corpus.

30|$|The {{physical}} layer scheme of ECMA- 368 adopts preamble-based mode, therefore, synchronization in MB-OFDM-based UWB systems is data-aided. Schmidl and Cox [17] defined a preamble structure with two identical parts. Timing synchronization is implemented by finding out {{the peak of}} pilot correlation, which introduces the timing synchronization idea that bases on preamble design. Studies [18 – 20] are {{on the basis of}} Schmidl's approach. The algorithms they proposed could realize timing synchronization, but are restricted by multipath effect. The above researches have solved timing issue for a great deal. Since the preamble structure for MB-OFDM-based UWB systems has been defined in literature [6] already, corresponding schemes are in need to improve system synchronization capability. Adaptive timing synchronization estimators are proposed in [21, 22], which are implemented by using energy ratio of received symbols. Peak detection [23], based on literature [17], and maximum likelihood estimator [24], based on literature [15], are applied to the systems. Some researchers consider implementing timing synchronization for MB-OFDM-based UWB systems by a defined operation (e.g., energy difference operation [25], or correlation difference operation [26]) to work out threshold contrast. Those types of estimators mitigate the multipath effect restrict, and make synchronization with an acceptable synchronization probability, but have some serious threshold limitation. The first sample that exceeds the threshold may not be the right timing sample. What's worse, the threshold set for the current SNR environment may not suit for other SNRs. Therefore, the threshold setting {{plays an important role in}} the performance of timing synchronization for the systems. Besides, if the samples exceeding the threshold are all taken into account, the consequence of running the algorithms would conclude more than one <b>timing</b> <b>index</b> when the threshold is a small one. Otherwise, none of <b>timing</b> <b>index</b> would be obtained when the threshold is relatively big. They both do not make sense for timing synchronization. The characters of correlation are also widely used in the design of timing synchronization estimators [27, 28]. Concerning the work of timing synchronization of MB-OFDM-based UWB systems, a majority of estimators proposed are of great performance for TFC 1 (or equivalently 2), but the performances for TFC 3 (or equivalently 4) are ignored, which should be taken into consideration, for they are also widely used.|$|E
30|$|The {{maximum total}} and exact {{synchronization}} probabilities {{of the proposed}} estimator among the results we achieved are 99 and 96 % for TFC 1 in the channel environment of CM 1.

So, the synchronization capacity of CBTS is {{lower than that of}} the proposed algorithm for both TFC 1 and TFC 3. The improvement is evident in particular if threshold is relatively small. The reason why synchronization probabilities of the two estimators in larger thresholds are not as much as those in smaller thresholds is that the samples exceeding the threshold of correlation difference are limited. Then the right timing sample would probably be missed by this operation. So, the two estimators have to select <b>timing</b> <b>index</b> from the elected samples. They could only choose a sample mostly close to the start of FS, which finally leads to the outcome of MSE and synchronization probabilities.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSN) are battery-powered, {{thus they}} should be optimized for low energy consumption already at design time. Current tools offer different levels of power simulation, showing the designer where the energy was spent, where hot spots might be optimizable, and so on. However, a semantic gap still remains open: The question why a specific part of the software was executed and therefore energy was consumed. Especially for WSN this question not only encompasses single devices, but whole networks, which can suffer e. g. from network congestion, attenuation, routing errors, lost packets, etc. This paper presents an overview over existing power simulation tools {{as well as the}} new approach of power profiling, which collects much data about many aspects that lead to energy consumption in a network of wireless sensor nodes. The outcome is a statistic about the energy consumption for each single generated transaction, from the moment it was generated until the resulting message is finally received.

It makes sense to propose polarity comparison and identification ideas to the scenario, the cross-correlation difference exceeding predefined threshold is not unique. If polarities of selected symbols are not all the same, the estimator is put forward to find out a peak of correlation summation {{to figure out the}} unique timing point and promote synchronization accuracy.
