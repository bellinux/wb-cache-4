The girder carried an upper <b>track</b> <b>beam</b> and a lower <b>track</b> <b>beam,</b> upon the sides of each of which the rails, four in number, were placed. The two bearing rails, which carried the load of the train, consisted of angle irons placed upon the outer upper edge of wooden stringers upon the lower <b>track</b> <b>beam.</b> These stringers {{were placed in the}} exterior recesses formed by two channel bars properly secured to the sides of the posts. These rails were fastened to each other, to the stringers, and to the <b>track</b> <b>beam</b> by bolts passing clear through. Two vertically placed rails for the balancing or friction wheels were carried by the upper <b>track</b> <b>beam.</b> The distance from out to out between the lower rails was 22½ inches, this being sufficient to insure the necessary transverse stiffness. This was the gauge of the road. The distance between the upper rails was 17½ inches. It was expected to adopt the common form of rail, beveling the edges of the lower stringers and placing the rail at an angle of about 45 degrees. The rails were {{in the form of a}} right angle, and the treads of the wheels were made with a corresponding right angle groove. The usual length of post, 24 feet, would give a clear headway of 14 feet, 4 feet being taken up by the truss and 6 feet forming the foundation.|$|E

GSI proposed <b>beam</b> <b>tracking</b> and performed several experimental studies to analyse the dosimetric precision {{of the system}} for scanned carbon beams. Methods A <b>beam</b> <b>tracking</b> system has been developed and integrated in the scanned carbon ion beam therapy unit at GSI. The system adapts pencil beam positions and beam energy according to target motion. Motion compensation performance of the <b>beam</b> <b>tracking</b> system was assessed by measurements with radiographic films, a range telescope, a 3 D array of 24 ionization chambers, and cell samples for biological dosimetry. Measurements were performed for stationary detectors and moving detectors using the <b>beam</b> <b>tracking</b> system. Results All detector systems showed comparable data for a moving setup when using <b>beam</b> <b>tracking</b> and the corresponding stationary setup. Within the target volume the mean relative differences of ionization chamber measurements were 0. 3 % (1. 5 % standard deviation, 3. 7 % maximum). Film responses demonstrated preserved lateral dose gradients. Measurements with the range telescope showed agreement of Bragg peak depth under motion induced range variations.

Since the mmWave suffers a serious path-loss, beamforming techniques shall be adopted to concentrate the transmit power and receive region on a narrow beam for achieving long distance communications. However, the mobility of users will bring frequent beam handoff, which will decrease the quality of experience (QoE).
