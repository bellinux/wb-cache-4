In that way, Nolan keeps his personality and {{point of view in}} every aspect of the film. [...] "If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why do I need to be there at all? The screen is the same size for every shot... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> you want to do an action film?" [...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|E

2500|$|Pollard has {{attempted}} to examine the negative views of Crabbe {{and the reasons for}} limited readership since his lifetime: [...] "Why did Crabbe's 'realism' and his discovery of what in effect was the short story in verse fail to appeal to the fiction-dominated Victorian age? Or is it that somehow psychological analysis and poetry are uneasy bedfellows? But <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> Browning succeed and Crabbe descend to the doldrums or to the coteries of admiring enthusiasts? And why have we in this century (the 20th century) failed to get much nearer to him? Does this mean that each succeeding generation must struggle to find his characteristic and essential worth? FitzGerald was only one of many among those who would make 'cullings from' or 'readings in' Crabbe. The implications of such selection are clearly that, though much has vanished, much deserves to remain." ...|$|E
