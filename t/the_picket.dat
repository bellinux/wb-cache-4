5|$|In April 1989, {{after the}} miners had worked 14 months without benefits, UMWA {{president}} Richard Trumka declared a strike against the Pittston Coal Company. Around 2,000 UMWA members {{who worked for}} Pittston {{walked out of the}} mines and reported to <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> line. Pittston responded to the strike by hiring replacement workers. To ensure that production would continue, Pittston also had help from the state police to escort the replacement miners and coal trucks across <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> line.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States in January 1919, O'Brien returned to European waters in May to serve as one of <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> ships for the NC-type seaplanes in the first aerial crossing of the Atlantic. O'Brien was decommissioned at Philadelphia in June 1922. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in March 1935 sold for scrapping in April.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{willingness}} of the players to cross <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> lines and networks to broadcast the replacement games, despite a 20% drop in television viewership and even steeper drops in attendance, the union failed to achieve their demands. The strike ended on October 15, 1987, without a collective bargaining agreement in place. The union filed a new antitrust lawsuit on December 30 asking federal judge David Doty to overturn the league's restricting free agent policies.|$|E

50|$|There {{was also}} some {{opposition}} within the NUM to <b>the</b> <b>picketing</b> of <b>the</b> steel plants, as closures {{in the steel}} industry could reduce demand for coal and lead to job losses in the coal industry. Mick McGahey, the deputy leader of the NUM, was particularly concerned about <b>the</b> <b>picketing</b> of Ravenscraig in Scotland, which he had campaigned to keep open, and negotiated agreements to maintain supplies of coal to the plant.|$|R
5|$|He {{is married}} to writer Julie Thacker; the couple has five daughters. His brother Brian Scully is also a comedy writer {{and he has a}} second brother called Neil, who is an ice hockey writer. His mother died in 1985.

5|$|Rick Neuheisel {{came off}} the bench to lead the Chargers to three second-half scores. Partly based on this performance, the Buccaneers later signed Neuheisel as a backup quarterback. Although many veteran NFL players crossed <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> line during the week, the Buccaneers were one of only six teams to have no players cross. More than 1,000 area union members joined the Buccaneers regulars in {{picketing}} the game, with some fans tearing up their tickets and joining them.|$|E
5|$|A {{vote was}} held on 3 May 1965 in which the {{committee}} voted to strike against Coachella Valley grape growers. Although the strikers weren't able to negotiate {{a contract with the}} growers, they did succeed in winning higher wages. Following the success in Southern California, on 8 September 1965 the Agriculture Workers Organizing Committee voted to strike against grape growers in Delano, California, where the grape season starts in September. This strike became the first time Mexican workers, due to the decision of Cesar Chavez, did not break a strike of Filipinos; later, on 16 September 1965, Chavez's National Farm Workers Association joined the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee on <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> lines. These strikes occurred around the same time when younger Filipino Americans began a period of political self-reflection and awakening.|$|E
60|$|The firing {{increased}} in volume, and was evidently approaching. <b>The</b> <b>pickets,</b> then, were being driven in, and the Dervishes {{were going to}} attack. The men were ordered to lie down, in the position {{in which they were}} to fight. In five minutes after the first shot all were ready for action, <b>the</b> <b>pickets</b> had run in; and, in the dim light, numbers of dark figures could be made out.|$|R
5000|$|Having corralled <b>the</b> <b>pickets</b> {{into a field}} {{overlooking}} the coke works, the police positioned officers equipped with long riot shields {{at the bottom of}} the field and mounted police and dogs to either side. A road along one side of the field allowed the mounted police to deploy rapidly, and a railway cutting at the top of the field made retreat by <b>the</b> <b>pickets</b> difficult and dangerous. When <b>the</b> <b>pickets</b> surged forward at the arrival of the first convoy of lorries, South Yorkshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Anthony Clement ordered a mounted charge against them. It was [...] "a serious overreaction" [...] and the miners responded by throwing stones and other missiles at the police lines. Clement ordered two further mounted advances, and the third advance was supported by [...] "short shield" [...] snatch squads who followed the mounted police, [...] "delivering baton beatings to the unarmed miners." [...] There followed a lull of several hours, during which many <b>pickets</b> left <b>the</b> scene. The coking plant had closed for the day and no more lorries were due to arrive. Those pickets that remained in the field were sunbathing or playing football and posed no threat to the police or the plant. By now [...] "massively outnumbering" [...] <b>the</b> <b>pickets,</b> <b>the</b> police advanced again and launched another mounted charge. The police pursued <b>the</b> <b>pickets</b> out of <b>the</b> field and into Orgreave village where Clement ordered a [...] "mounted police canter" [...] which Hunt describes as an [...] "out-of-control police force charging pickets and onlookers alike on terraced, British streets." ...|$|R

5|$|Considered the fourth-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} by Baseball America {{heading into the}} 1995 season, the Yankees projected Jeter as their starting shortstop. He suffered mild inflammation in his right shoulder in the Arizona Fall League after {{the conclusion of the}} 1994 regular season. As a precaution, the Yankees signed Tony Fernández to a two-year contract. With Fernández the starting shortstop, the Yankees assigned Jeter to Class AAA. During the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, offered Jeter the opportunity to work out for the MLB team with replacement players in spring training before the 1995 season. Jeter denied receiving the offer, and did not cross <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> line.|$|E
5|$|Despite advance {{sales of}} 40,000 tickets, only 4,919 fans {{showed up to}} the first strike game played by {{replacement}} players. Neither team had any of its regular players on the roster. Detroit punter Mike Black's 3rd-quarter fumble on the 3-yard line set up Harold Ricks' game-winning touchdown run. The Buccaneers' three second-quarter touchdowns overcame the Lions' early 17-point lead. 17 of the Buccaneers' points resulted from Lions turnovers. Around 1,000 union members, including UAW president Owen Bieber, joined the Lions on <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> lines. Attendance was also likely influenced by a baseball game taking place the same day, in which the Detroit Tigers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays to win the A.L. East Championship.|$|E
5|$|On 31 December 1918, Wadsworth {{stood out}} of Brest {{to return to the}} United States and reached Boston, Massachusetts, on 9January 1919. Following an {{extended}} overhaul, she put to sea on 1May to serve as one of <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> ships stationed at intervals across the ocean for the transatlantic flight of four Curtiss NC flying boats, one of which, NC-4, successfully completed the feat. The destroyer returned home and operated on the east coast through the summer of 1919. On 29August, Wadsworth was placed in reduced commission at Philadelphia where she remained almost two years. On 9May 1921, the destroyer returned to active service along the east coast.|$|E

5|$|On May 3, {{striking}} workers in Chicago met near the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company plant. Union molders {{at the plant}} had been locked out since early February and the predominantly Irish-American workers at McCormick had come under attack from Pinkerton guards during an earlier strike action in 1885. This event, along with the eight-hour militancy of McCormick workers, had gained the strikers some respect and notoriety around the city. By {{the time of the}} 1886 general strike, strikebreakers entering the McCormick plant were under protection from a garrison of 400 police officers. Although half of the replacement workers defected to the general strike on May 1, McCormick workers continued to harass strikebreakers as they crossed <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> lines.|$|E
5|$|The local nurses' {{union for}} the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital is on strike. Jeff, {{the husband of}} Deb (Chad Morgan), one of the nurses, collapses while walking <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> line. At the {{emergency}} room, House suspects Jeff's extreme niceness and inability to get angry is a major symptom of an underlying condition. After various tests, the team suspects his niceness is a personality change resulting from syphilis. Kutner (Kal Penn) asks the couple if either of them had an affair, {{which could lead to}} syphilis. Deb denies it, stating that it is just the way her husband behaves and that it is impossible for her to not love him.|$|E
5|$|The {{record was}} {{released}} in July 2009 and peaked at No.137 on the Billboard 200. Critics praised the title for its barrage of heavy rock and spiritually minded lyrics. Later that summer, Project 86 traveled nationwide on the Scream the Prayer Tour with metalcore outfits The Chariot, Haste the Day, and Gwen Stacy. Coming mid-October, Project 86 started <b>the</b> <b>Picket</b> Fence Cartel Tour with , Showbread, The Wedding, and Yearling, and added a second part in spring 2010 with Flatfoot 56 and Wavorly. The band released their first live album, entitled XV Live, in December 2010 to commemorate their 15th anniversary.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were {{performers}} were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club picket line as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover, were over as {{a result of}} the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> line to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $1.99 in a New York Times advertisement; when those in the know about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days were coming to an end. In the last few months of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On a good day in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the force}} {{was called in}} to manage {{industrial}} disputes on a range of occasions between 1887 and 1906. In the mining town of Lethbridge, for example, the Alberta Railway and Coal Company locked out its workforce in 1894 during an attempt to cut staff and reduce wages; a team of ten police was deployed to maintain order, in particular any risks posed by eastern European immigrants, and to mediate in the dispute. Police deployed there again in 1906 for nine months during a dispute between the company, now called the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company, and the workforce over union recognition, pay and working conditions. A team of 82 regular police were reinforced by 11 special constables recruited from within the company, with an undercover constable deployed to infiltrate the strike and send back intelligence. Efforts were made to collect information on the earnings of the union leaders, probably intended for use in discrediting them. The police maintained order and escorted non-striking workers past <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> lines.|$|E
5|$|Much of Livingstone's {{first two}} years were devoted to setting up the Mayoral system and administration. He also devoted much time to battling New Labour's plans to upgrade the London Underground system through a public–private {{partnership}} (PPP) program, believing it to be too expensive and tantamount to the privatisation of a state-owned service. He furthermore had strong concerns about safety; PPP would divide {{different parts of the}} Underground among various companies, something that he argued threatened a holistic safety and maintenance program. These concerns were shared by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) trade union, who went on strike over the issue, being joined on <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> line by Livingstone. Appointing Bob Kiley as transport commissioner, the duo argued that the upgrade should be carried out in state hands through a public bond issue, as had been done {{in the case of the}} New York City Subway. They launched court cases against the government over PPP in 2001–02, but were ultimately unsuccessful, and the project went ahead, with the Underground being privatised in January 2003.|$|E

5|$|The NFLPA went {{on strike}} for a month in 1987 upon the {{expiration}} of the 1982 CBA; the league's free-agent policy was the major matter in dispute. This time, however, the strike only canceled one week of the season. For three weeks, the NFL staged games with hastily assembled replacement teams, made up principally of players cut during training camp and players left out of work from {{the closure of the}} United States Football League two years prior (along with, to a lesser extent, the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL, who had folded just three months prior to the strike). They were joined by a few veterans who crossed <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> lines, including New York Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau, Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Randy White, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, New England Patriots quarterback Doug Flutie, and Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Steve Largent.|$|E
5|$|East India Company and British Army {{casualties}} {{amounted to}} 428 killed, 1138 wounded and 18 missing; {{a total of}} 1,584– {{over a third of}} the force engaged in combat. The 74th and <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> battalion were decimated; from a strength of about 500, the 74th lost ten officers killed and seven wounded, and 124 other ranks killed and 270 wounded. The pickets lost all their officers except their commander, Lieutenant Colonel William Orrock, and had only about 75 men remaining. Of the ten officers forming the general's staff, eight were wounded or had their horses killed. Wellesley himself lost two horses; the first was shot from underneath him and the second was speared as he led the charge to re-capture the Maratha gun line. The number of Maratha casualties is more difficult to ascertain. Despatches from British officers give a figure of 1,200 dead and many more wounded but some modern historians have estimated a total of 6,000 dead and wounded. The Marathas also surrendered seven stands of colours, large amounts of stores and ammunition and 98 cannon– most of which were later taken into service by the East India Company. Although Scindia and Berar's army was not finished as a fighting force, several of Scindia's regular infantry battalions and artillery crews had been destroyed. Their command structure had also been damaged: many of their European officers, including Colonel Pohlmann and Major Dupont, surrendered to the Company– which had offered amnesty to Europeans {{in the service of the}} Maratha armies– or deserted and sought employment with other native chieftains.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, the Jets {{won their}} first two games. NFL players then staged a strike; a team {{composed}} mostly of replacement players lost two of the next three games. The locker room was divided after the strike due to the decision of a few players, led by Gastineau, to cross <b>the</b> <b>picket</b> line. The Jets remained in contention in a mediocre AFC East {{through much of the}} season, but dropped all four games in December to finish 6–9, in last place. In 1988, the Sack Exchange era ended as Joe Klecko failed his offseason physical and was waived, linebacker Lance Mehl announced his retirement during training camp, and Mark Gastineau retired midseason, citing personal reasons. In spite of these departures, the Jets finished with an 8–7–1 record. They secured a winning record by ending the season with a victory over the Giants, which cost their in-state rivals a playoff berth. The team performed badly in 1989, finishing 4–12. On December 18, 1989, the Jets hired executive Dick Steinberg from the New England Patriots to take over as general manager. Three days after New York's final game of the season, a 37–0 loss to the Bills at Giants Stadium, Steinberg fired Walton and began to search for the team's 10th coach. The disastrous 1989 campaign cost Walton the chance to be the first Jets coach to complete his career with a winning record, a statistic he later admitted he cared about deeply.|$|E
