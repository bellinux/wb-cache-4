5|$|After {{completing}} all but {{its last}} moult, the caterpillar spins a cocoon out of silk. The cocoon {{can be in}} the <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network cocoon with large and irregular mesh. In the warm season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The chrysalis stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before eclosion, the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal exuvia (the pupal exoskeleton), the moth finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping haemolymph into the wing veins. The moth then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.|$|E

25|$|After {{emerging}} in the autumn, the migrant forms of sugarbeet root aphids seek out Populus trees to colonize. These migrant forms are short-lived, and usually die within 12 to 48 hours. In selecting trees to colonize, the autumn migrants of sugarbeet root aphids prefer to colonize larger trees over smaller ones, {{and are likely to}} use simple cues such as <b>tree</b> <b>crown</b> size or tree resistance to colonization to decide on which trees to colonize. Despite the importance of leaf size to stem mothers, autumn migrants do not appear to take leaf size into consideration when choosing a tree to colonize.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{micro-climate}} and {{the sensible}} heat flux in a street with thick <b>tree</b> <b>crowns</b> was investigated {{from a series}} of observations during summer. The difference of air temperature is negligible throughout the day compared to a parallel street without <b>tree</b> <b>crowns.</b> However, for the radiation field, there is a clear shielding effect for solar radiation and downward long wave radiation, consequently the road surface temperature will differ. The sensible heat flux at three meters height above the road surface was measured by scintillation method. The heat flux in the street with <b>tree</b> <b>crowns</b> was similar to that without <b>tree</b> <b>crowns,</b> although there was a large difference in road surface temperature between them. The estimated exhaust heat was extremely large and the measured heat flux was dominated by this artificial heat flux. Such a large exhaust heat could partly be explained by the parked vehicles in both sides of the roadway which would keep the air conditioning running...|$|R

40|$|In the {{computer}} analysis of high spatial resolution multispectral aerial images for forest inven-tory purposes, {{it may be}} more useful to deal with individual <b>tree</b> <b>crowns</b> as the "objects " of our analysis than with forest stands or individual pixels. Starting from this tenet, it becomes important to be able to spectrally define these <b>tree</b> <b>crowns</b> as succinctly as possible. This paper proposes, describes, and compares seven different ways that <b>tree</b> <b>crowns</b> in high spatial resolution aerial images can be spectral-ly defined for species classification. In testing these seven types of multispectral signatures, it was found that five led to relatively similar classification accuracies (72 ± 3 %) in differentiating five coniferous species. Additional classification accuracy improvements (to 76 %) were possible with some of the signatures by using Canonical Analysis prior to classification. The "tree colour line"-based signatures, a newly introduced approach, gave comparable results to simpler signatures such as those based on the mean multispectral value of <b>tree</b> <b>crowns.</b> Red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait) crowns were consistently hard to separate spectral-ly from other species, whereas black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.)

Methods: High-resolution imagery was taken from an airplane flying at a low altitude (600 m) above the ground. Imagery of the observable upper layer of the <b>tree</b> <b>crowns</b> {{was used for the}} analysis. Dichotomous identification keys for different types of crowns were produced and tested. The identification keys were designed to be web-based interactive, using Google Earth as the main online platform. The taxa analysed were Iriartea, Astrocaryum, Inga, Parkia, Cecropia, Pourouma, Guarea, Otoba, Lauraceae and Pouteria. Results: This paper demonstrates that a combination of photo-imagery, dichotomous keys and a web-based interface can be useful for the taxonomic identification of Amazonian trees based on their crown characteristics. The keys tested with an overall identification accuracy of over 50 % for five of the ten taxa with three of them showing accuracy greater than 70 % (Iriartea, Astrocaryum and Cecropia). Conclusions: The application of dichotomous keys and a web-based interface provides a new methodological approach for taxonomic identification of various Amazonian <b>tree</b> <b>crowns.</b> Overall, the study showed that crowns with a medium-rough texture are less reliably identified than crowns with smoother or well-defined surfaces.
