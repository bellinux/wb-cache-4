5|$|Common ixodid ticks {{collected}} from impala include Amblyomma hebraeum, Boophilus decoloratus, Hyalomma marginatum, Ixodes cavipalpus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. evertsi. In Zimbabwe, heavy infestation by ticks such as R. appendiculatus {{has proved to}} be a major cause behind the high mortality of ungulates, as they can lead to tick paralysis. Impala have special adaptations for grooming, such as their characteristic dental arrangement, to manage ticks before they engorge; however, the extensive grooming needed to keep the tick load under control involves the risk of dehydration during summer, lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of the teeth. A study showed that impala adjust the <b>time</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> grooming and the number of grooming bouts according to the seasonal prevalence of ticks.|$|E

There are frequent complaints that state sector schools do too little to encourage sport and a healthy lifestyle. In the 1980s, the government sold many schools sports fields to housing developers; as such, many older schools do not have outdoor facilities readily available.|$|E
25|$|Petrarch, 14th-century {{poet and}} Renaissance humanist, {{discusses}} otium in his De vita solitaria {{as it relates}} to a human life of simple habits and self-restraint.

25|$|The ancient Greek {{gymnasium}} {{soon became}} a place for more than exercise. This development arose through recognition by the Greeks of the strong relation between athletics, education and health. Accordingly, the gymnasium became connected with education {{on the one hand}} and medicine on the other. Physical training and maintenance of health and strength were the chief parts of children's earlier education. Except for <b>time</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> letters and music, the education of young men was solely conducted in the gymnasium, where provisions were made not only for physical pedagogy but for instruction in morals and ethics. As pupils grew older, informal conversation and other forms of social activity took the place of institutional, systematic discipline. Since the gymnasia were favorite resorts of youth, they were frequented by teachers, especially philosophers. Philosophers and sophists frequently assembled to hold talks and lectures in the gymnasia; thus the institution became a resort for those interested in less structured intellectual pursuits in addition to those using the place for training in physical exercises.|$|E
500|$|The third {{method is}} the {{input-output}} cost method. [...] This looks {{at both the}} costs of inputs and includes any value added by the household. [...] "For instance, the value of <b>time</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> cooking a meal can be determined by asking what it could cost to purchase a similar meal (the output) in the market, then subtracting {{the cost of the}} capital goods, utilities and raw materials devoted to that meal. This remainder represents the value of the other factors of production, primarily labor." [...] These types of models try to value household output by determining monetary values for the inputs [...] in the dinner example, the ingredients and production of the meal [...] and compares those with market equivalents.|$|E

500|$|Lesinski was {{terminated}} by Paramount in September 2011 {{and the project}} was passed to Brian Miller, Vice President of Paramount Digital Entertainment. Miller later explained that he wanted the production to avoid the mistakes typically made in movie tie-in games involved a lack of <b>time</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> the production, and excluding the people working on the film from work on the game. Miller hoped that they had rectified these issues with Star Trek, and explained that they hadn't produced a similar game to tie-in with 2009's Star Trek film {{because it would have}} suffered from those problems. He also expressed disappointment at the quality of previous in-universe games and wanted the new Star Trek to be [...] "a triple-A game" [...] and something that the franchise deserved.|$|E

Parthasarathy on the background music. Rajeswara Rao recalled in a 1993 interview for The Hindu {{that it took}} him over a year to compose the film's music, with much of his <b>time</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> the drum-dance scene: [...] "As the dancers performed, we used to rehearse and compose the music. It was done with incredibly few instruments. We used a piano, ten double-bass violins, and drums from Africa, Egypt, and Persia which we have acquired from an African War troupe." [...] Rao's salary was 1,500. The music was influenced by Carnatic and Hindustani music, Latin American and Portuguese folk music and Strauss waltzes. According to M. K. Raghavendra, Chandralekha has [...] "snatches from [...] Wagner and [...] Rimsky-Korsakov (Scherezade) being used at dramatic moments." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first problem}} of {{measuring}} unpaid {{work is the}} issue of collecting accurate information. This is always a concern in research studies, but is particularly difficult when evaluating unpaid work. [...] "Time-use surveys may reveal relatively little <b>time</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> unpaid direct care activities [...] the demands of subsistence production in those countries are great," [...] and may not take into account multitasking [...] for example, a mother may collect wood fuel while a child is in the same location, so the child is in her care while she is performing other work. Usually such indirect care should be included, as it is in many time use studies. But it is not always, and as a result some studies may undervalue the amount of certain types of unpaid work. Participant observation has been criticized for being [...] "so time-consuming that it can only focus on small numbers of households," [...] and thus limited in the amount of information {{it can be used to}} gather.|$|E

500|$|Stossel {{intended}} to go work at Seattle Magazine, {{but it had}} gone out of business by the time he graduated. His contacts there, however, got him a job at KGW-TV in Portland, Oregon, where Stossel began as a newsroom gofer, working his way up to researcher and then writer. After a few years, the news director told Stossel to go on the air and read what he wrote. Stossel, who confesses to having been frightened of being on the air, has expressed embarrassment at watching videos of his early performances. Nonetheless, Stossel says his fear spurred him to improve, examining broadcasts of David Brinkley and Jack Perkins to imitate them. Stossel also struggled with a stuttering problem he had harbored since childhood. After a few years of on-air reporting, Stossel was hired by WCBS-TV in New York City, by Ed Joyce, the same news director who hired Arnold Diaz, Linda Ellerbee, Dave Marash, Joel Siegel and Lynn Sherr. Stossel was disappointed at CBS, feeling that the journalism was of a lower quality than in Portland, and disliking the lesser quantity of <b>time</b> <b>devoted</b> <b>to</b> research there. Stossel cites union work rules that discouraged the extra work that Stossel felt allowed employees to be creative, which he says represented his [...] "first real introduction to the deals made by special interests". Stossel also [...] "hated" [...] Joyce, who he felt was [...] "cold and critical", though Stossel credits Joyce with allowing him the freedom to pursue his own story ideas, and with recommending the Hollins Communications Research Institute in Roanoke, Virginia, that largely cured Stossel's stuttering problem.|$|E
