A second PC further separated Italian, Spanish, and Greek individuals from those of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry as well as distinguishing among northern European populations. In separate analyses of northern European participants other substructure relationships were discerned showing a west to east gradient.|$|E
25|$|It is {{reported}} that roughly 2 million dogs are slaughtered and consumed {{every year in}} South Korea. In recent years the number of dog meat has gone down as more people have been adopting dogs as pets. Dog restaurants are also closing down, with reports saying the country’s 1,500 dog meat restaurants have almost halved in recent years. A poll conducted by Gallup Korea in 2015 showed that only 20 percent of men in their 20s consumed dog meat, compared to half of <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> 50s and 60s. However, there are still approximately 17,000 dog farms operating across the country, often in inhumane conditions.|$|E
25|$|More {{offenders}} are male than female, though the percentage varies between studies (see female child molesters).

Studies of sexual misconduct in US schools with female offenders have shown mixed results with rates between 4% to 43% of female offenders. Maletzky (1993) found that, of his sample of 4,402 convicted pedophilic offenders, 0.4% were female. Another study of a non-clinical population found that, among <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> sample that had been molested, as many as a third were molested by women.|$|E

25|$|Without {{immunization}} about 0.1 {{percent to}} {{one percent of}} the population are affected per year. Widespread vaccination has resulted in a more than 90 percent decline in rates of disease. Mumps is more common in the developing world where vaccination is less common. Outbreaks, however, may still occur in a vaccinated population. Before the introduction of a vaccine, mumps was a common childhood disease worldwide. Larger outbreaks of disease would typically occur every two to five years. Children between the ages of five and nine were most commonly affected. Among immunized populations often <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> early 20s are affected. Around the equator it often occurs all year round while in the more northerly and southerly regions of the world it is more common in the winter and spring. Painful swelling of the parotid glands and testicles was described by Hippocrates in the 5th century BCE.|$|E
25|$|Golden orb-weavers reach {{sizes of}} 4.8–5.1cm (1.5–2in) in females, not {{including}} legspan, with males being usually 2/3 smaller (less than 2.5cm, 1 in). The largest specimen ever recorded was a 6.9cm (2.7in) female N. plumipes (which is now debated {{to have been}} a new yet undocumented subspecies) from Queensland, Australia, that was able to catch and feed on a small finch. In 2012 a large individual was photographed killing and consuming a half-metre-long brown tree snake in Freshwater, Queensland. Species from Taiwan have been known to reach over , legspan included, in mountainous country. In 2014, a study discovered that golden orb-weavers living in urban areas, particularly those of a high socioeconomic status, grew larger and carried more eggs than <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> native habitats. A number of possible explanations were suggested, such as increased food supplies due to artificial light or lack of predators and parasites.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{the birth}} rate {{increased}} again. Russia recorded 1,896,263 births, {{the highest number}} since 1990, and even exceeding annual births during the period 1967–1969, with a TFR of 1.691, the highest since 1991. (Source: Vital statistics table below). In fact, Russia, despite having only slightly more people than Japan, has recently had nearly twice as many births as that country. The number of births was expected to fall {{over the next few}} years as women born during the baby bust in the 1990s enter their prime childbearing years, but this didn't occur thanks to the continued growth of the TFR. The figures for 2013-2015 again showed around 1.9 million births, about the same as in 2012, but because the number of women of childbearing age is dropping, especially for <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> early 20s, the TFR actually rose to 1.777, which places Russia at first 9 or 10 countries out of 50 developed nations, and at 6th place in Europe.|$|E

25|$|The term “thangata” has {{had several}} {{meanings}} in Malawi {{in the last}} 120 years, and its traditional or pre-colonial use {{was very different from}} its uses in colonial and modern times. The word exists in the Chewa and the related Mang'anja languages, and its first pre-colonial meaning was “help” or “to assist”, in the sense of freely-given reciprocal help such as neighbours might give each other building huts or clearing fields. It also had the meaning of the agricultural work that a member of the village community did for his chief. The ownership of land in much of Malawi was vested in the community, not individuals. Traditional leaders acted as trustees over communal land, and granted the right to use it to individuals in their communities. By custom, these leaders received in gifts in kind or labour from <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> community who had benefitted. This was also called thangata. When communal land was plentiful, community leaders could not demand thangata, but once it became scarcer in the colonial period, and particularly after the introduction of Indirect rule on 1933, the chiefs could impose a condition of thangata work on any grant. In {{the last two or three}} decades, chiefs have begun to require cash sums or rents to allow the use of communal land, but these cash payments are not called thangata.|$|E

The first such friendship was with Piers Dunkerley, 13 years old in 1934 when Britten was aged 20. Other boys Britten befriended were the young David Hemmings and Michael Crawford, both of whom sang treble roles in his works in the 1950s. Hemmings later said, [...] "In {{all of the time}} that I spent with him he never abused that trust", and Crawford wrote [...] "I cannot say enough about the kindness of that great man... he had a wonderful patience and affinity with young people. He loved music, and loved youngsters caring about music." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1888session, the General Assembly passed 1,571bills, {{exceeding}} the total passed {{by any other}} session in the state's history. Only about 150of these bills were of a general nature; the rest were special interest bills passed for the private gain of legislators and <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> constituencies. Buckner vetoed 60of these special interest bills, more than had been vetoed by the previous ten governors combined. Only one of these vetoes was overridden by the legislature. Ignoring Buckner's clear intent to veto special interest bills, the 1890legislature passed 300more special interest bills than had its predecessor. Buckner vetoed 50of these. His reputation for rejecting special interest bills led the Kelley Axe Factory, the largest axe factory {{in the country at}} the time, to present him with a ceremonial [...] "Veto Hatchet".|$|E

500|$|Development of Ikaruga began while Treasure's Sin and Punishment (2000) {{was still}} in development. Ikaruga was self-funded (and later self-published). Since company {{resources}} were allocated for Sin and Punishment, director Hiroshi Iuchi worked on Ikaruga at home on his spare time and developed a prototype with help from programmer Atsutomo Nakagawa. Ikaruga shares basic shooter gameplay elements with an earlier Treasure shooter, Radiant Silvergun (1998). Additionally, the polarity elements are similar to <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> earlier game Silhouette Mirage (1997). [...] Another source of inspiration was the defense system in Shinrei Jusatsushi Taromaru (1997) for the Sega Saturn. Iuchi reused sprites from Radiant Silvergun so he could finish the prototype quickly. A unique feature to the original design was a limited ammo supply. The player's stock was replenished by absorbing enemy bullets. This mechanic was seen as weak since it created gaps in the action when no bullets could be fired. Gameplay ideas in the prototype version were later included in a special bonus mode in the final game. After further testing and consultation between team members, the final gameplay system was implemented.|$|E
500|$|In 1222, {{along with}} the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Norwich, Hugh ordered that all <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> dioceses refrain from contact with Jews. This decree, however, was {{countermanded}} by a royal decree to the county sheriffs in the affected dioceses ordering them to imprison any residents who refused to interact with Jews. Besides these activities, Hugh was active in his diocese, including supervising the various monastic houses within it. In 1227, a visitation to Eynsham Abbey resulted in Hugh deposing the abbot. Although the 12th chronicler Matthew Paris accused Hugh of being biased against monks and nuns, and even called him the [...] "untiring persecutor of monks, the hammer of canons, nuns and all the religious", {{there is little evidence}} that Hugh singled out monks for persecution. One reason for Paris' dislike of the bishop may have been the fact that the chronicler's own abbey of St Alban's had to compromise with Hugh over two legal disputes, dealing with the right to appoint to various benefices.|$|E
