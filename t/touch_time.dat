So every time {{he wanted to go}} outside for a break, he had to come down the stairs and pass us on the way out. There was a joint across the street called the Copper Rail, which was a soul food {{restaurant}} and a bar where the musicians from the Metropole would all hang out. Soon I learned Dizzy mentioned me in an interview in International Musician, the musician union’s magazine, when he was asked about any promising young musicians he'd heard."

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the application of}} reconfigurable industrial robotics in the assembly of the engine nacelle inlet for a commercial aircraft. In addition to addressing the achievable level of automation, this thesis also reviews the evaluation of robotics vendor proposals and the accompanying financial justification requisite for implementation. The aircraft industry has long been dominated by manual fabrication and assembly methods. Variability in human skill, however, results in defects, rework, and reduced production throughput. One approach to reduce variability, decrease cycle time, and increase throughput is the implementation of robotic automation for various assembly tasks. Low aircraft production volumes have {{made it difficult to}} justify large investments in robotic automation. Decreasing cost and increasing capability of industrial robotics, however, are making investment more palatable. The excellent repeatability of robotic automation can significantly reduce individual task times {{for a wide range of}} operations. Standard automated task times are 60 { 85 % lower than standard manual task times for drill and fasten operations which represent the greatest opportunity for cycle time improvements because typical aircraft assembly requires tens of thousands of holes and fasteners. The optimal level of automation is a balance among decreasing manual <b>touch</b> <b>time,</b> improving production capacity, and increasing automation costs. A semi-automated solution is shown to reduce manual <b>touch</b> <b>time</b> by 70 % and total <b>touch</b> <b>time</b> by 30 %. The implementation of this solution requires an investment of tens of millions of dollars and results in present value savings of hundreds of millions of dollars for the program lifetime. by Bryce J.

40|$|Abstract — Oil-modified {{alkyd resin}} was {{prepared}} from crude castor oil. The experiment started with investigating the optimum conditions for neutralization of crude castor oil and bleaching of neutralized oil. Then the characteristics (iodine value, viscosity, acid value, refractive index and color) of oils were determined. Refined oil has iodine value of 90, kinemetic viscosity of 4 St, {{free fatty acid}} value of 1, refractive index of 1. 474 and color number of 8. These {{results showed that the}} refined oil was qualified to prepare dehydrated castor oil. Dehydration of refined oil was carried out at 210 - 220 ˚C under 600 - 640 mmHg with the help of 1 % (wt%) NaHSO 4 catalyst. The dehydrated castor oils were analyzed for iodine value, viscosity and its set to <b>touch</b> <b>time</b> and drying time were also investigated. Dehydrated castor oil has iodine value of 140, kinemetic viscosity of 1. 6 St, set to <b>touch</b> <b>time</b> of 4 hr and drying time of 5 days. And then, oil modified alkyd resin (acid value 6. 6) was prepared from dehydrated castor oil by alcoholysis method in excess of glycerol and phthalic anhydride in the presence of 0. 3 % (wt%) NaOH catalyst. The obtained resin was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer (FTIR) and the properties were determined...|$|E

A mold {{was designed for}} compression molding and installed in a hydraulic press. The mold features two shear edges, guide pins and an integrated part ejection system. A material preforming method was developed to improve consistency in material distribution, which improved process robustness. A number of parts were produced and inspected for void content and dimensional stability. No significant porosity or voids {{were found in the}} samples examined. Part thickness uniformity was studied and improved, {{in order to meet the}} required tolerances. Dimensional inspection before and after a free standing post cure showed no significant part distortion. This work showed that compression molded tailboom frames are a viable alternative to current tailboom frames using continuous pre-impregnated fabric materials and cured by autoclave.

40|$|A {{medical device}} company {{challenged}} a research team {{to reduce the}} manufacturing floor space required for an occlusion system product by one third. The team first cataloged equipment location and size, detailed the processes to make the product, and created a model for prototyping designs. The model allowed for multiple proposals of designs to the stakeholders without disrupting the line. The team implemented the new floor layout on August 3, 2012. The layout reduced the footprint by the required one third, removed the waste of extra space and maintenance time. The design was also the lowest cost design for the company. Further suggestions for future reduction in space are also included. The team was given the additional challenge of improving the manufacturing of the product. My particular focus was to analyze the cycle time. First definitions were given to provide criteria for analyzing different reductions. Processes that were the longest in each subassembly, or bottleneck processes, were specifically analyzed to reduce their process time or delay time. Technical updates to reduce <b>touch</b> <b>time</b> and delay time for other major processes were also considered. Suggestions for future work are included to reduce the production time.

40|$|This Research Topic {{explores the}} question: {{what is the}} {{relationship}} between representations of time and space in cultures around the world? This question touches on the broader issue of how humans come to represent and reason about abstract entities – things we cannot see or <b>touch.</b> <b>Time</b> is a particularly opportune domain to investigate this topic. Across cultures, people use spatial representations for time, for example in graphs, time-lines, clocks, sundials, hourglasses, and calendars. In language, time is also heavily related to space, with spatial terms often used to describe the order and duration of events. In English, for example, we might move a meeting forward, push a deadline back, attend a long concert or go on a short break. People also make consistent spatial gestures when talking about time, and appear to spontaneously invoke spatial representations when processing temporal language. A large body of evidence suggests a close correspondence between temporal and spatial language and thought. However, the ways that people spatialize time can differ dramatically across languages and cultures. This research topic identifies and explores some of the sources of this variation, including patterns in spatial thinking, patterns in metaphor, gesture and other cultural systems. This Research Topic explores how speakers of different languages talk about time and space and how they think about these domains, outside of language. The Research Topic invites papers exploring the following issues: 1. Do the linguistic representations of space and time share the same lexical and morphosyntactic resources? 2. To what extent does the conceptualization of time follow the conceptualization of space...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. This study {{focuses on}} {{optimising}} operations effectiveness and capacity at a heavy engineering plant, namely Heavy Engineering Vereeniging, {{a division of}} DCD–DORBYL (Pty) Ltd. The implementation and adoption of technology {{was included in the}} investigation. The company operates from 2 premises in Vereeniging and Vanderbijlpark (Gauteng), and consists of 5 factory buildings. A literature review was conducted to ascertain current industry best practises and technology implementation initiatives. This review included a discussion on the following aspects: Capacity and its utilisation, flexible technology and advanced manufacturing systems, technology in manufacturing, capacity expansion and scheduling, factory layouts, technology and capacity utilisation in a South African context, and finally future trends in capacity and technology at Heavy Engineering Vereeniging. Data collection from within the organisation was done via the issuing of a questionnaire and conducting interviews with various management and supervision employees. The gathered data was analysed for employees’ opinions on current utilisation of capacity and use of technology, as well as suggestions regarding improved working methods, factory layout and the implementation of new technology. The quantitative data was analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software, with the provided descriptive statistical test results used for the identification of possible trends and further interpretation. It was found that current capacities and equipment are being well utilised, but not to their optimal level. The well entrenched management information systems, measurement systems and operating procedures currently in use will aid to increase the level of utilisation of the available capacity and equipment. The implementation of technology and latest best practises within the operation will gain HEV a competitive edge, ensuring their future sustainability and market leadership. However, this implementation must be done with the input and buy in of the work force. The variances in perceptions and attitudes between the various job functions, discovered during the statistical analysis, must be taken into cognisance during any capacity optimisation or technology implementation initiative. Continued capital expenditure and the current drives in research and development need to be maintained to further ensure sustainability. Various inefficiencies were identified and recommendations were made to improve the current operation’s effectiveness and factory layout, primarily by decreasing operating inefficiencies. The recommendations were made {{based on the results of}} the study and included the expenditure involved in their execution. Financially viable options, calculated using payback periods and net present values (NPV), included the purchase of phased array ultrasonic testing equipment, horizontal SAW for longitudinal flanges and a modular type furnace. Other options, which could improve operations effectiveness, but not returning financially positive results, included the moving of the Hausler roll into the main fabrication workshop and the moving of the Sachems drills to alongside the lathes. A number of new processes and initiatives were recommended, for which cost comparisons to current similar practices could not be performed. These included the full production implementation of the punch through tandem arc submerged arc welding for wind turbine tower manufacture, implementation of a customer interfacing and communication platform and internal communication display boards. Current practises regarding <b>touch</b> <b>time</b> measurements for welding and drilling were validated. By undertaking these recommendations, it was felt that HEV would continue to be wepositioned to capture the predicted ongoing growth in the mining market in which they currently operate, and to fully benefit from the future upturn in the energy market.
