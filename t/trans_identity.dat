40|$|This paper argues {{through a}} textual and contextual {{analysis}} of the first trans character in the Flemish soap opera Thuis that in Flanders, <b>trans</b> <b>identities</b> and practices are rendered intelligible trough inherently homogenizing and normative discourses. While these identities and practices are diverse by definition, this research shows that only a very specific configuration of them is validated and privileged – such as post-op transwomen – while all others – like transmen and genderqueer identities – are symbolically annihilated. Specifically, discourses on <b>trans</b> <b>identities</b> subscribe to hegemonic conceptions of gender, prescribing a full surgical transition from one monolithic gender to the other, while denying {{the possibility of a}} radically subversive queer space in between. This gender conformity is further enforced by the construction of physical beauty as the defining feature of a successful transition, and the representation of <b>trans</b> <b>identities</b> as simply “longing to be on the other side. ” Finally, the apparent positive representation of <b>trans</b> <b>identities</b> collide with articulations of homonationalism – or transnationalism – that construct Flanders as a safe space for transpeople, while relegating all internal instances of transphobic violence to ethnic-cultural minorities...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between feminist praxis and trans subjectivities within and beyond academe {{is fraught with}} tensions. Since the early 1990 s, “trans studies ” has emerged as an independent interdisciplinary field through critical engagements with theories of sex, gender and sexuality developed by women’s studies and queer theory. Initially, trans intellectuals sought to counter radical feminist assertions, {{such as those of}} Janice Raymond (1994) that trans individuals were dupes of the system whose expressions of hyper-normative femininity and masculinity buttressed patriarchy (Stone 2006; Stryker 2006). To do so, much emphasis was placed on celebratory descriptions of <b>trans</b> <b>identities</b> existing in spite of the rigid sex/gender binary. Recently, the focus of trans commentary has shifted towards problematizing <b>trans</b> <b>identities</b> in terms of their emergence out of systemic power relations that privilege heteronormative masculinities, femininities, whiteness, nationalism and citizenship status, as well as middle class professionals (Spade 2006; Feinberg 2006).

40|$|An {{investigation}} of late twentieth-century transsexual and transgendered narratives, this thesis considers {{the role of}} embodiment {{in the development of}} <b>trans</b> <b>identities.</b> Because transsexuals and transgendered people do not adhere to the hegemonic sex/gender binary, they allow a critical view of subjectivity as they challenge essentializing accounts of identity, insisting instead that the self can continually change and unfold throughout one's lifespan. A comparison is made between written, autobiographical accounts of transsexual and transgendered subjectivities and photographic ones, in an attempt to understand how different media articulate trans struggles with the body. Through an analysis of Kate Bornstein's Gender Outlaw and Leslie Feinberg's Stone Butch Blues, two autobiographical texts, the first chapter examines the relationship between embodiment, gender identity and sexual desire. In exploring a textual mode of self-representation, the chapter attempts to understand how language impedes an articulation of trans bodies and sexual desires but also offers the potential for these emerging identities to be named. In the second chapter, two photographic works are analyzed [...] Loren Cameron's Body Alchemy: Transsexual Portraits and Del LaGrace Volcano's Sublime Mutations. These texts are used to consider how photography differs from writing in its presentation of trans embodiment, specifically because photography is credited with revealing the "real" and is capable of showing bodies that cannot be named. The potential for bodies to be transformed via sex-reassignment surgery and other types of body modifications is also discussed in relation to the forging of <b>trans</b> <b>identities...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{confluence}} of <b>trans</b> <b>identity</b> and sexuality drawing {{on the concept of}} translocational positionality. In this discussion, a broad spectrum of gendered positionalities incorporates <b>trans</b> <b>identity</b> which, in turn, acknowledges normative male and female identities as well as non-binary ones. It is also recognised, however, that <b>trans</b> <b>identity</b> overlaps with other positionalities (pertaining to sexuality, for example) to shape social location. In seeking to understand subject positions, a translocational lens acknowledges the contextuality and temporality of social categories to offer an analysis which recognises the overlaps and differentials of co-existing positionalities. This approach enables an analysis which explores how macro, or structural, contexts shape agency (at the micro-level) and also how both are mediated by trans people's multiple and shifting positionalities. In this framing, positionality represents a meso layer between structure and agency. Four case studies are presented using data from a qualitative study which explored trans people's experiences of family, intimacy and domestic abuse. We offer an original contribution to the emerging knowledge-base on trans sexuality by presenting data from four case studies. We do so whilst innovatively applying the conceptual lens of translocational positionality to an analysis which considers macro, meso and micro levels of influence...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the processes of}} gender role transition and sex reassignment {{from the perspectives of}} psychology, medicine, and sociology. Its main focus is on the various aspects influencing the psyche of a person undertaking transition. The thesis investigates why <b>trans</b> <b>identity</b> is commonly viewed as a pathology and the impact of pathologization on the self-perception of trans people. Furthemore, the traditional outline of the transition process in Czech sexology is compared to some current international approaches. A section of the text addresses psychotherapy as a key factor in transition. A significant component of the thesis is that it takes a sociocultural viewpoint on gender identity and gender roles. One of the goals is to understand how medical experts dealing with <b>trans</b> <b>identity</b> conceptualize transition and how trans people themselves conceptualize it. The overall aim is to investigate how both of these sides influence each other and what psychological aspects enter the processes of gender role transition and sex reassignment.

40|$|Sexual {{minorities}} are a hidden population who are difficult for social researchers to analyze well. One specific group of sexual minorities, the transgender population, {{and how they}} understand their sometimes changing identities, may be especially complex to study. Not only is this sometimes a hidden population, but they may only identify as transgender at certain points in the life course, preferring other identity categories at different life stages and in different circumstances. I use the shortened term "trans" to refer to all members of what the hegemonic gendered order would consider gender non-conforming. Using the overarching sociological concepts of social constructionism and classification and drawing on a life course perspective, this dissertation explores how the self-identity {{of members of the}} trans community might shift across the life course. The goal then is to better understand <b>trans</b> <b>identity</b> awareness and developments across the life course in order to make better sense of existing survey data as well as to improve future questions related to <b>trans</b> <b>identity.</b> Analysis for this dissertation drew upon data collected from 139 in-depth cognitive interviews in both English and Spanish from a project related to testing a new sexual identity question for the National Health Interview Survey conducted by the Questionnaire Design Research Laboratory at the National Center for Health Statistics to explore how survey wording affects what researchers know, or think they know, about sexual identity distribution, particularly as it relates to <b>trans</b> <b>identity.</b> It also drew upon data collected from 10 in-depth qualitative interviews done with members of the trans community in order to explore how an understanding of the trans life course enables us to make better sense {{of the ways in which}} this group identifies on official surveys.

40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has seen the}} {{expansion}} of <b>trans</b> <b>identities</b> that are gender queer, non-binary, androgynous, or multiply-sexed and gendered in Western Europe. These developments mark a shift from a uniformly gender-binaried system to one that encompasses some degree of gender pluralism, as reflected to an extent in policy changes in some European countries. However, gender binarism is still prevalent. This article uses the case of Norway to demonstrate a contrast between the citizenship statuses afforded to transsexual men and women, {{and the lack of}} citizenship rights that people with non-binary identities, and other gender-variant people who are not diagnosed as transsexual, face. The article addresses the historical role of the Norwegian state in perpetuating gender binaries, in key areas such as identity recognition.

Thus, the thesis intends to contribute both empirically and analytically to the research field of gender and sexuality, trans and sex work research in particular, considering the following questions: 	How do trans stories and story telling work to reproduce and problematize heteronormativity, and influence subject formation? In which ways do they invoke a temporality of a present and a future? What do the stories tell us about which bodies matter? 	In which ways do Hawaiian trans sex work reproduce and problematize stereotypes of sex work and sex workers? How does the sex worker identity interact with the <b>trans</b> <b>identity,</b> and how do other types of work come into play? How are non- normative bodies like the trans sex worker body sanctioned by society and state institutions? 	How do Hawaiian trans sex workers navigate the complications inherent in passing? How does the discourse of heteronormativity affect self-perception and produce particular notions of gender amongst trans sex workers? In which ways do gender norms regulate the trans body {{into the role of}} the freak? In which ways is passing, i. e., the quest for womanhood, both a threat to the well being of trans sex workers, and concomitantly an indispensible necessity for their survival...|$|E

D.), Department of Higher Education, Washington State UniversityThis {{research}} study examines transgender (<b>trans)</b> <b>identity,</b> {{how it is}} manifested in trans students, the college and university experiences of these individuals, and how organizational systems hinder, enhance, expand, and redefine trans student success. This study provides {{a greater understanding of}} a population that is often misunderstood by fellow students, university administrators, faculty, and staff. Literature and research about trans students are extremely limited within higher education, and knowledge is needed to understand how to better serve trans students as members of the campus community. This study provides insight into how trans students make sense of their gender identity and how it influences all other aspects of their lives. Additionally, it offers guidance for better ways to serve contemporary trans students on campuses today with a sense of inclusion and welcome. The study is based on eighteen interviews with trans students from across the country. A poststructural feminist theoretical framework guides this study and explores the following themes: Language, subjectivity and the personal daily experience, social processes, institutions, gender differences in organizational structures, and power. As a result of these interviews, knowledge of <b>trans</b> <b>identity</b> is expanded to include more diverse variations of presentation and definition, an understanding of the negative impacts of binary and hetero normative thinking and doing, and the celebration of socially constructed representations of fluid gender, sexuality and sex. This research captures the complex, provocative nature of gender non conforming identities and specifically recognizes ways that higher education can improve the trans student experience.

40|$|Depois dos estudos das masculinidades, não é possível pensar a produção das identidades de gênero sem referenciá-las ao caráter relacional. Esta mudança deveu-se à incorporação da perspectiva relacional nesse campo de estudos e à crítica ao conceito de gênero assentado em uma suposta natureza feminina e masculina para construir as interpretações sobre o lugar dos corpos da ordem de gênero. Os objetivos desse artigo são: 1) apontar como um determinado conceito de gênero pode visibilizar múltiplas expressões de gênero, a exemplo das identidades trans (transexuais, travestis, cross dress, drag queen, drag king, transgêneros) ou invisibilizá-las e contribuir para sua patologização. O segundo objetivo será apresentar narrativas de homens trans e de mulheres trans, que nos contarão suas vivências sexuais. Os saberes médicos-psi advogam a inexistência de sexualidade em seus corpos, sendo este um dos indicadores para produção do diagnóstico de transexua­lidade. Tentarei argumentar que a base teórica que sustenta a patologização das identidades trans e a afirmação que as pessoas trans são assexuadas tem como fundamento uma concepção que atrela e condiciona as identidades de gênero às estruturas biológicas. In the {{aftermath}} of studies on masculinity, {{it is impossible to}} consider the production of gender identities without linking them to the relationship aspect. This change was due to the incorporation of the relationship perspective in this field of study and criticism of the concept of gender founded upon an alleged concept of femininity and masculinity to create interpretations of the place of bodies in the gender order. The objectives of this paper are: 1) to show how a given concept of gender can render multiple expressions of gender visible, like the <b>trans</b> <b>identities</b> (transsexuals, transvestites, cross dressers, drag queens, drag kings, transgenders) or sublimate them and contribute to their pathologization. The second objective will be to present narratives of trans men and trans women, who will tell us about their sexual experiences. Psycho-physicians contend the non-existence of sexuality in their bodies as being one of the indicators to lead to a diagnosis of transsexualism. I will attempt to argue that the theoretical basis that supports the pathologization of <b>trans</b> <b>identities</b> and the assertion that trans people are asexual is based on a conception that links and renders gender identities conditional upon biological structures...|$|R
