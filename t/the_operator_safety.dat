40|$|Early {{concerns}} over the handling of toxic materials related primarily {{to the safety of}} <b>the</b> <b>operator.</b> <b>Safety</b> procedures relating to prevention of ingestion, inhalation and skin contact, have been developed and in the field of CVD processing, many good standard practices are being used. Frequently, the safety procedures adopted for dealing with toxic gases and fumes rely on dilution in a forced air extraction enclosure to a level which under normal operating conditions reduce the toxic gas concentration to levels below the maximum exposure limit (MEL). Today, however, much more attention is being paid to the environmental issues and simply to dilute toxic fumes is no longer considered an acceptable practice. Handling of liquid and solid toxic waste products also poses concerns regarding final safe disposal, and the techniques employed as part of the CVD process for removal of toxic waste will impact significantly on this. This paper considers the issues involved in handling of toxic gases and particularly techniques for scrubbing gas effluent. The types of scrubber commonly used will be discussed and the results reported on two types of commercially available scrubbers that have been used on MOCVD systems in our laboratories. In addition we will consider the opportunities for replacing some of the highly toxic gases with less hazardous materials and report on current progress with substitutes for arsine and phosphine. Finally we will propose some general principles for reviewing and defining procedures for safe handling of waste gases...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} results of some spray {{application}} trials carried out in two tomato greenhouses to assess foliar deposition, ground losses, and dermal operator exposure when using hand-held highpressure spray lances. Two operating ways (forward vs. backwards operator movement) and two different plant vegetative stages (pre-production vs. full development) were taken into consideration. An experimental design with one factor (the operator walking direction) was adopted, arranged according to a randomised block design with three replicates. Volume application rates were settled according to the plant development: 900 L/ha in pre-production stage and 1800 L/ha at full development stage. The results showed {{no statistically significant differences}} in the mean foliar deposition between the two walking directions in both development stages. The greatest differences among the sampling locations were observed in pre-production stage, when, due to the spraying technique (spray jet directed from top to bottom), the foliar deposits in the low part of the canopy were much lower than those in the middle and high part. Also ground losses were unaffected by walking direction: they ranged on average from 14. 3 % to 23. 5 % of the applied volume rate. Finally, the dermal operator exposure was greatly affected by walking direction: at full development stage, it was 8 times higher walking forward than walking backwards. So, this simple change in field practice can noticeably improve <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> <b>safety,</b> without penalising working capacity and quality of deposition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Electrical {{equipment}} poses {{a danger}} to maintenance personnel when the equipment must be serviced energized. While de-energized maintenance is preferred, for some tests, doing so will not provide the needed performance data to validate important performance metrics of the equipment. In particular, sites with a high cost of downtime (health care centers, data centers, continuous process manufacturing, etc.) identifying a problem that could affect series integrity of conductors (continuity) of service is critical. The infrared thermal imaging test is a common method of inferring the resistance of a connection by measuring the temperature of a component, and when normalized to current flow, {{can be used as}} a proxy for the effective resistance of the current path. Deviations from historical ratios of temperature to current may indicate a change in the junction resistance. The problem is that IR cameras require line-of-sight visibility with the energized electrical component to be tested. Many times due to available fault currents, fault clearing times and/or voltage levels, this cannot be done from a far enough distance to afford <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> <b>safety</b> even when wearing the maximum available PPE (personal protective equipment). The challenge has been how to perform this measurement safely and accurately, but still recognize that capital (for specialized test equipment) and expenses (for labor to perform testing) are frequently limited. Therefore, having a method of performing these tests throughout a facility, ideally performed from a central location while not requiring specialized equipment (leveraging the already installed IEDs [intelligent electronic devices]), would be a valuable solution. This research discovered a solution that reads low-resolution data from legacy IEDs but processes it to improve resolution to a point where ultimately it can be used to measure junction-to-junction impedances to sufficient resolution to detect failing connections. The research outlines the statistical analysis, filter design and conductor temperature normalization algorithms necessary to achieve this goal...|$|E

40|$|The {{aviation}} {{and space}} domains have safety guidelines and recommended practices for Design Organisations (DOs) and Operators alike. In terms of Aerospace DOs there are certification criteria {{to meet and}} to demonstrate compliance there are Advisory Circulars or Acceptable Means of Compliance to follow. Additionally there are guidelines such as Aerospace Recommended Practices (ARP), Military Standards (MIL-STD 882 series) and System Safety Handbooks to follow {{in order to identify}} and manage failure conditions. In terms of Operators there are FAA guidelines and a useful ARP that details many tools and techniques in understanding Operator Safety Risks. However there is currently no methodology for linking the DO and Operator safety efforts. In the space domain NASA have provided safety standards and guidelines to follow and also within Europe there are European Co-operation of Space Standardization (ECSS) to follow. Within the emerging Commercial Human Spaceflight Industry, the FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation has provided hazard analysis guidelines. However all of these space domain safety documents are based on the existing aerospace methodology and once again, there is no link between the DO and Operator’s safety effort. This paper addresses the problematic issue and presents a coherent methodology of joining up the System Safety effort of the DOs to <b>the</b> <b>Operator</b> <b>Safety</b> Risk Management such that a ‘Total System’ approach is adopted. Part of the rationale is that the correct mitigation (control) can be applied within the correct place in the accident sequence. Also this contiguous approach ensures that the Operator is fully aware of the safety risks (at the accident level) and therefore has an appreciation of the Total System Risk. The authors of this paper contend that it is better practice to have a fully integrated safety model as opposed to disparate requirements or guidelines. Our methodology is firstly to review ‘best practice’ approaches from the aviation and space industries, and then to integrate these approaches into a contiguous safety model for the commercial human spaceflight industry...|$|E
40|$|Existing date {{harvesting}} machines are {{vehicles equipped with}} a long arm to lift {{a man on a}} platform to harvest the fruits. The arm and the vehicle are heavy (4 to 8 tonnes), expensive (from £ 16 000) and are not sufficiently manoeuvrable in constricted date groves. Most dates in the main producing countries, including Iran, are therefore harvested manually. The manual method is unsafe, slow, expensive (£ 0. 63 per tree) and the fruit quality is often damaged. A light, weight 4 wheel drive, remotely controlled tree climbing machine is, therefore, a potential solution to the problems of harvesting and servicing (such as pollinating and pruning). A prototype of such a device was designed, developed and evaluated under laboratory conditions. To determine the operating characteristics and feasibility the machine was designed to climb the tree using pneumatic tyres as traction wheels. The machine can be transformed to ground drive and move between trees under its own power. This approach reduces the machine weight, cost and size because the tree trunk is used as a support for the machine to climb to the fruits. It is operated and controlled from the ground which improves <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> <b>safety.</b> A vertical traction theory for this type of machine has been developed based on the tree size and surface characteristics and machine size and weight which can be used to design date harvesting and climbing machines with different capacities. The test results showed that the experimental machine could achieve a tractive efficiency of 90 % and that the optimum wheel slippage was between 10 - 15 %. The machine consumes a maximum of 1. 4 kW power which is only 3 % of the power requirement of existing systems. The machine weight is 150 kg which is 2 - 4 % of the existing systems' weight. It is capable of climbing the tree at a maximum speed of 0. 27 m/s although the optimum speed is 0. 17 m/s for best control. The prototype can carry a payload of 100 kg of dates and, considering a field efficiency of 75 %, it can potentially harvest a tree in 22 minutes which is 18 % faster than the manual system in Iran and 6 % faster than one of the mechanised systems used in Saudi Arabia. The harvester can work on tree diameter ranges from 300 to 850 mm and can pass over the tree leaf bases of 41 mm high. The machine should not damage the tree because the tree resists the machine stresses with a minimum safety factor of 7. An economic analysis showed that it can be manufactured in Iran at 20 % of the cost of existing systems. The machine cost per tree is equal to the hand harvesting method (£O. 63 per tree) for Iranian farmers if it harvests 978 trees per year...|$|E
40|$|Suborbital flights {{will soon}} take flight {{as a viable}} {{commercial}} operation. Operators such as Virgin Galactic, along with their designer Scaled Composites, {{will be responsible for}} safety of the flight crew, Spaceflight Participants and indeed the uninvolved public beneath their flight trajectories. Within the United States, the Federal Aviation Authority’s Office of Commercial Transportation (FAA-AST) has provided Launch License Regulations and Guidelines for prospective design organisations and operators alike. The aim of this thesis is to analyse suborbital spaceflight approaches to safety management and to determine whether effective safety management is being or could be applied to influence vehicle design and subsequent operation. The thesis provides a review of current safety-related information on suborbital spaceflight, existing space safety information and also existing aviation safety information. The findings of the review concern two main areas; firstly that a gap exists within suborbital safety management criteria, and secondly that a gap exists in existing aviation-based safety guidelines. In the first case, the research concluded that FAA-AST safety management criteria did not present sufficiently explicit and rationalised guidelines for this new industry. Indeed, the thesis argues that the scope of the FAA-AST regulations (covering both orbital and suborbital aspects) is too broad, and that regulations and guidelines should be split into distinct orbital and suborbital sections so as to provide more effective directives. In Europe, no such regulations or guidelines exist as there has until now been no requirement (a ‘customer’) for the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to implement such a framework. This thesis sought to address this gap by using a safety tool (Goal Structuring Notation) to construct a goal-based regulatory approach, which was included in a draft EASA suborbital Policy. Secondly, the main significant finding of this research is that a gap (literally) exists between current aviation-based design organisation safety guidelines and operator safety risk management guidelines. This absence of communication means operators are not managing their safety risks as effectively as they could. The thesis argues that the suborbital domain should take heed, as most vehicles are based on aircraft designs and therefore suborbital operators will, no doubt, apply ‘best practice’ either from the aviation or commercial space domains. Neither is appropriate or effective. As a result of the main finding a contiguous safety model has been developed which employs a ‘key (platform) hazard’ to join the design organisation analysis to <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> <b>safety</b> risk management, therefore completing an explicit sequence from the initiating causal event to the accident. The model is demonstrated using case studies from space disasters (Space Shuttle) and also from aviation accidents (Air France flight AF 447); the model details the explicit accident sequence and shows missing or failed controls leading up to the accident. The research enabled models to be constructed and also proposed additional and explicit guidelines for the suborbital industry such as medical and training standards and separate safety criteria for vertical launch vehicles; these are included as recommendations and need to be ratified by recognised bodies such as the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety’s Suborbital Space Safety Technical Committee for inclusion in their Space Safety Standards Manual. In the latter case these recommendations are already agenda items for the Technical Committee to address. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} complexity of controlling Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), researchers {{have been trying to}} let automation take part of the UAV control in order to eliminate human error and reduce the workload of <b>the</b> <b>operator.</b> Such a system has been developed for UAV teleoperators which incorporates haptic feedback on the control stick based on a Collision Avoidance System (CAS). When nearing obstacles, <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> gets redirected by the haptic feedback and so avoiding a possible collision.

40|$|In tele-operating an UAV human {{operators}} fully rely on {{cameras to}} control the vehicle from a distance. To increase operator situation awareness and reduce workload, a haptic feedback on the control stick has been developed which acts as an automatic collision avoidance system. A virtual force field surrounding the moving vehicle interacts with obstacles surrounding it, yielding repulsive forces on the stick that lead the vehicle away from them. Albeit successful in significantly {{reducing the number of}} collisions, the haptic interface received low user acceptance ratings. Operators do not always fully understand the collision avoidance automation intentions, and they experience the haptic forces as intrusive.

The tubular magazine does allow easy [...] "topping off" [...] (a tube-fed pump shotgun can be kept shouldered and aimed at a target and ready to fire while being loaded), so training emphasizes the need to load the magazine to full capacity whenever the opportunity presents itself.

The usually used simultaneous reflow soldering processes were optimized in the past for a minimum of temperature difference between small and large or heavy components. A further development of soldering processes is demanded because of the increasing requirements for polymer electronics, electrical-optical assemblies or high temperature electronics. The technology developed should allow a direct heating of the solder paste while the components are at a considerably lower temperature. This is possible only by sequentially working selective soldering processes at present. The selective heating method for a simultaneous process presented here is possible using microwaves provided the energy penetrates the assembly and heats certain regions only, depending on specific material characteristics. Today?s conventional solder pastes are already able to be heated with microwave, but only very slowly and using a high power density. It is possible to increase the absorbed heat considerably by mixing additional materials referred to as suszeptors into the solder paste which are absorbing microwave power.

This paper describes a test stand for the laboratory testing of conveyor idlers, under the influence of different radial loads, which was developed by the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Belgrade. Data acquisition and processing are also considered, which includes control, monitoring and automatisation of the test stand. Machine protective systems, which ensure a high level of machine safety, were specifically redesigned due to <b>the</b> importance of <b>operator</b> <b>safety</b> and health...|$|R
40|$|Robotic wheelchairs are an {{excellent}} example of tight coupling between the desires of <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> and <b>the</b> automated navigation system of a robot. One of the primary challenges of such a system is to have the chair follow the navigational desires of <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> while maintaining <b>safety.</b> Often, in crowded situations, the automated system will halt movement, or redirect the chair against the operatorÕs desires. In these cases <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> usually has to execute a manual override Ð temporarily disabling the automated safety features of the robot. This paper explores two alternatives. The first is an autonomy dial, where <b>the</b> <b>operator</b> can move along a spectrum of manual to autonomously guided movement. The second is a system for autonomously deciding when to switch to manual control i. e., having the autonomous system recognize when it is stuck and needs assistance...|$|R
40|$|Bounded Model Checking (BMC) {{has played}} an im-portant role in {{verification}} of software, embedded sys-tems and protocols. The idea of BMC is to encode Fi-nite State Machine (FSM) and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) verification specification into satisfiability (SAT) instances, {{and then to}} search for a counterexample via various SAT tools. Improving encoding technology of BMC can generate a SAT instance easy to solve, and therefore is essential to improve the efficiency of BMC. In this paper, we improve the encoding of BMC by combining the characteristic of FSM state transition and semantics of LTL, get a simple and efficient recur-sion formula which is useful to efficiently generate SAT instances. We present an efficient algorithm to encode <b>the</b> modal <b>operator</b> (<b>safety</b> formula) in BMC. The ex-periments for comparative analysis shows that this encoding algorithm is more powerful than the existing two mainstream encoding algorithms in both the scale of generated SAT instances and the solving efficiency. The methodology presented in this paper is also valuable for optimization of other modal operator encodings in BMC. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Black Knight {{is capable}} of being used {{off-road}} meaning that it go through any type of terrain such as rocks or water. The vehicle is used in military tests that allows Soldiers {{to figure out the}} major roles of the tank in order to use it in a more advanced military force. Because of its autonomous and semi-autonomous (being able to control itself and be controlled by someone else) components this helps operators plan an efficient plan of attack as well as avoiding obstacles while finding its way from point A to point B. It also consists of three modules: <b>the</b> Robotics <b>Operator,</b> <b>the</b> Mission Commander, and the Safety Officer each serving their own purpose. The Black Knight is basically operated through <b>the</b> Robotics <b>Operator</b> Control Station (ROCS) which is inside an armed vehicle. Meaning that it controls the remote and autonomous operations while the Mission Commander has the task of reading the data and then transferring it to the whole system allowing it to better direct <b>the</b> robotics <b>operator.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Safety</b> Officer controls the remote hand controller which is used when there's an unsafe situation and an emergency stop command is needed. Its main role is to insure the safety of those around the vehicle and after each task, it needs to be remotely parked in a certain location like a garage or onto a truck.|$|R
40|$|The risk to {{run into}} a Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorder (WMSD) is very high when {{operating}} in the primary sector. As {{a matter of fact}} the professional illnesses related to the WMSD in Italy are increasing. Nowadays the assessment of the WMSD in the primary sector is performed mainly in the agricultural sector, considering different agronomical activities; for the forestry sector, only few documents reported an ergonomic evaluation. The lack of available information on this topic in the forestry sector, as well as the similarity with the agricultural sector, drives the interest to the assessment of the conditions that expose workers to WMSD risks in forestry operations. Four different assessment approaches were applied in this study. These tools permitted to classify which are the exposures and if there is the presence of WMSD risk for forest <b>operators.</b> <b>The</b> approaches are respectively the OCRA checklist and the RNLE equation, both recognized as ISO standards, as well as OWAS and REBA, recommended by ISO standards. The first approach focusses on the risk due to repetitive and stressed movements, while the second evaluates the risk of injures due to the manual movement of loads. Meanwhile OWAS and REBA detect the possibility of injures due to wrong postures during the work. These approaches were applied for the cutting operations with chainsaw. Since the evaluation requires high levels of attention and also because it was necessary to gain a good level of safety for the surveyor, a digital camera was used to film the operative activities. Then, the movies were analysed in office. Aim of the research is to analyse if it is possible to apply the approaches suggested by ISO standards in order to assess the most dangerous activities that, when not properly carried out, could be the cause of WMSD in forestry operations. The study showed that during the use of the chainsaw the index of risk of professional injures was overpassed several times, compromising <b>the</b> <b>operator’s</b> <b>safety...</b>|$|R
