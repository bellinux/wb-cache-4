40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of Helicobactor pylori (H. pylori) {{infection}} and drug therapy on functional dyspepsia (FD) symptoms and gastrointes-tinal eosinophil count. In this study, 215 continuous FD patients fulfilling Rome criteria were enrolled. The patients were divided into a H. pylori-positive group and a H. pylori-negative group. The H. pylori-positive group was divided into H. pylori-eradicated and H. pylori-uneradicated groups following H. pylori-eradication treatment, and the H. pylori-negative group was randomly divided into esome-prazole and <b>teprenone</b> treatment groups. The symptom scores of the esomeprazole group were significantly lower compared with those of the <b>teprenone</b> group at week 6 but not at baseline and week 2. Compared with the H. pylori-uneradicated group, eosinophil counts in the antrum and body were significantly reduced in the H. pylori-eradicated group at week 6. The number of gastric eosinophil clusters was significantly higher in the H. pylori-positive group than in the H. pylori-negative group. Eradication was associated with gastric eosinophil counts but did not affect duodenal eosinophil levels. Neither esomeprazole nor <b>teprenone</b> treatments reduced eosinophil levels in the stomach and duodenum of H. pylori-negative patients...|$|E
40|$|When rats {{were given}} a supramaximal dose of caerulein (infused {{intravenously}} at 5 Ilg/kg. h for 4 h) they developed acute pancreatitis characterized by significantly raised amylase levels in the blood. In this model of acute pancreatitis, reduced gastric adenylate energy charge levels were observed, and the leakage of the lysosomal enzyme, cathepsin B, from gastric lysosomes and of the mitochondrial enzyme, malate dehydrogenase, from gastric mitochondria were both significantly accelerated compared with the control group. The intragastric administration of the anti-ulcer agent, <b>teprenone,</b> at a dose of 5 mg/kg (twice before caerulein infusion) significantly inhibited this gastric damage accompanying acute pancreatitis. These results suggest that gastric subcellular organelle fragility may {{play an important role}} in the pathogenesis of impaired gastric energy metabolism accompanying acute pancreatitis, and indicate the possible usefulness of <b>teprenone</b> in preventing this gastric damage...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe goal of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} whether the blockade of histamine H 2 receptors is beneficial for the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure (CHF). BackgroundBecause CHF {{is one of the major}} life-threatening diseases, we need to find a novel effective therapy. Intriguingly, our previous study, which predicts the involvement of histamine in CHF, suggests that we should test this hypothesis in patients with CHF. MethodsWe selected 159 patients who received famotidine among symptomatic CHF patients for the retrospective study. We blindly selected age- and gender-matched CHF patients receiving drugs for gastritis other than histamine H 2 receptor blockers as a control group. For the prospective study, 50 symptomatic CHF patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group received famotidine of 30 mg/day for 6 months, and the other group received <b>teprenone.</b> ResultsIn the retrospective study, famotidine of 20 to 40 mg decreased both left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic lengths (LVDd and LVDs, respectively) and the plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels (182 ± 21 vs. 259 ± 25 pg/ml, p < 0. 05) with unaltered fractional shortening (FS). In a randomized, open-label study, compared with <b>teprenone,</b> famotidine of 30 mg prospectively decreased both New York Heart Association functional class (p < 0. 05) and plasma BNP levels (183 ± 26 pg/ml vs. 285 ± 41 pg/ml, p < 0. 05); this corresponded to decreasing both LVDd (57 ± 2 mm vs. 64 ± 2 mm, p < 0. 05) and LVDs (47 ± 2 mm vs. 55 ± 2 mm, p < 0. 05) with unaltered FS (15 ± 1 % vs. 17 ± 1 %). The frequency of readmission because of worsening of CHF was lower in the famotidine group (4 % and 24 %, p < 0. 05). On the other hand, <b>teprenone</b> had no effects on CHF. ConclusionsFamotidine improved both cardiac symptoms and ventricular remodeling associated with CHF. Histamine H 2 receptor blockers may have therapeutic benefits for CHF...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In Japan, {{treatment}} {{guidelines are}} lacking {{for patients with}} upper gastrointestinal symptoms. We aimed to compare the efficacy of different drugs {{for the treatment of}} uninvestigated upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods This was a randomized, open-label, parallel-group multicenter study. Helicobacter pylori -negative, endoscopically uninvestigated patients[*]≥[*] 20 [*]years of age with upper gastrointestinal symptoms of at least moderate severity (Global Overall Symptom score [GOS][*]≥[*] 4 on a 7 -point Likert scale) were randomized to treatment with omeprazole (10 [*]mg once daily), famotidine (10 [*]mg twice daily), mosapride (5 [*]mg three times daily) or <b>teprenone</b> (50 [*]mg three times daily). The primary endpoint was sufficient relief of upper gastrointestinal symptoms after 4 [*]weeks of treatment (GOS[*]≤[*] 2). UMIN clinical trial registration number: UMIN 000005399. Results Of 471 randomized patients, 454 were included in the full analysis set. After 4 [*]weeks of treatment, sufficient symptom relief was achieved by 66. 9 % of patients in the omeprazole group, compared with 41. 0 %, 36. 3 % and 32. 3 % in the famotidine, mosapride and <b>teprenone</b> groups, respectively (all, p[*] Conclusions The favorable efficacy and safety profiles of omeprazole in relieving uninvestigated upper gastrointestinal symptoms support its use as first-line treatment in this patient group in Japan. Patients who show no improvement in symptoms despite PPI use, and those with alarm symptoms (such as vomiting, GI bleeding or acute weight loss) should receive further investigation, including prompt referral for endoscopy.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} prescribing {{pattern in}} low-dose aspirin users and physician awareness of preventing aspirin-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury with combined protective medications. METHODS: A retrospective drug utilization {{study was conducted}} in the 2 nd Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University. The hospital has 2300 beds and 2. 5 million outpatient visits annually. Data mining was performed on all aspirin prescriptions for outpatients and emergency patients admitted in 2011. Concomitant use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine 2 -receptor antagonists (H 2 RA) and mucoprotective drugs (MPs) were analyzed. A defined daily dose (DDD) methodology was applied to each MP. A further investigation was performed in aspirin users on combination use of GI injurious medicines [non-steoid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids and clopidogrel and warfarin] or intestinal protective drugs (misoprostol, rebamipide, <b>teprenone</b> and gefarnate). Data of major bleeding episodes were derived from medical records and adverse drug reaction monitoring records. The annual incidence of major GI bleeding due to low-dose aspirin was estimated for outpatients. RESULTS: Prescriptions for aspirin users receiving PPIs, H 2 RA and MPs (n = 1039) accounted for only 3. 46 % of total aspirin prescriptions (n = 30 015). The ratios of coadministration of aspirin/PPI, aspirin/H 2 RA, aspirin/MP and aspirin/PPI/MP to the total aspirin prescriptions were 2. 82 %, 0. 12 %, 0. 40 % and 0. 12 %, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed in age between patients not receiving any GI protective medications and patients receiving PPIs, H 2 RA or MPs. The combined medication of aspirin and PPI was used more frequently than that of aspirin and MPs (2. 82 % vs 0. 40 %, P <b>teprenone</b> > sucralfate oral suspension > L-glutamine and sodium gualenate granules > rebamipide > sucralfate chewable tablets. The ratio of MP plus aspirin prescriptions to the total MP prescriptions was as follows: rebamipide (0. 47 %), <b>teprenone</b> (0. 91 %), L-glutamine and sodium gualenate granules (0. 92 %), gefarnate (0. 31 %), hydrotalcite (1. 00 %) and sucralfate oral suspension (0. 13 %). Percentages of prescriptions containing aspirin and intestinal protective drugs among the total aspirin prescriptions were: rebamipide (0. 010 %), PPI/rebamipide (0. 027 %), <b>teprenone</b> (0. 11 %), PPI/teprenone (0. 037 %), gefarnate (0. 017 %), and PPI/gefarnate (0. 013 %). No prescriptions were found containing coadministration of aspirin and other NSAIDs. Among the 3196 prescriptions containing aspirin/clopidogrel, 3088 (96. 6 %) prescriptions did not contain any GI protective medicines. Of the 389 prescriptions containing aspirin/corticosteroids, 236 (60. 7 %) contained no GI protective medicines. None of the prescriptions using aspirin/warfarin (n = 22) contained GI protective medicines. Thirty-five patients were admitted to this hospital in 2011 because of acute hemorrhage of upper digestive tract induced by low-dose aspirin. The annual incidence rates of major GI bleeding were estimated at 0. 25 % for outpatients taking aspirin and 0. 5 % for outpatients taking aspirin/warfarin, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prescribing pattern of low-dose aspirin revealed a poor awareness of preventing GI injury with combined protective medications. Actions should be taken to address this issue...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus of three diterpenes, namely, geranylgeraniol, <b>teprenone,</b> and phytol, {{by using a}} broth dilution with shaking method to identify the effects of diterpenes with long aliphatic carbon chains. We also performed time-kill assays and measured the leakage of K+ ions from bacterial cells {{in response to these}} diterpenes. The diterpenes used inhibited the growth of S. aureus at concentrations of 0. 15 μg/ml, as determined by damage to the cell membranes, and had clear bactericidal activity. However, the inhibitory effects of the diterpenes decreased when the concentration of each was raised above a certain level. The diterpenes tested in this study appeared to have both growth-inhibitory and growth-accelerating effects, and the net effect of each depended on its concentration...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBeta cell injury due to {{oxidative}} stress {{is a typical}} etiology of diabetes caused by nutritional excess, but its precise mechanism remains largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the microtubule motor KIF 12 mediates an antioxidant cascade in beta cells as an intracellular target of excess fat intake or “lipotoxicity. ” KIF 12 knockout mice suffer from hypoinsulinemic glucose intolerance due to increased beta cell {{oxidative stress}}. Using this model, we identified an antioxidant signaling cascade involving KIF 12 as a scaffold for the transcription factor Sp 1.  The stabilization of nascent Sp 1 appeared to be essential for proper peroxisomal function by enhancing Hsc 70 expression, and the pharmacological induction of Hsc 70 expression with <b>teprenone</b> counteracted the oxidative stress. Because KIF 12 is transcriptionally downregulated by chronic exposure to fatty acids, this antioxidant cascade involving KIF 12 and Hsc 70 is proposed to be a critical target of nutritional excess in beta cells in diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Recently, some antiulcer {{agents have}} been {{reported}} to have antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori, which is highly associated with gastritis and peptic ulcers. In-vitro and in-vivo activity of plaunotol, a cytoprotective antiulcer agent, against H. pylori was investigated. Antibacterial activity of plaunotol against a standard strain (NCTC 11637) and 14 clinical isolates was compared with those of other cytoprotective antiulcer agents: benexate, sofalcone, <b>teprenone,</b> cetraxate, and gefarnate, by an agar dilution method. The MIC » and MIC » of plaunotol against 15 strains were 6. 25 and 12. 5 mg/L, respectively, making it the most potent of the cytoprotective antiulcer agents. The bactericidal effect of plaunotol was investigated using an in-vitro killing assay. Plaunotol at concentrations of more than 6 mg/L induced a rapid reduction of culture turbidity, with an extensive loss of viability, within 30 min. Observation by scanning electron microscopy revealed that plaunotol caused autolysis and treated cells were deformed. In-vivo activity of plaunotol against H. pylori was examined in a nude mouse gastritis model. Plaunotol significantly decreased the number of H. pylori in the stomach of nude mice. In addition, the antiulcer agent enhanced the antibacterial activity of amoxycillin or clarithromycin in the infection model...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{study of}} {{combination}} of H₂ blocker and cytoprotective agents and H₂ blocker alone in maintenance therapy was　performed to evaluate its efficacy {{in the prevention}} of the recurrence of gastric ulcer. For the purpose, 136 patients with endoscopically confirmed gastric or gastroduodenal ulcer were treated with one year maintenance by these drugs after healing. In the maintenance therapy, patients were divided into two groups : Group H (patients who were administered one of the H₂ blockers alone; cimetidine 400 mg, ranitidine 150 mg or famotidine 20 mg nocte) and Group HC (patients being treated with one of the H₂ blockers and one of the cytoprotective agents; sucralfate 1 g, <b>teprenone</b> 50 mg or aldioxa 100 mg 3 times a day in a combination regimen). During the maintenance therapy, the lesions were observed every 3 months by endoscopy to check for recurrence and for the stage of ulcer scar for one year. 1) Cumulative recurrence-free rate of Group HC was about 10 % higher than that of Group H during 12 months of maintenance therapy. 2) In gastroduodenal ulcer patients, recurrence-free rate of Group HC was significantly higher than that of Group H (p＜ 0. 01). 3) In patients who had recurrent ulcer and who had ulcer that was healed within 3 months after treatment, the recurrence-free rate of Group HC tended to be higher than that of Group H. 4) In these two groups, the recurrence-free rate of white ulcer scar was significantly higher than that of red ulcer scar (p＜ 0. 05). It is concluded that the maintenance therapy of combination regimen is more effective than that of H₂ blocker alone and red ulcer scar is more likely to recur than white ulcer scar in spite of the combination maintenance therapy. This fact suggests that maintenance therapy should be continued carefully until white ulcer scar is confirmed...|$|E
