The ten genera (two genera of Table 3 are subsumed {{into other}} genera) of the Lilioideae {{subfamily}} are characterised by contractile bulbs and roots and a megagametophyte (embryo-sac) of the Fritillaria-type with four megaspores.

Mitotic gene convertants were selected at two heteroallelic sites on the left arm of disomic chromosome III and tested for coincident chromosome loss. The principal results are: (1) Disomic chromosome loss is markedly enhanced (nearly 40 -fold) over basal levels among mitotic gene convertants selected to arise close to the centromere; no such enhancement is observed among convertants selected to arise relatively far from the centromere. (2) Chromosome loss is primarily associated with proximal allele conversion at the centromere-adjacent site, {{and many of these}} convertants are reciprocally recombined in the adjacent proximal interval. (3) Partial aneuploid exceptions provisionally identified as carrying left arm <b>telocentrics</b> have been found.

All but one species with 28 chromosomes show only metacentric or submetacentric chromosomes, whereas the species with 40 and 46 chromosomes display some <b>telocentrics</b> or subtelocentrics, that are probably derived from the former by centric fissions. However, since the number of major chromosome arms is strikingly higher in these latter species (NF = 70 and 78) than in the 28 -chromosome species (mostly NF = 56), other chromosomal rearrangements such as pericentric inversions or heterochromatin accretions could also be involved.

40|$|In many organisms, {{homologous}} pairing and synapsis {{depend on}} the meiotic recombination machinery that repairs double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) produced {{at the onset of}} meiosis. The culmination of recombination via crossover gives rise to chiasmata, which locate distally in many plant species such as rye, Secale cereale. Although, synapsis initiates close to the chromosome ends, a direct effect of regions with high crossover frequency on partner identification and synapsis initiation has not been demonstrated. Here, we analyze the dynamics of distal and proximal regions of a rye chromosome introgressed into wheat to define their role on meiotic homology search and synapsis. We have used lines with a pair of two-armed chromosome 1 R of rye, or a pair of <b>telocentrics</b> of its long arm (1 RL), which were homozygous for the standard 1 RL structure, homozygous for an inversion of 1 RL that changes chiasma location from distal to proximal, or heterozygous for the inversion. Physical mapping of recombination produced in the ditelocentric heterozygote (1 RL/ 1 RL(inv)) showed that 70 % of crossovers in the arm were confined to a terminal segment representing 10 % of the 1 RL length. The dynamics of the arms 1 RL and 1 RL(inv) during zygotene demonstrates that crossover-rich regions are more active in recognizing the homologous partner and developing synapsis than crossover-poor regions. When the crossover-rich regions are positioned in the vicinity of chromosome ends, their association is facilitated by telomere clustering; when they are positioned centrally in one of the two-armed chromosomes and distally in the homolog, their association is probably derived from chromosome elongation. On the other hand, chromosome movements that disassemble the bouquet may facilitate chromosome pairing correction by dissolution of improper chromosome associations. Taken together, these data support that repair of DSBs via crossover is essential in both the search of the homologous partner and consolidation of homologous synapsis...|$|R

The meiotic nuclear architecture depends on the chromosome characteristics and consequently is prone to modification by chromosomal rearrangements. In this work, we consider Mus domesticus spermatocytes with diploid chromosome number 2 n = 40, all <b>telocentric,</b> and investigate a possible modification of the ancestral nuclear architecture due {{to the emergence of}} derived Rb chromosomes, which may be present in the homozygous or heterozygous condition. Results: In the 2 n = 40 spermatocyte nuclei random associations mediated by pericentromeric heterochromatin among the 19 <b>telocentric</b> bivalents ocurr at the nuclear periphery. The observed frequency of associations among them, made distinguishable by specific probes and FISH, seems to be the same for pairs {{that may or may not}} form Rb chromosomes. In the homozygote Rb 2 n = 24 spermatocytes, associations also mediated by pericentromeric heterochromatin occur mainly between the three <b>telocentric</b> or the eight metacentric bivalents themselves. In heterozygote Rb 2 n = 32 spermatocytes all heterochromatin is localized at the nuclear periphery, yet associations are mainly observed among the three <b>telocentric</b> bivalents and between the asynaptic axes of the trivalents. Conclusions: The Rb chromosomes pose sharp restrictions for interactions in the 2 n = 24 and 2 n = 32 spermatocytes, as compared to the ample possibilities for interactions between bivalents in the 2 n = 40 spermatocytes. Undoubtedly the emergence of Rb chromosomes changes the ancestral nuclear {{architecture of}} 2 n = 40 spermatocytes since they establish new types of interactions among chromosomal domains, particularly through centromeric and heterochromatic regions at the nuclear periphery among <b>telocentric</b> and at the nuclear center among Rb metacentric ones.

40|$|Background: Dendropsophus is a {{monophyletic}} anuran genus with a {{diploid number}} of 30 chromosomes {{as an important}} synapomorphy. However, the internal phylogenetic relationships of this genus are poorly understood. Interestingly, an intriguing interspecific variation in the <b>telocentric</b> chromosome number has been useful in species identification. To address certain uncertainties related {{to one of the}} species groups of Dendropsophus, the D. microcephalus group, we carried out a cytogenetic analysis combined with phylogenetic inferences based on mitochondrial sequences, which aimed to aid in the analysis of chromosomal characters. Populations of Dendropsophus nanus, Dendropsophus walfordi, Dendropsophus sanborni, Dendropsophus jimi and Dendropsophus elianeae, ranging from the extreme south to the north of Brazil, were cytogenetically compared. A mitochondrial region of the ribosomal 12 S gene from these populations, as well as from 30 other species of Dendropsophus, was used for the phylogenetic inferences. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Results: The species D. nanus and D. walfordi exhibited identical karyotypes (2 n = 30; FN = 52), with four pairs of <b>telocentric</b> chromosomes and a NOR located on metacentric chromosome pair 13. In all of the phylogenetic hypotheses, the paraphyly of D. nanus and D. walfordi was inferred. D. sanborni from Botucatu-SP and Torres-RS showed the same karyotype as D. jimi, with 5 pairs of <b>telocentric</b> chromosomes (2 n = 30; FN = 50) and a terminal NOR in the long arm of the <b>telocentric</b> chromosome pair 12. Despite their karyotypic similarity, these species were not found to compose a monophyletic group. Finally, the phylogenetic and cytogenetic analyses did not cluster the specimens of D. elianeae according to their geographical occurrence or recognized morphotypes. Conclusions: We suggest that a taxonomic revision of the taxa D. nanus and D. walfordi is quite necessary. We also observe that the number of <b>telocentric</b> chromosomes is useful to distinguish among valid species in some cases, although it is unchanged in species that are not necessarily closely related phylogenetically. Therefore, inferences based on this chromosomal character must be made with caution; a proper evolutionary analysis of the karyotypic variation in Dendropsophus depends on further characterization of the <b>telocentric</b> chromosomes found in this group.
