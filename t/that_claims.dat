5|$|After Brokeback Mountain {{lost the}} Academy Award for Best Picture to Crash, many accused the Academy of {{homophobia}} and {{for making a}} non-groundbreaking choice, and commentators including Kenneth Turan and Nikki Finke derided the Academy's decision. However, Roger Ebert argued <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> of foul play were unjustified and that the better film won.|$|E
5|$|By morning, the UFO {{crash site}} has been sealed {{off by the}} government, who has put out a cover-story <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> a Taco Bell is being built. Douchebag visits Kupa Keep and learns that the Stick has again been stolen by the elves. Cartman and Kyle task Douchebag with {{recruiting}} the Goth kids for their respective sides, each claiming that the other has the Stick. Randy agrees to help Douchebag recruit the Goths after Douchebag infiltrates the crash site and discovers that government agents are plotting {{to blow up the}} town in order to destroy an alien goo released from the ship. The goo turns living creatures into Adolf Hitler-esque Nazi Zombies; an infected person escapes government containment, unleashing the virus on South Park.|$|E
5|$|Empiricist David Hume's {{requirement}} <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> about reality must {{be verified}} by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for {{a statement to}} hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued {{that he could not}} have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.|$|E

5|$|Exactly when Mellitus and {{his party}} arrived in England is unknown, but he was {{certainly}} in the country by 604, when Augustine consecrated him as bishop {{in the province of}} the East Saxons, making Mellitus the first Bishop of London after the Roman departure (London was the East Saxons' capital). The city was a logical choice for a new bishopric, as it was a hub for the southern road network. It was also a former Roman town; many of the Gregorian mission's efforts were centred in such locations. Before his consecration, Mellitus baptised Sæberht, Æthelberht's nephew, who then allowed the bishopric to be established. The episcopal church built in London was probably founded by Æthelberht, rather than Sæberht. Although Bede records that Æthelberht gave lands to support the new episcopate, a charter <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> to be a grant of lands from Æthelberht to Mellitus is a later forgery.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, a group <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> {{affiliation}} with Anonymous group, calling themselves as AnonSec, {{claimed to have}} hacked and gathered almost 276 GB of data from NASA servers including NASA flight and radar logs and videos, and also multiple documents related to ongoing research. AnonSec group also claimed gaining access of a Global Hawk Drone of NASA, and released some video footage purportedly from the drone's cameras. A part of the data was released by AnonSec on Pastebin service, as an Anon Zine. NASA has denied the hack, asserting that {{the control of the}} drones were never compromised, but has acknowledged that the photos released along with the content are real photographs of its employees, but that most of these data are already available in the public domain.|$|E
5|$|Many {{writers have}} {{attempted}} to designate one person, often Hensley, as the progenitor of Appalachian religious snake handling. Although these writers have emphasized Hensley's role in propagating the practice, Kimbrough notes <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> that he originated it are usually unsubstantiated by research, and {{the origins of the}} observance are unclear. Hood and Williamson argue that the beginnings of Pentecostal snake handling rites cannot be ascribed to a single person, and that the observance arose independently on multiple occasions. There is no doubt among historians, however, that Hensley helped spread Pentecostal snake handling throughout the Southeast, and that media coverage of Hensley's ministry was influential in prompting various churches to include the practice in their services.|$|E

40|$|Argentina's {{economic}} and institutional decline has long posed a conundrum to economists and social scientists. In particular, it challenges theories {{that seek to}} explain cross-country growth differences over time. Those theories <b>that</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> institutions have a first-order effect on growth cannot explain the persistent economic decadence {{of a country that}} in 1930 was among the most institutionally advanced in Latin America. Theories <b>that</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> that education and growth precede inclusive institutions face a similar problem, since Argentina {{was one of the most}} educationally advanced countries in Latin America. The same can be said of theories <b>that</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> social capital is the determinant factor that explains long-term growth. This paper emphasizes the key role played by recurrent cycles of populism in pushing the country into secular decadence and posits that, in Argentina, rising commodity prices have driven the cycles of populism...|$|R

5|$|Three {{anhydrous}} neptunium oxides {{have been}} reported, NpO2, Np2O5, and Np5O8, though {{some studies have}} stated that only the first two of these exist, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> of Np5O8 are actually the result of mistaken analysis of Np2O5. However, as {{the full extent of}} the reactions that occur between neptunium and oxygen has yet to be researched, it is not certain which of these claims is accurate. Although neptunium oxides have not been produced with neptunium in oxidation states as high as those possible with the adjacent actinide uranium, neptunium oxides are more stable at lower oxidation states. This behavior is illustrated by the fact that NpO2 can be produced by simply burning neptunium salts of oxyacids in air.|$|E
5|$|In general, the USACE {{credited}} existing {{flood control}} projects as preventing additional flooding. In West Virginia alone, {{it was estimated}} that existing flood-control projects saved about $135million in damage. Lake Moomaw in western Virginia helped prevent $70million in damage along the James River. In Pennsylvania, flood measures resulted in minimal flooding along the Youghiogheny River. After sustaining damage from flooding along the Monongahela River with little warning, the owners of a marina filed a class action lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County on November21, 1985, against West Penn Power Company to compensate for damages. The plaintiffs believed that the damage occurred because the company opened the flood gates of the Lake Lynn Dam. The power company attempted to move the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in March 1986, citing the Federal Power Act's provision <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> should be in the District Court, but the nature of the suit sent it back to the Court of Common Pleas, bringing it to trial in September 1989. The jury found that although the West Penn Power was negligent, the damage was caused mainly by the historic and unprecedented flooding; consequently, the case entered a compulsory nonsuit, meaning the company was not required to pay compensation. The plaintiffs sought an appeal in 1990, which was denied.|$|E
5|$|Motivated {{in part by}} {{a desire}} to prove that Australians could compete at the highest level, and believing <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> that his brother died due to {{inexperience}} was a smokescreen intended to cover-up the poor safety standards, Malcolm Milne represented Australia at the next two Winter Olympics, won a World Cup event and came third in a World Championship. In 1968, Milne finished 24th in both the downhill and slalom events, Australia's best result in a skiing event up to that point. Ross Martin came 60th in both cross-country events, and Colin Coates came 41st and 49th in his two speed skating events. Australia had more officials present than athletes, with five competitors and three administrators. This trend continued at the 1972 Olympics in Sapporo, which were attended by five staff and four athletes. Milne rose up the rankings to finish 23rd and 24th in the downhill and slalom respectively, as did Coates, who came in the top 30 in three of his four events, including an 18th-place result in the 10,000m event. Milne was considered a medal contender and the team manager felt that but for a near-fall, he would have placed near the medalists.|$|E

5|$|The {{power of}} the Aksumite Kingdom {{declined}} after the 6th century due {{to the rise of}} other regional states in the Horn of Africa. Modern scholars continue to debate the identity and provenance of the legendary or semi-legendary figure Gudit (fl. 10th century), a queen who is traditionally believed to have overthrown the Kingdom of Aksum. The legend is found in the 13th-century chronicle of the monk Tekle Haymanot, who compiled historical writings gathered from various Ethiopian churches and monasteries. The chronicle alleges that, after being exiled from Axum, she married a Jewish king of Syria and converted to Judaism. The Scottish travel writer James Bruce (1730–1794) was incredulous about the tale and believed she was simply a Jewish queen. Carlo Conti Rossini (1872–1949) hypothesized that she was an ethnic Sidamo from Damot, whereas Steven Kaplan argues she was a non-Christian invader and historian Knud Tage Andersen contends she was a regular member of the Aksumite royal house who shrewdly seized the throne. The latter is more in line with another legend <b>that</b> <b>claims</b> Dil Na'od, the last king of Aksum, kept his daughter Mesobe Werq in isolation out of fear of a prophecy that her son would overthrow him, yet she eloped with the nobleman Mara Takla Haymanot from Lasta who eventually killed the Aksumite king in a duel, took the throne and founded the Zagwe dynasty. The latter {{remains one of the most}} poorly understood periods of Ethiopia's recorded history. What is known is that the early Zagwe kings were polytheistic, eventually converted to Christianity, and ruled over the northern Highlands of Ethiopia, while Islamic sultanates inhabited the coastal Ethiopian Lowlands.|$|E

5000|$|As {{explained}} by the circuit court, [...] "claim 21 of the '835 patent is identical to <b>claim</b> 1 except <b>that</b> it does not contain the 'maintaining updated sums' and 'periodically compressing said sums' limitations". The district court decided <b>that</b> the <b>claim</b> {{did not lead to}} a seamless DWT because the word [...] "seamless" [...] did not appear in it. The circuit court agreed with LizardTech <b>that</b> <b>claim</b> 21 was in fact directed to creating a seamless DWT, but nevertheless decided <b>that</b> <b>claim</b> 21 was invalid. The circuit court argued <b>that</b> <b>claim</b> 21, since it lacked the limitations of claim 1, would need [...] "to cover all ways of performing DWT-based compression processes that lead to a seamless DWT". The circuit court looked to the [...] "written description" [...] requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112, holding that the '835 patent did not properly describe any method other than [...] "maintaining updated sums". Since the patent failed to give a proper written description for claim 21, the circuit court ruled <b>that</b> <b>claim</b> 21 was invalid. The remaining claims depended on claim 21.|$|R
