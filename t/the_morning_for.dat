5|$|Becoming a Peking opera {{performer}} {{requires a}} long and arduous apprenticeship beginning from an early age. Before the 20th century, pupils were often handpicked {{at a young age}} by a teacher and trained for seven years on contract from the child's parents. Since the teacher fully provided for the pupil during this period, the student accrued a debt to his master that was later repaid through performance earnings. After 1911, training took place in more formally organized schools. Students at these schools rose as early as five o'clock in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>for</b> exercises. Daytime was spent learning the skills of acting and combat, and senior students performed in outside theatres in the evening. If they made any mistakes during such performances, the entire group was beaten with bamboo canes. Schools with less harsh training methods began to appear in 1930, but all schools were closed down in 1931 after the Japanese invasion. New schools were not opened until 1952.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Hitler {{had come}} into power, he had started to make plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933 he {{contracted}} Paul Troost to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost. As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor {{on the progress of}} the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to lunch, to the architect's great excitement. Hitler evinced considerable interest in Speer during the luncheon, and later told Speer that he had been looking for a young architect capable of carrying out his architectural dreams for the new Germany. Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected to call on Hitler in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>for</b> a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.|$|E

25|$|However, West Indies fought back. Ramdin {{took care}} of both spinners and seamers in style, driving his way to 56 before {{dragging}} a delivery from Test debutant Gayan Wijekoon onto his own stumps, but he had lifted West Indies to a respectable 192 for 6. Chanderpaul and spinner Omari Banks saw them through to stumps on day one, with an unbeaten partnership of 79. However, the second day opened with a nightmare for West Indies. Malinga and Chaminda Vaas {{took care of}} the remaining four wickets in 40 deliveries in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>for</b> only fourteen runs, as the tail rolled over for 285.|$|E
25|$|I {{knew that}} the end of September was the last period (of time) before the explosion, but when Sharon reached the al-Aqsa Mosque, this was the most {{appropriate}} moment for the outbreak of the intifada.... The night prior to Sharon's visit, I participated in a panel on a local television station and I seized the opportunity to call on the public to go to the al-Aqsa Mosque in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>for</b> it was not possible that Sharon would reach al-Haram al-Sharif just so, and walk away peacefully. I finished and went to al-Aqsa in the morning.... We tried to create clashes without success because of the differences of opinion that emerged with others in the al-Aqsa compound at the time.... After Sharon left, I remained for two hours in the presence of other people, we discussed the manner of response and how it was possible to react in all the cities (bilad) and not just in Jerusalem. We contacted all (the Palestinian) factions.|$|E

The President, who presumably orchestrated the accusations for his own purposes, wants Canales to flee because [...] "running away would be a confession of guilt".|$|E

500|$|The Extension School {{developed}} its online Teleteaching Project in the 1980s. [...] In 1984, a calculus {{course was}} offered via voice-data modem, kicking off its online education effort.

[...] It was taught in Harvard Square at nights, and the Chinese students simultaneously took the class in what was <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>for</b> them.|$|E
500|$|... "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] shared many of {{the themes}} in President Clinton's inaugural address, which he gave {{immediately}} before Angelou read her poem, including change, responsibility, and the President's and the citizenry's role in establishing economic security. The symbols in Angelou's poem (the tree, the river, and <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>for</b> example) paralleled {{many of the}} same symbols Clinton used in his speech, and helped to enhance and expand Clinton's images. Clinton's address and the poem, according to Hagen, both emphasized unity despite the diversity of American culture. [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] attempted to convey many of the goals of Clinton's new administration.|$|E
500|$|When MythBusters {{broadcast}} {{the result of}} the San Francisco experiment in January 2006, the claim was placed in the category of [...] "busted" [...] (or failed) because of the length of time and the ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur. It was also pointed out that since Syracuse faces the sea towards the east, the Roman fleet would have had to attack during <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>for</b> optimal gathering of light by the mirrors. MythBusters also pointed out that conventional weaponry, such as flaming arrows or bolts from a catapult, would have been a far easier way of setting a ship on fire at short distances.|$|E

In addition, the participants spent time with the kids through games, sports, arts and crafts.|$|R
500|$|Childe {{was fond}} of driving cars, enjoying the [...] "feeling of power" [...] he got from them. He often told {{a story about how}} he had raced at high speed down Piccadilly, London at 3 o'clock in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>for</b> the sheer {{enjoyment}} of it, only to be pulled over by a policeman for such illegal activity. He loved practical jokes, and allegedly kept a halfpenny in his pocket to trick pickpockets. On another occasion he played a joke on the delegates at a Prehistoric Society conference by lecturing them on a theory that the Neolithic monument of Woodhenge had been constructed as an imitation of Stonehenge by a nouveau riche chieftain. Several audience members failed to realise that he was being tongue in cheek.|$|E
500|$|Another dispute {{occurred}} between TLC and Rolston {{was over the}} choice of clothing. The director was interested in [...] "tight and sexy" [...] lingerie looks for them while they only liked baggy, tomboy clothes. Combining the two, he finally gave out {{the idea of the}} girls wearing the silk pajamas with each custom-made cost more than 1,000. Thomas also talked about their exhaustion on the set: [...] "People don't realize that for video shoots you have to wake up at like 5 in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>for</b> your call time. So when we did that part {{at the very end of}} the video where we're talking to the camera and looking all silly, we were so tired. But sometimes that ends up being your best shots." [...] Eventually, she praised Rolston's final product for the group as [...] "excellent" [...] while Lopes said that after two failed ones, the director finally gave them a [...] "real video." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{give the}} Odyssey an unnatural ghostship feeling of solitude, many wide angle shots and VisFX matte {{extension}} were used with no additional music. Robert C. Cooper often {{listened to the}} CCR song [...] "Have You Ever Seen the Rain?" [...] during {{the making of the}} episode and decided to play it over the first montage, showing the passage of time. The tone of the second montage was set with a cello. Stargate composer Joel Goldsmith later accompanied the hand movements of the hired cellist with different music during post-production. A third montage was filmed but not included in the final cut of the episode since the last table scene already supplied the needed sentiment. Each time period included the same shots to help the audience focus on the differences that characters have gone through. The last scene at Stargate Command was the last filmed Stargate SG-1 scene, shot at two o'clock in <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>for</b> which every member of the crew came back.|$|E

500|$|However, he {{eventually}} beat 5,000 other hopefuls to land his breakout role opposite Stallone, Carl Weathers and Brigitte Nielsen. To improve his physique and athletic abilities {{for the role}} of Drago, he trained intensely in bodybuilding and boxing for five months before the film was shot. Lundgren said, [...] "We trained six days a week—weights in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>for</b> about an hour, then boxing in the afternoon. We did a split of chest and back one day and then shoulders, legs, and arms the next. We boxed {{for an hour and a}} half, practiced the fight choreography, and did bag work and abs." [...] He weighed [...] – [...] during the filming, but in the film he was billed at one publisher said of Drago, [...] "He's a hulking 261pounds of merciless fighting machine, the best that Soviet science & medicine can create". His lines [...] "If he dies, he dies" [...] and [...] "I must break you" [...] are amongst the best known of the Rocky series and have been cited in popular culture.|$|E

[...] It was anticipated that Antelope, once fishing season ended, would be put on the Bandon-Coquille City run, making a total of five steamers daily operating on the route.

2500|$|The Japanese {{landings}} at Gona commenced {{at about}} 5:30pm on 21 July 1942. [...] They were opposed by Allied air attacks until darkness fell {{and again in}} <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>for</b> the loss of one transport ship. [...] The Japanese landings were observed by patrols of the PIB and officers of the ANGAU. [...] Templeton bought forward two of his platoons. His remaining platoon was to protect Kokoda. First contact was made at about 4.00 pm on 23 July. A PIB patrol led by Lieutenant Chalk ambushed advancing Japanese near Awala. The bridge across the Kumusi River at Wairopi was destroyed by the withdrawing Australians and the Japanese were harassed as they made a crossing.|$|E
