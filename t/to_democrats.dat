5|$|In 1967, Ford ran for {{lieutenant}} governor, {{this time}} against {{the wishes of}} Breathitt and Combs, whose pick was state attorney general Robert Matthews. Ford defeated Matthews by 631 votes, 0.2% of the total vote count in the primary. He ran an independent campaign and won {{in the general election}} even as Combs-Breathitt pick Henry Ward lost the race for governor to Republican Louie B. Nunn. Republicans and Democrats split the state offices, with five going to Republicans and four going <b>to</b> <b>Democrats.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1988, if Kemp had won his {{campaign}} for the United States Presidency, {{it would have made}} him the first person to move from the United States House of Representatives to the White House since James Garfield. When he formed his exploratory committee, he signed Ed Rollins, Reagan's 1984 re-election political director, as an advisor. From the outset, Kemp had failed to position himself as the primary alternative to Vice President Bush. Except for a select few cognoscenti, the general public did not recognize Kemp's leadership ability, although he was a successful man of ideas. In fact, most of the Republican electorate found themselves unfamiliar with Kemp early in {{his campaign}}. Political pundits recognized him, however, as a visionary idea man. In addition, he was quickly perceived as a verbose speaker who sometimes lost contact with his audience. Although Kemp tried to appeal to conservatives, his libertarian philosophies of tolerance and individual rights and his commitment to supporting minorities, women, blue-collar workers and organized labor clashed with conservative voters' social and religious values. <b>To</b> <b>Democrats,</b> Kemp's free-market philosophies were a form of laissez-faire anarchy. However, as much as Kemp wanted to minimize government's role, he acknowledged that moves toward a more laissez-faire system should be well-thought out.|$|E

25|$|In October 2009, McMahon {{was viewed}} as a {{political}} outsider in the Republican Party (GOP). She faced competition from Sam Caligiuri and Rob Simmons, both established politicians among Connecticut Republicans.

25|$|A December 2007 {{poll showed}} Coleman's {{approval}} rating among Minnesota voters at 53%. The seat was heavily {{targeted by the}} Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee because of Minnesota's Democratic leanings and recent Democratic gains in national and statewide elections. These factors, coupled with a national political climate favorable <b>to</b> <b>Democrats,</b> made the Minnesota Senate race {{one of the most}} competitive and closely watched of the cycle.|$|E

25|$|Senator Max Baucus is {{a popular}} Democrat in Montana, {{representing}} {{a state that has}} long been fairly Republican but also is receptive <b>to</b> <b>Democrats</b> in state and local elections. President Bush won Montana by more than 20 points in both 2000 and 2004, but Montana also has a popular Democratic governor, Brian Schweitzer, and a newly elected Democratic junior senator, Jon Tester. Baucus was not expected to face a significant challenge from the 85-year-old Republican nominee, Bob Kelleher, who surprised observers by winning the June 3 Republican primary despite supporting a number of positions that put him to the political left of Baucus, such as nationalization of the American oil and gas industry.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Steele, {{a former}} MI6 agent, {{was hired by}} Fusion GPS to produce {{opposition}} research on Donald Trump. His reports were first sold to Republicans, then <b>to</b> <b>Democrats,</b> and included alleged kompromat that may make Trump vulnerable to blackmail from Russia. A 33-page compilation was leaked to the press in October 2016 but was not published by mainstream media who doubted the material's credibility. In December 2016, two more pages were added alleging efforts by Trump's lawyer to pay those who had hacked the DNC and arranging to cover up any evidence of their deeds. On January 5, 2017, U.S. intelligence agencies briefed President Obama and President-elect Trump {{on the existence of}} these documents. Eventually, the dossier was published in full by BuzzFeed on January 11.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s {{many people}} moved in {{from out of}} state. Much of this {{immigration}} included the arrival of more liberal political influences of the urban areas of New York {{and the rest of}} New England in Vermont. The brand of Republicanism in Vermont has historically been a moderate one, and combined with the newcomers from out of state, this made Vermont friendlier <b>to</b> <b>Democrats</b> as the national GOP moved to the right. As evidence of this, in 1990 Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, was elected to Vermont's lone seat in the House as an independent. Sanders became the state's junior Senator in 2007. However, for his entire career in the House and Senate, Sanders has caucused with the Democrats and is counted as a Democrat for the purposes of committee assignments and voting for party leadership.|$|E
25|$|With President Bush {{ineligible for}} a third term and Vice President Dick Cheney not {{pursuing}} the party's nomination, Arizona Senator John McCain quickly emerged as the Republican Party's presidential nominee, receiving President Bush's endorsement on March 6, six months before official ratification at the 2008 Republican National Convention. On August 29, Senator McCain announced Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running-mate, making her the first woman on a Republican Presidential ticket. McCain surged ahead of Obama in the national polls following the nominationm but amid a financial crisis and a serious economic downturn, McCain and Palin went on to lose the election <b>to</b> <b>Democrats</b> Barack Obama and running mate Joe Biden. Since 1992, the 2012 presidential election was the sixth consecutive election in which the Republican candidate failed to win at least 300 electoral votes, suggesting a ceiling on GOP strength and a modicum margin of error should an election become highly competitive.|$|E
