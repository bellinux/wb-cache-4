40|$|There are {{thresholds}} {{in visual}} perception that affect a persons interaction {{with a smaller}} screen. In this article we will look {{into some of the}} research done in cognitive psychology on perception, memory and attention and how this applies to designing games for mobile phones and other small networked devices that are limited in screen size. Examples will be taken from mobile games and the GameBoy Advance to show how this approach can be used to improve screen interaction and game play. Limitations of the Small Screen We must first ask the question; why would anyone play games on a mobile phone? A portable device such as a mobile phone does have certain advantages that are given by itâ€™s size, a miniature networked device that one has on ones self at nearly all times. We will look further into a smaller segment of the phone, in most cases smaller than the touch <b>tone</b> <b>pad,</b> the screen utilized in these phones that are used as the main means of visual feedback towards the actions of the user. This is a small screen interface and this is where we will find the biggest limitations that thes...|$|E

50|$|The touch <b>tone</b> key <b>pad</b> has sixteen keys {{laid out}} in a four-by-four matrix. Each key {{produces}} a combination of two audible tone frequencies, determined by their position on the pad. Each column and row has a distinct frequency assigned, thus generating a total of sixteen dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals. Early keypads only used the keys with the digits 1 through 9 and 0. The extra keys were intended for computer data entry, business functions, and military applications. By 1967, the keys with the asterisk (*) and hash (#) were added on all subscriber telephone sets. The keys A, B, C, D were used as priority signals (FO, F, I, and P) in the Automatic Voice Network (AUTOVON) of the US military.|$|R
5000|$|With the new [...] "Forever Young" [...] design (adopted in 2006), {{the first}} major {{redesign}} since 1969, McDonald's turned a new page for itself. New and remodeled restaurants feature dining zones with [...] "distinct personalities". Most of them offer three sections or zones. A linger zone was designed to accommodate people who were inclined to dawdle and socialize while sitting comfortably on armchairs or sofas using free wifi access. Another zone offers counters and stools for patrons in a hurry who might just grab and go. The third {{and perhaps most important}} zone is the one for families or groups where seating arrangements can be reconfigured to meet a variety of needs. Also, harsh colors and hard plastics have been replaced with custom earth <b>tones</b> and flexible <b>padded</b> fabric covered booth seating all in hopes of engaging diners to loiter and perhaps spend more money and in addition to architecture and furnishings, the McDonald's menu has been tweaked to offer a larger variety of what the corporation refers to as more healthy food.|$|R
