50|$|The {{scale of}} peat cutting around Zuidveen {{declined}} {{from the second}} half of the 18th century, as peat fens became smaller and more land was converted to agricultural use. The last peat to be cut was in the Broekslagen, the present-day business park Groot Verlaat. Zuidveen resident Meine Veen (married 1920) was billed as the last turfmeter, or peat measurer, in the province of Overijssel. He was responsible for collecting taxes on peat for the water board. With the disappearance of peat, the canals and ditches lost their function of drainage and transportation channels, and were sometimes filled in.

Diameter of the <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> and {{distance of the}} <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> are controlled together based on fluid e. g. water, to be transported. The <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> exhibit tortuosity of 1, and have the diameter within a range of 10 to 500 micrometer. The <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> are spaced apart from each other such that the gas diffusion layer has 1 to 400 <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> per centimeter square. USE - Method for producing a gas diffusion layer of a fuel cell (all claimed) i. e. direct methanol fuel cell for transporting fluid i. e. water.

China is a large developing nation with a population of over 1.3  billion.

By “security of resources”, I mean maintaining both adequate quantity and acceptable quality of resources. For example, ample supply of drinking water is of utmost importance to human beings, as is arable land. If arable land is contaminated with heavy metals, the security of edible agricultural products will be threatened. The commercial trade of resources must also be safeguarded.
