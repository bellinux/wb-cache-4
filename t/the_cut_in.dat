5|$|A {{sequel to}} Songs in the Key of Springfield was {{released}} in October 1999, titled Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons. It contained songs that {{had appeared in the}} series since the previous soundtrack album was released, as well as some earlier ones that did not make <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> Songs in the Key of Springfield. Most of the 53 tracks featured were composed by Clausen. The album peaked at number 197 on the Billboard 200. , the third and latest album (as of 2012) to feature music from The Simpsons, was released eight years later in September 2007. Like its predecessors, the majority of the tracks were composed by Clausen. The album, which did not chart, contains songs from the series' eleventh season (1999) to its eighteenth season (2007).|$|E
5|$|The {{high-speed}} freeway {{connection was}} completed {{with the opening}} of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932. The Pulaski Skyway ramp at its eastern terminus was eventually replaced with two long outside ramps that were dedicated for eastbound and westbound traffic from <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> Bergen Hill just west of JohnF. Kennedy Boulevard. On September14, 1938, a direct ramp, known as the Tonnele Circle Viaduct, opened over Tonnele Circle to connect westbound traffic with southbound U.S.Route1/9 Truck, which quickly connects to Route7 that leads to Interstate280.|$|E
5|$|After the {{takeover}} of service along the former Morris & Essex Lines by New Jersey Transit from Conrail in 1982, the service at the Roseville Avenue station remained minimal. Many trains bypassed the station in favor {{of going to the}} nearby Newark Broad Street Station. Trains continued to serve the Roseville Avenue station throughout 1982 and 1983, and service continued to be condensed during 1984. However, as of the official September 1984 timetables, service was cut from Roseville Avenue in favor of Newark Broad Street to Grove Street, East Orange (on the Morris & Essex) or Ampere (on the Montclair Branch), both of which closed in April 1991. On September 16, 1984, trains began bypassing Roseville Avenue, and the station was closed permanently. Although the station was closed, Roseville Tower, for the interlocking between the Montclair Branch and Morris & Essex Lines, remained in service for almost two more decades. In 2002, during construction of the Montclair Connection, the tower was demolished in favor of expanding <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> Roseville for a second track of the new Montclair-Boonton Line.|$|E

5|$|On May 19, 2014, {{she became}} the {{youngest}} (age 11) {{to qualify for the}} U.S. Women's Open, surpassing Thompson's record (12 years, 4 months, 18 days) from the 2007 Open. Notably, Li not only qualified, but she won her qualifying event by seven strokes at Old Course at Half Moon Bay Golf Links. Thompson missed <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> 2007 with a 36-hole 168 total. Li was the second-youngest to compete; nine years prior to the introduction of qualification in 1976, Beverly Klass played in the 1967 Open at age 10 years, 7 months, and 21 days. Although Li's qualification was largely heralded, some were befuddled at the state of the sport when a sixth grader could even qualify {{for one of the most}} prestigious events of the year. Li, who had reached a 1.5 handicap by April, had a handicap better than threshold 2.4, making her eligible to participate in qualifications.|$|E
5|$|Records {{indicate}} that the alignment of PA371 was first constructed as a cut from the Delaware River to the community of Great Bend, Pennsylvania, in1791 through Wayne and Susquehanna Counties. In1801, the state legislature of New York and Pennsylvania brought up the proposal for the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike (later the Great Bend and Newburgh Turnpike) to connect the Hudson River to the Delaware River. Although the route was finished in New York, the portion in Pennsylvania was not legislated until March29,1804. Construction through Wayne and Susquehanna Counties commenced in1806, with completion of the roadway coming in1811. At that point, the turnpike was extended onto <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> Pennsylvania to the Susquehanna River. The turnpike was used for transportation of farmers' goods and stock along with a route for pioneers to use for heading westward. After construction of the original CochectonDamascus Bridge in 1817 (and later in 1821), {{the area around the}} bridge became a bustling community. The alignment of what is now PA371 eventually became littered with a large rate of development, with nineteenth-century style buildings constructed in Damascus. The turnpike itself fared poorly later on, and was abandoned in1853. Although the roadway itself was abandoned, the turnpike corporation that was supposed to maintain the roadway remained intact until 1868, when it was dissolved. Even afterwards, the roadway remained the only physical route in the area until at least the1890s.|$|E

25|$|While Zaharias missed <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the 1938 PGA Tour event, later, as {{she became}} more experienced, she made <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> every PGA Tour event she entered. In January 1945, Zaharias played in three PGA tournaments. She shot 76–76 {{to qualify for}} the Los Angeles Open. She then shot 76–81 to make the two-day cut in the tournament itself, but missed the three-day cut after a 79, making her the first (and {{currently}} only) woman in history to make <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> a regular PGA Tour event. She continued her cut streak at the Phoenix Open, where she shot 77–72–75–80, finishing in 33rd place. At the Tucson Open, she qualified by shooting 74–81 and then shot a 307 in the tournament and finished tied for 42nd. Unlike other female golfers competing in men's events, she got into the Los Angeles and Tucson Opens through 36-hole qualifiers, as opposed to a sponsor's exemption.|$|E
