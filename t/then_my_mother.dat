25|$|Around 1954, {{parties were}} held at Florance's house, {{referred}} to as 'The Hovel'. According to Peter Oyston: over those years my sister and I worked out that we had 82 callers a week, not counting those who came more than once. It was constant open house. My stepfather would start a party with his muso friends while my mother was at the theatre. And <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would bring back the cast and any {{people who came to}} see the shows. And the taxi drivers and, if the police called to quieten us up, then the police would be invited in and they'd join the party too. It really was an extraordinary time.|$|E

Barr's parents kept their Jewish heritage secret from their neighbors and were partially involved in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Barr has stated, [...] "Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning I was a Jew; Sunday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon, and Wednesday afternoon we were Mormons". [...] When Barr was three years old, she got Bell's palsy {{on the left side}} of her face. Barr said, [...] " [...] my mother called in a rabbi to pray for me, but nothing happened. <b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> got a Mormon preacher, he prayed, and I was miraculously cured". Years later Barr learned that Bell's palsy was usually temporary and that the Mormon preacher came [...] "exactly at the right time". [...] At six years old, Barr discovered her first public stage by lecturing at LDS churches around Utah and even was elected president of a Mormon youth group.|$|E
60|$|Thus, <b>then,</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> now, {{commanding}} that hideous deed with a mind {{at peace}} in pharisaic self-righteousness.|$|E
60|$|I drew back, still wrought upon by <b>my</b> surprise; and <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> {{voice came}} cold and acid.|$|R
60|$|MALET. <b>Then</b> for <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> sake, and England's sake That suffers in {{the daily}} want of thee, Obey the Count's conditions, my good friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{made over}} his small income <b>then</b> to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> in trust for me. Did it {{strike you as}} strange that he should do this instead of making a will?" ...|$|R
60|$|It was by {{an effort}} that I refrained from {{striking}} him. And <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> spoke again.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Not for my sake,’ says {{my sister}} obstinately, and <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> comes ben {{to me to}} say delightedly, ‘She winna listen to reason!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{would begin}} to laugh. ‘I would find out first {{if he had a}} family, and then I would say they were the finest family in London.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Langer! It's no possible!" [...] exclaimed {{the poor}} Laird. [...] "It canna be; ye were {{born on the}} land. O Jeanie woman, ye haena lookit--ye haena seen the half o' the gear." [...] He drew out another drawer--"A' gowd, Jeanie, and there's bands for siller lent--And the rental book, Jeanie--clear three hunder sterling--deil a wadset, {{heritable}} band, or burden--Ye haena lookit at them, woman--And <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> wardrobe, and <b>my</b> grandmother's forby--silk gowns wad stand on their ends, their pearline-lace as fine as spiders' webs, and rings and ear-rings to the boot of a' that--they are a' in the chamber of deas--Oh, Jeanie, gang up the stair and look at them!" ...|$|R
6000|$|And <b>then</b> {{as usual}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would give herself away unconsciously. ‘That is what I tell him,’ she says chuckling, ‘and {{he tries to}} keep me out, but he canna; it’s more than he can do!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was ambitious--I {{wanted to}} get on. And <b>then</b> there were <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and <b>my</b> sisters to be thought of. Thank Heaven, here is the morning coming. Your aunt and you will soon cease to feel the cold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And, <b>then,</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is very {{bitter about}} all this. And how can I, {{at such a}} time, tell her that her opinion is to go for nothing? I am bound to think of my own children, and cannot abandon my claim to the property." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Once," [...] she remarked, reflectively, [...] "I, too, went {{a little}} way into the world. I was a school-teacher at Norwich. I was very fond of some one there; we were engaged. <b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> died and I {{had to come back}} to look after father." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> sorely vexed over my adventures--which {{in truth}} were but sorry ones for a child--took me home. Nor would {{she let me}} keep Alicia's chain, but made away with it, how I knew not and little cared, for {{the sight of it}} was loathsome to me.|$|E
6000|$|These {{things had}} {{happened}} two days before; now John was dying, {{and the letter}} had not come. I had been summoned to many death beds in my life, but to none that made my heart ache as it did <b>then,</b> since <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> called me to watch the departure of a spirit akin to this in its gentleness and patient strength. As I went in, John stretched out both hands: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, sir, I do {{not think}} it was myself. It was first the mercy of the Almighty, and <b>then</b> <b>my</b> blessed <b>mother's</b> holy memory working on him, revived by the sight of myself. I cannot {{describe}} to you how gentle, and courteous, and respectful he was to me all along, though I am sure those dreadful men mocked at him for it. Do you know whether his father has heard?" ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had meant}} to keep our grim secret to ourselves; but to hide one's {{troubles}} long from Amy was like keeping cold hands from the fire. Very soon she knew everything {{that was to be}} known, drawing it all from <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> as from some overburdened child. <b>Then</b> she put <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> down into a chair and stood over her.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{never do}} spend ten minutes {{together}} alone," [...] Julian replied drily. [...] "I see to that. <b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> you know, has the knack of getting interesting people together. The Bishop is coming, amongst others. And, Furley, I {{wanted to ask}} you--do you know anything of a young woman--she is half Russian, I believe--who calls herself Miss Catherine Abbeway?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{slipped the}} bolt at once, and we stood and panted {{for a moment}} in the dark, alone in the house with the dead captain's body. <b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> got a candle in the bar, and holding each other's hands, we {{advanced}} into the parlour. He lay as we had left him, on his back, with his eyes open and one arm stretched out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor have I lost mine," [...] said Agatha. [...] "But we {{will not}} talk about that yet. He brought us up and started us well; <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> died, and nobody had any further claim on him. His duty was done, and though he was getting old, {{he went back to}} the North. Well, I have told you part of his story, and you know the rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|Early in July {{my brother}} Franklin joined {{me in the}} garden work, and <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> cup of contentment fairly overflowed its brim. So far as we knew she had no care, no regret. Day by day she sat in an easy chair under the trees, {{watching}} us as we played ball on the lawn, or cut weeds in the garden; and each time we looked at her, we both acknowledged {{a profound sense of}} satisfaction, of relief. Never again would she burn in the suns of the arid plains, or cower before the winds of a desolate winter. She was secure. [...] "You need never work again," [...] I assured her. [...] "You can get up when you please and go to bed when you please. Your only job is to sit in the shade and boss the rest of us," [...] and to this she answered only with a silent, characteristic chuckle of delight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>my</b> pet, <b>Mother's</b> got her, Mother won't leave her; Totty {{be a good}} dilling, and go {{to sleep}} now," [...] said Mrs. Poyser, leaning back and rocking the chair, while she tried to make Totty nestle against her. But Totty only cried louder, and said, [...] "Don't yock!" [...] So the mother, with that wondrous {{patience}} which love gives to the quickest temperament, sat up again, and pressed her cheek against the linen night-cap and kissed it, and forgot to scold Hetty any longer.|$|R
6000|$|Oh, come, spirit-mother! {{discourse}} of the hours My young bosom beat all its beating to yours, When heart-woven wishes in soft counsel fell On ears--how unheedful, proved sorrow might tell! That deathless affection nae sorrow could break; When all else forsook me, ye would na forsake; <b>Then</b> come, oh <b>my</b> <b>mother!</b> come often to me, An' soon an' for ever I'll come unto thee! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> censured Eustace for {{bad taste}} in talking over his case with his lawyer in public. He laughed, and {{assured her that}} he had never even thought of his suit, but had been {{discussing}} one of the pictures on the walls, a fine Veronese--appealing to me if it were not so; but she was not satisfied; she said he should not have encouraged the presumption of that little advocate by presenting him to his sisters.|$|E
6000|$|... "One day {{he went to}} the post-office for his mail. That {{was when}} I was about nine years old. When he got back he began to dance around and he caught me by the hands and rushed around the house like a crazy man. 'A hundred {{thousand}} francs! A hundred thousand francs!' he kept calling out, over and over again. <b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> asked him what he meant. He said a distant relative had died and left him and her a hundred thousand francs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have worked}} {{all sorts of}} {{traverses}} {{to get hold of}} this matter, and never could make any thing of it. It is harder than logarithms. If my father had been the only one to teach it, I should have thought less about it, for he was no scholar, and might have been paying it out just in the way of business; but <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> believed it, body and soul, and she was too good a woman to stick long to a course that had not truth to back it." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{studied a}} little and badly. <b>Then</b> with <b>my</b> little <b>mother</b> {{sitting on the bed}} I chattered a lot… The gong rang, that is, it was {{announced}} that my father was going to the bath. Then we, bathed, ate in the oil pressing room - we didn’t bath in it, but had dinner having bathed, and happily heard the peasants jesting.|$|R
60|$|On {{that same}} {{occasion}} I learned, {{for the first}} time, from Miss Abbot's communications to Bessie, {{that my father had}} been a poor clergyman; that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had married him against the wishes of her friends, who considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that after <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and father had been married a year, the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was <b>then</b> prevalent: that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> took the infection from him, and both died within a month of each other.|$|R
5000|$|Barış Arduç {{was born}} in Switzerland on 9 October 1987 to a family of Albanian immigrants, {{including}} his father, Erol Arduç, and his mother, Gülay Arduç. He has two siblings. His older brother, Onur Arduç, was engaged in May 2016 at Istanbul, and married on August 28, 2016 at Bolu. His younger brother, Mert Arduç, is single. At the age of 8, Barış Arduç moved to Turkey with his whole family. [...] "I am originally Albanian. My father was going to Fatsa and <b>then</b> Duzce. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> is from Artvin. Their roads intersect in Sakarya. Then they went to Switzerland to work. There my older brother, me, my younger brother were born." [...] Barış Arduç ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> died. Her perfect health failed her suddenly, and her decline was not long. But she {{suffered}} much, {{and on the}} last occasion of my being with her at her bedside {{she told me that}} she was very tired and had no fear of death, and would be glad to go but for the thought of leaving me in such a precarious state of health and with a mind distressed. Even then she put no questions to me, but only expressed the hope that her prayers for me would be answered and that at the last we should be together again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Life {{to me just}} now," [...] he continued, [...] "is so much {{a matter}} of comparison. It is for that, indeed, that I am here. You see, I have lived nearly all my life in my own country and only a very short time in Europe. <b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was an English lady, and my father a Japanese nobleman. Always I seem to be pulled two {{different}} ways, to be struggling to see things from two different points of view. But there is one subject in which I think I am wholly with my own country." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{first she}} {{was no more than}} a blue-clad, white-aproned benevolence, that moved in the shadows behind the bed on which my old mother lay and sank restfully to death. She would come forward to {{anticipate}} some little need, to proffer some simple comfort, and always <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> smiled on her. In a little while I discovered the beauty of that helpful poise of her woman's body, I discovered the grace of untiring goodness, the sweetness of a tender pity, and the great riches of her voice, of her few reassuring words and phrases. I noted and remembered very clearly how once my mother's lean old hand patted the firm gold-flecked strength of hers, as it went by upon its duties with the coverlet.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{had been}} {{practically}} abandoned {{for some years}} and was in a bad state of delapidation, but the beautiful carved work {{that had been done}} by William Bernard Sears, soon after the church was built, had not <b>then</b> been molested. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> used to sit in the church and read the Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments over the Chancel, and admire the gilded dove that Mr. Sears had placed high over the Pulpit. The 'Eye' which he also had made seemed to be looking at her no matter where she sat.|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems all confused," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "I don't even {{remember}} going out of the house. I can remember his striking {{me in the face}} again and again, and <b>then</b> I heard <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> scream, and everything seems to have become misty. But I know I was walking about; I know that I was worrying to get at him, and that if I had met him I should have attacked him, and if I had had anything in my hand I should have killed him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps... Ah, Ventre Dieu, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is right! Let {{the matter}} rest, <b>then,</b> <b>my</b> father. We will talk of it again {{as soon as}} you are well." ...|$|R
