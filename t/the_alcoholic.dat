40|$|A {{previous}} study {{has shown a}} high incidence of abnormal auditory brainstem responses in alcoholics, particularly when cerebral and/or cerebellar atrophy was present in CT scans. To correlate the electrophysiological findings with definable morphological alterations, quantitative measurements of the brainstem structures in CT scans were made. To determine the relative size of the brainstem, the ratio between the sizes of the brainstem and its cisterns was obtained at the midbrain, upper and lower pons. When compared to the aged-matched control group, <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> as a whole and <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> with abnormal auditory brainstem responses had a decrease in the ratio at all three brainstem levels, but these ratios were not decreased in <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> with <b>the</b> normal auditory brainstem responses. The present data indicate that abnormal brainstem responses in <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> correlated with an increased size of the brainstem cisterns and possible brainstem atrophy...|$|R

5|$|Alcoholic {{beverage}} and {{the process}} of fermentation: The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation and the consumption of alcoholic beverages was discovered in neolithic China dating from 7000–6600 BC. Examination and analysis of ancient pottery jars from the neolithic village of Jiahu in Henan province in northern China revealed fermented residue left behind by <b>the</b> <b>alcoholic</b> beverages they once contained. According to {{a study published in the}} Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, chemical analysis of the residue revealed that the fermented drink was made from fruit, rice and honey. Elsewhere in the world, fermented beverages have been found dating from 6000 BC in Georgia, 3150 BC in ancient Egypt, 3000 BC in Babylon, 2000 BC in pre-Hispanic Mexico, and 1500 BC in Sudan.|$|E

5|$|Federal law prohibits {{alcoholic}} beverages from being shipped through the mail.

United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express will ship wine to a person's home, but will only deliver beer or hard liquor to a licensed business. Although uncommon, it is legal for a liquor store to deliver {{alcoholic beverages}} by car or van to a person's home.

40|$|Unstimulated and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) stimulated {{immunoglobulin}} (Ig) synthesis by {{peripheral blood}} mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro and plasma Ig concentrations were measured in {{three groups of}} alcoholic patients: (i) with clinical or biochemical signs of liver disease, (ii) with evidence of an alcohol related disease but no overt signs of liver damage and (iii) with no evidence of any alcohol related disease. The concentrations of IgG and IgA were significantly raised in the supernatants of unstimulated cultures of PBMC from the patients, while the stimulation of Ig synthesis by PWM, measured as a stimulation index, was significantly reduced. The ratio of the concentration of IgG to IgA was reduced in the unstimulated cultures of PBMC from <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics,</b> indicating a greater relative increase in IgA synthesis compared to IgG synthesis. Comparing <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> to <b>the</b> controls, {{it was found that the}} concentration of IgA in the plasma of <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> was increased, but that the concentration of IgG was not altered. Comparing the different groups of patients, it was found that the concentration of IgG in the plasma was higher in <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> with evidence of liver damage compared to alcoholics with alcohol related disease but no evidence of liver damage, and that the concentration of IgA in the plasma was higher in alcoholics with liver damage than those without. Otherwise there were no differences between <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> with respect to the synthesis of IgG or IgA or the plasma Ig concentrations. These results indicate that IgG synthesis by PBMC in vitro, and serum Ig concentration in vivo, are abnormal in all alcoholics, not just those with overt clinical or biochemical signs of liver damage...|$|R

5|$|Starting in 1738, {{towns in}} New Jersey began issuing liquor {{licenses}} to tavern keepers. Before federal Prohibition in 1919, despite many state liquor statutes, {{the regulation of}} alcoholic beverages in New Jersey was almost exclusively local, with wide variations among municipalities. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the states were again permitted to regulate alcoholic beverages. Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933, New Jersey instituted <b>the</b> <b>Alcoholic</b> Beverage Control Law, which established and granted rulemaking powers to the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. The law also established a three-tier alcohol distribution system whereby, with minor exceptions, alcohol manufacturers may only sell to wholesalers, who may only sell to retailers, who may only sell to customers.|$|E

5|$|Drunken Angel {{is often}} {{considered}} the director's first major work. Although the script, {{like all of}} Kurosawa's occupation-era works, {{had to go through}} forced rewrites due to American censorship, Kurosawa felt that this was the first film in which he was able to express himself freely. A grittily realistic story of a doctor who tries to save a gangster (yakuza) with tuberculosis, it was also the director's first film with Toshiro Mifune, who would proceed to play either the main or a major character in all but one (Ikiru) of the director's next 16 films. While Mifune was not cast as the protagonist in Drunken Angel, his explosive performance as the gangster so dominates the drama that he shifted the focus from the title character, <b>the</b> <b>alcoholic</b> doctor played by Takashi Shimura, who had already appeared in several Kurosawa movies. However, Kurosawa did not want to smother the young actor's immense vitality, and Mifune's rebellious character electrified audiences in much the way that Marlon Brando's defiant stance would startle American film audiences a few years later. The film premiered in Tokyo in April 1948 to rave reviews and was chosen by the prestigious Kinema Junpo critics poll as the best film of its year, the first of three Kurosawa movies to be so honored.|$|E
5|$|The first {{forms of}} art {{recognised}} on the Altiplano are petrographs and petroglyphs in various locations on the Altiplano, mainly {{at the rock}} shelters of the Bogotá savanna. El Abra, Piedras del Tunjo and Tequendama are among the oldest sites where rock art has been discovered. The Herrera Period, commonly defined from 800 BC to 800 AD, was {{the age of the}} first ceramics. The oldest Herrera pottery has been discovered in Tocarema and dates to 800 BC. Herrera art is also represented by the archaeoastronomical site, called El Infiernito by the Spanish. On a field outside Villa de Leyva, menhirs in the shape of aligned phalluses were erected. This site, the oldest remaining of constructed art, dated at 500 BC, formed an important place for religious rituals and festivities where great quantities of <b>the</b> <b>alcoholic</b> drink chicha was consumed. The evidence for festivities at this site are from a later date, already in the Muisca Period.|$|E
5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both <b>the</b> <b>alcoholic</b> and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{discusses}} {{the possibility of}} facilitating coexistence between user groups in an urban space by implementing clear demar- cations. This study reflects upon the future Enghave Plads and <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> affiliated with <b>the</b> former Enghave Plads. Due to the construc- tion of a new metro station on Enghave Plads the square will in the future perform the function of an urban space dominated by commuters; room for movement. This is the primary need that has been taken into consideration by Københavns Kommune and <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> are because of this prioritisation being excluded from the square. To re-integrate <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> on <b>the</b> future Enghave Plads it is of great importance to involve them {{in the design of}} a territory that will provide them with privacy, which they depend on in terms of being able to coexist with other user groups. Based on theories concerning the interaction between humans and the materials surround- ing them in urban spaces, a greater insight is provided concerning how to ensure the territory being embedded by <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> and <b>the</b> addi- tional groups. To understand this interaction the theories of Jan Gehl, Dag Østerberg and Zygmund Baumann has been accounted for and included in the analysis of the study. The study demonstrates that coexistence can only happen if both the alco- holics and the additional groups tolerate the ter- ritorial design...|$|R

5|$|Upon {{repeal of}} Prohibition and {{the passage of}} <b>the</b> <b>Alcoholic</b> Beverage Control Law, the ABC issued {{regulations}} that prohibited bars and liquor stores from selling alcohol to a person under 21, which was considered the age of majority at that time. In 1939, it became a criminal offense to sell alcohol to a person under 21, and for a person under 21 to purchase or consume alcohol in a licensed establishment. The state criminalized the underage possession of alcohol in motor vehicles and other public areas in 1957, possibly in response to young New Jerseyans traveling to New York, where the drinking age was 18, and returning home with liquor. For many years laws against underage drinking and the serving of alcohol to minors did not apply on private property, though an adult who supplied {{a substantial amount of}} liquor to an underage person could possibly be prosecuted for contributing to the delinquency of a minor Furthermore, arrests and criminal prosecutions for underage drinking in bars or public areas were very uncommon before the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Aims: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} a possible relationship between taste responses to sweet solutions and <b>alcoholic</b> status. Methods: <b>The</b> rated intensity and pleasantness of sucrose taste was compared in male alcoholics (n = 45) and non-alcoholic controls (n = 33). Results: The rated intensity, but not pleasantness, of water taste (0 % sucrose) was higher in <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics.</b> <b>The</b> two groups did not differ with respect to the rated intensity or pleasantness of sucrose solutions (1 – 30 %). The proportion of sweet-likers, i. e. subjects rating 30 % sucrose as most pleasant, was similar in both groups (the controls: 57. 6 %, the alcoholics: 62. 2 %). A sub-group of alcoholics with a paternal history of alcoholism (n = 22) rated the highest sucrose concentration as more pleasant compared to alcoholics without <b>alcoholic</b> fathers. <b>The</b> proportion of sweet-likers among <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> with a paternal history of alcoholism (77. 3 %) was significantly higher than that found in <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> without a familial history of alcoholism (47. 8 %). Conclusions: The present results suggest the following: (i) alcohol dependence is not associated with any major alterations in taste responses to sucrose solutions, (ii) sweet liking is a phenotypic marker of male alcoholics with a paternal history of alcoholism...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{was based on}} some personality traits of alcoholics such as specific ego qualities, special qualities of psychopathological and sociopathological characteristics of alcoholic offenders according {{to the type of}} criminal offence and non-offenders. The {{research was}} carried out in prison and hospital system during 2002 / 2003 in Popovača. Two groups of examinees were included. The experimental group (E) (N= 96) included the persons convicted for homicide (N 1 = 32), traffic offences (N 2 = 32) and offences against property (N 3 = 32). The control group (K) (N 4 = 64) included <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> undergoing hospital treatment at the Alcoholism Department of Neuropsychiatric hospital “Dr. Ivan Barbot” in Popovača.

There were no evident differences in the examined psychopathological variables among alcoholic offenders except that the offenders against property displayed more aggression than the homicide offenders. Among criminal offenders, <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> exhibited most sociopathological characteristics and the traffic offenders and offenders against property the least. The criminal offenders exhibited more sociopathological characteristics than <b>alcoholic</b> non-offenders. <b>The</b> homicide and traffic offenders and non-offenders differed the most in the family problem variable – <b>the</b> <b>alcoholics</b> in their current families...|$|R
