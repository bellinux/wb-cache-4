5|$|After the Lord's Test, Miller {{enjoyed a}} night out and {{returned}} to the team hotel after daybreak the next morning. Australia were due to play Surrey at The Oval that day. With Australia in the field, Bradman sent Miller <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> leg boundary as a punishment—between overs, he was forced to walk the length of the field. One of the spectators felt sorry for Miller and lent him his bicycle, which Miller used to cycle around the circumference of the ground.|$|E

Brick farm houses built separately from barns are found in Zeeland, but none have survived in other locations. Unlike the common practice in New York, the farm houses in Zeeland do not have separate outside doors for each room. The Dutch also used bricks to pave the roads, or chaussees, in the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|Again about 1505 the {{rebuilding}} {{of the church of}} San Pietro in Oliveto began, a commission probably won by Sanmicheli. Note that the reliefs are the only figurative works there, in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> carvings on pilasters and frames of the chapels, a specialism of the Sanmicheli that no longer met contemporary tastes. The ultimate answer from Gasparo not long in coming: with the ark of Sant'Apollonio of 1508, he established once and for all his artistic superiority, which was by then certainly much more preferred by the Brescian clientele.|$|E

The Senate passed the Act unanimously through voice vote, and it passed the House of Representatives 265–79. Signed into law by President Harry S. Truman on August 1, 1946, it went into effect on January 1, 1947, and the Atomic Energy Commission assumed responsibility for nuclear energy from the wartime Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|Once Beach {{accepted}} the commission on March 12, 1928, Juliette Fraser's sketches were forwarded to him. On April 7, he sent completed models to the Mint and photographs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fine</b> Arts Commission. Both the Mint and Houston responded with criticism, the former that {{the relief of}} the coin was high and difficult to reduce to coin-sized hubs. On April 19, Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock wrote in a memorandum that the coin {{would be very hard}} to produce because the area of greatest relief on each side was in the same part of the design. Beach agreed to lower any high points that might cause the Mint difficulty.|$|E

Moore sent his commission's approval to Grant on March 26, with several recommendations, including that the motto E Pluribus Unum, present on the obverse in Sinnock's sketches, and the sun's rays on the reverse, be omitted. The rays were not removed, and the motto {{was moved to the}} reverse. Approval of the models followed in April, again with minor suggestions.|$|E

It argued that before Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz, a federal district judge for the Southern District of California, who granted an injunction against NOAA prohibiting it from selling the fins itself. The company and the agency then agreed that, in return for the former putting up a $775,000 bond, that it would take possession of the shark fins, although they remained in cold storage pending the outcome of the case. Tai Loong presold the fins for an amount almost equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> against it. NOAA then initiated a civil forfeiture action with the bond substituting for the fins.|$|E

Now accustomed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> fashions of court, Bran expresses dismay at finding Mel dressed in old clothes - she never before cared about her appearance. Mel becomes shy and embarrassed about her lack of courtly finesse and grace, and avoids the visitors, especially Shevraeth, who she fears looks down on her.

5|$|Inter-Sultanate marriages {{normalised}} {{relations and}} Ali I (1557–1580) joined a confederacy of Sultanates who eventually inflicted a crushing defeat on the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565. The most notable {{ruler of the}} dynasty was Ibrahim II (1580–1626) who ascended the throne as a nine-year-old with Chandbibi, the king's aunt acting as the regent. Later when Ibrahim II was defeated by {{the first of the}} Moghul incursions into the Deccan, he gave his daughter in marriage to Daniyal, a son of Emperor Akbar, but managed to collect tributes from the former feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire. According to a historian, the rule of Ibrahim II was the high point of the Bijapur Sultanate. A tolerant king inclined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> arts, the earliest book on music in Urdu language called Kitab-e-Nauras is ascribed to him. The opening song in the book is an invocation of the Hindu Goddess Saraswati. During the rule of his son Muhammad, Shahji Bhosle from Ahmadnagar joined the Bijapur army and along with commander Ranadullah Khan conducted many successful campaigns in the southern Deccan collecting tribute from local rulers there. The final end of the diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from Vellore came during these campaigns.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{different}} types of fines to adsorb colloidal extractives and whether this adsorption is influenced by pH and the addition of NaCl, have been measured. In order <b>to</b> produce <b>the</b> different <b>fines,</b> chips from Norway spruce were refined in a pilot refiner. This was executed four successive times, producing different types of <b>fines.</b> Most of <b>the</b> <b>fines</b> were removed from the pulp by washing before further refining. <b>The</b> <b>fines</b> were washed and centrifuged before the adsorption measurements. A colloidal dispersion of extractives was produced by extracting TMP with acetone, and rapidly mixing this extract with water. After the acetone had been removed, the colloidal dispersion was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fines</b> and <b>the</b> adsorption isotherms were measured. Below pH 5 there was clear adsorption of <b>the</b> colloids <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fines,</b> which was not seen between pH 5 and 8. The adsorption at pH 3 was strongly influenced by the addition of NaCl. A rough estimation of the specific surface of <b>the</b> <b>fines</b> indicated that <b>the</b> different <b>fines</b> had similar abilities <b>to</b> adsorb <b>the</b> colloidal wood resin per square meter...|$|R
