5|$|In {{the season}} opener, the Wolverines played the Western Michigan Broncos at Michigan Stadium. The Wolverines scored first, {{midway through the}} first quarter, with a 27-yard {{touchdown}} (TD) pass from Tate Forcier to Junior Hemingway. They added to their lead five minutes later when Denard Robinson ran in a TD from 43 yards out. In the second quarter, Michigan added 17 more points: <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> and a field goal. First was a 7-yard TD pass from Tate Forcier to Kevin Koger. 6 minutes later, Jason Olesnavage kicked a 44-yard field goal. Junior Hemingway scored Michigan's final points when he caught a 44-yard TD pass from Tate Forcier, putting the Wolverines up 31–0 at halftime. Western Michigan missed a field goal just {{before the end of}} the half.|$|E
25|$|For the {{purposes}} of elections to Dáil Éireann, the town {{is part of the}} five seat Louth constituency which returns five TDs. Following the 2016 general election, the constituency elected <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> for Sinn Féin (left wing), <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> for Fine Gael party (centre right), and one TD for Fianna Fáil (centre to centre-right).|$|E
25|$|Brennan {{finished}} 37-of-50 for 401yards and <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> but his pass {{attempt on}} fourth-and-14 from Oregon State's 26 fell short {{and so did}} Hawaii's comeback.|$|E

25|$|Harrell, {{who threw}} for 445 yards and <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> while also {{running for a}} TD, {{was chosen as the}} {{offensive}} MVP. Tech cornerback Antonio Huffman was defensive MVP. Other top performers for Tech included Woods (109 yards and three TDs rushing) and Filani (nine catches for 144 yards and a TD).|$|E
25|$|For the {{purposes}} of elections to Dáil Éireann, the city is part of two constituencies: Cork North-Central and Cork South-Central which each returns four TDs. Following the 2016 general election, these constituencies together returned <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> for the Fine Gael party, three for Fianna Fáil, two for Sinn Féin {{and one for the}} Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit.|$|E
25|$|Lyle Leong snared three {{touchdown}} passes from Harrell, who was 38-for-51 for 454 yards. Texas Tech scored on seven straight possessions {{and did not}} attempt a punt until Taylor Potts replaced Harrell late in the fourth quarter. Heisman candidate Michael Crabtree had nine catches for 107 yards and <b>two</b> <b>TDs.</b> With six, Harrell tied his career-best for {{touchdown passes}}, getting the ball to ten different receivers.|$|E

5000|$|Rutgers {{running back}} Ray Rice ran for 170 {{yards and a}} touchdown, Tim Brown caught <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> passes and the 16th-ranked Scarlet Knights won a bowl game {{for the first time}} in program history, beating Kansas State 37-10 in the Texas Bowl.|$|R
50|$|Steelman {{paced the}} Army offense with 128 yards passing and <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> passes to Malcom Brown {{to go along}} with a team-high 74 yards rushing. Army would {{dominate}} the game from an offensive standpoint holding edges in, total yards, rushing yards, and time of possession. They would also hold a 4−2 edge on turnovers, but the fumble recovery and <b>two</b> big play <b>TD</b> passes by Dobbs would be too much to overcome.|$|R
25|$|The fifth-largest {{crowd in}} Razorback Stadium history watched the Hogs and Dogs pile up over 1,000 yards of offense and {{numerous}} school records. Georgia QB Joe Cox threw for 375 yards and five scores. Bulldogs receiver A. J. Green had seven catches for 137 {{yards and two}} scores. Ryan Mallett of Arkansas completed 21 of 39 for 408 yards and five touchdowns. The yardage and touchdown totals both are school records. Razorback receiver Greg Childs caught five passes for 140 yards and <b>two</b> <b>TDs.</b>|$|E
25|$|Arkansas went to Scott Field to play winless-in-the-SEC Mississippi State. The Razorbacks defense held on {{a fourth}} down play which saved the game. The Razorbacks ran for 237 yards, 121 of those from {{freshman}} tailback De'Arruis Howard. Fred Talley fell {{just short of}} his fourth 100-yard game as he ran for 94 yards. Mississippi State used two quarterbacks, Kevin Fant was 14-of-26 for 115 yards with an interception.

25|$|UCLA led 7–0 after Hundley {{connected}} with Duarte for a score on their opening drive. However, Stanford's Kevin Hogan was 14 for 15 for 189 yards and <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> {{in the first}} half to lead the Cardinal to a 21–10 halftime lead. After Stanford scored on their first possession of the second half, they proceeded to control the clock. Stanford outgained UCLA in yardage 436–262 and had possession of the ball for almost 38 minutes. Backup Jerry Neuheisel finished the game after Hundley exited {{in the middle of the}} fourth quarter with an injured throwing hand.|$|E

40|$|AbstractVolatility Tandem Differential Mobility Analysers (VTDMAs) {{are widely}} used for {{determining}} the volatile and refractory fractions and thus the mixing state of aerosols particles. A three-channel VTDMA consisting of <b>two</b> thermodenuders (<b>TDs)</b> with distinct designs (i. e., the NanoTD, having a straight tube design, and a coiled TD; cTD) and a by-pass line was built and fully characterized. Both TDs were tested using laboratory-generated aerosol particles (single compound and core–shell particles) as well as atmospheric aerosols observed at an urban background station. The NanoTD exhibited high particle penetration efficiency and negligible thermophoretic losses, making it advantageous for ultrafine particle analysis, especially in environments with low particle concentration. The cTD allows longer particle residence time for the same flow rate, resulting in higher particle volatilization in some cases. Higher particle losses in this TD, both thermophoretic and diffusional, pose a limitation when dealing with low particle concentrations. The difference in the performance between the thermodenuders was only noticed at intermediate temperatures, at which particle volume loss becomes more pronounced. These temperatures vary among aerosols, since the volatilization rate depends on the chemical complexity {{and size of the}} particles sampled. Differences in the aerosol volume fraction remaining after heating with the <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> designs exhibited a maximum of 20 % for single-compound particles and 12 % for urban background aerosols. Measurements using core–shell particles yielded differences of up to 21 % in particle volatilization, independently of particle size, when comparing the system using either of the <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> designs. Similar results were obtained with the <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> designs at higher operating temperatures (e. g., 230 °C), indicating that at this temperature most of the material on the particles was evaporated...|$|R
50|$|Penn State quarterback Daryll Clark {{passed for}} 310 {{yards and four}} {{touchdown}}s against Michigan State. He set a school record with 23 touchdown passes on the season and set the Penn State career record with 42. Running back Evan Royster gained 114 yards on 13 carries. Graham Zug and Andrew Quarless caught <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> passes each.|$|R
25|$|At the 2011 general {{election}} the Socialist Party returned <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> to Dáil Éireann: Clare Daly was elected for the Dublin North constituency, while Joe Higgins regained {{his seat in}} Dublin West. The Socialist Party contested this election {{as part of the}} United Left Alliance (ULA), a political alliance which included both People Before Profit Alliance (PBPA) and Workers and Unemployed Action Group (WUAG), as well as independent activists. The Alliance won five seats in the national parliament. Higgins resigned his European Parliament seat, and Paul Murphy was selected by the party to replace him. Following the death of Brian Lenihan, Jnr, the Socialist Party contested the 2011 Dublin West by-election, with its candidate Ruth Coppinger coming in third. The Socialist Party also called for a referendum on the December 2011 EU deal, which it opposed.|$|E
25|$|In Week 3 {{against the}} Kansas City Chiefs, he {{completed}} the then-longest touchdown pass {{in his career}} for 70 yards to Roddy White. The 70-yard touchdown pass to White was the longest pass completion for the Falcons since December 23, 2007, when Chris Redman threw a 74-yard touchdown pass. In the same game Ryan completed passes to 6 different players. The following week, he threw for 194 yards and <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> against the Green Bay Packers. His touchdown passes went to Roddy White and tight end Justin Peelle. The following week against the Chicago Bears Ryan led the Falcons to a comeback win. With 6 seconds left he completed a 26-yard strike to Michael Jenkins that set Jason Elam up for the game-winning field goal as time expired. Ryan finished the game 22-of-30 for a then career-high 301 passing yards. He also had a key fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Roddy White. On Atlanta's first offensive drive, Ryan completed all five of his pass attempts for 57 yards {{en route to a}} Falcons field goal and a 30 lead. Ryan was named Diet Pepsi Rookie of the Week for his performance.|$|E
25|$|On 7 December, Anti-Treaty IRA gunmen shot <b>two</b> <b>TDs,</b> Sean Hales and Pádraic Ó Máille, in Dublin as {{they were}} on their way to the Dáil. Hales was killed and O'Máille was badly wounded. After an {{emergency}} cabinet meeting, the Free State government decided on the retaliatory executions of four prominent Republicans (one from each province). Accordingly, on 8 December 1922, the day after Hales' killing, four members of the IRA Army Executive, who had been in jail since the first week of the war - Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Richard Barrett and Joe McKelvey - were executed in revenge. O'Connor and Mellows particularly were revered heroes of the War of Independence. This was arguably an unlawful act, as the four Republicans had been captured before the Dáil passed the legislation authorising executions. Later on the same day the Dáil debated the executions and retrospectively approved them by a vote of 39-14. One of the poignant aspects of the incident was that O'Connor and Kevin O'Higgins were formerly close friends, and O'Connor had been best man at O'Higgins' wedding just a few months previously. Historian Michael Hopkinson reports that Richard Mulcahy had pressed for the executions and that Kevin O'Higgins was the last member of cabinet to give his consent.|$|E
50|$|Shane Vereen {{finished}} with 154 yards in 17 carries and Marvin Jones caught <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> passes from Kevin Riley in his four receptions {{for a total}} of 89 yards. Giorgio Tavecchio kicked a 24-yard field goal in the third quarter and Mychal Kendricks returned a 68-yard touchdown interception for Cal in the fourth quarter with 5 minutes remaining in the game.|$|R
50|$|Chicago's offense {{sputtered}} {{for most}} of the game after the first <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> passes. Anthony Thomas left the game with a broken right index finger and did not return {{for the rest of the}} season. Third string QB Henry Burris threw a 45-yard TD pass to Marcus Robinson with 10 seconds left in the game, but it had little impact on the final outcome.|$|R
25|$|After the Seahawks {{gained a}} {{surprise}} division title with a 7–9 regular season record {{and an even}} more miraculous playoff victory over the defending champion Saints, they headed to Chicago in the divisional round. However, there was no repeat of Week 6 this time. On a gray, fog-shrouded winter afternoon, Jay Cutler threw <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> passes as the Bears overpowered their opponent 35–24 {{to advance to the}} NFC Championship.|$|R
25|$|Flutie {{became the}} Buffalo Bills' quarterback five games into the 1998 season. The Bills were {{initially}} uninterested in signing him, but then-pro personnel director A.J. Smith convinced {{the organization that}} Flutie {{would be a great}} asset to the team. In his first action with the Bills, Flutie entered for an injured Rob Johnson and passed for <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> while leading a fourth-quarter comeback against the Indianapolis Colts on October 11, 1998. The following week, Doug Flutie made his first NFL start since October 15, 1989, against the unbeaten Jacksonville Jaguars. The nine-year gap between starts for a quarterback in the NFL is the third-longest in duration behind Tommy Maddox (December 12, 1992 to October 6, 2002) and Todd Collins (December 14, 1997 to December 16, 2007). Flutie was the hero of the Bills' victory as he scored the winning touchdown against the Jaguars by rolling out on a bootleg and into the end zone on a fourth-down play in the waning seconds. The Bills' success continued with Flutie at the helm; his record as a starter that season was 8 wins and 3 losses. Flutie was selected to play in the 1998 Pro Bowl, and is currently the shortest quarterback to make the Pro Bowl since 1970.|$|E
25|$|Even {{after the}} {{election}} of Bobby Sands as MP for Fermanagh/South Tyrone, {{a part of the}} mass mobilisation associated with the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike by republican prisoners in the H blocks of the Maze Prison (known as Long Kesh by republicans), Adams was cautious that the level of political involvement by Sinn Féin could lead to electoral embarrassment. Charles Haughey, the Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland, called an election for June 1981. At an Ard Chomhairle meeting, Adams recommended that they contest only four constituencies which were in border counties. Instead, H-Block/Armagh candidates contested nine constituencies and elected <b>two</b> <b>TDs.</b> This, along with the election of Sands, was a precursor to an electoral breakthrough in elections in 1982 to the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly. Adams, Danny Morrison, Martin McGuinness, Jim McAllister, and Owen Carron were elected as abstentionists. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) had announced before the election that it would not take any seats and so its 14 elected representatives also abstained from participating in the Assembly and it was a failure. The 1982 election was followed by the 1983 Westminster election, in which Sinn Féin's vote increased and Gerry Adams was elected, as an abstentionist, as MP for Belfast West. It was in 1983 that Ruairí Ó Brádaigh resigned as President of Sinn Féin and was succeeded by Gerry Adams.|$|E
2500|$|Reserve sophomore {{running back}} Mikell Simpson racked up 119 yards rushing and <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> {{to go along}} with 152 {{receiving}} yards, for 271 all-purpose yards, as 19th-ranked Virginia came from behind to defeat Maryland. The game ended when, with 16 seconds left, Simpson dived into the endzone as the ball was knocked out of his hands. It was ruled a touchdown and Virginia defeated Maryland. Terps coach Ralph Friedgen said [...] "I saw the ball come out on the goal line. I saw it and I don't think he had possession." [...] Simpson himself stated, [...] "It crossed the line. I knew I scored because I looked down and saw the yellow line and I saw the ball cross [...] they hit it out." [...] With the victory, the Cavaliers reached seven wins in a row {{for the first time since}} 1990 and for only the fourth time in school history. They also accomplished the feat in 1914 and 1949. That season, Virginia won an NCAA record of five games by two points or less, with the other edged teams being North Carolina, Middle Tennessee State, Connecticut, and Wake Forest.|$|E
25|$|The Seahawks then {{traveled}} to Chicago for a rematch with the Bears in the divisional round, but as most experts predicted, the latter {{won the game}} easily: thanks to <b>two</b> passing <b>TDs</b> and <b>two</b> rushing <b>TDs</b> by Jay Cutler, the Bears jumped out to a 21-0 halftime lead and eventually defeated the Seahawks 35-24. It would mark {{the third time in}} five years that the Seahawks were eliminated in the divisional round, and the second time by the Bears.|$|R
25|$|Central Michigan quarterback Dan LeFevour {{set a new}} FBS {{record for}} most {{combined}} career touchdowns passing, rushing, and receiving in the MAC Championship Game against Ohio. His <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> passes in the game gave him a career total of 148, surpassing the previous record of 147 held by Colt Brennan of Hawaii and Graham Harrell of Texas Tech. In the GMAC Bowl, he passed for a TD and ran for another, ending his career {{with a total of}} 150 TDs.|$|R
25|$|However, Shanahan {{suddenly}} reversed {{direction by}} naming veteran backup Rex Grossman {{to the starting}} position. In Week 1, Grossman threw for 305 yards and <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> passes as the Redskins crushed the Giants 28-14, ending a six-game losing streak against that team. After beating the Cardinals in Week 2, the Redskins {{got off to a}} surprise 2-0 start. In Week 3, they played the Cowboys on MNF and lost a poorly played game where the latter edged them out with six field goals to win 18-16.|$|R
2500|$|After {{speculation}} {{of where}} the game would be played due to the California wildfires, it was confirmed on October 26, 2007 that Qualcomm Stadium would be discontinued as an evacuation site for San Diego residents (with most of the evacuees moved to Del Mar). Before, sites in the Phoenix area were being considered to host the game, as well as Houston's Reliant Stadium, and also the Dallas Cowboys' Texas Stadium. Before the game a special tribute was paid to at the stadium for the fire fighters, National Guard, and volunteers who assisted in fighting the fires and helping the evacuees. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger attended the game and flipped the coin, which the Chargers won. With an emotional charge from both the players and fans, {{as well as some}} victims, the Chargers played one of the best games of their season. Philip Rivers threw 3 touchdown passes despite only throwing 11 passes. <b>Two</b> <b>TDs</b> went to tight end Antonio Gates, and the remainder went to newly acquired wideout Chris Chambers, who was just traded from the Miami Dolphins a two weeks earlier and played his first game as a Charger (due to San Diego's bye week). However, that performance was second to second-year corner Antonio Cromartie, who performance included two interceptions, and two defensive touchdowns. He had a 70-yard INT return for a score, and the other was a complicated snap where the Texans snapped the ball over punter Matt Turk's head, and the ball fell into the end zone. Quickly having to recover, Turk missed grabbing the ball and it fell into the hands of Cromartie, easily scoring. The Chargers won, 35–10 in a home blowout, which was, in the quote of LaDainian Tomlinson, [...] "one for the fans." ...|$|E

25|$|The Redskins traded {{all their}} high level draft picks to St. Louis for taking Baylor QB Robert Griffin III #2 in the 2012 draft. Although {{the need for}} a {{franchise}} QB was obvious, many football experts doubted the wisdom of such a trade for one player. Griffin silenced his critics in Week 1 as Washington won a surprise upset over the Saints in New Orleans. The rookie QB threw for 320 yards and <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> passes in a 40-32 victory for the Redskins' highest scoring game since 2005.|$|R
5000|$|Matt Dunigan, who {{completed}} only 12 of 29 passes, throwing for 142 yards, including <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> passes, {{was playing with}} a separated shoulder (frozen for the Grey Cup game), suffered the previous week in the East Final. He finally completed a Grey Cup victory from start to finish. Previously, he lost with the Edmonton Eskimos in 1986, was injured out of Edmonton's classic 1987 victory, lost to the BC Lions in 1988, and later would lose with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 1992 {{and was unable to}} play in the 1993 Grey Cup (due to injury, with Winnipeg).|$|R
