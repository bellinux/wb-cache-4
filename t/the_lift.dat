5|$|After {{the train}} departs from the station, it {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching the top of <b>the</b> <b>lift,</b> the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as the train exits <b>the</b> <b>lift,</b> it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in {{the layout of the}} roller coaster. The train speeds through the station going back up <b>the</b> <b>lift.</b> Once it loses momentum the train then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds back up the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, the train is stopped near the top of <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> hill. It is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the train. The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator's discretion. When the train stops on <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> hill {{at the end of the}} ride, instead of lowering slowly back to the station, the chain will raise the car up and send it through the ride again.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lift</b> {{bridge is}} the last of several {{previous}} crossings over the waterway. A wooden swing bridge was built in 1875. A newer, iron swing bridge was built in 1897; this structure was partially destroyed in 1905 when it was struck by a ship. This second crossing was rebuilt in 1906 and remained in service until <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> bridge was opened in December 1959. The current bridge was last used for railroad traffic in the summer of 1982, after the Soo Line rail lines north of Houghton were abandoned starting in 1976. The middle section is left in an intermediate position for the warmer nine months of the year so that vehicle traffic can use the lower deck of <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> span and pleasure craft can pass under the bridge. In the winter, <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> span is lowered so snowmobiles and skiers can use the lower deck while cars and trucks use the upper deck.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe present <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> scheme, a {{new idea}} for {{constructing}} compactly supported wavelets with compactly supported duals. <b>The</b> <b>lifting</b> scheme uses a simple relationship between all multiresolution analyses with the same scaling function. It isolates the degrees of freedom remaining after fixing the biorthogonality relations. Then one has full control over these degrees of freedom to custom design the wavelet for a particular application. <b>The</b> <b>lifting</b> scheme can also speed up the fast wavelet transform.

5|$|It {{had been}} {{expected}} that use of the chutes to transfer salt between the canal and the river would cease once <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> was opened, but {{by the turn of}} the 19th century, although there were 190,000 tons of cargo using <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> each year, 38,000 tons of salt were still being transferred by chute. From the middle of the 19th century, some of the salt traffic transferred to the railways, and the use of pipelines through which the brine was pumped also affected trade, but as that source of revenue declined, a chemical industry developed in the area around Northwich, which became the major source of income for the Navigation.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{carries out}} a {{research}} on the dynamic performance of the template during the lowing operation through splash-zone. During <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> operation, especially under harsh environment, the waves, winds {{as well as the}} currents will leave significant influences on the template. Hence, to study how the template performed under such environmental conditions is the main purpose of this thesis. A brief introduction to the marine operation industry as well as <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> operation is presented first. During the installation, template is exposed to the magnificent dynamic loads from the environment. So during <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> process, <b>the</b> forces acting on the template as well as the displacement of the template should be inspected and controlled. Thus, the wave description and an introduction to the different dynamic loads due to the wave movement are performed. In addition, the methodology and the theory background of SIMA program is also included in this thesis. After building up the model of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> system in SIMA, the static and dynamic analysis of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> operation is performed. The results of the static and dynamic analysis are all listed in the thesis as figures or tables. The finding of the studies shows that the template experiences a significant drift in the wave induced direction for all sea-states. Besides, the dynamic load of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> lines can be more than twice than the static load. This will lead to a huge challenge to the capacity of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> wires. Additionally, <b>the</b> vertical motion of the template is sufficient large during <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> operation and may lead to potential risk. Overall, the environmental conditions have magnificent influences on <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> structures. In particular, lifting operations must not take place once the significant wave height exceeds an up-limitation. On <b>the</b> meantime, <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> action needs to be paused if the wave peak period is approaching a critical value. </p...|$|R
