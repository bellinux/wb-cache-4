5|$|In 1989, NeXT {{struck a}} deal for former Compaq {{reseller}} Businessland to sell NeXT computers in select markets nationwide. Selling through a retailer was a major change from NeXT's original business model of only selling directly to students and educational institutions. Businessland founder David Norman predicted <b>that</b> <b>sales</b> of the NeXT Computer would surpass sales of Compaq computers after 12months.|$|E

He suggested to the Press-Enterprise that his operation was so diffuse <b>that</b> <b>sales</b> of his one-dollar sex education pamphlets were too difficult to track accurately. Babb eventually sold the rights to Mom and Dad and his stake in Modern Film Distributors to Erwin Joseph and Floyd Lewis—former partners in Modern Film who would continue to showcase Mom and Dad across the United States.|$|E

In June 2015, Bethesda announced that a sequel, Dishonored 2, was in development, featuring Corvo and Emily as playable characters. Dishonored 2 was released on 11 November 2016. In June 2017, Bethesda announced a standalone spinoff, , which was released on 15 September 2017.|$|E

5|$|Six {{months after}} the release of the iPhone 5S, on March 25, 2014, Apple {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>sales</b> of the iPhone brand had exceeded 500 million units. By May 2014, despite having been on the market for eight months, the iPhone 5S reportedly outsold the newly released Samsung Galaxy S5 by 40%, with 7 million iPhone 5S units versus 5 million Galaxy S5 units. The Galaxy S5's failure to oust the iPhone 5S from the top selling spot was a major setback for Samsung Mobile, as the preceding Samsung Galaxy SIII and Samsung Galaxy S4, {{in the first quarter of}} their releases, had outsold the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The first copies were {{delivered}} to bookstores on September 10. Many were wary of it, {{due to its}} technical nature, and feared <b>that</b> <b>sales</b> would be low. An exception was Scribner's Bookstores, which placed large early orders. At Oak Ridge, the Manhattan Project's major production site, 8,000 copies were sold through the employee welfare organization. Similar arrangements were made for Los Alamos and Richland, which were located in areas where bookstores were scarce.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the first}} few days of operation, Rise of Mana had 500,000 active players. Within a month of its release, that number had {{increased}} to one million registered players. In an interview, Oyamada said <b>that</b> <b>sales</b> of the title had increased with the release of more powerful mobile devices. By May 2015, the smartphone versions had over two million registered players. The Vita version was similarly successful: within two months of release, it had been downloaded 100,000 times. That figure rose by an additional 50,000 over the following month.|$|E
5|$|A {{prevailing}} design philosophy for A Realm Reborn was {{to simultaneously}} appeal to hardcore MMORPG players while {{reaching out to}} new players and Final Fantasy fans who had never experienced the genre before. As a consequence, Yoshida held optimizing gameplay for controllers as a top priority. To streamline development, he made about 400 fundamental design decisions which eliminated time lost to getting approvals, {{with a focus on}} implementing standard features of the genre first. The new workflow pipeline was tested using updates to the original game and applied to development of A Realm Reborn. The continuing operations of the original release also provided a valuable testing ground for new features that would be carried into the relaunch. Throughout this process, Yoshida emphasized that communication with players and restoring their trust was key, even admitting <b>that</b> <b>sales</b> were secondary compared to redeeming the reputation of the series. Live streaming conversations between the development team and fans, such as the Letters from the Producer LIVE events, became a major element of Yoshida's player outreach strategy.|$|E
5|$|By {{that year}} the bikini made up nearly 20% of {{swimsuit}} sales, {{more than any}} other model in the US. As skin cancer awareness grew and a simpler aesthetic defined fashion in the 1990s, sales of the skimpy bikini decreased dramatically. The new swimwear code was epitomized by surf star Malia Jones, who appeared on the June 1997 cover of Shape Magazine wearing a halter top two-piece for rough water. After the 90s, however, the bikini came back again. US market research company NPD Group reported <b>that</b> <b>sales</b> of two-piece swimsuits nationwide jumped 80% in two years. On one hand the one-piece made a big comeback in the 1980s and early 1990s, on the other bikinis became briefer with the string bikini in the 1970s and 80s.|$|E

5|$|In December 2014, Image {{published}} Saga Deluxe Edition Volume 1, a hardcover volume {{collecting the}} first 18 {{issues of the}} series, which comprise its first three story arcs. Because Vaughn sees Saga as a story about Hazel, he and Staples decided to have each new hardcover volume feature an original image of that character at a different stage of her life. Because the first volume covers her birth and infancy, its cover features a closeup of Hazel nursing from her mother's breast, set {{against the backdrop of}} Landfall and Wreath, which recalls the first issue's cover. Eric Stephenson warned Vaughn and Staples that some retailers and distributors would object to this cover image, thus limiting the series' audience, but after seeing Staples' rendition of the image, Stephenson decided <b>that</b> <b>sales</b> would not be a problem.|$|E
5|$|Looking Glass {{intended}} Flight Unlimited as {{a gateway}} into {{the video game}} publishing industry. According to Lerner, the idea of self-publishing had been considered when the company was founded. In 1995, Looking Glass projected <b>that</b> <b>sales</b> of Flight Unlimited would increase royalty revenues to $10 million that year, up from $1.5 million in 1994. Jeffrey A. Kalowski, the company's vice president of finance and administration, expected that the game would recoup its development costs and make a return {{before the end of}} the year. He predicted that, over the following 12 to 18 months, the company's number of employees would increase from 52 to 82. The company's executive vice president and general manager, Jerry Wolosenko, told The Boston Globe that the company hoped to publish six games each year. According to Doug Church, the pressure for Flight Unlimited to succeed meant that the concurrently-developed System Shock, which was not self-published, received little attention from the company's management.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines was {{completed}} in September 1990. The game did not go through quality assurance, and as a result, a major bug that caused the game to crash was discovered near completion. The bug occurred when the player tried to reverse on the first race, and escaped notice because none of the testers thought to do so as {{they thought it was}} so easy. It was determined that just one binary bit was wrong, and a device that functioned like a miniature Game Genie was installed on the cartridges to correct it, as by the time the bug was discovered, there were plenty of ROM chips containing the bugged version. Micro Machines was released for the NES by Camerica in 1991. Nintendo wanted development halted because Codemasters did not have a licence from them, and sued Galoob over the sales of the Game Genie. Courts ruled in Galoob's favour (Nintendo appealed, but the ruling was upheld), but the legal issues meant <b>that</b> <b>sales</b> of the NES version were not as good as hoped.|$|E

5|$|On 23 May 2013, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>sales</b> of the HTC One {{had reached}} around 5 million since its launch in March. By comparison, the iPhone 5 sold 5 million units within its {{first three days}} of availability and the Galaxy S4 shipped 10 million units within its first month of availability. While not quoting any further numbers, Mark Woodward, president of HTC’s North American division, considered the HTC One’s launch {{to have been the}} most successful in the company’s history. In response to its success, HTC released two other HTC One-branded devices throughout 2013 that extended traits and design elements from the device into other form factors, including the mid-range HTC One Mini, and HTC One Max phablet.|$|E
5|$|Sega {{announced}} {{the release of}} the Mega-CD in Japan for late 1991, and North America (as the Sega CD) in 1992. It was unveiled to the public {{for the first time at}} the 1991 Tokyo Toy Show, to positive reception from critics. The Mega-CD would go on to be released in Japan on December 12, 1991, initially retailing at JP¥49,800. Though the unit sold quickly, the small install base of the Mega Drive in Japan meant <b>that</b> <b>sales</b> declined rapidly after launch. Within its first year in Japan, the Mega-CD only sold 100,000 units. Third-party development of games for the new system suffered because Sega took a long amount of time to release software development kits. Other factors impacting sales included the high launch price of the Mega-CD in Japan and only two titles being available at launch.|$|E
5|$|Be Here Now was {{released}} in the UK on 21 August 1997. The release date had been brought forward out of Ignition's fear that import copies of the album from the United States would arrive in Britain before that country's designated street date. Worrying that TV news cameras would interview queuing fans at a traditional midnight opening session, Ignition forced retailers to sign contracts pledging not to sell the record earlier than 8:00am. However, when the album did go on sale, the cameras showed up regardless, {{just in time to}} record the initially slow trade. It was not until lunch time <b>that</b> <b>sales</b> picked up. By {{the end of the first}} day of release, Be Here Now sold over 424,000 units and by the end of business on Saturday of that week sales had reached 663,389, making it, at the time, the fastest-selling album in British history. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard charts in the United States kept off the #1 spot by Puff Daddy's No Way Out, but its first week sales of 152,000—below expected sales of 400,000 copies—were considered a disappointment.|$|E

5|$|In July 2007, Sony {{announced}} {{a drop in}} the price of the console by $100. This measure only applied to the 60 GB models and was exclusive to the United States and Canada, where those models are no longer in production.

5|$|The {{disposal}} of military {{equipment and materials}} was also a key priority {{after the end of}} the war.

The timing of equipment release had to be carefully planned, however, to avoid harming employment by creating surpluses of manufactured goods. Planning for the {{disposal of}} equipment began in 1943 and the Commonwealth Disposals Commission was established to oversee the sale or destruction of equipment on September 1944. Before the commission was established the Government decided that ex-military equipment would be offered to other government agencies before being made available to the public, <b>that</b> <b>sales</b> to the public were to be made on a 'as is, where is' basis and be processed through existing trade channels or public auction at 'fair market prices' and that payment was to be required in cash. Some special priorities were also established; farmers were to be given priority for motor vehicles, machine tools were to be allocated to ex-servicemen and training colleges and special consideration was to be given to the needs of the Red Cross and other overseas and domestic charitable associations.|$|E
