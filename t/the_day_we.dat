So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E

25|$|She {{was born}} in Dublin and grew up at 48 Cherryfield Avenue in the Dublin suburb of Ranelagh. Her parents, Robert and Úna Brennan, were Republicans and were deeply {{involved}} in the Irish political and cultural struggles of the early twentieth century. They participated in the 1916 Easter Rising but while Úna was imprisoned for a few days, Robert was sentenced to death. The sentence was commuted to penal servitude. His continuing political activity resulted in further imprisonments in 1917 and 1920. Maeve was born while he was in prison. He was director of publicity for the anti-Treaty Irish Republican Army during the Irish Civil War. He also founded and was the director of The Irish Press newspaper. His imprisonments and activities greatly fragmented Maeve Brennan's childhood. In her story <b>The</b> <b>Day</b> <b>We</b> Got Our Own Back she recounts her memory of how, when she was five, her home was raided by Free State forces looking for her father, who was on the run.|$|E

500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 20 February 1961 dozens of ITAK volunteers staged a satyagraha at the Jaffna Kachcheri. Among them were several ITAK MPs {{including}} Chelvanayakam. As Government Agent M. Srikantha and Superintendent of Police Richard Arndt tried to leave Old Park in a jeep the protesters blocked their way. The police baton charged the protestors, kicking and dragging them away. Several protestors, including ITAK MPs A. Amirthalingam, V. Dharmalingam, V. A. Kandiah, E. M. V. Naganathan and K. Thurairatnam were injured. The police fired tear gas to disperse a large crowd that had gathered to watch the satyagraha.

500|$|The Progress Party {{does not}} belong to any {{international}} political groups, and does not have any official sister parties. Historically the party has not compared itself to other European parties, and has sought to rather establish its own identity. In 2008 however, the party for the first time set out to build its international reputation by hiring two international secretaries to travel internationally and establishing contact with politicians and parties abroad. This was cited especially to [...] "not risk being declared as extremists by opponents <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> form a government". An international secretary for the party in the same year said that the party had been connected with a [...] "misunderstood right-wing radical label", partly because people with nationalistic and [...] "hopeless attitudes" [...] had previously been involved in the party. Such persons were said no longer to be involved.|$|E

Wark remarked, [...] "We were underdogs but on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> hammered them." [...] Wark did not touch the ball for the first 18 minutes of the match, and as the players left the pitch at half-time, David Geddis said to Wark, [...] "Make sure you hit it between the posts in the second-half.

500|$|While {{filming the}} reunion special at the Atlanta Biltmore Hotel on March 27, Moore implied that Williams was unfaithful during her marriage; after Williams called Moore a [...] "slut from the '90s" [...] and Moore yelled that Williams was [...] "a dumb ho" [...] from a megaphone, Williams dragged Moore {{across the floor}} by her hair. Moore was {{initially}} unable to complete a police statement because she was required to complete the reunion filming, although Williams was arrested and booked for misdemeanor battery on April 18. Moore later threatened to quit the series if Williams were to remain, commenting: [...] "we've become angry with each other, we've threatened each other and gone to the edge. But {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> know there's a line."

500|$|On {{the morning}} of the {{scheduled}} flight, the day before the concert, on 12 September, Lennon, Ono, and Clapton were not at the airport. At this point, Clapton had not been aware of the concert, nor of Lennon contacting him. Brower had managed to get through to Clapton and told him to contact Lennon and Ono, who were still in bed. Clapton said he got [...] "a phone call on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> were to leave and he said that someone had asked him to do that concert and it was that night! So I had to make the airport in an hour." [...] The group had two rehearsals: one was during the transatlantic flight from London to Toronto, and the other shortly before appearing on stage at the actual festival. Lennon said the group [...] "didn't know what to play", as they had not previously performed together. Also on the flight, Lennon gained the confidence, that when he got back to England, to leave the Beatles. Lennon told this to Clapton, and shortly afterwards, to the Beatles' then-manager, Allen Klein.|$|E

[...] On 28 June 2007, the group held a press conference at The O2 Arena revealing their intention to reunite.

We are like sisters and we have our arguments, but by the end of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> get back together", said Emma Bunton, while Melanie Chisholm commented that the tour [...] "will be a proper good farewell to our fans".

500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically. According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. I mean, it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> broke up. Maybe some of the things I say in the song are cruel, but it is how I felt at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|By June 1943, it {{was clear}} to the USCG that the {{recruiting}} process in place did not favor the SPARS, so it withdrew from the joint agreement effective 1 July 1943. Hence, all women applicants for SPARS would be interviewed and enlisted at USCG district recruiting stations. The change was met with increased enthusiasm by the recruiters and it proved positive overall. Still, the competition remained keen with the other, better known, women services. Some recruiters referred to themselves as peddlers of patriotism, but their lot was not an easy one. In their book, Three Years Behind the Mast, the authors Mary Lyne and Kay Arthur, both officers in SPARS, described the realities of recruiting in this way: During <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> made speeches distributed posters, decorated windows, led parades, manned information booths, interviewed applicants, appeared on radio programs, and gave aptitude tests. By night, we made more speeches; prayed women would be drafted, and went to bed dreaming about our quotas. [...] The main recruiting effort had ended. During the 25-month recruitment period, about 11,000 women signed enlistment contracts to serve in the SPARS. Yeoman Third Class Dorothy Tuttle was the first woman to enlist in the SPARS at a recruiting station on 7 December 1942.|$|E

In {{preparation}} for the fight, both Wen and her stunt double Samantha Jo had to learn both May and Agent 33's actions, with Jo explaining that [...] "Usually you only have to learn one side, so you can just drill that into your head and have that muscle memory and be good to go. But for this fight, for both Ming and myself, we had to learn both sides of the fight. And we knew on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> were filming that we’d have to be changing our wardrobe back and forth. So we’d be going {{to one side of the}} fight, to the other side of the fight, back to the other side, and we just wanted to make sure we were safe about it. Because if we spaced out and started doing the other side again, we didn’t want anyone to get hurt. So that’s why we trained together. We were doing two sessions twice a week, anywhere from two to five hours at Ming’s house just trying to get as physically ready and as mentally ready as possible. But thankfully, we’d already done so many episodes together by that point that we were super comfortable, and we know each other’s body movements." ...|$|E
500|$|A late {{change in}} the Oxford cox saw Samantha Benham replace Gordon Buxton to steer the Dark Blues, {{becoming}} the eighth female cox {{in the history of}} the race. [...] Oxford's Royle noted that Buxton's form had declined in the run-in to the race, while Benham was [...] "handling the pressure a lot better." [...] Cambridge cox, Martin Haycock, suggested that female coxes were not as accomplished as their male counterparts: [...] "We had one cox who was exceptionally good at giving massages but on the whole... they're not aggressive or tough enough." [...] Oxford also saw a change to their crew in the week preceding the race. [...] Old Etonian undergraduate Ed Haddon (who had rowed for Isis in 1992) was dropped in favour of German Philipp Schuller. [...] Schuller had arrived at Oxford just two months earlier, but rejected suggestions that his late inclusion was symptomatic of the recent influx of [...] "professionals" [...] to the race. [...] Of his selection, he noted: [...] "You can't have one of the most respected races in the world and then limit it to English people between the ages of 19 and 21 ... on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> went for whoever would make the boat go fastest. It was done entirely on merit." [...] Schuller's compatriot and opponent Dirk Bangert had struggled with the move to cleavers, finding it difficult to adjust his timing: [...] "I nearly didn't make it. I couldn't get this rhythm until about three weeks ago and was not sure of my place." ...|$|E
500|$|Unhappy {{with the}} quality of 1980's Live at Last, the band {{recorded}} another live album—titled Live Evil—during the Mob Rules world tour, across the United States in Dallas, San Antonio, and Seattle, in 1982. During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals. In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork. Butler also accused Dio and Appice of working on a solo album during the album's mixing without telling the other members of Black Sabbath. [...] "Ronnie wanted more say in things," [...] Iommi said. [...] "And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in. Live Evil is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> just said, 'That's it, the band is over'". [...] "When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody! Because they're not as good as me, so I do what I want to do," [...] Dio later said. [...] "I refuse to listen to Live Evil, because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny".|$|E
