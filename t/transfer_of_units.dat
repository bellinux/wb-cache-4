25|$|The Soviet armies {{were in a}} poor {{state after}} the catastrophes of Uman and Kiev, and could offer only {{sporadic}} resistance, but the German advance was slowed by the autumn rains and the Soviet scorched earth policy, which denied the Germans food and fuel and forced them to rely on overstretched lines of supply. Rundstedt's armies were also weakened by the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> back to Army Group Centre {{to take part in}} the attack on Moscow (Operation Typhoon). Reichenau did not take Kharkov until 24 October. Nevertheless, during October Rundstedt's forces won another great victory when Manstein and Kleist's tanks reached the Sea of Azov, trapping two Soviet Armies around Mariupol and taking over 100,000 prisoners. This victory enabled Manstein to undertake the conquest of the Crimea (apart from the fortress city of Sevastopol) against only weak opposition, while Kleist advanced towards Rostov. Despite these defeats, the Red Army was able to fall back on the Don in reasonably good order, and also to evacuate much of the industrial plant of the Donbass.|$|E

500|$|Raised {{to acting}} group captain in February 1954, Jeffrey was {{appointed}} Superintendent, Air, with the Long-Range Weapons Establishment [...] in Salisbury, South Australia. Coordinating weapons trials at Woomera Rocket Range, Jeffrey and his support staff were based initially at RAAF Base Mallala but later relocated to Edinburgh airfield, then part of Salisbury and {{owned by the}} Department of Supply. On 17January 1955, he became the inaugural Officer Commanding RAAF Base Edinburgh, and oversaw the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> from Mallala during the year.

Returning to private life, Jeffrey settled in Queensland and became partner in a stock broking firm at Surfers Paradise.

Still recuperating, Scherger acted {{in the role of}} Air Member for Personnel at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, from January to May 1945. On 10May, he was posted back to the Pacific to resume control of No.1 TAF following Cobby's dismissal {{in the wake of the}} [...] "Morotai Mutiny". He returned as Operation Oboe One, the Battle of Tarakan, was under way; No.1 TAF's airfield construction teams had been tasked with opening the runway on Tarakan Island within a week of Allied landings but extensive pre-invasion damage and adverse environmental conditions delayed this until the end of June. He then led No.1 TAF in Operation Oboe Six, the invasion of Labuan, going ashore on the afternoon of the landings on 10June to establish his command post. By July, when the final Allied offensive of the Borneo Campaign took place as Operation Oboe Two in Balikpapan, No.1 TAF had reached a strength of some 25,000 personnel; by the end of hostilities on 14August this figure had been reduced with the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> to the recently formed No.11 Group.|$|E

The experimental results show that under different spray densities, the height <b>of</b> mass <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> liquid phase of the packed column added with the packing apparatus decreased approximately above 19 % more than that not added the packing apparatus; the height <b>of</b> mass <b>transfer</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> liquid phase lowers more with the decrease of the spray density, which demonstrated that the mass <b>transfer</b> efficiency <b>of</b> the packed column added with the packing apparatus was much higher than that of the column not added the packing apparatus...|$|R
5000|$|On 1 April 1931 it was {{transferred}} to the United States Army Air Corps as a regular unit without reservists, being activated at March Field, California and assigned to the 7th Bombardment Group. It was initially equipped with Keystone B-3 and B-4 biplane bombers, the bombers usually differed from each other only in the type of engine which powered them, and it was often only possible to distinguish one from the other by an examination of their serial numbers. The Keystone planes were the standard Army bomber during the 1920s and about as powerful as their World War I contemporaries, but in terms of safety they were much improved.The group {{was transferred}} on 5 December 1934 to the newly built Hamilton Field, near San Francisco, as part of a realignment of the Air Corps units in California due to the closure of Rockwell Field near San Diego and the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> from Rockwell to March Field. At Hamilton Field, the 31st was upgraded to the Martin B-10 and B-12s, the first all-metal monoplane bomber to enter full production for the Army. It was also the first bomber to have a performance that exceeded that of contemporary pursuit aircraft. Again, the main difference between the bombers was the engine type. In the spring of 1937, the 31st received new Douglas B-18 Bolos, the 7th Bomb Group being the first operational unit to receive the bombers.The squadron trained at Hamilton until the end of 1937, when it was ordered to proceed to Hickam Field, Hawaii, to reinforce the Hawaiian Department. It departed from the port of San Francisco on the USAT Republic on 1 February 1938, arriving at the port of Honolulu on 8 February and transferring to Hickam the same day, being assigned to the 5th Composite Group. [...] The 31st joined the 23d and 72d Bomb Squadrons at Luke Field on Ford Island which were equipped with Martin B-12s. [...] The 31st had brought its B-18s with it to Hickam, and it began engaging in reconnaissance flights over the Islands. [...] In mid-1941, the 5th Bombardment Group began receiving B-17D Flying Fortresses from the United States, as part of the United States buildup of its Pacific forces due to rising tensions with the Japanese Empire.|$|E

40|$|Path {{planning}} {{is the art}} of deciding which route to take, based on and expressed in terms of the current internal representation of the terrain. Path finding also involves the execution of this theoretical route, by translating the plan from the internal representation in terms of physical movement in the environment. During combat, transfers of military units in the shortest period and with least damage are vitally important. In this study, navigation planning problems, described in semi-dynamic and fully-dynamic scenarios, have been solved using evolutionary algorithm approach. 3 -D graph is used to mode the environment. In the first scenario, graph node and edge deletion and cost update operations are applied and the impact of the different parameters of genetic algorithm on the solution has been investigated. In the second scenario, in an environment with possibility of combat, the aim is to find the most secure shortest path by employing genetic algorithm approach dynamically, in case any combat information arrives during the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>units...</b>|$|E
