5|$|Chrissie {{plans to}} sell the pub to Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and a mystery second buyer, and flee the country, {{although}} Phil and Grant Mitchell try to taunt her. Chrissie though, is unfazed, as Sharon still supports her – however, Grant finally convinces Sharon to visit Sam in prison. Sharon still believes Chrissie is innocent, but finally learns the truth when Chrissie makes an innocuous, but telling, comment. Realising that Sharon knows, Chrissie becomes distraught as she felt that so long as Sharon, Den's daughter, thought well of her, she could <b>think</b> <b>well</b> of herself. Panicking, she begins to make mistakes, arguing with Jake outside of Johnny's club. Chrissie had confessed her role in Den's death to Jake, and lets information regarding her guilt slip as they argue. This is caught on CCTV by Johnny, who delights in telling Jake {{that he has a}} recording. Chrissie asks to get the money for The Queen Victoria right away, and Johnny takes advantage, saying the only way she will get the money is if she sleeps with him. Chrissie resists, saying that she will not hurt Jake. Johnny tells her that she will not receive the money, and tells Phil and Grant about the tape.|$|E
500|$|The band is not musically polished. Paul has joked that, if {{they had}} known of the band’s popularity, they might have made [...] "an effort to sing in tune. But it’s hard to {{anticipate}} {{that sort of thing}} when you’re just writing silly songs and recording them in your living room over a weekend.". While musicianship is not the strength of the band, Paul says that the fans [...] "know we're not the best singers and keyboard players, but we're okay. And they <b>think,</b> <b>well,</b> I could do that, too. I think that’s really encouraging to people..." [...] Paul sees the brothers as a [...] "bridge between this mainstream phenomena of Harry Potter and the indie rock underground. Plus, we’re also pretty strong adherents to the DIY ideal." [...] The two brothers promote this ideal of making music independently and have fused the legions of fans on to the DIY free-for-all of indie rock and punk music, albeit of the silly kind.|$|E
500|$|General George Washington, {{commander}} in chief of the Continental Army, came to Philadelphia to brief Congress on military affairs. [...] Lafayette met him at a dinner on 5 August 1777; according to Leepson, [...] "the two men bonded almost immediately." [...] Washington was impressed by the young man's enthusiasm and was inclined to <b>think</b> <b>well</b> of a fellow Mason; Lafayette was simply in awe of the commanding general. General Washington took the Frenchman to view his military camp; when Washington expressed embarrassment at its state and that of the troops, Lafayette responded, [...] "I am here to learn, not to teach." [...] He became a member of Washington's staff, although confusion existed regarding his status. Congress regarded his commission as honorary, while he considered himself a full-fledged commander who would be given control of a division when Washington deemed him prepared. Washington told Lafayette that a division would not be possible as he was of foreign birth, but that he would be happy to hold him in confidence as [...] "friend and father".|$|E

500|$|Garfield's biographers, {{and those}} who have studied his {{presidency}}, tend to <b>think</b> <b>well</b> of him, and that his presidency saw a promising start before its untimely end. Historian Justus D. Doenecke, while deeming Garfield a bit of an enigma, chronicles his achievements, [...] "by winning a victory over the Stalwarts, he enhanced both the power and prestige of his office. As a man, he was intelligent, sensitive, and alert, and his knowledge of how government worked was unmatched." [...] Yet Doenecke criticizes Garfield's dismissal of Merritt in Robertson's favor, and wonders if the president was truly in command of the situation even after the latter's confirmation. According to Caldwell, writing in 1931, [...] "If Garfield lives in history, it will be partly on account of the charm of his personality—but also because in life and in death, he struck the first shrewd blows against a dangerous system of boss rule which seemed for a time about to engulf the politics of the nation. Perhaps if he had lived he could have done no more." [...] Rutkow writes, [...] "James Abram Garfield's presidency is reduced to a tantalizing 'what if.|$|E
500|$|Locke wrote Some Thoughts Concerning Education in {{response}} to his friend Samuel Clarke's query on how to educate his son, so the text's [...] "principal aim", as Locke states at the beginning, [...] "is how a young gentleman should be brought up from his infancy." [...] This education [...] "will not so perfectly suit the education of daughters; though where the difference of sex requires different treatment, it will be no hard matter to distinguish" [...] (Locke's emphasis). This passage suggests that, for Locke, education was fundamentally the same for men and women—there were only small, obvious differences for women. This interpretation is supported by a letter he wrote to Mrs. Clarke in 1685 stating that [...] "since therefore I acknowledge no difference of sex in your mind relating ... to truth, virtue and obedience, I <b>think</b> <b>well</b> to have no thing altered in it from what is [...]" [...] Martin Simons states that Locke [...] "suggested, both by implication and explicitly, that a boy's education should be along the lines already followed by some girls of the intelligent genteel classes." [...] Rather than sending boys to schools which would ignore their individual needs and teach them little of value, Locke argues that they should be taught at home as girls already were and [...] "should learn useful and necessary crafts of the house and estate." [...] Like his contemporary Mary Astell, Locke believed that women could and should be taught to be rational and virtuous.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a spring}} 2014 {{interview}} with the BBC about the then forthcoming reissue of Led Zeppelin's first three albums, Page said he was confident fans would be keen on another reunion show, but Plant later replied that [...] "the chances of it happening [...] zero." [...] Page then told The New York Times that he was [...] "fed up" [...] with Plant's refusal to play, stating [...] "I was told last year that Robert Plant said he is doing nothing in 2014, and what do the other two guys <b>think?</b> <b>Well,</b> he knows what the other guys think. Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band. He's just playing games, and I'm fed up with it, {{to be honest with}} you. I don't sing, so I can't do much about it", adding, [...] "I definitely want to play live. Because, you know, I've still got a twinkle in my eye. I can still play. So, yeah, I'll just get myself into musical shape, just concentrating on the guitar." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite his celebrated flaws, history records Fox as {{an amiable}} figure. The Tory wit George Selwyn wrote that, [...] "I have passed two evenings with him, and never was anybody so agreeable, {{and the more}} so from his having no pretensions to it". Selwyn also said that [...] "Charles, I am persuaded, would have no {{consideration}} on earth but for what was useful to his own ends. You have heard me say, that I thought he had no malice or rancour; I think so still and am sure of it. But I {{think that he has}} no feeling neither, for anyone but himself; and if I could trace in any one action of his life anything that had not for its object his own gratification, I should with pleasure receive the intelligence because then I had much rather (if it were possible) <b>think</b> <b>well</b> of him than not". Sir Philip Francis said of Fox: [...] "The essential defect in his character and the cause of all his failures, strange as it may seem, was that he had no heart". Edward Gibbon remarked that [...] "Perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood." [...] Central to understanding Fox's life was his view that [...] "friendship was the only real happiness in the world." [...] For Fox, politics was the extension of his activities at Newmarket and Brooks's to Westminster. [...] "Fox had little or no interest in the exercise of power." [...] The details of policy – particularly of economics – bored him, in contrast with the intensity of Burke’s legal pursuit of Warren Hastings, and of Pitt’s prosecution of the war against France. Moreover, the Foxites were [...] "the witty and wicked" [...] satellites of their leader, as much friends as political allies.|$|E
