5000|$|Definition of an {{individual}} entity.

50|$|Data Preparation: The data {{preparation}} phase covers all activities {{to construct the}} final dataset (data that will be fed into the modeling tool(s)) from the initial raw data. Data preparation tasks {{are likely to be}} performed multiple times, and not in any prescribed order. Tasks include <b>table,</b> <b>record,</b> and attribute selection as well as transformation and cleaning of data for modeling tools.|$|E

50|$|The Status {{field in}} a {{partition}} <b>table</b> <b>record</b> {{is used to}} indicate an active partition. Standard-conformant MBRs will allow only one partition marked active and use this {{as part of a}} sanity-check to determine the existence of a valid partition table. They will display an error message, if more than one partition has been marked active. Some non-standard MBRs will not treat this as an error condition and just use the first marked partition in the row.|$|E
50|$|The Error Event schema holds {{records of}} all error events thrown {{by the quality}} screens. It {{consists}} of an Error Event Fact table with foreign keys to three dimension tables that represent date (when), batch job (where) and screen (who produced error). It also holds information about exactly when the error occurred and {{the severity of the}} error. In addition there is an Error Event Detail Fact table with a foreign key to the main table that contains detailed information about in which <b>table,</b> <b>record</b> and field the error occurred and the error condition.|$|E
50|$|Version columns are {{automatically}} incremented by ESE {{each time a}} record containing this column is modified via an Update operation. This column cannot be set by the application, but can only be read. Applications of version columns include being used to determine if an in-memory copy of a given record needs to be refreshed. If the value in a <b>table</b> <b>record</b> {{is greater than the}} value in a cached copy then the cached copy is known to be out of date. Version columns must be of type Long.|$|E

50|$|Compaction {{proceeds}} {{from the bottom of}} the heap (low addresses) to the top (high addresses). As live (that is, marked) objects are encountered, they are moved to the first available low address, and a record is appended to a break table of relocation information. For each live object, a record in the break table consists of the object's original address before the compaction and the difference between the original address and the new address after compaction. The break table is stored in the heap that is being compacted, but in an area that are marked as unused. To ensure that compaction will always succeed, the minimum object size in the heap must be larger than or the same size as a break <b>table</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{multiple}} {{databases and}} multiple tables are joined, it's {{referred to as}} a cluster (not to be confused with clustered index described above). The records for the tables sharing the value of a cluster key shall be stored together in the same or nearby data blocks. This may improve the joins of these tables on the cluster key, since the matching records are stored together and less I/O is required to locate them. The cluster configuration defines the data layout in the tables that are parts of the cluster. A cluster can be keyed with a B-Tree index or a hash table. The data block where the <b>table</b> <b>record</b> is stored is defined by the value of the cluster key.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{researches}} {{methods used}} by relational database management systems to manage LOBs. It attempts to use LOB slave table methods to optimize and advance the storage structures of large objects {{as well as}} optimize the redo and undo log mechanisms to increase LOB access efficiency. For changes in slave table data, it effectively prevents the redo log from being written into the LOB database, while diminishing the amount of changes being recording within the undo journal. This improves the writing speed of the log, thus improving the access efficiency and speed of the slave <b>table</b> <b>record.</b> At the same time, this optimized log mechanism also ensures the correct recovery of data after a system crash. Tests {{have shown that the}} optimized LOB access efficiency is slightly better than Oracle’s...|$|E
