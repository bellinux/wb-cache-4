When the identity connects it to one of the employees at the facility where the Fringe mainframe is housed, Broyles suspects a mole seeking to wipe out Fauxlivia's data, and orders a mainframe lockdown, while verifying <b>the</b> <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> key people in the FBI and Massive Dynamic. Astrid identifies several other potential candidates, including a doctor from Massive Dynamic who had already left. By the time Fringe division reaches his home, they find the man, a shapeshifter, already dead.|$|E

25|$|The Manifestations of God are {{not seen}} as incarnations of God, and are also {{not seen as}} {{ordinary}} mortals.

25|$|Founded by Francis of Assisi in {{the early}} 13th century, the Franciscan Friars {{emphasized}} devotion to the Incarnation, <b>the</b> <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> Jesus Christ.

Franciscan prayer includes the conscious remembering of the human life of Jesus and the practice of care for the poor and marginalized.|$|E
25|$|The {{opinions}} that pit races {{against one another}} are likely to reflect Tolkien’s critique on war rather than a racist perspective. In The Two Towers, the character Samwise sees a fallen foe and considers for a moment <b>the</b> <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> this fallen Southron who, just moments before, is {{shown to be a}} man of color. Director Peter Jackson considers Sam this scene in the director’s commentary of the scene and argues that Tolkien isn’t projecting any negative sentiments towards the individual soldier because of his race, but the evil that’s driving them from their authority, These sentiments, Jackson argues, were derived from Tolkien’s experience in the Great War and found their way into his writings to show the evils of war itself, not of other races.|$|E

25|$|Barks's stories (whether humorous adventures or {{domestic}} comedies) often exhibited a wry, dark irony born of hard experience. The ten-pagers showcased Donald as everyman, struggling against the cruel bumps and bruises {{of everyday life}} with the nephews often acting as a Greek chorus commenting on the unfolding disasters Donald wrought upon himself. Yet while seemingly defeatist in tone, <b>the</b> <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> the characters shines through in their persistence despite the obstacles. These stories found popularity not only among young children but adults as well. Despite the fact that Barks had done little traveling his adventure stories often had the duck clan globe-trotting to the most remote or spectacular of places. This allowed Barks to indulge his penchant for elaborate backgrounds that hinted at his thwarted ambitions of doing realistic stories in the vein of Hal Foster's Prince Valiant.|$|E

500|$|Though he {{believed}} that the historical Jesus was barely known, Keable nonetheless devoted much attention in The Last Galilean to trying to understand the figure. He emphasised <b>the</b> <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> historical Jesus, who, he wrote, had shared humanity's ignorance – though had also been blessed with an extraordinarily undistorted mind. He wrote of a Jesus tolerant – even fond – of sinners, and one who, understanding the importance of love and sex to the average man, advocated love as the most important thing, above any church rule or regulation. This Jesus was a great prophet of free love, associated and in harmony with a [...] "spirit of all life".|$|E

500|$|We {{too often}} forget <b>the</b> <b>{{humanity}}</b> <b>of</b> doctors and nurses. They become godlike {{to most of}} us and yet it is their humanity that makes them so interesting and enjoyable. We are not doing a drama and have no intention of doing anything like dealing with life and death issues. We want to make people laugh so we de-emphasize the more serious elements of hospital life. It isn't that he [...] just sees things differently, he also deals with them differently. That is why Noland will dream up a baby derby, a gambling night at the hospital, a variety show at Christmas and off-track betting when patients get bored with the hospital routine.|$|E
500|$|Composer Jeff Russo {{felt that}} [...] "the {{important}} part is allowing <b>the</b> <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> these characters to really shine through", {{and in addition}} to an orchestra he used [...] "a bunch of old synthesizers" [...] and [...] "a lot of interesting sound design" [...] to represent the [...] "otherworldly" [...] elements of the series. Russo specifically found a Synthi AKS synthesizer for the show, as that instrument was used during the making of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, one of Hawley's favorite albums and what Russo described as [...] "the sound of schizophrenia, the sound of mental illness in the ’70s. So why not use that as the touchstone for what the sound of this score might be?" [...] Russo experimented with the instrument, and began [...] "recording and writing melodies around its unusual sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} racial {{injustice}} appears symbolically {{in the novel}} as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, {{even though it is}} not his job to do so. Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, [...] "he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies <b>the</b> <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> Tom Robinson.... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger." ...|$|E

500|$|Millett {{focused on}} her mother in Mother Millett, a book about how she was made aware by her sister Sally of the {{seriousness}} of Helen Millett's declining health and poor nursing home care. Kate removed her mother from the home and returned her to an apartment, where caregivers managed her health and comfort. In the book, [...] "Millett writes about the situation—her mother's distance and imperiousness, her family's failure to recognize <b>the</b> <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> the old and the insane—with brutal honesty. Yet she also describes moments of forgiveness, humility and admiration." [...] During this time, she developed a close relationship, previously inconceivable, with her mother, which she considered [...] "a miracle and a grace, a gift." [...] Her relationships with her sisters were troubled during this time, but they all came to support their mother's apartment-living. The suggestion of her role as the heroine in Mother Millett, however, may have been [...] "at the expense of her two siblings".|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} {{third of the}} film, Barton speaks {{constantly}} of his desire to write work which centers on and appeals to [...] "the common man". In one speech he declares: [...] "The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life– [...] why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater? [...] Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? [...] Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater." [...] Yet, despite his rhetoric, Barton is totally unable (or unwilling) to appreciate <b>the</b> <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "common man" [...] living next door to him. Later in the film, Charlie explains that he has brought various horrors upon him because [...] "you DON'T LISTEN!" [...] In his first conversation with Charlie, Barton constantly interrupts Charlie just as he is saying [...] "I could tell you some stories-", demonstrating that despite his fine words he really isn't interested in Charlie's experiences; in another scene, Barton symbolically demonstrates his deafness to the world by stuffing his ears with cotton to block {{the sound of his}} ringing telephone.|$|E
500|$|The sleeper {{carriage}} setting gave Shearsmith and Pemberton {{a number of}} [...] "traumatic" [...] elements to exploit, such as claustrophobia, proximity to strangers, motion, and the various elements associated with settling down to sleep, such as flatulence and getting undressed. These characteristics led to elements typical of Pemberton and Shearsmith's work—characteristics of what The Guardian critic Sam Wollaston calls [...] "Shearsmith'n'Pembertonism"—including [...] "macabre horror, stiff-handling, cadaver spooning" [...] and multiple twists. Commentators stressed how the characters are generally not particularly likable people, and one critic observed that the actors are somewhat typecast; [...] "Hesmondhalgh was frumpy but compassionate, while Whitehall played yet another clueless, posh student". The characters are mostly archetypes of British comedy—such as [...] "the rude German traveller" [...] and [...] "the British snob"—and the norms of these archetypes are used for both humour and to advance the plot. The archetypes are gradually unspun; for instance, the apparently well-meaning Les is revealed as somewhat xenophobic. The discovery of the body reveals <b>the</b> <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> the various characters. For instance, Jorg is revealed to be more ill than vulgar, and Hugo is shown to be poor. Maxwell's character, by contrast, is not subverted.|$|E

500|$|As Salander's legal guardian, he {{uses his}} {{position}} to sexually abuse and eventually rape her. Salander turns the tables on him, torturing him and branding him as a rapist. Fincher wanted the character to be worse than a typical antagonist, {{although he did not}} want to emulate the stereotypical [...] "mustache-twirling pervert". The director considered Van Wageningen to be the embodiment of a versatile actor—one who was a [...] "full-fledged human being" [...] and a [...] "brilliant" [...] actor. [...] "He was able to bring his performance from a logical place in Bjurman's mind and find the seething morass of darkness inside," [...] Fincher stated. Bjurman's multifaceted psyche was the main reason Van Wageningen wanted to play the role. The Dutch actor said, [...] "This character goes through a lot and I wasn't quite sure I wanted to go through all that. I started out half way between the elation of getting to work with David Fincher and the dread of this character, but I was able to use both of those things. We both thought the most interesting route would be for Bjurman to seem half affable. The challenge was not in finding the freak violence in the guy but finding <b>the</b> <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> him." ...|$|E
500|$|... 3 Splash {{received}} favourable {{reviews from}} music critics. Chris True from AllMusic highlighted Hashire! {{as a career}} stand out track from Kumi's discography. Ian Martin from the same publication reviewed [...] "Lick Me" [...] and [...] "Ecstasy" [...] from the Universe album and was divided. For [...] "Lick Me", he said, [...] "She wears her sexuality on her sleeve, with song titles like [...] "Lick Me" [...] laying their erotic playing {{cards on the table}} from the get-go, and her lack of any recognizable singing ability compensated for by an awful lot of gumption." [...] For [...] "Ecstasy", he commended her [...] "hard working ethic" [...] in many songs, highlighting the song and concluded that, [...] "All of this reveals a desperate need to achieve success no matter what, but also <b>the</b> <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> the effort underpinning it." [...] Greenberg commended the production of [...] "Ecstasy", and said that [...] "Lick Me" [...] was [...] "slightly off-tempo" [...] that [...] "brings Kumi back to more standard territory." [...] A reviewer from CD Journal complimented the production of each song, and described the EP as [...] "catchy" [...] and [...] "danceable". Hiraga Tetsuo from Hot Express was positive, who commended Kumi's song writing and the [...] "summer" [...] theme throughout the EP.|$|E
500|$|Howarth {{said he had}} {{no desire}} to portray a {{redeemed}} Todd, and that the show would be better off finding [...] "a Todd who won't object to the material." [...] He subsequently left the series for a year. In the October 24, 1995 Soap Opera Digest issue, he stated:In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it {{was the result of a}} real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show <b>the</b> <b>humanity</b> <b>of</b> someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [...] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [...] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear to me they were taking the character on a different path—they were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play Todd Lord. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic—it's a fairy tale. I thought, [...] "It would be best for the show if I were to leave." [...] That's when I tendered my resignation.|$|E
