5|$|Although it {{remained}} far from land, <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> triggered by Liza {{were able to}} reach California, where they combined with high tide, threatening beachfront homes that had weakened foundations after a previous tide.

25|$|The Penn State Student Section initiates a wave during {{sporting}} events.

5|$|August 13–21, 1995- Swells and 10foot (3m) waves {{generated}} by Hurricane Felix restrict beaches along the coastline. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> cause beach erosion and minor tidal flooding.|$|E

30|$|F is the {{frequency}} of <b>the</b> <b>wave,</b> and Θ is the angle between the direction of <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> and <b>the</b> x-axis.

5|$|Tropical Storm Danielle dropped light {{rainfall}} {{across much}} of New Jersey, with some areas in the southwestern portion of the state experiencing over 3inches (76mm). Strong waves from the storm washed out miles of beaches along the coastline. In Ocean City, <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> passed over the boardwalk and into houses. Further north, <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> crashed a four-person, 35-foot (10-m) sailboat near Island Beach State Park. Two managed to swim safely to shore, though the other two occupants drowned.|$|E
5|$|With no aid {{possible}} from the shore, night fell on 14January {{with most of the}} crew and passengers still aboard. During the night, <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> stove in (smashed in) the stern of the ship, flooding much of the interior. On the morning of 15January, a small boat carrying nine British prisoners (part of the crew of the Cumberland, captured by Droits de l'Homme earlier in the campaign) managed to reach shore. The sight of the British-manned boat reaching shore prompted a mass launching of small rafts from the wreck in hopes of gaining the beach. However <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> increased once more, and not one of these small craft survived the passage.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{bifurcation}} phenomena of nonlinear waves {{described by a}} generalized Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation ut+au 2 +bu 4 ux+γuxxx+δuxyy= 0. We reveal four kinds of interesting bifurcation phenomena. The first kind is that <b>the</b> low-kink <b>waves</b> can be bifurcated from <b>the</b> symmetric solitary <b>waves,</b> <b>the</b> 1 -blow-up <b>waves,</b> <b>the</b> tall-kink <b>waves,</b> and <b>the</b> antisymmetric solitary <b>waves.</b> <b>The</b> second kind is that <b>the</b> 1 -blow-up <b>waves</b> can be bifurcated from <b>the</b> periodic-blow-up <b>waves,</b> <b>the</b> symmetric solitary <b>waves,</b> and <b>the</b> 2 -blow-up <b>waves.</b> <b>The</b> third kind is that <b>the</b> periodic-blow-up <b>waves</b> can be bifurcated from <b>the</b> symmetric periodic <b>waves.</b> <b>The</b> fourth kind is that <b>the</b> tall-kink <b>waves</b> can be bifurcated from <b>the</b> symmetric periodic <b>waves...</b>|$|R

40|$|We study <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> dislocations with an induced gauge potential.

5|$|Additionally, {{civilian}} vessels produce sonar {{waves in}} order to measure the depth of the body of water in which they are. Similar to the navy, some boats produce waves that attract porpoises, while others may repel them. The problem with <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the storm}} never made landfall, the fringe {{effects of the}} storm {{produced}} significant flooding across the Baja California Peninsula which damaged agricultural land and dozens of homes. Howard also produced large swells which reached 18ft (5.4m) along the Baja coastline and 10ft (3m) along the California coastline. About 1,000 lifeguard rescues took place in California due to <b>the</b> <b>waves.</b> Moisture from the storm also enhanced rainfall in parts of Arizona, leading to minor accumulations.|$|E
5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated {{in the bow}} and {{exploded}} the forward ammunition magazines. The bow was badly mangled; in about half an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the sea floor, the bow was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below <b>the</b> <b>waves,</b> a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship's engine rooms.|$|E
5000|$|Since the Stokes drift {{velocity}} [...] is in <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> propagation direction, and [...] {{is in the}} vertical direction, the Coriolis-Stokes forcing is perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> propagation direction (i.e. in the direction parallel to <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> crests).

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>wave</b> {{propagation}} over a submerged bar is simulated {{using the}} open source CFD model REEF 3 D and the numerical results are {{compared to the}} experimental data. The transformation of <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> resulting in higher harmonics in <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> train is observed as <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> propagates over <b>the</b> crest of the bar. The difference between <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> transformation processes for two different incident wave heights is studied. <b>The</b> higher incident <b>wave</b> height shows more shoaling than <b>the</b> lower incident <b>wave</b> height. <b>The</b> numerical results show a good agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
30|$|Therefore, when Z 2 [*]>[*]Z 1, <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> propagates from <b>the</b> medium {{with low}} {{impedance}} to the medium with large impedance and the reflection coefficient is negative. <b>The</b> <b>wave</b> sign {{will have a}} reverse mutation. When Z 2 [*]<[*]Z 1, <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> propagates from <b>the</b> medium with large impedance to the medium with small impedance and the reflection coefficient is positive. <b>The</b> <b>wave</b> sign {{does not have a}} mutation. For example, when <b>the</b> stress <b>wave</b> propagation reaches <b>the</b> interface between the free length and the grouted length, the reverse impedance can occur in <b>the</b> reflected <b>wave.</b> Transmission wave will continue to propagate to the basement. When it reaches <b>the</b> basement, <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> impedance of <b>the</b> grouted section is larger than <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> impedance of <b>the</b> air. And <b>the</b> reflected <b>wave</b> will not have a mutation.|$|R
5|$|At Lulworth Cove, <b>the</b> <b>waves</b> {{have cut}} {{their way through}} the {{resistant}} Portland stone and created a horseshoe-shaped cove by eroding the softer sands and clays behind. Another feature of this part of the coast is Durdle Door, a natural arch. Sea stacks and pinnacles, such as Old Harry Rocks at Handfast Point, have been formed by erosion of the chalk cliffs.|$|E
5|$|At the outset, the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and USCG {{agreed to}} recruit and to train the members of their {{respective}} women's reserves together, using existing Navy facilities. For recruiting purposes, the SPARS would utilize the Offices of the Naval Officer Procurement. Their first recruiting efforts got underway in December 1942, but they were hampered somewhat {{by the absence of}} SPAR recruiting personnel. Their absence resulted from the agreement between the Navy and the USCG, whereby the SPARS would receive its first personnel by transfer from <b>the</b> <b>WAVES.</b> A total of 15 WAVE officers and 153 WAVE enlisted women requested and were discharged from <b>the</b> <b>WAVES</b> to become the first SPARS. Eventually, SPAR officers were assigned to most of the Naval Officer Procurement offices. The recruiting information about SPARS was disseminated with WAVES publicity materials and it was also done separately. But it became apparent that the job of selling the SPARS included selling the USCG as well.|$|E

50|$|In a {{collisionless plasma}} the {{particle}} velocities are often {{taken to be}} approximately a Maxwellian distribution function.
