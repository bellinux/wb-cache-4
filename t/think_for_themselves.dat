5|$|Kubah was {{the second}} novel written by Ahmad Tohari, {{who had been in}} senior high school when the G30S {{announced}} its coup. A devout Muslim who had trained as a doctor and ran a pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in Central Java, Tohari began to focus on writing when his first novel, Di Kaki Bukit Cibalak (On the Foothill of Cibalak; 1978), won a prize from the Jakarta Arts Council. He finished Kubah in two months, first making a thematic overview for each chapter and then developing it further while writing. He deliberately left the novel's ending open to interpretation, intending for readers to <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lancashire {{appointed}} MacLaren {{as coach}} for the 1922 season, to popular acclaim; he also captained the Lancashire second team. Even before he began work, his poor financial situation forced him to request two advances on his salary. As a coach, MacLaren was autocratic and demanding, but encouraged the players to <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves.</b> He was unpopular with some players and clashed frequently with the Lancashire committee. During the winter of 1922–23, the MCC organised two cricket tours—a Test playing tour to South Africa and a tour to Australia and New Zealand intended to give experience to young, promising cricketers. MacLaren was chosen to captain the latter team {{on account of his}} experience and his success with young cricketers during his win over the Australians in 1921. He was given a good reception by the crowds when he played and press reports praised his tactical awareness. The team was undefeated in matches in New Zealand. Against the full New Zealand team, MacLaren scored 200 not out in 264 minutes in his final first-class innings; the effort placed a strain on his knee and he was unable to play again on the tour. He ended his first-class career with 22,236 runs at an average of 34.15.|$|E

She conducted archaeological and ethnographic research in the Southwestern United States; and undertook some of the first dendrochronological research in eastern North America in the mid 20th century, examining samples from a number of archaeological sites. She was also highly regarded as a passionate teacher who pushed her students toward greatness by encouraging them to <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> and work hard for what they wanted to achieve.

500|$|In 1750, Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University, {{starting}} {{a period where}} natural sciences were esteemed. Perhaps the most important contribution he made during his time at Uppsala was to teach; many of his students travelled to various {{places in the world}} to collect botanical samples.

500|$|Luhr (2009) {{states that}} Christian metal expresses feeling of {{isolation}} and rebellion just like non-Christian metal - but {{in a completely different}} way. Christian metal's rebellion is about [...] "Christian opposition to the perceived sinfulness and immorality of a late modern society and culture in which traditional family values have been eroded through such things as the legalization and increasing acceptability of abortion and pornography and the rise of gay rights and feminist movements." [...] Causes for the feeling of isolation can be explained with the fundamental Christian struggle of being in the world but not of it. Bloodgood and Barren Cross inverted the meaning of rebellion by declaring that in Western society and culture the Christian faith is true rebellion. As in non-Christian metal, fans are encouraged to stand up for their faith, <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> and not blindly follow authorities, including religious ones.|$|E

They go on to say that they wanted their music to be an awakening for listeners so that they would begin to <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> and question the world around them. [...] Industrial Records intended the term industrial to evoke the idea of music created for a new generation, with previous music being more agricultural: P-Orridge stated that [...] "there's an irony in the word 'industrial' because there's the music industry. And then there's the joke we often used to make in interviews about churning out our records like motorcars —that sense of industrial. And ... up till then the music had been kind of based on the blues and slavery, and we thought it was time to update it to at least Victorian times—you know, the Industrial Revolution".|$|E

[...] She {{goes on to say}} that Judaism in fact validates and empowers women. She points out the essential difference between traditional and alternative forms of Judaism: traditional Jews believe that the Torah is a divine document, not invented or controlled by rabbis, whereas members of alternative Jewish groups do not believe in the divinity of the Torah and thus feel that Jewish practice can be changed on demand. Sara Conway, neuropsychologist and mother of four, states that traditional women do indeed <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> and make autonomous decisions, [...] "It is my personal belief that Torah Judaism, including its belief in separate but complementary gender roles and a more spiritually inward role for women, is the best choice for me and my family." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nabokov {{continues}} {{to express his}} scorn for the Soviet, indicating how he is a figure easily manipulated by others; the inability of a character to express his free will is a considerable crime for Nabokov. So {{not only does the}} reader observe that the Soviet's every emotion at the whim of Ivanov ("when he pressed the flat surface of the razor to the man's neck, his entire body twitched") but in the final paragraph, Ivanov seems to be able to control his foe physically. Petrified by the possibility of revenge being meted out, the Soviet cannot move until Ivanov commands it of him. Having done that the Russian barber [...] "clapped the bowler on his head, thrust the briefcase under his arm, and swivelled him toward the door." [...] On leaving the barber's, descriptions of the Soviet further emphasise his robotic demeanour. Eyes completely shut, [...] "he stepped like an automaton", [...] "with the same mechanical gait" [...] and [...] "with an outstretched petrified hand". Each of these descriptions demonstrate the Soviet as being a non-individual, without free will, who can be manipulated and controlled by others. The political subtext of Nabokov's characterisation [...] communists simply follow the herd rather than <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> [...] becomes clearer.|$|E

2500|$|From 1798 onwards, structural, {{training}} and logistical reforms implemented or authorised by the Duke of York (as {{head of the}} army) [...] slowly improved the lot of the ordinary soldier. York oversaw a crackdown on corruption and removed the threat of corporal punishment for {{a large number of}} petty offences (while it was still retained for serious derelictions of duty). He also stamped down on the abuse of buying officer commissions, making it necessary for officers to serve two full years before either promotion or purchase to captain and six years before becoming a major The establishment of the Royal Military Academy for officers was instigated due to York's influence, while regular recruits to the army were allowed to join under contract for limited periods, rather than for life. Men such as Sir John Moore, Thomas Sydney Beckwith and Rowland Hill characterised the new breed of officers who sought to improve the relationship between officers and men, motivating troops through mutual respect, reward and promotion rather than by relying on punishment. The Shorncliffe System for light infantry was established, being devised by Lt-Col Kenneth Mackenzie, and trained soldiers to <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> and act on initiative while the light infantry officers drilled alongside the men fostering comradeship. In addition, the introduction of new tactical and organisational flexibility contributed a great deal to the successes of the Peninsula and Waterloo.|$|E

But to appoint not only a woman who had for fifteen years worked in the chorus alongside several who were now principals, but the wife of one of the main principals, seemed to me to be a psychological error of the first magnitude. [...] I felt that ... she would, rightly or wrongly, be accused of that very same favouritism. [...] My views made no impression on Miss Carte, but time was to prove that I was right. [...] Discontent grew, changes were constantly taking place, and criticism became rampant. [...] Nor did it stop at the methods of production; it went so far as to suggest a complete lack of knowledge, evidenced ... by constant self-contradiction.

2500|$|Like Dutch {{football}} in general until the mid-1960s, Cruyff's early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of British/English coaches such as Vic Buckingham. However, his footballing philosophy shares more similar aspects to free-flowing style of South American football (Brazilian {{football in}} particular) than traditional British/Anglo-Saxon school of football (with distinctively direct, aggressive, heavily athletic, muscular, physical elements in coaching and playing style). The mind-body duality always {{plays an important}} role in his footballing philosophy. In Cruyff’s words, quoted in Dennis Bergkamp's autobiography Stillness and Speed: My Story, “...Because you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you. If you don't use your head, using your feet won't be sufficient. Why does a player have to chase the ball? Because he started running too late. You have to pay attention, use your brain and find the right position. If you get to the ball late, it means you chose the wrong position. Bergkamp was never late.” For Cruyff, football (the so-called beautiful game) is much an artistic-oriented mind-body game instead of an athletic-oriented physical competition. As he put it, [...] "Every trainer talks about movement, about running a lot. I say don't run so much. Football is a game you play with your brain. You have to be in the right place at the right moment, not too early, not too late." [...] The creativity is always the key element in his footballing philosophy, both as a player and as a manager. Cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with Louis van Gaal's more mechanized and rigid coaching style, “Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>themselves</b> and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax [...] I would have failed the test. When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. Besides, I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer.” ...|$|E
