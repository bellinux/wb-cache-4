500|$|Crowley {{believed}} in the objective existence of magic, which he chose to spell [...] "Magick", an older archaic spelling of the word. He provided various different definitions of this term over his career. In his book Magick in Theory and Practice, Crowley defined Magick as [...] "the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will". He also told his disciple Karl Germer that [...] "Magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane <b>than</b> <b>ours.</b> Mysticism is the raising of oneself to their level." [...] Crowley saw Magick as a third way between religion and science, giving The Equinox the subtitle of [...] "The Method of Science; the Aim of Religion". Within that journal he expressed positive sentiments toward science and the scientific method, and urged magicians to keep detailed records of their magical experiments, [...] "The more scientific the record is, the better". His understanding of magic was also influenced {{by the work of}} the anthropologist James Frazer, in particular the view that magic was a precursor to science in a cultural evolutionary framework. Unlike Frazer however, Crowley did not see magic as a survival from the past that required eradication, but rather he believed that magic had to be adapted to suit the new age of science.|$|E
