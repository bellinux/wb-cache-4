40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a <b>travel</b> decision model using sociodemographics, <b>travel</b> characteristics, and psychographic factors and identify the different types of <b>travel</b> decision patterns in Japanese and West German <b>travel</b> markets. A secondary analysis of data from the Pleasure <b>Travel</b> Markets Survey for Japan and West Germany in 1989 was used. The major findings supported the proposition that models of a <b>travel</b> decision consisting of sociodemographics, <b>travel</b> characteristics and psychographics variables fit the observed data very well. Sociodemographics and <b>travel</b> characteristics were significantly related to psychographics variables and further predict the <b>travel</b> decision. The results also showed that <b>travel</b> decision pattern segmentation (<b>travel</b> philosophy [...] <b>travel</b> benefit sought [...] <b>travel</b> product preference) is a viable approach to identify different types of <b>travel</b> decision patterns in Japanese and West German <b>travel</b> markets. Implications of the findings are discussed and future research directions are suggested for this important area. ...|$|R
