I watched a guy [...] "chasing the dragon". It frightened me to death. I had never seen that before." [...] He refused to answer detailed questions about the trial or case, but protested his innocence, saying [...] "If I knew who killed my wife, how, where, why, then I would have said so. I did not know <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know now." ...|$|E

Sometimes I use 40 tracks of audio just on one vocal track. Each has a different level and treatment, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> a composite.

2500|$|She {{converted}} to Orthodoxy and became Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna of Russia. The lavish wedding {{took place on}} [...] in the Imperial Chapel of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. Financial constraints had prevented her parents from attending the wedding, and in their stead, they sent her brother, Crown Prince Frederick. Her brother-in-law, the Prince of Wales, had also travelled to Saint Petersburg for the ceremony; pregnancy had prevented the Princess of Wales from attending. After the wedding night, Alexander wrote in his diary, [...] "I took off my slippers and my silver embroidered robe and felt the body of my beloved next to mine...
