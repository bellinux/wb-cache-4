5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plots</b> shown {{of image}} impedance, {{attenuation}} and phase change are <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> of a low-pass prototype filter section. The prototype has a cut-off frequency of ωc = 1 rad/s and a nominal impedance R0 = 1 Ω. This {{is produced by}} a filter half-section where L = 1 henry and C = 1 farad. This prototype can be impedance scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values. The low-pass prototype can also be transformed into high-pass, band-pass or band-stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations.|$|E
5|$|Another source may be Aesop's Fables as {{published}} by William Caxton—scholar John MacQueen considers this {{more likely than}} Disciplina clericalis—although the tale itself is not Aesopic but rather of the beast fable (also beast-epic) genre. <b>The</b> <b>plots</b> of such works are more complicated than their Aesopic counterpart, tend more towards ribaldry, and feature the fox making {{a victim of the}} wolf.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the series}} {{consists}} of original content featuring new as well as established characters, but the second season is mostly based on <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> of Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is an attempt to read Mark 12 : 1 - 12 in terms of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> of <b>the</b> Gospel. Firstly a brief survey is given of the {{development}} of <b>the</b> term <b>plot</b> from Aristotle to the present, thereafter an own methodological point of departure concerning plot is formulated in order to study <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> of Mark. <b>The</b> conclusions made from this are used to indicate how Mark 12 : 1 - 12 fits into <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> of <b>the</b> Gospel and what functional role it plays in the development of <b>the</b> <b>plot.</b> <b>The</b> conclusion reached is that Mark 12 : 1 - 12 contains <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> of Mark in a nutshell...|$|R

5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope.

5|$|Fleming was {{not happy}} with the book, owing to the {{reactions}} by critics and fans, and attempted to suppress elements of it where he could: he blocked a paperback edition in the United Kingdom and only gave permission for the title to be used when he sold the film rights to Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, rather than any aspects of <b>the</b> <b>plots.</b> However, a British paperback edition was published after his death, and the Bond film character of Jaws is loosely based on one of the characters in the book.|$|E

50|$|The Greek philosopher Aristotle, {{writing in}} the fourth century BCE in his classic book <b>The</b> Poetics, {{considered}} <b>plot</b> or mythos as the most important element of drama, even more important than character. Aristotle wrote that a tragedy, a type of plot, could be divided into three parts: a beginning, where <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> is set up; a middle, where <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> reaches its climax; and an end, where <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> is resolved. He also believed that the events of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> must causally relate to one another as being either necessary or probable. Of the utmost importance is <b>the</b> <b>plot's</b> ability to arouse emotion in the psyche of the audience, he thought.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plot</b> {{involved}} up to 10 conspirators travelling from Syria {{to engage}} in a series of suicide bombings and mass shootings in central Düsseldorf. <b>The</b> <b>plot</b> was to involve attacks on the Heinrich-Heine-Allee street, as well as other attacks in the Altstadt district of <b>the</b> city. <b>The</b> <b>plot</b> was supposedly ordered by ISIS command in Syria and <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> was foiled while waiting for all the conspirators to arrive in the city.|$|R

5|$|It was a multi-target success, with an {{audience}} {{not limited to}} viewers in their forties as the focus on 1980s nostalgia might have indicated. This countered a contemporary trend in series television to target a specific audience demographic. <b>The</b> <b>plots</b> include characters and situations for all ages, and the series' general tone is family-friendly. Although it includes a number of flashbacks, the scripts did not limit the actors to a 1980s viewpoint; according to consultant Mariela Mociulsky, the show reflects more modern realities (such as men showing their emotions and women having greater autonomy in their lives) than TV shows of the 1980s did.|$|E
5|$|Note: The {{short story}} {{takes place at}} an inn on the road from London to Norwich, but the play calls for Alsatian costumery.

There are also various small changes to the order of events, not described.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, L. Sprague de Camp {{considered}} Morris's fantasies {{to be not}} wholly successful, partly because Morris eschewed many literary techniques from later eras. In particular, De Camp argued <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> of the novels are heavily driven by coincidence; while many things just happened in the romances, the novels are still weakened by the dependence on it. Nevertheless, large subgenres {{of the field of}} fantasy have sprung from the romance genre, but indirectly, through their writers' imitation of William Morris.|$|E

5|$|The {{film has}} been {{compared}} to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as the stories have some elements in common such being set in a fantasy world, <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> including a disturbance in logic and stability, and there being motifs such as food having transformational qualities; though developments and themes are not shared. Among other stories compared to Spirited Away, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is seen to be more closely linked thematically.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Days of Ruin is {{considerably}} darker than, and unrelated to, <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> of previous games. Almost 90% of humanity {{has been killed}} off following devastating meteor strikes which have destroyed much of civilization and caused a massive dust cloud to blot out the sun, preventing photosynthesis and thereby preventing the growing of crops. Scattered survivors pick through the wreckage, and the remnants of several military superpowers patrol the ravaged landscape, some factions protecting the innocent while the others prey upon them.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plots</b> of the unmade serials also vary. A {{theme of}} a {{civilisation}} {{where women are}} dominant was proposed twice—once for The Hidden Planet, and again for The Prison in Space. In some cases, elements of unmade serials were adapted, or were moved from one serial to another; for example, Song of the Space Whale {{was intended to be}} the introduction of Vislor Turlough until it was repeatedly set back, causing Mawdryn Undead to be Turlough's first appearance.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plot</b> {{is known}} also as Watson's <b>Plot,</b> <b>the</b> Catholic <b>Plot,</b> <b>the</b> Surprising Treason, or the Treason of the Priests.

40|$|Parody as {{a salient}} device in postmodern {{literature}} is extensively applied by Tom Stoppard in his plays. Having different layers of parody, Stoppard‟s “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead”, “The Real Inspector Hound”, and “Dogg‟s Hamlet, Cahoot‟s Macbeth ” exhibit his parodic application of other writers ‟ <b>plots.</b> <b>The</b> analytical-qualitative scrutiny of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> lines of these plays not only corroborates their parodic nature but also demonstrates the techniques Stoppard employs in each play to parody <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> of its hypotext. “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead ” dramatizes a specific parody of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> of “Hamlet ” both where it overlaps <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> of <b>the</b> tragedy and more intensely where it touches Shakespeare‟s plot tangentially. Stoppard‟s genre parody of <b>the</b> stock <b>plot</b> of <b>the</b> crime genre is portrayed in “The Real Inspector Hound”. It simultaneously enjoys {{a parody of}} <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> of Agatha Christie‟s “The Mousetrap”. The three-part performance {{in the first part}} of “Dogg‟s Hamlet, Cahoot‟s Macbeth ” displays a specific parody of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> of Shakespeare‟s “Hamlet”...|$|R
