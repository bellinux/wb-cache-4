40|$|The video content {{management}} has attracted increasing attention in recent years. We {{have proposed a}} new spatio-temporal knowledge structure, called 3 D C-string, to represent the spatio-temporal relations between <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> a video and {{to keep track of}} the motions and size changes of <b>the</b> <b>objects.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we propose a video algebra to infer the spatio-temporal relations between <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> a video represented by the 3 D C-string. The algebra contains four kinds of rules, namely, transitive, distributive, manipulation, and integration rules. By using those rules, all the binary relations between <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> a video can be derived from a given 3 D C-string. The algebra provides the theoretic basis for spatio-temporal reasoning and video query inference...|$|R

In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>in</b> the photo were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived.

This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, the object is hidden in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Typically, children younger than one year old search for the object under Location A, where the object was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>in</b> Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B task is a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Mayan languages is {{simpler than}} that of other Mesoamerican languages, yet its morphology is still considered agglutinating and polysynthetic.

Possessed nouns are marked for person of possessor. In Mayan languages, nouns are not marked for case and gender is not explicitly marked. Inanimate nouns are not gendered, but, if necessary, the gender of animate nouns may be specified by the prefix.|$|E

5|$|Wagiman is a prefixing language, which, in {{the context}} of {{typology}} of Australian languages, may refer to its genealogical classification as well as its syntactic properties.

However, Wagiman also behaves as a dependent-marking language, in that nominals are case marked as to their grammatical or semantic roles, such as ergative (the subject of a transitive clause) or absolutive (the object of a transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause).|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} common effectors is the gripper.

Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include the Delft hand. Mechanical grippers can come in various types, including friction and encompassing jaws. Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>in</b> place using friction.
