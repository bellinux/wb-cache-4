5000|$|Women's {{events were}} added {{beginning}} in 1961 with Wilma Rudolph {{competing in the}} 100 meters. The 1966 Relays began a streak of 48 consecutive Saturdays with a sellout. In 1969, a $175,000 tartan track was installed. The events at the Relays would go all-metric beginning in 1976; the track was rebuilt in a 400-meter oval in 1978. The track oval was resurfaced in 1983 and in 1988 was renamed the [...] "Jim Duncan Track" [...] to honor the long <b>time</b> <b>relays</b> public address announcer.|$|E
5000|$|A {{relay race}} {{is run by}} a team of {{competitors}} each running a course, and the result is based on the team's total <b>time.</b> <b>Relays</b> usually employ a mass start instead of a staggered start. Relays are part of World Orienteering Championships both as sprint relays and as cross-country relays. Additionally, there are popular mass club races out of which Jukola relay has the highest number of participating clubs 1,787 (in 2015), while 25-manna has the highest number of legs 25. To reduce competitors following each other, various spreading methods might be used. This is called [...] "gaffling", which is a Swedish word meaning [...] "forking". The key principle is that every team must run every leg (between each pair of two controls), but not necessarily in the same order. The IOF have introduced the nomenclature to try to clarify the usage of the word [...] "leg". In orienteering usage, leg normally refers to the part of a race between two control points. In relay (non-orienteering) usage, leg refers to the part of a race run by a single team member. The IOF prefer [...] "lap" [...] for this latter term, but despite this, in common parlance, [...] "leg" [...] is used for both terms.|$|E

The purpose of the coordination process is to find a time element function that allows it to operate using a constant back–up time delay, for any fault current. The results obtained from <b>time</b> overcurrent adaptive <b>relays</b> are collated, and the results from analysis of negative sequence <b>relays</b> and conventional <b>time</b> overcurrent <b>relays</b> are also presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a simulator for the electro-mechanical control systems. Electro-mechanical control systems mainly consist of contactors, <b>time</b> <b>relays,</b> electrical motors, switches, buttons and etc. Single or three phase power {{system that has}} high voltage and current is generally used {{in this kind of}} systems. Engineering students or technicians who are studying electro-mechanical control systems are always faced with a high voltage and current. For this reason a simulator is developed to establish a safety study environment. In this environment, students easily implement their designs or assignments to get familiar with the real industrial applications in the laboratory. Key-Words: Electro-mechanical systems, Electrical motor control, Electrical control techniques simulator, Educational tool, Educational simulators. ...|$|E

The system was designed to support loading analyses on the Tracking Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS). The system is a scheduler for various types of data relays (including tape recorder dumps and real <b>time</b> <b>relays)</b> from orbiting payloads to the TDRSS. Several model options are available to statistically generate data relay requirements. TDRSS time lines (representing resources available for scheduling) and payload/TDRSS acquisition and loss of sight time lines are input to the scheduler from disk. Tabulated output from the interactive system includes {{a summary of the}} scheduler activities over time intervals specified by the user and overall summary of scheduler input and output information. A history file, which records every event generated by the scheduler, is written to disk to allow further scheduling on remaining resources and to provide data for graphic displays or additional statistical analysis...|$|E
