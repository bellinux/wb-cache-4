This new strategy was {{as a result of}} the appointment of a new chief executive officer. In order to build and implement the strategy, one of the top international consulting firms was hired by the CEO. The consulting firm advised the CEO that <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard would facilitate the implementation of the strategy and it would improve the performance of the employees and the company performance for <b>the</b> shareholders. <b>The</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard architect from a consulting firm and 14 employees from the mobile telecommunications company were interviewed. The interview with the architect focused on the process of building the scorecard and the views of the ‗architect‘ on the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard at <b>the</b> company. The other interviews aimed to answer two questions; namely how <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard facilitated <b>the</b> implementation of the strategy in the company and the factors that helped or hindered the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard in <b>the</b> company. The research presents how <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard had not successfully facilitated the implementation of the company strategy as <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard had not been effectively implemented.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. <b>The</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard {{has become}} vital for {{companies}} {{in order to}} ensure a competitive advantage in our ever changing global environment. <b>The</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard, if applied effectively, will assess whether the company’s vision, mission, strategy and values are achieved. <b>The</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard system is a management tool {{that can be used to}} transform strategy into action. <b>The</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard used at Picture Perfect Photography has been identified as problematic. This study includes a literature study on <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard system and an empirical study regarding the application of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard in a specific Photography company. The literature study set out to evaluate the efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard as it is applied at Picture Perfect Photography. The secondary objectives defined <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard, reviewed <b>the</b> evolution and the need for a <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard. <b>The</b> literature study further explored the advantages and disadvantages of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard and continued exploring personal development with linking it to compensation. <b>The</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard should be used to align the company’s vision and strategy in order to improve long-term performance. The research indicates that communication and constant feedback play an important role in the successful implementation of a <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard approach. <b>The</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard could be a very useful instrument when implemented and applied effectively. An empirical study was done including Picture Perfect Photography’s employees, at different job levels, work sections and years of service. The aim of the empirical study was to determine how <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard was used in the alignment with the company’s strategy, vision, mission and values. Furthermore, the aim was to determine the problems with <b>the</b> existing <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard and if it helps to focus on quality, reengineering and customer services’ initiatives. The study indicated more or less the same average responses on specific Balanced Scorecard related issues. The majority of employees responded that feedback and communication of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard were not transparent enough nor was it applied effectively. Conclusions and recommendations were made in order to identify and improve the advancement of an effectively applied Balanced Scorecard used at Picture Perfect Photography for the future.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>balanced</b> {{scorecard}} arguably {{regarded as}} one of the most important and widely used financial framework. since it's creation by Robert Kaplan and David Norton, as a simple framework to resolve problems associated with traditional financial-only performance measurement system, the tool has evolved not only to become a comprehensive performance masurement framework but also a strategic management system. The general trend worldwide on the number of companies that have been implementing <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard has been on a rise, but whether this is the same in a Malaysian context is difficult to determine, due to unavailability of supporting data and research. Under these circumstances, it probably would be fair to say that either Malaysian companies have been implementing <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard (with no proper study done to determine the extent of implementation) or Malaysian companies are reluctance to implement <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard. Based on the latter being the most likely case, a case study research was undertaken on two public-listed Malaysian companies to determine their reluctant in implementing <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard. With an interview-based approach to undertake the case study, it was possible to conclude that Malaysian companies are well aware of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard concept and techniques, but their reluctance to implement <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard was attributable to the cost,complexity, familiarity with their current measurement and planning tool and how <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard would integrate with their current measurement system.
