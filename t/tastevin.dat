2500|$|In {{the rubber}} hand {{illusion}} (RHI), human participants view a dummy hand being stroked with a paintbrush, while {{they feel a}} series of identical brushstrokes applied to their own hand, which is hidden from view. If this visual and tactile information is applied synchronously, and if the visual appearance and position of the dummy hand is similar to one's own hand, then people may feel that the touches on their own hand are coming from the dummy hand, and even that the dummy hand is, in some way, their own hand. This is an early form of body transfer illusion. The RHI is an illusion of vision, touch, and posture (proprioception), but a similar illusion can also be induced with touch and proprioception. It has also been found that the illusion may not require tactile stimulation at all, but can be completely induced using mere vision of the rubber hand being in a congruent posture with the hidden real hand. [...] The very first report {{of this kind of}} illusion may have been as early as 1937 (<b>Tastevin,</b> 1937).|$|E

5000|$|Lawrence put <b>Tastevin</b> {{in touch}} with Edward C. [...] "Ted" [...] Martin, who had {{designed}} an engine that Lawrence thought would work well in the Monica. After evaluating the engine <b>Tastevin</b> bought the design, rights and existing tooling for Ted Martin's engine. The agreement included four complete 3.0 litre engines.|$|E
50|$|After the French Revolution, {{the general}} {{use of these}} cups died out, but winemakers and traders {{continued}} their use. After 1840 the design was mostly standardized, to the type shown in the illustration above. A few <b>tastevins</b> were made and used in countries other than France, but only a few. In the twentieth century sommeliers in upscale restaurants sometimes carried <b>tastevins</b> around their necks with a ribbon or chain, and used them to check wine after opening the bottle. That custom has largely died out, but is occasionally still seen in the twenty-first century.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of modern {{electric}} lights, <b>tastevins</b> have very little practical use, although sommeliers often wear them on a ribbon or chain around the neck as a nod to tradition.|$|R
5000|$|The find {{consisted}} of a large Roman bronze vessel with a handle, a situla, which held a large gold torc, four Roman wine cups resembling modern <b>tastevins,</b> a bronze strainer and two bronze bells. The hoard was from about 100 AD and all the objects were exceptionally well preserved. On {{the handle of the}} situla were stamps reading [...] "TOR, CANNIMASUIT, (P CI)PI POLYB and IPI(?)". The two bells were tied together with leather straps into a rattle.|$|R

5000|$|After the Geneva show <b>Tastevin</b> invited several racing {{drivers and}} {{automotive}} journalists to Paul Ricard's circuit, Le Castellet, {{to evaluate the}} new Chrysler-powered car. Among those there was driver/journalist Paul Frère, whom <b>Tastevin</b> invited to [...] "lend a hand" [...] in sorting out the car's handling. He would also be the person who wrote the semi-official obituary for the Monica car.|$|E
50|$|Lawrence {{delivered}} chassis #3 to Vignale's carrozeria, {{and they}} completed {{the body in}} steel. While prototype #3 was a significant improvement the <b>Tastevins</b> were not yet entirely satisfied with its appearance. Performance of this car was also disappointing due to it being between 200 kg and 250 kg overweight. By way of explanation Lawrence drilled a hole into the scuttle. The drill penetrated 0.5 in of lead. Vignale, in the mean time, sold his company to DeTomaso in December 1969 and died three days later {{in an automobile accident}} while driving a Maserati.|$|R
5000|$|The saucer-like cups were {{originally}} created by Burgundian winemakers {{to enable them}} to judge the clarity and color of wine that was stored in dim, candle-lit wine cellars. Regular wine glasses were too deep to allow for accurate judging of the wine's color in such faint light. <b>Tastevins</b> are designed with a shiny faceted inner surface. Often, the bottom of the cup is [...] in shape. The facets, convex bottom, and the shiny inner surface catch as much available light as possible, reflecting it throughout the wine in the cup, making it possible to see through the wine.|$|R
50|$|Wine cups or <b>tastevins</b> are {{mentioned}} occasionally in European inventories from 1200 to 1600. Around 1680, silver cups about 3-4 {{inches in diameter}} and 1-2 inches deep came into use in France by affluent people. The custom spread and they came into general use among the wealthy around 1720-1750. They were made by master silversmiths, and were often decorated and engraved with the owner's name. Their size and shape allowed them to be carried in a pocket at all times, and they were prized possessions like rings or watches. Each region in France had its own characteristic style. They were mostly male possessions, but in Normandy about 15 per cent were engraved with women's names.|$|R
5000|$|The Mura/Bohurá endonym is Buhuraen, {{according}} to Barboza Rodrigues (1892), or Buxivaray ~ Buxwarahay, {{according to}} <b>Tastevin</b> (1923). This was pronounced Murá by their neighbors, the Torá and Matanawi. In his vocabulary, Rodrigues lists Bohura {{for the people}} and bhurai-ada 'Mura language' for the language, from the Mura of the Manicoré River; <b>Tastevin</b> has Bohurai and bohuarai-arase for the same.

50|$|In 1969 {{prototype}} chassis #3, {{the first}} to receive a ZF 5-speed manual transmission, was built. At this time the <b>Tastevins</b> introduced Tudor (Tony) Rascanu, a Romanian exile and former shop manager for Vignale in Italy, to the project. Rascanu was entrusted with the job of completely restyling the bodywork for the third prototype, but {{was not allowed to}} make any modifications to Lawrence's chassis, which was to be sent to French coach-builder Henri Chapron in Paris. Chapron was to build a full-sized maquette, or body-form, of the revised car under Rascanu's oversight. Rascanu and Capron's work met with Tastevin's approval. With hidden headlamps in a sloping aerodynamic nose and wide horizontal taillights it was much more appealing than the previous two attempts. The maquette was then sent to Carrozzeria Alfredo Vignale in Turin {{to be used as a}} base for Vignale to produce a body in steel.|$|R
50|$|A rapid {{succession}} of prototypes {{would be built}} to finalize the car. The cars at Le Castellet were numbers 8 and 9. Numbers 10 and 11 were built for crash-testing and numbers 12, 13 and 14 came after. Prototype 14 was basically pre-production and would eventually {{be one of the}} cars <b>Tastevin</b> kept for his personal use. <b>Tastevin</b> had hired a director to get production under way at Balbigny, but nothing was built for a year while the new director stalled and made changes to the car. Eventually <b>Tastevin</b> fired the directory and turned production over to LawrenceTune again while he looked for a new director. The car was also subsequently shown at the Earls Court auto show.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} Paris auto show, <b>Tastevin</b> phoned Lawrence {{and told him}} that he had {{arranged}} for the car to be evaluated by a team from Matra. A team of six from Matra drove the cars for over three hours straight and then met with <b>Tastevin.</b> The outcome of the evaluation was that the Matra engineers thought that the car should go into production, but only with a different engine.|$|E

50|$|In the {{intervening}} time things had settled down in Paris, and <b>Tastevin</b> {{wanted to move}} the project along quickly. Chassis #5 {{was sent to the}} factory in Balbigny while Lawrence set about establishing a machine shop at LawrenceTune Engines able to produce the engines as well. Problems with castings coming from a company called Birmingham Alloys prompted Lawrence to have <b>Tastevin</b> search his contacts in the French aluminum industry for an alternative supplier, settling on a company called Montupet.|$|E

50|$|One of the 1889 {{vineyard}} buyers, Léonce Bocquet, {{also bought}} the château, and initiated renovations {{of a part}} of it. In 1920, the château came {{into the hands of}} Etienne Camuzet, who was vineyard owner in Vosne-Romanée and politician. He put it to the disposal of the Confrérie des Chevaliers du <b>Tastevin,</b> and on November 29, 1944 sold it to the organisation Société civile des Amis du Château du Clos de Vougeot ("Friends of the Château du Clos de Vougeot"), which gave the Confrérie des Chevaliers du <b>Tastevin</b> a 99-year lease on the property.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tastevin</b> {{decided that}} the car would debut at the Salon de l'Auto show in Paris in October 1971. The car on display was powered by a Martin V8 and was called the Monica 350. <b>Tastevin</b> {{arranged}} to have a car raised to the tenth floor of a Paris hotel {{the day before the}} show, and then have it moved over to the Salon, where the car was received enthusiastically. The morning after the day of the show Lawrence was approached by Zora-Arkus Duntov, who asked if he could take the car for a drive. Lawrence handed him the keys.|$|E

5000|$|Automotive {{engineer}} and racing driver Chris Lawrence's company LawrenceTune Engines {{had developed a}} 2.6-litre version of the Standard engine used in the Triumph TR4. Lawrence's version used a crossflow cylinder head of his own design and Tecalemit-Jackson fuel injection to make a claimed [...] bhp. Automotive journalist Gérard [...] "Jabby" [...] Crombac had seen the engine at the 1966 Racing Show at Olympia West Hall in London. The article he wrote about it had caught Tastevin's eye. <b>Tastevin</b> wrote to Lawrence asking about having LawrenceTune supply 250 engines per year for his new car. Upon learning that the car was not yet developed, Lawrence offered the services of his own company. Crombac, who was familiar with Lawrence's racing exploits, vouched for Lawrence and <b>Tastevin</b> entrusted development of the Monica to LawrenceTune.|$|E
