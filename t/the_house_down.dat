5|$|Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis paired {{up to do}} slapstick comedy for {{the first}} time at the 500 Club on July 25, 1946. While Martin was trying to get gigs as a singer, Lewis {{performed}} as a comedian at the club. One night a different act failed to show up and Lewis suggested to the owner that he hire Martin to do comedy with him. The owner was skeptical, but the two went ahead and tried to devise an act on paper in their hotel room, which did not work. The next night, they went on stage and improvised for three hours, bringing <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>down.</b> The comedy duo of Martin and Lewis was popular in nightclubs and in film from 1946 to 1956.|$|E
25|$|This {{includes}} the tree-flanked sloping lawns {{to the south}} of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>down</b> to the Octagon Lake and {{a mile and a half}} beyond to the Corinthian Arch beyond which stretches the Grand Avenue of over a mile and a half to Buckingham. This is the oldest area of the gardens. There were walled gardens on the site of the south lawn from the 1670s that belonged to the old house. These gardens were altered in the 1680s when the house was rebuilt on the present site. They were again remodelled by Bridgeman from 1716. The lawns with the flanking woods took on their current character from 1741 when 'Capability' Brown re-landscaped this area.|$|E
25|$|Exorcism by a Christian priest {{works in}} some tales; {{the bishop of}} Hildesheim managed to exorcise Hödekin from the castle. Even this method is not fool-proof, however; when an exorcist tried to drive away Heinzelmann, the kobold tore up the priest's holy book, strewed it about the room, {{attacked}} the exorcist, and chased him away. Insulting a kobold may drive it away, but not without a curse; when someone tried to see his true form, Goldemar left the home and vowed that the house would now be as unlucky {{as it had been}} fortunate under his care. Actions a Hütchen considers insulting include giving him clothing, rushing him in his work, burning <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>down,</b> and leaving a wagon wheel in front of it.|$|E

25|$|In February 1958, Brel's wife Miche {{and their}} two {{children}} returned to live in Belgium, while Brel rented a room near Place de Clichy in Paris—a place to stay on those rare occasions when he was not touring. In March and April, he recorded his third album, Au Printemps (In the spring), which would be released later that year. In May, while touring Canada for the first time, he met Félix Leclerc. On 23 August, his third daughter, Isabelle, was born back in Belgium. In November he gave a recital at the Halles d'Arlon in Belgian Luxembourg with Stéphane Steeman. In December Brel appeared at the Olympia in Paris as the supporting act to Philippe Clay. The pianist Gérard Jouannest and François Rauber joined Brel on stage for this performance. Brel's incredibly emotional performance brought <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
25|$|Humphrey Lyttelton, {{primarily}} {{known as}} a jazz trumpeter and bandleader, was invited to be chairman because of {{the role played by}} improvisation in both comedy and jazz music. In the first series Lyttelton shared the role of chairman with Barry Cryer but he made it his own (especially once Cryer replaced Cleese as a regular panellist) and continued as chairman until his death on 25 April 2008. He read the script introducing the programme and segments in an utterly deadpan manner. He claimed the secret was just to read what was in front of him without understanding why it was funny. He adopted the grumpy persona of someone who would really rather be somewhere else, which he attributed to worrying that, surrounded by four professional comedians, he would have nothing worthwhile to chip in. He did occasionally depart from the script, however, often bringing <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>down</b> with an ad-lib. He was credited by the regular panellists as being the chief reason for the show's longevity.|$|E
25|$|Shia historians {{hold that}} Umar called for Ali and his {{followers}} {{to come out and}} swear allegiance to Abu Bakr. When they did not, Umar broke in, resulting in Fatimah's ribs being broken by being pressed between the door and the wall causing her to miscarry Muhsin which led to her eventual death. Another Shia version of the events says that Umar sent a force led by his slave-boy Qunfud to Fatimah's house instructing them to bring Ali to the mosque. Arriving at the house, Qunfud requested permission to enter, which was refused by Ali causing Qunfud to return to Abu Bakr and Umar and relate the events, who instructed them to go back and enter the house by force if necessary. Qunfud and his men returned but were this time refused permission by Fatimah which caused Qunfud to send his men back to Abu Bakr and Umar for further instructions who told them to burn <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>down</b> if necessary in order to bring Ali to them.|$|E

25|$|Kelly's first {{documented}} {{brush with}} the law was on 15 October 1869 {{at the age of}} 14 when he was charged with the assault and robbery of Ah Fook, a pig and fowl trader of Chinese descent from Bright. According to Fook, as he was passing Kelly's house, Kelly approached him with a long bamboo stick, announcing that he was a bushranger and would kill him if he did not hand over his money. Kelly then allegedly took him into the bush, beat him with the stick and stole 10 shillings. According to Kelly, his sister Annie and two witnesses, Bill Skilling and Bill Grey, Annie was sitting outside the house sewing when Fook walked up and asked for a drink of water. Given creek water, he abused Annie for not giving him rain water, and Kelly came outside and pushed him. Fook then hit Kelly three times with the bamboo stick, causing him to run away. The visitor then walked away, threatening to return and burn <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>down,</b> and Kelly did not return until sundown. Historians find neither account convincing and believe that Kelly's account is likely true up to being hit by Fook but then Kelly probably took the stick from him and beat him with it.|$|E

50|$|The name Glen Alpine {{dates back}} to the 1820s when Thomas Reddall, who lends his name to Thomas Reddall High School in {{neighbouring}} Ambarvale, built a house with that name. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> burnt <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> early 1900s and the site is now called Heritage Park on Abington Crescent.

[...] Three weeks of tryouts in Boston followed the brief New Haven run, and the audience there gave the musical a warm reception.

500|$|Cyrus has {{performed}} the song during her Bangerz Tour. Critics praised her {{performance of the}} song, specifically praising Cyrus' vocals and showmanship. While performing [...] "FU" [...] during {{the first leg of}} the tour, Cyrus wore a long red sequined skirt over a sequined red and white leotard designed by [...] "The Blonds". She also wore matching gloves and cowboy boots. During the second leg of the show, she replaced the center color of the leotard from red to neon yellow and wore a long feathery yellow skirt with yellow elbow-length gloves. David Blond of The Blonds stated that the pave crystal bodysuit and the rip-away sequin skirt were inspired by Jessica Rabbit. A Sesame Street-esque, bi-pod puppet joined her during the performance. Of her August 4, 2014 performance at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that she bought <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>down</b> [...] "with a show-stopping cabaret vocal" [...] during [...] "FU".|$|E
500|$|Tudor-style {{garden on}} the {{original}} [...] site that the Weddells purchased for the house site, using a steeply sloping southern hillside by creating interconnecting cascading ponds, flagstone walkways and terraced garden beds. In 1932, the second phase reworked the original concept by overlaying a cross-axis and planting further beds for flowers such as tulips and iris. The third phase of the plan took place in 1939, when the Weddells purchased a large adjacent piece of land on the southern side of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>down</b> towards the James River. Gillette extensively planted grass and positioned evergreens in an asymmetrical pattern which he believed would demonstrate a romantic mirroring of the rambling architecture of the house. As of 1990, Gillette's original blueprints and notes are preserved in a collection at the Fiske Kimball Fine Arts Library at the University of Virginia. Garden Week tours are held in Virginia House gardens in the spring, attracting thousands of visitors annually.|$|E

5000|$|J. L. Mackie {{argues that}} usual talk of [...] "cause" [...] in fact refers to INUS {{conditions}} (insufficient but non-redundant {{parts of a}} condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect). An example is a short circuit as a cause for a <b>house</b> burning <b>down.</b> Consider <b>the</b> collection of events: the short circuit, the proximity of flammable material, {{and the absence of}} firefighters. Together these are unnecessary but sufficient to <b>the</b> <b>house's</b> burning <b>down</b> (since many other collections of events certainly could have led to <b>the</b> <b>house</b> burning <b>down,</b> for example shooting <b>the</b> <b>house</b> with a flamethrower in the presence of oxygen and so forth). Within this collection, the short circuit is an insufficient (since the short circuit by itself would not have caused the fire) but non-redundant (because the fire would not have happened without it, everything else being equal) part of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the effect. So, the short circuit is an INUS condition for the occurrence of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> burning <b>down.</b>|$|R

500|$|In Greece, a {{large log}} was lit on the hearth on Christmas Eve and kept burning or {{smoldering}} through the Twelve Days of Christmas. This was {{done as a}} protection against the demons called Kallikantzaroi, believed to be emerging from their dens at night during that period to attack people and damage their property. The fire and smoke from the log was thought to prevent the Kallikantzaroi from entering <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>down</b> the chimney. The ritual burning of logs on the Eve was also carried out in Albania. When the buzm, as the log was called there, {{was about to be}} brought into the house, {{a member of the family}} would go out into the yard, shout the name of the household's head, and proclaim that the buzm was coming and bringing all kinds of delicious things. The head of the household would respond by saying [...] "You are welcome!" [...] and the buzm would be ceremonially brought in, greeted by the family and treated with great respect. The log would be placed on the hearth, and often a significant part of all food and drink in the house would be put on the log and burned together with it.|$|E
