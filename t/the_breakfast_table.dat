Later, she is seen with female hands on her body as she dances seductively. Other scenes show her wearing lingerie and performing a pole dance with several other female dancers. Shortly afterwards, Beyoncé performs a choreographed chair dance across a purple background as Jay-Z is seen in the audience watching her while smoking a cigar. The end of the video shows the singer dancing with another woman next to her to a projected cheetah print. The last seconds cut to <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table</b> where Beyoncé is seen. For the video, the singer wears an archival corset by Christian Lacroix, lace gloves by Chanel, and a crystal mask by Atelier Swarovski.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{structure}} {{influenced the}} biographical films Lawrence of Arabia and —which {{begin with the}} subject's death and show their life in flashbacks—as well as Welles's thriller Mr. Arkadin. Rosenbaum sees similarities in the film's plot to Mr. Arkadin, {{as well as the}} theme of nostalgia for loss of innocence throughout Welles's career, beginning with Citizen Kane and including The Magnificent Ambersons, Mr. Arkadin and Chimes at Midnight. Rosenbaum also points out how the film influenced Warren Beatty's Reds. The film depicts the life of Jack Reed through the eyes of Louise Bryant, much as Kane's life is seen through the eyes of Thompson and the people who he interviews. Rosenbaum also compared the romantic montage between Reed and Bryant with <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table</b> montage in Citizen Kane.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Others, the Simpson family find unexplained frosty {{chocolate}} milkshakes and that their TV only shows Married... with Children. After a ghost attacks him in his sleep, Homer summons the ghosts, who are the family's former selves from The Tracey Ullman Show. Homer is attracted to the ghost Marge who prefers him to the former grumpy Homer, so the jealous living Marge kills herself to become a ghost. The ghost Homer becomes jealous and bludgeons the living Homer {{to death with a}} toaster while he is in the bathtub. Bart fakes suicide to join the ghosts, tricking Lisa into actually killing herself, her ghost then murders Bart as revenge. Groundskeeper Willie takes the children's corpses to make stew and it is implied that he murdered Maggie. Homer chooses his modern-day wife over the older ghost. The next morning at <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table,</b> Lisa asks if there could ever be any other incarnations of the Simpsons and a range of Simpson families based on other animations are then shown. The segment ends with the original version of Homer unsuccessfully trying to photograph a good portrait of the two families together.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, Gardner's {{official}} biography, entitled Gerald Gardner: Witch, was published. It {{was written}} by a friend of his, the Sufi mystic Idries Shah, but used {{the name of one}} of Gardner's High Priests, Jack L. Bracelin, because Shah was wary about being associated with Witchcraft. In May of that year, Gardner travelled to Buckingham Palace, where he enjoyed a garden party in recognition of his years of service to the Empire in the Far East. Soon after his trip, Gardner's wife Donna died, and Gardner himself once again began to suffer badly from asthma. The following year he, along with Shah and Lois Bourne, travelled to the island of Majorca to holiday with the poet Robert Graves, whose The White Goddess would play a significant part in the burgeoning Wiccan religion. In 1963, Gardner decided to go to Lebanon over the winter. Whilst returning home on the ship, The Scottish Prince on 12 February 1964, he suffered a fatal heart attack at <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table.</b> He was buried in Tunisia, the ship's next port of call, and his funeral was attended only by the ship's captain.

500|$|Holmes first gained {{international}} fame {{with his}} [...] "Breakfast-Tables" [...] series. These three table-talk books attracted a diverse audience {{due to their}} conversational style, which made readers feel an intimate connection to the author, and resulted in a flood of letters from admirers.

He had met his second wife, Carol Held Knight (b. 1945), in 1992 at a golf tournament, where they were seated together at <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table.</b> She said little to Armstrong, but two weeks later she {{received a call from}} him asking what she was doing—she replied she was cutting down a cherry tree; 35 minutes later Armstrong was at her house to help out.

Upset by this, Lois goes to a PTA meeting to complain about the textbook. Responding to her grievances, Principal Shepherd explains that the school cannot afford new textbooks due to the school's loss of federal funding under the No Child Left Behind Act {{as a result of their}} low test scores.

500|$|When Homer is mowing {{his lawn}} with obvious frustration, his next-door {{neighbor}} Ned Flanders invites {{him into his}} basement rumpus room for a beer. Upon seeing Ned's house and observing his exaggeratedly perfect relationships {{with his wife and}} son, Homer erupts at Ned, accusing him of showing off. Ned angrily asks Homer to leave in response. Later, however, he feels guilty and writes a letter to Homer saying that he is really sorry and that he loves him as a brother. [...] Homer is amused by Ned's sentimentality and reads the letter to the family at <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table.</b> Marge is not happy with the family's reaction, despite being unable to control her laughter, and chastises Homer for making light of Ned's sincere apology. Afterward, Homer takes Bart and Maggie to Sir Putt-A-Lot's Merrie Olde Fun Centre for a round of miniature golf. They unexpectedly run into Ned and his son Todd and end up going golfing together.|$|E
500|$|... "Peterotica" [...] {{was written}} by Patrick Meighan and {{directed}} by Kurt Dumas. The episode ran into multiple objections from broadcasting standards and the show's producers. For instance, the original title of the episode was [...] "A Connecticut Yankee and King Arthur's Butt", but broadcasting standards objected. A sequence showing all of the different erotic novels written by Peter was edited for the television version; one entitled Catcher in the Eye {{was removed from the}} television version as broadcasting standards disliked the cover, which implied her eye was a target for semen during ejaculation. The scene of Peter reading his new erotic novel to Lois was never cut from airing, although the producers of Family Guy had some trouble with it, as it is the second semen joke of the episode. When Lois' father, Carter, sits down at <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table,</b> Lois states: [...] "Daddy, did you remember to clean up?" [...] Originally, she was meant to say, [...] "Daddy, did you remember to wipe yourself?", but broadcasting standards objected, so it was modified to [...] "Daddy, did you remember to clean yourself?"

500|$|The {{entrance}} {{to the first floor}} on the south front leads to a room now known as the Portico Room. [...] This was the original entrance hall to the house, but {{as a result of the}} 19th-century alterations it was converted into a billiard room. [...] It was later used as a drawing room, and during the time the house was used as a school, it was the school library. [...] From 1990 it has been restored as the entrance hall. [...] It contains a white chimney-piece and a cast iron grate. [...] The mahogany woodwork was carved by Daniel Shillito and Mathew Bertram and the plasterwork was by Thomas Oliver. [...] In the side walls are plaster figures of Isis and the Capitoline Flora in niches, and on the walls are plaster relief medallions representing the four seasons.

500|$|Citizen Kane was {{edited by}} Robert Wise and {{assistant}} editor Mark Robson. Both would become successful film directors. Wise was hired after Welles finished shooting the [...] "camera tests" [...] and began officially making the film. Wise said that Welles [...] "had an older editor assigned {{to him for}} those tests and evidently he was not too happy and asked to have somebody else. I was roughly Orson's age and had several good credits." [...] Wise and Robson began editing the film {{while it was still}} shooting and said that they [...] "could tell certainly that we were getting something very special. It was outstanding film day in and day out." [...] Welles gave Wise detailed instructions and was usually not present during the film's editing. The film was very well planned out and intentionally shot for such post-production techniques as slow dissolves. The lack of coverage made editing easy since Welles and Toland edited the film [...] "in camera" [...] by leaving few options of how it could be put together. Wise said <b>the</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>table</b> sequence took weeks to edit and get the correct [...] "timing" [...] and [...] "rhythm" [...] for the whip pans and over-lapping dialogue. The News on the March sequence was edited by RKO's newsreel division to give it authenticity. They used stock footage from Pathé News and the General Film Library.|$|E
