5|$|The Mundo Perdido {{continued}} {{to serve as}} an important burial site during the 8th and 9th centuries. The final version of the Talud-Tablero Temple received three elite status burials, possibly {{members of the royal family}} <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> extremely high quality of the associated offerings. These burials have been dated to the second half of the 8th century, during the reign of YaxNuunAyiinII.|$|E
5|$|The {{king was}} already {{advanced}} in {{age at the}} time of his death, being over fifty years old, <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> incisor teeth, which are worn and corroded by the impurities of which the Egyptian bread was full. The body, though small and emaciated, shows evidence of unusual muscular strength; the head is bald, the features are refined, and the mouth still bears an expression characteristic of shrewdness and cunning.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} is {{of very high}} quality, probably by an artist used to working on illuminated manuscripts, <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fine detail of the work, and some stylistic details. In its position on the high altar the detailed images would only have been clearly visible to officiating clergy, and no concessions were made to more popular taste. The tiny globe held by Christ is painted with four registers of scenes showing animals, trees, and {{a man in a}} boat.|$|E

25|$|<b>To</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{accounts}} of wholesale massacres in 115 BCE, {{the number of}} Jewish residents in Cyrenaica, Cyprus, and Mesopotamia was also large. At the commencement {{of the reign of}} Caesar Augustus, there were over 7,000 Jews in Rome (though this is only the number that is said to have escorted the envoys who came to demand the deposition of Archelaus; compare: Bringmann: Klaus: Geschichte der Juden im Altertum, Stuttgart 2005, S. 202. Bringmann talks about 8,000 Jews who lived in the city of Rome.). Many sources say that the Jews constituted a full one-tenth (10%) {{of the population of the}} ancient city of Rome itself. Finally, if the sums confiscated by the governor Lucius Valerius Flaccus in the year 62/61 BCE represented the tax of a didrachma per head for a single year, it would imply that the Jewish population of Asia Minor numbered 45,000 adult males, for a total of at least 180,000 persons.|$|E
25|$|In the pre-Spanish past, {{there may}} never have existed a unified concept of the afterlife. Among the Pokoman Maya of the Verapaz, Xbalanque was to {{accompany}} the dead king, which suggests a descent into the underworld (called xibalba 'place of fright') like that described in the Popol Vuh Twin myth. The Yucatec Maya had a double concept of the afterlife: Evildoers descended into an underworld (metnal) to be tormented there (a view still held by the 20th-century Lacandons), while others, such as those led by the goddess Ixtab, went {{to a sort of}} paradise. The ancestors of Maya kings (Palenque tomb of Pakal, Berlin pot) are shown sprouting from the earth like fruit trees which, together, constitute a blissful orchard. The so-called 'Flower Mountain' has more specifically been interpreted as a reference to an aquatic and solar paradise. <b>To</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> marine faunal remains found in Classic tombs and by the accompanying aquatic imagery, this sea paradise may have been the Maya variant of the rain god's paradise (Tlalocan) in Central Mexican religion.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her book}} The Beauty Myth, Naomi Wolf {{reported}} that [...] "thirty-three thousand women told American researchers {{they would rather}} lose ten to fifteen pounds than achieve any other goal." [...] Through repeated images of excessively thin women in media, advertisement, and modeling, thinness has become associated with not only beauty, but happiness and success. As Charisse Goodman {{put it in her}} article, [...] "One Picture is Worth a Thousand Diets," [...] advertisements have changed society's ideas of beauty and ugliness: [...] "Indeed <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> phrasing of the ads, 'slender' and ‘attractive' are one word, not two in the same fashion as 'fat' and 'ugly.'" [...] This idea of beauty has become drastically more narrow and unachievable, putting increased pressure on people looking to satisfy society's standards.|$|E

2500|$|Raphael {{was one of}} {{the finest}} draftsmen in the history of Western art, and used {{drawings}} extensively to plan his compositions. According to a near-contemporary, when beginning to plan a composition, he would lay out a large number of stock drawings of his on the floor, and begin to draw [...] "rapidly", borrowing figures from here and there. Over forty sketches survive for the Disputa in the Stanze, and there may well have been many more originally; over four hundred sheets survive altogether. He used different drawings to refine his poses and compositions, apparently {{to a greater extent than}} most other painters, <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> number of variants that survive: [...] "... This is how Raphael himself, who was so rich in inventiveness, used to work, always coming up with four or six ways to show a narrative, each one different from the rest, and all of them full of grace and well done." [...] wrote another writer after his death. For John Shearman, Raphael's art marks [...] "a shift of resources away from production to research and development".|$|E
