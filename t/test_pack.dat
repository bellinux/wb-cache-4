40|$|BACKGROUND: Using {{accurate}} {{and easy to}} use rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) to identify group A beta-haemolytic Streptococci (GABHS) sore throat infections could reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and antimicrobial resistance. Although there is no international consensus on the use of RADTs, these kits have been widely adopted in Finland, France and the USA. Yet in the UK, the Clinical Knowledge Summaries, that provide the main online guidance for GPs, discourage RADTs use, citing their poor sensitivity and inability to impact on prescribing decisions in acute sore throat infections. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the ease of use and in vitro accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the five most commonly used RADTs in Europe (OSOM Ultra, Quickvue Dipstick, Streptatest, Clearview Exact Strep A and IMI <b>Test</b> <b>Pack).</b> METHODS: To ensure the RADTs were evaluated objectively, a standardized in vitro method using known concentrations of GABHS was used to remove the inherent biases associated with clinical studies. RESULTS: The IMI <b>Test</b> <b>Pack</b> was the easiest RADT to use overall. The ability to detect all positive GABHS (sensitivity) varied considerably between kits from 95 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 88 - 98 %], for the IMI <b>Test</b> <b>Pack</b> and OSOM, to 62 % (95 % CI: 51 - 72 %) for Clearview, at the highest GABHS concentration.

In this study, we evaluated {{the performance of}} five different grades of Kimguard One-Step sterilisation wrap after prion sterilisation cycle (134 °C for 18 minutes) using the final pack test method. Kimguard One-Step grades KC 100, KC 200, KC 300, KC 400 and KC 500 were used to wrap a 1 / 1 DIN steel wire instrument tray (internal volume of 7. 2 L) and each wrapped <b>test</b> <b>pack</b> was challenged with 100, 000 1 μm latex particles delivered at an air flow rate of 250 mL/min during a 25 -minute test period.

At both time points, particle counts within the wrapped test packs were negligible and yielded mean particle retention rates for all five grades of sterilisation wrap of ≥ 99. 99 %. From these results, we conclude that the microbial barrier effectiveness of Kimguard One-Step sterilisation wraps KC 100, KC 200, KC 300, KC 400 and KC 500 remains unaffected by prevacuum steam sterilisation at 134 °C for 18 minutes, or by subsequent storage for three months with regular movement of packs during storage...|$|E
40|$|Background: Clinical {{reasoning}} utilizing certain {{symptoms and}} scores has not {{proven to be}} a reliable decision-making tool {{to determine whether or not}} to suspect a group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection in the patient presenting with a sore throat. Culture as the so-called ‘gold standard’ is impracticable because it takes 1 to 2 days (and even longer in remote locations) for a result, and thus treatment decisions will be made without the result available. Rapid diagnostic antigen tests have demonstrated sufficient sensitivities and specificities in detecting GAS antigens to identify GAS throat infections. Methods: Throat swab samples were collected from patients attending the Mount Isa Hospital emergency department for a sore throat; these samples were compared to swab samples collected from healthy controls who did not have a sore throat. Both groups were aged 3 – 15 years. All swab samples were analyzed with a point-of-care test (Alere <b>Test</b> <b>Pack</b> +Plus with OBC Strep A). The etiologic predictive value (EPV) of the throat swab was calculated. Results: The 95 % confidence interval for positive EPV was 88 – 100 % and for negative EPV was 97 – 99 %, depending on assumptions made. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the point-of-care test Alere <b>Test</b> <b>Pack</b> +Plus Strep A has a high positive predictive value and is able to rule in GAS infection as long as the proportion of carriers is low. Also the negative predictive value for ruling out GAS as the etiologic agent is very high irrespective of the carrier rate. Hence, this test is always useful to rule out GAS infection...|$|E
