5|$|A {{meeting was}} held after <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> a {{detailed}} restoration plan was {{announced at the}} meeting along with a list for those wishing to donate to the work. The Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and the Marquess of Bute were among those who pledged donations sufficient to allow the restoration work to continue immediately. The cathedral was extensively restored, the tower rebuilt and a spire added. Much of the restoration work was completed by local architect John Prichard between 1843 and 1869. A triptych by Dante Gabriel Rossetti was designed {{for use as a}} reredos, and a new stained glass window, Shipwreck of St Paul, was designed by Ford Madox Brown. Sir Edward Burne-Jones designed the porcelain panels Six Days of Creation in St Dyfrig's Chapel.|$|E
5|$|Albert and Victoria {{chose the}} names Louisa Caroline Alberta. She was baptized on 13 May 1848 in Buckingham Palace's private chapel by John Bird Sumner, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Though she was christened Louisa at the service, she was {{invariably}} known as Louise throughout her life. Her godparents were Duke Gustav of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (her paternal great-great-uncle, for whom Prince Albert stood proxy); the Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen (for whom her great-aunt Queen Adelaide stood proxy); and the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (her first cousin once-removed, {{for whom the}} Duchess of Cambridge stood proxy). During the ceremony, the Duchess of Gloucester, {{one of the few}} children of King George III who was still alive, forgot where she was, and suddenly got {{up in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> knelt at the Queen's feet, much to the Queen's horror.|$|E

5|$|Beginning with Rag Doll Kung Fu in October 2005, {{third-party}} games {{became available}} for purchase and download on Steam, and Valve announced that Steam had become profitable because of some highly successful Valve games. Although digital distribution could not yet match retail volume, profit margins for Valve and developers were far larger on Steam. Large developer-publishers, including id Software, Eidos Interactive, and Capcom, began distributing their games on Steam in 2007.

Following the announcement, Wam stated that NSB would continue to operate <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> <b>and</b> use the Timetoget concept. An internal document the newspaper Varden received access to showed that NSB needed to calm down the heated discussions with the labor unions, and that their negativity to Timetoget was a tactical move to satisfy the labor unions. Minister of Transport, Terje Moe Gustavsen from the Labour Party, stated in a meeting with two parliamentarians from Telemark, that he would allow a new private company, without NSB ownership, to operate the line.|$|E
5|$|Further {{economic}} success {{continued through the}} 1980s, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% up until 1999. During the 1980s, Singapore began to upgrade to higher-technological industries, such as the wafer fabrication sector, in order to compete with its neighbours which now had cheaper labour. Singapore Changi Airport was opened in 1981 and Singapore Airlines was developed to become a major airline. The Port of Singapore {{became one of the}} world's busiest ports and <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> tourism industries also grew immensely during this period.

5|$|Male sovereigns {{up to and}} {{including}} George VI have traditionally worn a crimson cap of maintenance for the opening procession and when seated in the Chair of Estate during {{the first part of the}} service. Female sovereigns wear the George IV State Diadem, also worn by its namesake, George IV. For the Anointing, the sovereign is bareheaded, and remains so until the Crowning. Monarchs are usually crowned with St Edward's Crown but some have chosen to use other crowns because it weighs 2.23kg (4.9lb).

5|$|Palladio {{would often}} model his villa {{elevations}} on Roman temple facades. The temple influence, {{often in a}} cruciform design, later became a trademark of his work. Palladian villas are usually built with three floors: a rusticated basement or ground floor, containing <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> minor rooms. Above this, the piano nobile accessed through a portico reached by a flight of external steps, containing the principal reception and bedrooms, and above it is a low mezzanine floor with secondary bedrooms and accommodation. The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa.|$|E
5|$|Several game {{websites}} {{were outraged}} at Nintendo's decision.

McMillen further praised the flexibility of the Steam platform, which does not require games to obtain ESRB ratings to be published on <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> <b>and</b> the freedom it gave to the publishers regardless of the game content.|$|E
5|$|The King lent {{support to}} Fisher, {{in part because}} he disliked Beresford, and {{eventually}} Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign outside of the navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although the bulk of his policies were retained. The King was intimately involved in the appointment of Fisher's successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> <b>and</b> the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson, who had retired in 1907. Wilson was reluctant to return to active duty, but Edward persuaded him to do so, and Wilson became First Sea Lord on 25 January 1910.|$|E

5|$|This pricing {{mechanism}} {{has been}} used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> <b>and</b> whether to avoid expensive new investments just to satisfy peak demand, or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and electric utilities, metros, railways and autobus services, and has been proposed for charging internet access. It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports, waterways, airports and road pricing, though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, the disposition of the revenues raised, and the social and political acceptability of the congestion charge.|$|E
5|$|When World War II broke out, Shaw took a {{break from}} acting and joined the Royal Air Force. He was {{commissioned}} as an Acting-Pilot Officer on probation in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch on 25 April 1941 {{and over the next}} three months was promoted to Pilot Officer on probation, then Flying Officer and then Flight Lieutenant. According to his obituary in the Guardian, he saw little action in <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> was told the only chance he would have to fly would be as a rear gunner. Some of his fellow airmen hounded Shaw for autographs while others mocked his posh accent, to which he retaliated with an excellent and unflattering imitation of their less refined speech. He continued to hold a Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve commission after the war until he resigned the commission on 10 February 1954; he was permitted to retain his rank.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Gellibrand {{returned}} to Tasmania. He boarded the troopship RMS Kaiser-i-Hind in London on 4 May 1919, and reached Hobart on 30 June, {{after a long}} sea voyage, a rail trip from Fremantle to Melbourne, passage across the Bass Strait, and a week in quarantine on Bruny Island due to the 1918 flu pandemic. As Tasmania's highest-ranking war hero, he was greeted by the Governor of Tasmania, Sir Francis Newdegate. On August 1919 he accepted an offer from the Premier of Tasmania, Walter Lee, of the post of Public Service Commissioner. He investigated the conditions of <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> <b>and</b> found that public servants were agitating for a 40 per cent pay rise, as no pay rises had been granted since before the war. He {{came up with a}} plan for a temporary reclassification of positions, which would offer some relief, at a cost to the government of £12,000. This was implemented in December. On 19 July 1920, he was formally knighted by the Prince of Wales.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the council}} had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the {{decrease}} {{in the exercise of}} traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before Easter, Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On Maundy Thursday, 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was the focal point of <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.|$|E
5|$|As {{the year}} progressed, Calvin and Farel's {{reputation}} with the council began to suffer. The council {{was reluctant to}} enforce the subscription requirement, as only a few citizens had subscribed to their confession of faith. On 26 November, the two ministers hotly debated the council over the issue. Furthermore, France was taking an interest in forming an alliance with Geneva and as the two ministers were Frenchmen, councillors had begun to question their loyalty. Finally, a major ecclesiastical-political quarrel developed when the city of Bern, Geneva's ally in the reformation of the Swiss churches, proposed to introduce uniformity in the church ceremonies. One proposal required the use of unleavened bread for the Eucharist. The two ministers were unwilling to follow Bern's lead and delayed {{the use of such}} bread until a synod in Zurich could be convened to make the final decision. The council ordered Calvin and Farel to use unleavened bread for the Easter Eucharist. In protest, they refused to administer communion during the Easter service. This caused a riot during <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> the next day, the council told Farel and Calvin to leave Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{timber and}} education, Missoula's {{economic}} mainstay {{has been of}} one as a regional trade center. Missoula has an immediate trade area of approximately 180,000 residents. The Missoula is the hub of its Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Economic Area, which includes the Montana Counties of Flathead, Lake, Lincoln, Mineral, Missoula, Ravalli, and Sanders. , the BEA listed the economic area population at 306,050. Key businesses sectors serving the area include health care, retail shopping, transportation, financial services, government and social services, education, events, arts and culture. Health care in particular is one of Missoula's fastest growing industries with St. Patrick Hospital (western Montana's only LevelII Trauma center) and the Community Medical Center already the city's second and third largest employers behind the university. 55% of employment in Missoula {{is made up of}} <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>and</b> retail sectors. Export industries are concentrated in heavy and civil engineering, construction, beverage production, technical services, truck transportation, and forestry-, logging-, and wood-related industries. In addition to nearly 4million out-of-state visitors annually, which makes tourism a significant aspect of the Missoula economy, Missoula also is home to a vibrant sector of alternative healthcare.|$|E
