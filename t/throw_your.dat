This is Wale's record. It's not my record. It's one of those songs, one of those tracks and one of those videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|E
500|$|After the match, {{the final}} contest in the [...] "Redneck Triathlon" [...] was held. Originally it was {{supposed}} to be a singing contest, though both men agreed to change it into a pigpen contest, where the objective was to <b>throw</b> <b>your</b> opponent into a pigpen. Austin threw Bischoff into a pigpen set up near the Bad Blood entrance stage, thus Austin won the triathlon 2–1.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{were written}} in five minutes and are derived from U2's {{experience}} in Shinjuku. Bono has compared the lyrics to those in U2's 1991 song [...] "Tryin' to <b>Throw</b> <b>Your</b> Arms Around the World", as both depict the nightlife of a city. Lyrics were also inspired {{by the presence of}} the yakuza in Shinjuku; the group saw gang members with amputated fingers as punishment for their misbehaviour, which Bono has described as a [...] "very, very surreal" [...] experience. He has said that [...] "Slug" [...] was about avoiding harmful mistakes, stating [...] "we all play with things we shouldn't play with".|$|E

500|$|U2 biographer Bill Flanagan credits Bono's {{habit of}} keeping his lyrics [...] "in flux {{until the last}} minute" [...] with {{providing}} a narrative coherence to the album. Flanagan interpreted Achtung Baby as using the moon {{as a metaphor for}} a dark woman seducing the singer away from his virtuous love, the sun; he is tempted away from domestic life by an exciting nightlife and tests how far he can go before returning home. For Flanagan, [...] "Tryin' to <b>Throw</b> <b>Your</b> Arms Around the World" [...] on the album's latter third describes the character stumbling home in a drunken state, and the final three songs—"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)", [...] "Acrobat", and [...] "Love Is Blindness"—are about how the couple deal with the suffering they have forced on each other.|$|E
500|$|On August 18, 1997, {{four days}} before {{shooting}} on the episode began, NBC censors provided 17 pages of notes to Yoshimura requiring changes regarding violence and language. A typical Homicide: Life on the Street episode usually results in {{only three or four}} pages. Yoshimura made several modifications {{with the help of his}} writing assistant Joy Lusco, a future writer on Simon's HBO series The Wire. The changes included removing several instances of the words [...] "ass" [...] and [...] "bitch" [...] from the script. Lange's line, [...] "Why am I even saying the son of a bitch's name?" [...] was changed to [...] "Why am I even saying the twerp's name?", and his line, [...] "Go find another train and <b>throw</b> <b>your</b> miserable stupid ass in front of it" [...] was changed to [...] "throw yourself in front of it".|$|E
500|$|... "Mysterious Ways" [...] {{featured}} a belly dancer on-stage. For the 1992 indoor legs, Florida resident Christina Petro was the dancer. Tour choreographer Morleigh Steinberg assumed the role {{starting with the}} [...] "Outside Broadcast" [...] leg. [...] "One" [...] was accompanied by the title word shown in many languages, as well as Mark Pellington-directed video clips of buffalos leading to a still image of David Wojnarowicz's [...] "Falling Buffalo" [...] photograph. For [...] "Until the End of the World", Bono often played with a camera, kissing the lens and thrusting it into his crotch, a stark contrast from his more earnest stage behaviour of the past. Beginning with [...] "Outside Broadcast", the band began playing [...] "New Year's Day" [...] afterwards. During [...] "Tryin' to <b>Throw</b> <b>Your</b> Arms Around the World", Bono danced with a young female fan from the crowd (a ritual he had done more solemnly on past tours), shared camcorder video filming duties with her, and sprayed champagne. At {{this point in the}} show, Mullen sometimes sang a solo performance of [...] "Dirty Old Town".|$|E

500|$|Before the U2 360° Tour commenced, [...] "If God Will Send His Angels", [...] "Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own", and [...] "Drowning Man", a {{previously}} unplayed song from War, were rehearsed, as was [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing" [...] in the Perfecto mix style, while The Edge stated {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that [...] "Luminous Times (Hold on to Love)" [...] was also being considered. None of these were played during the first four legs of the tour. Willie Williams stated in his 27 June 2009 tour diary entry on U2.com that the band [...] "really wants [...] to work and it sounds great", {{but the rest of the}} setlist struggled due to the song's [...] "beautiful melancholy". In his 24 July 2009 entry, Williams noted that [...] "October" [...] and [...] "White as Snow" [...] were also being considered. [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] and [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] were rehearsed in an acoustic style, but performances during the tour were done by the full band. Before the third leg, [...] "Tryin' To <b>Throw</b> <b>Your</b> Arms Around the World" [...] was also rehearsed.|$|E
500|$|A few modern video gaming {{websites}} reviewed Ninja GaidenIII {{upon its}} release to the Virtual Console in 2008. Nintendo Life's Damien McFerran gave lackluster ratings, {{saying that the}} game [...] "passed under the radar of many a videogame enthusiast". He added that while the presentation was great, he pointed out flaws in the [...] "silly" [...] plot, the inconsistently laid-out level designs, and frustrating difficulty {{in addition to the}} five-continue limit. He said that many gamers would prefer the previous two Ninja Gaiden titles over this one. IGN's Lucas Thomas appreciated the improvement in Ryu's ability to scale and climb on top of walls, his ability to hang overhead, good storyline, and the new items such as the Dragon Sword power-up and the Vacuum Wave. His chief criticism was the game's difficulty, saying that it's not the [...] "rewarding kind of difficult" [...] but instead [...] "the cheap, annoying kind of difficult that makes you want to <b>throw</b> <b>your</b> controller at the TV screen and just go read a book". As with the Nintendo Life review, Thomas similarly criticized the inconsistent level design as well as a storyline which becomes progressively more bizarre, including [...] "weird science-fiction themes about bionics and clones".|$|E
500|$|Angelina's {{dream is}} to be a {{successful}} singer on the music charts. DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating {{to get out there and}} be bad. You just <b>throw</b> <b>your</b> ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E

2500|$|He lasted {{in the job}} only 44 {{days before}} he was sacked by the Leeds {{directors}} on 12 September 1974, after alienating many of Leeds's star players, notably Johnny Giles, Norman Hunter and Billy Bremner. During {{one of the first}} training sessions he took for Leeds United, he reportedly said [...] "You can all <b>throw</b> <b>your</b> medals in the bin because they were not won fairly." [...] Until Darko Milanic's winless six games in 2014, he had the unenviable record of being Leeds United's least successful permanent manager, winning only one match from six games. Leeds were fourth from bottom in 19th position with only 4 points from a possible 12, their worst start since their last relegation campaign 15 years earlier. His pay-off was estimated at £98,000, a huge amount at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Hancock's men, {{led by the}} {{division}} of Maj. Gen. David B. Birney, overwhelmed Henagan's small force, which fled across the bridge. [...] Union sharpshooters discouraged Confederate attempts to burn the bridge. Hancock's men did not cross the bridge and seize ground to the south because Confederate artillery was laying down heavy fire against them. At Jericho Mills, Warren found the river ford unprotected and established a beachhead south of the river. General Lee convinced his Third Corps commander, A.P. Hill, that Warren's movement was simply a feint, so Hill sent only a single division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox, to deal with Warren's supposedly minor threat. The Union troops were taken by surprise and their right flank was beaten back, but they were supported by three batteries of artillery, which slowed the Confederate advance until Union reinforcements arrived to end the brief battle. The next morning, Lee expressed his displeasure at Hill's performance: [...] "General Hill, why did you let those people cross here? Why didn't you <b>throw</b> <b>your</b> whole force on them and drive them back as Jackson would have done?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilcox and Pegram {{delivered}} a firm blow. Crawford's division suffered heavy {{damage from the}} artillery and Griffin's division was hit hard by the North Carolinians of Brig. Gen. James H. Lane and the South Carolinians of Brig. Gen. Samuel McGowan. Cutler's wing, just arriving in line, was hit by the Georgians of Brig. Gen. Edward L. Thomas's brigade, more South Carolinians under Col. Brown, and the North Carolinians of Brig. Gen. Alfred M. Scales's brigade (temporarily commanded by Col. William L. Lowrance). Cutler's line was broken and his men fled to the rear, but their path of retreat led to the bluffs overlooking the North Anna. Warren's V Corps was rescued from a significant defeat by his artillery, commanded by Col. Charles S. Wainwright, which placed 12 guns on a ridge and subjected the Confederates to plunging fire. At the same time, the 83rd Pennsylvania led a portion of Brig. Gen. Joseph J. Bartlett's brigade down a ravine and struck the right flank of Thomas's Brigade. The Georgians fled, uncovering Scales's flank and leaving his men in an untenable position. Seeing that reinforcements from the division of Maj. Gen. Henry Heth would not arrive in time, Wilcox ordered his men to withdraw. He had been outnumbered about 15,000 to 6,000. His division suffered 730 casualties, including Col. Brown, who was captured; Union casualties were 377. The next morning, Robert E. Lee expressed his displeasure at Hill's performance: [...] "General Hill, why did you let those people cross here? Why didn't you <b>throw</b> <b>your</b> whole force on them and drive them back as Jackson would have done?" ...|$|E
