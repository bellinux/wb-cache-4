40|$|This paper investigates how {{wearable}} {{sensing technology}} {{can be applied to}} alpine avalanche rescue. Sensors worn by mountaineers reveal information about vital functions of the victims in an emergency case. In particular the rescue of multiple victims might benefit enormously from the use of wearable sensors. As time is the most critical issue in rescue, we belief that based on those sensor information rescuers obtain the necessary information in order to focus on victims which are still alive rather than to waste valuable time to dig out victims which are already dead. Our vision is <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> rescuers <b>with</b> a <b>tool,</b> that provides awareness about urgency and chances of success of individual victims in order to achieve recovery of as many victims as possibl...|$|R

By providing examples of online publicity and marketing activities used today, this report emphasizes the opportunities that publicity and marketing provide to publishers. Online publicity is compared with offline publicity to emphasize what publishers {{need to do to}} ensure their online publicity program is a success. By accessing the literature on online publicity, this report focuses on what can make an online campaign successful for book publishers as oppose to other industries. A case study of Chronicle Book’s online campaign to publicize and market You Can Do It!

40|$|I {{have two}} {{distinct}} research directions. The first is surface modeling, particularly the representation, analysis, and manipulation of complicated, organic shapes. My research brings fundamental mathematical concepts, such as manifolds, {{stress and strain}} analysis, and shape description techniques, to bear on these problems. In addition to this strong theoretical base, I also apply my background in user interfaces in order <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> practitioners <b>with</b> practical <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> use these techniques. The second research area brings tools and techniques developed by artists to computer graphics, in particular {{in the area of}} arranging 3 D scenes on a 2 D canvas. Much of the other research in this area has focused on replicating particular artistic media on the computer. My approach is to identify artistic decision making processes and translate them into usable interfaces. Surface modeling In recent years my interests in surface modeling have turned towards problems of shape representation and comparison for bio-medical applications. The last decade has seen an explosion in 3 D imaging data, both in terms of quantity and quality. It is now relatively easy to capture, and view, 3 D volume data sets. It is not, however, so easy to ask quantitative questions such as “How do the cortical folds change during brain development? ” or “What shape should this broken bone have?”. Answering these question...|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Arquitectura Paisagista - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{existence}} of large public parks in cities {{has always been}} a fact that followed the history of the growth of various cities. Their social, cultural, ecological and economic benefits have been recognized for many centuries and over time took different forms of organization and expression within the city. The abandonment of certain sites and their condition as new open spaces in the city emerges as an opportunity to convert a space with a specific function, in a green public park that serves its surrounding population and supports the expression of urban ecological structure. The opportunity to take an area without expression and <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> it <b>with</b> essential <b>tools</b> that arises as a site for urban regeneration is a very attractive and challenging project. In the context of reusing new open spaces of large scale in the city, the possibility of the relocation of Portela’s Airport was analyzed in this paper {{in order to create a}} proposal for a green urban park. This proposal must be able to articulate the historical, cultural and social elements of the place, with the elements of the Urban Ecological Structure for the Airport’s City Park to be successfully incorporated into the dynamics of a changing city. The reality of urban growth may have stalled, but structures like airports that should be removed from the urban environment, were agglutinated by its expansion. Because of these occurrences, the conversion of airports into a green park was put into practice in several countries, with citizens and green structure benefiting from this change. The Tempelhof Freiheit Park was one of the latest examples of reappropriation of an airport in Berlin, this being the case study availed to establish points of similarity with the proposal of this work...|$|R
40|$|New high {{throughput}} experimental {{techniques have}} turned the life sciences into a data-intensive field. Scientists are faced with new types of problems, such as managing voluminous sources of information, integrating heterogeneous data, and applying the proper analysis algorithms; all {{to end up with}} reliable conclusions. These challenges call for an infrastructure of algorithms and technologies <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> researchers <b>with</b> the <b>tools</b> and methods necessary to maximize the usefulness of the data. eScience has emerged as a promising technology to take on these challenges, and denotes integrated science carried out in highly distributed network environments, or science that makes use of large data sets and requires high performance computing resources. In this thesis I present standards, exchange formats, algorithms, and software implementations for empowering researchers in the life sciences <b>with</b> the <b>tools</b> of eScience. The work is centered around Bioclipse - an extensible workbench developed in the frame of this thesis - which provides users with instruments for carrying out integrated research and where technical details are hidden under simple graphical interfaces. Bioclipse is a Rich Client that takes full advantage of the many offerings of eScience, such as networked databases and online services. The benefits of mixing local and remote software in a unifying platform are demonstrated with an integrated approach for predicting metabolic sites in chemical structures. To overcome the limitations of the commonly used technologies for interacting with networked services, I also present a new technology using the XMPP protocol. This enables service discovery and asynchronous communication between the client and server, which is ideal for long-running analyses. To maximize the usefulness of the available data {{there is a need for}} standards, ontologies, and exchange formats, in order to define what information should be captured and how it should be structured and exchanged. A novel format for exchanging QSAR data sets in a fully interoperable and reproducible form is presented, together with an implementation in Bioclipse that takes advantage of eScience components during the setup process. Bioclipse has been well received by the scientific community, attracted a large group of international users and developers, and has been awarded three international prizes for its innovative character. With continued development, the project has a good chance of becoming an important component in a sustainable infrastructure for the life sciences...|$|R
