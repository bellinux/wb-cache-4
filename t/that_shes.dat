30|$|In this work, {{pozzolanic}} {{activities of}} heat treated dredged sea soils {{from two different}} sources, SH (dredged sea soil samples from South Harbor in Busan) and JH (Jangsaengpo Harbor in Ulsan), were investigated. It was found <b>that</b> <b>SH,</b> mostly consisting of very fine sand, did not present pozzolanic activity by TG/DTA analysis. However, the 28  day compressive strength did not show significant decrease with replacement of <b>SH,</b> indicating <b>that</b> <b>SH</b> can still meet other criteria for pozzolanic material, such as strength activity index, etc. Thus, {{it should be noted}} SH can be weakly pozzolanic although it was found to be non-pozzolanic by TG/DTA analysis.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe sh 3 bgr (SH 3 domain binding glutamate-rich) gene encodes a small protein {{containing}} a thioredoxin-like fold, SH 3 binding domain, and glutamate-rich domain. Originally, {{it was suggested}} that increased expression of Sh 3 bgr may cause the cardiac phenotypes in Down's syndrome. However, it was recently reported that the overexpression of Sh 3 bgr did not cause any disease phenotypes in mice. In this study, we have discovered <b>that</b> <b>Sh</b> 3 bgr is critical for sarcomere formation in striated muscle tissues and also for heart development. Sh 3 bgr is strongly expressed in the developing somites and heart in Xenopus. Morpholino mediated-knockdown of sh 3 bgr caused severe malformation of heart tissue and disrupted segmentation of the somites. Further analysis revealed <b>that</b> <b>Sh</b> 3 bgr specifically localized to the Z-line in mature sarcomeres and <b>that</b> knockdown of <b>Sh</b> 3 bgr completely disrupted sarcomere formation in the somites. Moreover, overexpression of Sh 3 bgr resulted in abnormally discontinues thick firmaments in the somitic sarcomeres. We suggest <b>that</b> <b>Sh</b> 3 bgr does its function at least partly by regulating localization of Enah for the sarcomere formation. In addition, we provide the data supporting Sh 3 bgr is also necessary for proper heart development in part by affecting the Enah protein level...|$|R

40|$|PRRSV strain SH 1211 was {{isolated}} from the lung tissue of a piglet on a large-scale pig farm with approximately 30 % morbidity and 50 % mortality in mid-eastern China in 2012. The full-length genome of SH 1211 was 15 313 [*]nt in size, excluding the polyadenylated sequences, and shared 94. 9 % nucleotide sequence identity with the HP-PRRSV strain, JXA 1. The GP 2 and GP 5 proteins of SH 1211 shared only 91. 5 % and 85. 1 % amino acid sequence identities {{with those of the}} JXA 1, respectively. A deletion at amino acid positions 68 and 69 was identified in the GP 3 protein of SH 1211, compared with the GP 3 of Type- 2 PRRSV isolates. A phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequence of the complete genome showed <b>that</b> <b>SH</b> 1211 is the most closely related to other HP-PRRSV strains isolated in China. However, phylogenetic analysis based on the GP 2 and GP 5 proteins showed <b>that</b> <b>SH</b> 1211 is the most closely related to the QYYZ strain. A recombination analysis indicated <b>that</b> <b>SH</b> 1211 might have been generated through recombination events between the JXA 1 and QYYZ in which the GP 2 and GP 5 coding sequences were exchanged. Thus, SH 1211 is a novel PRRSV strain with significant variation. Our analysis of SH 1211 provides insight into the role of genetic variation in the antigenicity of PRRSVs in China...|$|R
40|$|Neurite {{outgrowth}} is {{an essential}} process {{for the establishment of}} the nervous system. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) binds to its receptor TrkB and regulates axonal and dendritic morphology of neurons through signal transduction and gene expression. SH 2 B 1 is a signaling adaptor protein that regulates cellular signaling in various physiological processes. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the role of SH 2 B 1 in the development of the central nervous system. In this study, we show <b>that</b> knocking down <b>SH</b> 2 B 1 reduces neurite formation of cortical neurons whereas overexpression of SH 2 B 1 b promotes the development of hippocampal neurons. We further demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>SH</b> 2 B 1 b promotes BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth and signaling using the established PC 12 cells stably expressing TrkB, SH 2 B 1 b or SH 2 B 1 b mutants. Our data indicate <b>that</b> overexpressing <b>SH</b> 2 B 1 b enhances BDNF-induced MEK-ERK 1 / 2, and PI 3 K-AKT signaling pathways. Inhibition of MEK-ERK 1 / 2 and PI 3 K-AKT pathways by specific inhibitors suggest that these two pathways are required for SH 2 B 1 b-promoted BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth. Moreover, SH 2 B 1 b enhances BDNF-stimulated phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 at serine 727. Finally, our data indicate <b>that</b> the <b>SH</b> 2 domain and tyrosine phosphorylation of SH 2 B 1 b contribute to BDNF-induced signaling pathways and neurite outgrowth. Taken together, these findings demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>SH</b> 2 B 1 b promotes BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth through enhancing pathways involved MEK-ERK 1 / 2 and PI 3 K-AKT...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Sh 2 - 188 {{is thought}} to be an ancient {{planetary}} nebula in the galactic disk. It appears to be one-sided with recent observations revealing structure behind the filamentary limb. We postulate <b>that</b> <b>Sh</b> 2 - 188 is interacting with the ISM and simulate it in terms of a “triple-wind ” model comprising of the usual “fast ” and “slow ” interacting stellar winds plus the wind due to motion through the ISM. We have run simulations at various velocities of the central star relative to the ISM and find that a high velocity of 125 kms − 1 best approximates the observed structure. We also suggest <b>that</b> <b>Sh</b> 2 - 188 is younger than previously thought and that much of the mass lost on the AGB has been swept downstream. Key words.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of sarpogrelate hydrochloride (SH), a selective serotonin 2 A receptor antagonist, on diabetic nephropathy in a type 2 diabetes mouse model. We treated db/m and db/db mice with SH (30 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Rat renal proximal tubule cells (NRK- 52 E) and mouse macrophages (Raw 264. 7) were stimulated by high glucose (30 mM glucose) or LPS (100 ng/ml) with or without SH (20 μM). We found <b>that</b> <b>SH</b> treatment increased serum adiponectin level and decreased urinary albumin, macrophage infiltration to glomeruli, and renal inflammatory and fibrosis signals, which were highly expressed in diabetic mice. Proximal tubule cells treated with high glucose (30 mM) also showed increased inflammatory and fibrosis signals. However, SH (20 μM) treatment reduced these changes. Moreover, SH treatment inhibited LPS-stimulated macrophage migration and activation. These findings suggest <b>that</b> <b>SH</b> ameliorates diabetic nephropathy not only by suppressing macrophage infiltration, but also by anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects...|$|R
40|$|There is {{evidence}} of an association between thyroid hormones (TH) alterations and mental dysfunctions related to procedural and working memory functions, but the physiological link between these domains is still under debate, also {{for the presence of}} age as a confounding factor. Thus, we investigated the TH tuning of cerebral functions in young females affected by the borderline condition of subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) and in euthyroid females of the same age. The experiment consisted in the characterization of the affective state and cognitive abilities of the subjects by means of specific neuropsychological questionnaires, and of brain activity (EEG) in resting state and during the passive viewing of emotional video-clips. We found <b>that</b> <b>SH</b> had i) increased anxiety for Physical Danger; ii) better scores for both Mental Control and no-working-memory-related functions; iii) association between anxiety for Physical Danger and fT 4 levels. Thus, in young adults, SH increases inward attention and paradoxically improves some cognitive functions. In addition, self-assessed questionnaires showed <b>that</b> <b>SH</b> had a greater susceptibility to unpleasant emotional stimulation. As for EEG data, SH compared to controls showed: i) reduction of alpha activity and of gamma left lateralization in resting state; ii) increased, and lateralized to the right, beta 2 activity during stimulations. Both results indicated <b>that</b> <b>SH</b> have higher levels of arousal and greater susceptibility to negative emotion than controls. In conclusion, our study indicates that minimal changes in TH levels produce subtle but well-defined mental changes, thus encouraging further studies for the prediction of pathology evolution...|$|R
