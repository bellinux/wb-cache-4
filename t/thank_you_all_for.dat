500|$|On 24 September 2014, the band's website was updated {{to include}} a {{countdown}} timer accompanied by text reading [...] "News...". The timer ended on 13 October with the announcement of a ten-year anniversary show at the Forum in London. A statement from the band followed: [...] "It has been 10 years {{since the inception of}} this band and we wanted to celebrate it with a bang. We want to <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> your love and support {{over the past ten years}} and we can't wait to commemorate this milestone with you guys." [...] The concert sold out in minutes; due to demand a second concert was scheduled at O2 Academy Brixton for December, which was later postponed until February 2015. With news of the postponement came an announcement of additional dates in Birmingham, Glasgow and Manchester. On 25 February, it was confirmed that the band would be third-stage headliners at the 2015 Download Festival.|$|E

2500|$|Military forces {{increasingly}} {{joined the}} opposition, and Nasheed resigned that day. His statement read: [...] "I believe if I continue as the President of the Maldives, {{the people of}} the country would suffer more. I therefore have resigned as the President of Maldives. I wish the Maldives would have a consolidated democracy. I wish for justice to be established. My wish is for the progress and prosperity of the people. And I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> your support and contributions to achieve success for the past three years." [...] He also stated his hope that his resignation might avoid international pressure on the Maldives over the unrest. Vice President Mohammed Waheed Hassan, who claims to have opposed Abdulla Mohamed's arrest, was then sworn in as the new president, and a warrant was issued for Nasheed's arrest.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{publication}} of his eighth novel White Noise in 1985, DeLillo began a rapid ascendancy to being a noted and respected novelist. White Noise was arguably a major breakthrough both commercially and artistically for DeLillo, earning him a National Book Award for Fiction and a place among the academic canon of contemporary postmodern novelists. DeLillo remained as detached as ever from his growing reputation: when called upon to give an acceptance speech for the Award, he simply said, [...] "I'm sorry I couldn't be here tonight, but I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> coming," [...] and then sat down. The influence and impact of White Noise {{can be seen in the}} writing of such authors as David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Lethem, Jonathan Franzen, Dave Eggers, Martin Amis, Zadie Smith and Richard Powers (who provides an introduction to the 25th anniversary edition of the novel). Among the 39 proposed titles for the novel were [...] "All Souls", [...] "Ultrasonic", [...] "The American Book of the Dead", [...] "Psychic Data" [...] and [...] "Mein Kampf"; however, DeLillo acknowledged in a 2005 interview that White Noise was a fine choice, remarking [...] "Once a title is affixed to a book, it becomes as indelible as a sentence or a paragraph." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yoshinori Natsume's art was {{commended for}} {{featuring}} [...] "heavy inks, lots of crosshatching, and copious amounts of shading". Mania.com's Patricia Beard {{feels that the}} manga makes a [...] "compelling read" [...] by [...] "laying out its premise and conditions by the mid-point of the first volume". Manga Life's Michael Aronson comments that the manga simply rearranges the [...] "premise of every other pop manga series. We have an anachronistic protagonist (InuYasha) who’s rather impure at heart (Death Note) hunting spirits {{that no one else}} can see (Bleach)". Ed Sizemore from Comics Worth Reading criticises the series for ending its unfinished story with volume 8. As well as [...] "putting salt in the wound" [...] by advertising for [...] "Togari: The Perfect Edition" [...] in the last four pages, with the last sentence of the ad reading: [...] "Sorry, this was all a joke! <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> reading." [...] Jason Thompson's online appendix to [...] compares Togari to InuYasha in their shared theme of [...] "a villain gradually [...] into a good guy" [...] commenting that [...] "Togari makes a stronger than usual effort to show Tobe’s gradual socialization process." [...] Thompson also comments on the art [...] "while not nearly as scary as the premise suggests, is clean and chiseled, similar to Ryōji Minagawa." [...] In a series of reviews on Manga News, the manga's graphics is commended for its [...] "pure style with panels that are not overdone", commendation on the level of precision through explanation, with discrete action and advancing the plot through the use of intrigue.|$|E

But that will not be till I am in a position when I can want nothing, for I feel now that were I dying of hunger I could not accept a crust from your hands, for if I did so I should feel I was a party to this abominable fraud.

6000|$|At twelve o'clock exactly Mr. Hardy rose to {{his feet}} 'My friends,' he said, 'I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> so {{promptly}} answering to my summons. I need say no words to excite your indignation at the massacre that has taken place here. You know, too, that my child has been carried away. I intend, with my sons and my friends from Canterbury, going in search of her into the Indian country. My first object is to secure her, my second to avenge my murdered friends. A heavy lesson, too, given the Indians in their own country, will teach them that they cannot with impunity commit their depredations upon us. Unless such a lesson is given, a life on the plains will become so dangerous that we must give up our settlements. At the same time, I do not conceal from you that the expedition is a most dangerous one. We are entering a country of which we know nothing. The Indians are extremely numerous, and are daily becoming better armed. The time we may be away is altogether vague; for if it is a year, I do not return until I have found my child. I know {{that there is not a}} man here who would not gladly help to rescue Ethel,--not one who does not long to avenge our murdered friends. At the same time, some of you have ties, wives and children, whom you may not consider yourselves justified in leaving, even upon an occasion like this. Some of you, I know, will accompany me; but if any one feels any doubts, from the reasons I have stated,--if any one considers that he has no right to run this tremendous risk,--let him say so at once, and I shall respect his feelings, and my friendship and goodwill will in no way be diminished.' ...|$|E
