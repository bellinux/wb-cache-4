5|$|In August 1814, British forces {{attacked}} Washington, D.C. {{and burned}} the White House.

After the sacking of Washington, the tide of battle turned against the British, and the Treaty of Ghent ended the war even as Johnson prepared to return to Kentucky to raise another military unit. With {{the end of the}} war, he turned his legislative attention to issues such as securing pensions for widows and orphans and funding internal improvements in the West.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Gasparo Cairano before 1489. No {{information}} has been found about the date and place of his birth, education, or <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> led him to Brescia. The appellation da Milano, with which he is often recalled in the sources, however, {{does not provide a}} definitive fact of his origin because it could refer to the city {{as well as to the}} dukedom or diocese. The generic reference, in any case, is compatible with the cultural basis of his artistic work. Some conjectures can be made on the surname Cairano, in particular that it leads one to Cairate in Varese province, which is to this day shortened to Caira in the local dialect.|$|E

Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown assuming direct control over much of the Indian subcontinent.

5|$|Benbow's next post was as Master Attendant of Chatham Dockyard. He {{then moved}} to become Master Attendant at Deptford Dockyard in early March 1690, a post he {{intermittently}} held {{for the next six}} years. He was master of HMS Sovereign in summer 1690, under his old commander Arthur Herbert, now Lord Torrington. He was assigned to act as master of the fleet, and took part in the English defeat in the Battle of Beachy Head. After the defeat, a Royal Commission was held into <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> led to it. Benbow was highly regarded as a specialist in both navigation and pilotage, and his evidence given in July 1690 to the preliminary investigation strongly favoured his old patron, Torrington. He did not however testify during Torrington's court-martial in December that year.|$|E

5|$|During the conflict, it is {{revealed}} that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi's who {{was thought to}} be dead. The real Madara saved Tobi's life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> <b>that</b> led to his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans. However, Madara's body ends up possessed by Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, an ancient princess who intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya is sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.|$|E
