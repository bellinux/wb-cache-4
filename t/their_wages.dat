5|$|Other economists {{argue that}} no matter how much Greece and Portugal drive down <b>their</b> <b>wages,</b> they could never compete with {{low-cost}} developing countries such as China or India. Instead weak European countries must shift their economies to higher quality products and services, though this is a long-term process and may not bring immediate relief.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Suzanne Bergeron, for example, raises {{examples}} {{of studies that}} illustrate the multifaceted effects of globalization on women, including Kumudhini Rosa's study of Sri Lankan, Malaysian, and Philippine, workers in free trade zones {{as an example of}} local resistance to globalization. Women there use <b>their</b> <b>wages</b> to create women's centers aimed at providing legal and medical services, libraries and cooperative housing, to local community members. Such efforts, Bergeron highlights, allow women the chance to take control of economic conditions, increase their sense of individualism, and alter the pace and direction of globalization itself.|$|E
30|$|The {{impacts of}} a typical {{recession}} vary sharply across gender/race/ethnic groups, with the biggest effect among women. Based on the estimates in Column (2), for them an increase of 4.7 percentage-points in average unemployment (which occurred in the Great Recession) increases <b>their</b> <b>wage</b> disadvantage by over 4 percentage points; among Hispanics the effect is tiny—an increase in <b>their</b> <b>wage</b> disadvantage of slightly more than 0.1 percentage points, while among African-Americans this severe a recession reduces <b>their</b> <b>wage</b> disadvantage by about 1.7 percentage points.|$|R

5|$|Due to the club's {{financial}} situation, {{the reserve}} team had <b>their</b> <b>wages</b> halved {{early on in}} the season, and by January 1886 the payments made to reserve players were withdrawn altogether, although there was a possibility of them receiving a bonus {{at the end of the}} season if funds permitted. This resulted in Albion's second team refusing to play against Small Heath Alliance and the game was cancelled. Some of the players were suspended as a result of their actions, but were later re-instated.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{thought the}} land grants given to {{expanding}} railroads was an unjust practice. He also opposed some monopolistic practices by corporations, {{as well as}} the power sought by workers' unions. Garfield supported the proposed establishment of the United States civil service as a means of ridding officials of the annoyance of aggressive office seekers. He especially wished to eliminate the common practice whereby government workers, in exchange for their positions, were forced to kick back a percentage of <b>their</b> <b>wages</b> as political contributions.|$|E

The railroad workers struck at 6:00 P.M. that same day.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} weeks before the election, the issue of Chinese {{immigration}} entered the race. Both major parties (as well as the Greenbackers) pledged in their platforms to limit immigration from China, which native-born workers in the Western states believed was depressing <b>their</b> <b>wages.</b> On October 20, however, a Democratic newspaper published a letter, purportedly from Garfield {{to a group of}} businessmen, pledging to keep immigration at the current levels so that industry could keep workers' wages low. Garfield denounced the letter as a ruse, but not before one hundred thousand copies of the newspaper were mailed to California and Oregon. Once the letter was exposed as a forgery, Garfield biographer Peskin believes it may even have gained votes for the Republican in the East, but it likely weakened him in the West.|$|E
5|$|Ryan {{voted to}} extend {{unemployment}} insurance in 2002, 2008, and 2009, but has since voted against further extensions. In 2004 and 2005, Ryan pushed the Bush administration to propose {{the privatization of}} Social Security. His proposal ultimately failed when it did not gain {{the support of the}} then-Republican presidential administration. In 2005, Ryan and Senator John Sununu of New Hampshire introduced the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act, also known as the Ryan-Sununu plan. The plan would have allowed employees to direct a portion of their Federal Insurance Contributions Act payroll tax on <b>their</b> <b>wages</b> to a private account which invested in a stock portfolio managed by the Social Security Administration. Versions of the plan were included in Ryan's later budget proposals.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Saka were {{enlisted in}} Phraates' forces against Antiochus. However, they arrived {{too late to}} engage in the conflict. When Phraates refused to pay <b>their</b> <b>wages,</b> the Saka revolted, which he tried to put down with the aid of former Seleucid soldiers, yet they too {{abandoned}} Phraates and joined sides with the Saka. Phraates II marched against this combined force, but he was killed in battle. The Roman historian Justin reports that his successor Artabanus I of Parthia (r. c.128–124BC) shared a similar fate fighting nomads in the east. He claims Artabanus was killed by the Tokhari (identified as the Yuezhi), although Bivar believes Justin conflated them with the Saka. Mithridates II of Parthia (r. c.124–90BC) later recovered the lands lost to the Saka in Sistan.|$|E

40|$|We {{exploit the}} {{regional}} variation in negative attitudes towards immigrants to Sweden {{in order to}} analyse {{what are the consequences}} of such attitudes have on immigrants welfare. A well educated immigrant from a non developed country who lives in a municipality with strong negative attitudes earns less than what she would earn if she lived in a municipality where natives are more positive. If attitudes changed from the average level to the most positive level, her wage would increase by 12 %. This would reduce the wage gap to well-educated immigrants from developed countries by 70 %. We interpret this eect as evidence of labour market discrimination. The same reduction in negative attitudes would increase the welfare of immigrants from Africa and Asia, through <b>their</b> <b>wage</b> and local amenities, by an equivalent to one third of <b>their</b> <b>wage.</b> The analogous amount for immigrants from South America and Eastern Europe is one fourth of <b>their</b> <b>wage</b> if they are well educated and one tenth otherwise. na...|$|R
5|$|The pay dispute {{split the}} unit. About two thirds went on strike, {{saying they would}} not return to action unless the Army upped <b>their</b> <b>wages</b> and paid them in foreign currency. Meanwhile, {{some of the more}} {{contented}} Frenchmen made steps to remain permanently, buying cars and having their wives join them in Salisbury. The Army detained the strike's ringleaders for insubordination. With neither side willing to budge—the Army refused to give the strikers extra pay or special treatment, saying this would contravene Rhodesia's policy not to engage mercenaries—the disaffected men were repatriated to France at their own request. The Rhodesian Army considered disbanding the unit altogether, but persevered when Major de l'Assomption convinced his superiors that his remaining men were still loyal and eager to continue serving.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, a brief boom in textile {{manufacture}} {{was followed}} by periods of chronic economic depression, particularly among textile weavers and spinners (the textile trade was concentrated in Lancashire). Weavers who could have expected to earn 15shillings for a six-day week in 1803, saw <b>their</b> <b>wages</b> cut to 5shillings or even 4s6d by 1818. The industrialists, who were cutting wages without offering relief, blamed market forces generated by the aftershocks of the Napoleonic Wars. Exacerbating matters were the Corn Laws, the first of which was passed in 1815, imposing a tariff on foreign grain in an effort to protect English grain producers. The cost of food rose as people were forced to buy the more expensive and lower quality British grain, and periods of famine and chronic unemployment ensued, increasing the desire for political reform both in Lancashire and in the country at large.|$|E
5|$|Although the Convertibility {{plan had}} {{positive}} consequences {{in the short}} term, it caused problems that surfaced later. Large numbers of employees of privatized state enterprises were fired, and unemployment grew to over 10%. Big compensation payments prevented an immediate public reaction. The free trade, and the expensive costs in dollars, forced private companies {{to reduce the number}} of workers as well, or risk bankruptcy. Unions were unable to resist the changes. People with low incomes, such as retirees and state workers, suffered under tax increases while <b>their</b> <b>wages</b> remained frozen. The provinces of Santiago del Estero, Jujuy and San Juan had their first violent riots. To compensate for these problems, the government started a number of social welfare programs, and restored protectionist policies over some sectors of the economy. It was difficult for Argentine companies to export, and easy imports damaged most national producers. The national budget soon slid into deficit.|$|E
50|$|Tournament {{theory is}} an {{efficient}} way of labour compensation when quantifying output is difficult or expensive, but ranking workers is easy. It is also effective as it provides goals for workers and incentivises hard work {{so that they}} may one day attain one of the coveted positions at the top. An advantage to workers over a piece rate would be that {{in the event of a}} natural disaster they would preserve <b>their</b> <b>wage</b> as <b>their</b> output would go down in absolute terms but stay the same relative to their colleagues. This means that in times of disaster workers could maintain <b>their</b> <b>wage.</b>|$|R

5|$|Breckinridge rode into Abbeville, South Carolina on {{the morning}} of April 28. While there, Breckinridge and Brigadier General Basil W. Duke finally {{convinced}} Davis that further prosecution of the war was hopeless. Breckinridge was put in charge of the $150,000 in gold specie remaining in the Confederate treasury; traveling southward by rail toward Washington, Georgia, a group of soldiers in his military escort – unpaid for months – threatened to divide the gold among themselves before it could be captured by federal troops. Breckinridge convinced them to abandon their scheme after paying them <b>their</b> <b>wages</b> from the treasury, but some of them refused to escort Breckinridge and the bullion any further. Breckinridge's party arrived in Washington on May 4 and, after paying out several requisitions from the treasury, deposited the rest in banks there. He also composed a letter to his remaining deputies in which he disbanded the War Department.|$|E
5|$|By 1989, {{the airline}} had 156 {{employees}} and 150,000 annual passengers. On 9 February 1989, Norsk Air's board {{decided to start}} the termination process if a sale was not made. The employees agreed to cut <b>their</b> <b>wages</b> 10 percent and not take sick days during the sales process. One of the main difficulties in the sales process was that Widerøe {{could not afford to}} purchase Norsk Air's hangar at the airport. Widerøe intended to continue operations at both Torp and Geiteryggen for a year to see where to establish its base. In fear that the airline would move to Skien, the municipalities of Sandefjord and Stokke, who owned the majority of the airport, agreed to purchase the hangar, which had been built for NOK20 million in 1987, for NOK11.5 million. Half the hangar would be rented to Widerøe for NOK500,000 per year. This was insufficient to cover the NOK1.2 million in annual interest costs.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, {{the salary}} for patrolmen {{was set at}} $1,400 a year. Police {{officers}} had to buy their own uniforms and equipment which cost over $200. New recruits received $730 during their first year, which increased annually to $821.25 and $1000, and to $1,400 after six years. In the years following World War I, inflation dramatically eroded {{the value of a}} police officer's salary. From 1913 to May 1919, the cost of living rose by 76%, while police wages rose just 18%. Discontent and restiveness among the Boston police force grew as they compared <b>their</b> <b>wages</b> and found they were earning less than an unskilled steelworker, half as much as a carpenter or mechanic and 50 cents a day less than a streetcar conductor.

5|$|Walmer Castle {{was left}} to decline in the early 17th century, with little money being made {{available}} for repairs and the garrison receiving low pay, leading some members to reside in nearby Deal rather the fort itself, and to take on additional employment to supplement <b>their</b> <b>wages.</b> Walmer Castle was seized by Parliamentary forces {{at the start of}} the first English Civil War between the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament, but did not play a significant role in the remainder of the initial conflict. After the few years of unsteady peace after 1645, the Second Civil War broke out in 1648, this time with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by Scottish allies. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by Walmer and the other Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was under way across Kent.|$|E

After a third-place finish in the 2008–09 season, the Panthers mounted a title challenge during 2009–10, remaining in contention for the championship until the final stages of the season. They eventually finished third for a third successive season. The Panthers also won the Challenge Cup {{for the second time in}} three seasons, defeating the Cardiff Devils 8–7 on aggregate in the final. The 2010–11 season started strongly, but the Panthers suffered a poor mid season run which scuppered their chances of winning the regular season title and led to players being fined a proportion of <b>their</b> <b>wages.</b> The team were able to rebound from this, first securing a 4–3 aggregate victory over the Belfast Giants to successfully defend the Challenge Cup, then securing their third playoff championship with a 5–4 win over the Cardiff Devils. The Panthers repeated the double in the 2011–12 season first winning a third straight Challenge Cup with a 10–4 aggregate victory over Belfast. In the playoffs, the Panthers defeated Braehead and Hull in the playoffs before winning 2–0 against Cardiff in the final.
