5|$|After {{emerging}} from a manhole in <b>the</b> <b>showers</b> of the guard living quarters, Riddick uses a guard uniform to blend in {{as he makes his}} way to the space port and his chance at escape.

5|$|The main centre for {{administration}} {{was at the}} entrance to the prison, which included the warden's office. The office contained a desk with radio and telegraph equipment, typewriter, and a telephone. The administrative office section also had the offices of the associate warden and secretary, mail desk, captain's desk, a business office, a clerk's office, an accounting office, a control room which was added with modern technology in 1961, the officer's lounge, armory and vault, and a visitation centre and restrooms.

Hassett shared partnerships in excess of 150 with both Bradman and Harvey. Harvey's century took only 90 minutes and Loxton hit 67 in 75 minutes on the second day.

5|$|Poole's Guildhall {{has played}} a varied part {{in the history of}} the town. A Grade II* listed {{building}}, the Guildhall was built in 1761 at a cost of £2,250. The new building included an open market house on the ground floor and a courtroom and offices for the town council on the first floor and has also been used as a Court of Record, Magistrates' Court, Court of Admiralty and a venue for Quarter Sessions. Between 1819 and 1821 the building was consecrated as a Parish Church while the old St. James Church was pulled down and replaced with the present church. During the Second World War the building was used as a canteen and meeting room for American soldiers prior to the invasion of France. <b>The</b> <b>showers</b> and washing facilities installed at this time were later converted into public baths which were used until the 1960s. The building was converted for use as the town museum between 1971 and 1991 but stood empty for the next 16 years. After a renovation project funded by Poole Borough Council, the restored Guildhall opened in June 2007 as a Register Office for weddings, civil partnerships and other civic ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|Six months later, Alice {{travels to}} Alaska in an airplane, {{tracking}} broadcasts {{from a safe}} haven called Arcadia; however, she only finds abandoned planes, and is attacked by feral Claire Redfield (Ali Larter). Alice destroys a spider-like device on Claire's chest, giving her amnesia and pacifying her. They travel to the ruins of Los Angeles, where they find survivors living in a prison which is surrounded by thousands of undead. They meet Luther West, (Boris Kodjoe) who leads the surviving band from the prison, Wendell (Fulvio Cecere), Crystal Waters (Kacey Clarke), Bennett (Kim Coates), Kim Yong (Norman Yeung), and Angel Ortiz (Sergio Peris-Mencheta). With their help, Alice finally lands on the prison's roof and learns Arcadia isn't a fixed place, but a cargo tanker traveling along the coast. However, though the ship hasn't moved, no-one from it has responded to the group's rescue flares. Luther takes Alice to the last inmate, Chris (Wentworth Miller), who insists he's falsely imprisoned, and will reveal an escape route for freedom. Alice goes to <b>the</b> <b>showers</b> to wash up, but catches Wendell attempting to peep. Holding him at gunpoint, they are attacked {{by a group of}} infected that dug into the prison.

25|$|Although the {{air quality}} was set to improve {{with the arrival of}} the Northeast monsoon rains in mid-October, southeasterly winds {{extended}} the hazy season. A mild El Niño effect delayed the starting of <b>the</b> <b>showers</b> to late October or early November, or even until the end of November. The prolonged haze could be attributed to the extended dry season, which put the rains on hold and affected wind patterns which brought the haze to Singapore. Intermittent showers could occur in the pre-monsoon period, but these would do little in increasing air quality. The unpredictable winds in the pre-monsoon period could bring haze from either Sumatra or Kalimantan.|$|E
25|$|Rain ravaged {{the match}} between Somerset and Lancashire {{allowing}} little {{play on the}} first three days. Between <b>the</b> <b>showers,</b> Lancashire had Somerset at 48 for 2 on the first day, but the little play that was possible after that gave Mike Burns (87) and Sanath Jayasuriya (72 not out after three days) opportunity to increase the score to 195 for 3 on day 3. A draw looked more than likely, even if the sides would agree to forfeiting an innings. The fourth day was {{a full day of}} cricket, and Muttiah Muralitharan took five for 56 for Lancashire as they bowled Somerset out for 294. Iain Sutcliffe then lifted Lancashire to four batting points and 351 for 3 declared with his 150, well helped by an unbeaten century from Australian Brad Hodge.|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} of the bathhouse between the four {{buildings}} is the central courtyard. Now open space, the courtyard was initially used for dressing rooms, built with numerous cabana-shaped lockers, along with shower facilities. The western courtyard was for women, while the eastern court was for men. There were 500 changing rooms, containing 8,100 individual lockers. Of these, 5,400 lockers were located in the men's section, while the women's quarters held 2,700. The capacity was later increased to 10,000 during the 1936-1937 expansion, with 6,000 men's lockers and 4,000 women's lockers. The changing rooms were constructed of asbestos board, while <b>the</b> <b>showers</b> were tile with stone trim.
