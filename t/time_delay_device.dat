Up to date, bandwidth of the <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> <b>device</b> is limited to 45 MHz bandwidth. To solve this problem, we propose the new time delay techniques up to 100 MHz bandwidth without data loss. Proposed techniques are the low speed down scaling and high speed up scaling methods to read and write the external memory, and the matrix structure design of FPGA memory to treat data as high speed rate. We developed the satellite link simulator in 100 MHz bandwidth using the proposed new time delay techniques, implemented to the transponder simulator and verified the function of 265 ms <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> <b>device</b> in 100 MH...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An optical true <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> <b>device</b> is {{demonstrated}} that {{is capable of}} supporting 112 antennas with 81 different delays (6 bits) in a volume 16 5 4 including the box with electronics. It uses a free-space design based on the White cell, and alignment is made simple, fast, and robust by the use of slow-tool diamond turning of many optics on a single substrate. Pointing accuracy of the 12 objective mirrors is better than 10 rad, and surface roughness is 45 nm RMS. Delays vary from 0 to 25 ns in 312. 5 ps increments. Short delays are implemented using delay rods of high refractive index, and long delays using folded mirror trains. Total insertion loss from fiber to detector was 7. 82 dB for the no-delay path, and 10. 22 dB for the longest lens train. A three-state tip-style MEMS micromirror array is used to select among the delays, with tilt angles 1 4 plus flat, and switching time 100 s for the entire array. An InP wideband optical combiner photodetector array converts the optical signal to RF with 20 GHz bandwidth. The unit survived temperature cycling 0 to 50 C and random vibration on three axes (9. 84 g RMS) with no degradation of signal.

In this study, we investigated the use of fluorine doped plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition grown silicon oxide thin film as a low dielectric con-stant intermetal dielectric material. We evaluated C,F 6 and an organometallic liquid source triethoxyfluorosilane as the F dopant. It was found that the dielectric constant generally decreased as the F concentration increased. However, we also found that above a certain F concentration, the F-doped oxide film would become unstable and absorb moisture from the ambient. At similar F concentrations, the films deposited with the liquid source are always more stable than those deposited with C 2 F 6. This, in addition to the different stress vs. low frequency radio frequency power behavior between the two types of film, suggests that the already present Si-F bond in the liquid precursor results in a denser and more sta-ble film compared to the C,F 6 doped film where interstitial F may be present...|$|R
40|$|Modern x-ray {{sources and}} {{analysis}} {{techniques such as}} lens less imaging combined with phase retrieval algorithms allow for resolving structure sizes in the nanometerrange. For this purpose optics have to be employed, ensuring small focal spot dimensions simultaneously with high photon densities. Furthermore, the wave front behind the optics is required to be smooth enabling for high-resolution imaging. Combining all these properties, x-ray waveguides are well suited to perform this task, since the intensity distribution behind the guide is restricted in two dimensions serving as a secondary quasi point-source without wave-front aberrations, showing also a high divergence, suitable for resolving fine features. Importantly, the radiation provided by the waveguide reveals {{a high degree of}} coherence, required by many imaging techniques. The waveguide itself consists of an air-filled channel embedded in a solid matrix; typical materials are silicon, germanium or quartz. While the entrance area is nano-sized, the channel length is in the millimeter-range, this way posing challenges to fabricate high aspect ratio geometries. Since the functioning of x-ray waveguides is based on the total reflection at small incident angles, the surface roughness of the channel walls must be as low as possible to avoid scattering and hence loss of intensity. To fulfill these demanding conditions, a process scheme involving spin-coating, electron beam lithography, wet development, reactive ion etching and wafer bonding is optimizedwithin thiswork. To gain deeper insights into the principle of waveguiding finite difference simulations are performed, also opening access for advanced design considerations such as gratings, tapered and curved channels, or beamsplitters, enabling for constructing novel x-ray tool as for example <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> <b>devices</b> or interferometers. Waveguides in all geometries are tested at synchrotron sources, accomplishing new benchmarks in x-ray optical performance. Here, the x-ray beam leaving the channel, propagates out to a pixel array detector in the far-field region. From the recorded data the intensity distribution in the near-field directly behind the waveguide is reconstructed, revealing an outstanding agreement with the simulations and electron micrographs. Since the radiation field of the waveguide is well-characterized and also tunable to meet the requirements of both the measurement setup and the sample, they are suited of a broad field of applications in coherent x-ray imaging...|$|R
