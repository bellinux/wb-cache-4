5|$|Capture the Flag. <b>This</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> {{game play}} {{is by far}} the most popular among Warhawk players.

You can only capture the flag if your flag remains at the base.|$|E
5|$|In {{figure at}} left, the various {{segments}} {{that form the}} epitope {{have been shown to}} be continuously collinear, meaning that they have been shown as sequential; however, for the situation being discussed here (i.e., the antigen recognition by the B cell), this explanation is too simplistic. Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence (line). <b>This</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> recognition is possible only when the peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E

The grantees have assumed that they were authorized to take forcible possession of the two reservations, or of the four, as the case would have been under the first treaty. The plaintiff in this case was expelled by force; and unless <b>this</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> removal can be sustained, the recovery against the defendants for the trespass was right, and must be affirmed.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} led to {{accidents}} with the CFM56-3C engine was the failure of fan blades. <b>This</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> failure led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.|$|E

5|$|Meditation is an {{integral}} part of the rosary. <b>This</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> meditation is the process of reflecting on the mysteries of the rosary. With practice, this may in time turn into contemplation on the mysteries. The practice of meditation during the praying of repeated Hail Marys dates back to 15th century Carthusian monks, and was soon adopted by the Dominicans at large. By the 16th century the practice of meditation during the rosary had spread across Europe, and the book Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine (i.e. Meditations on the Rosary of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for the rosary confraternity of Milan provided an individual meditation to accompany each bead or prayer.|$|E
5|$|Trollope refused. Hugo's {{novel was}} {{published}} in The Gentleman's Magazine, beginning in May 1869. However, {{by the end of}} June, the sale of Once A Week to a new publisher was in progress. Rather than serialising The Vicar in the magazine, Bradbury and Evans issued it in eleven monthly shilling numbers, running from July 1869 to May 1870. Trollope could not object to <b>this</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> independent publication; but it was one that had fallen out of favour with the public, and Trollope suffered a loss of reputation and readership as a result. He also suffered a pecuniary loss of £300, agreeing for reasons unspecified to accept only £2500 for the novel.|$|E

5|$|As an {{adaptation}} for navigating its complex reef environment, the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing {{off of the}} substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait {{is similar to that}} of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the epaulette shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs. <b>This</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools. The gait of the epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. Epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.|$|E

25|$|Animal ambush predators usually remain {{motionless}} (sometimes hidden) {{and wait}} for prey to come within ambush distance before pouncing. Ambush predators are often camouflaged, and may be solitary animals. <b>This</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> predation may be less risky for the predator because lying-in-wait reduces exposure to its own predators.|$|E
25|$|Biological {{transmission}} {{requires a}} period of incubation of the trypanosomes within the tsetse host. The term 'biological' is used because trypanosomes must reproduce through several generations inside the tsetse host {{during the period of}} incubation, which requires extreme adaptation of the trypanosomes to their tsetse host. In <b>this</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> transmission, trypanosomes reproduce through several generations, changing in morphology at certain periods. <b>This</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> transmission also includes the sexual phase of the trypanosomes. Tsetse are believed to be more likely to become infected by trypanosomes during their first few blood meals. Tsetse infected by trypanosomes are thought to remain infected for the remainder of their lives. Because of the adaptations required for biological transmission, trypanosomes transmitted biologically by tsetse cannot be transmitted in this manner by other insects.|$|E
