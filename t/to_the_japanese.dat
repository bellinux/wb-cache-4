5|$|One of the castle's most {{important}} defensive elements is the confusing maze of paths {{leading to the}} castle's keep. The gates, baileys, and outer walls of the complex are organized so as to confuse an approaching force, causing it to travel in a spiral pattern around the complex {{on its way to}} the keep. The castle complex originally contained 84 gates, 15 of which were named according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> syllabary (I, Ro, Ha, Ni, Ho, He, To, etc.). At present, 21 gates from the castle complex remain intact, 13 of which are named according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> syllabary.|$|E

5|$|After {{consultation}} with the Australian armed forces, General MacArthur, the Admiralty, and the Australian Government, an official protest was sent. This was received by the Japanese Government on 29 May 1943. At around the same time, the International Committee of the Red Cross sent a protest {{on behalf of the}} major Allied Red Cross organisations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> Red Cross.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> {{attacks on}} <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> oil supply, <b>the</b> 380th was heavily engaged in crippling their shipping fleet <b>to</b> reduce <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> capability of supplying their far-flung forces. Numerous Japanese airfields were also heavily bombed in <b>the</b> East Indies <b>to</b> reduce <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> threat <b>to</b> Australia and New Guinea forces.|$|R
25|$|Hoad {{was sent}} by Chief of the General Staff, Edward Hutton, to Manchuria on {{attachment}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Imperial <b>Japanese</b> Army. Along with other Western military attachés, Hoad had two complementary missions: <b>to</b> assist <b>the</b> <b>Japanese,</b> and; <b>to</b> observe <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> forces in <b>the</b> field during the Russo-Japanese War. For this service, he received <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> Order of <b>the</b> Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon, which represents the third highest of eight classes associated with this award. His participation in the war was also recognised with a presentation of <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> War Medal.|$|R
50|$|Ko decided <b>to</b> attack <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> at Geumsan <b>to</b> {{prevent them}} from invading Cholla.

5|$|Asashōryū {{returned}} to Mongolia after the May tournament to receive {{treatment for a}} bruised chest suffered in his defeat to Harumafuji. In June he received the Hero of Labour Award from outgoing Mongolian President Nambaryn Enkhbayar, the highest government award in Mongolia and equivalent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> People's Honour Award. He performed poorly in the July tournament with a 10–5 record, his worst finish in just over two years.|$|E
5|$|Before the British {{surrendered}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> on 15 February 1942, {{they destroyed}} all remaining coastal artillery {{to prevent any}} possible usage by the invading Japanese forces. This {{is known as a}} scorched-earth policy.|$|E
5|$|By March 1942, the Japanese {{invasion}} of the Philippines had compelled MacArthur to withdraw his forces on Luzon to Bataan, while his headquarters and {{his family moved to}} Corregidor. The doomed defense of Bataan captured the imagination of the American public. At a time when the news from all fronts was uniformly bad, MacArthur became a living symbol of Allied resistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{a strong}} grasp of logograms is needed <b>to</b> study <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{language}} (whose writing system includes kanji, or modified Chinese characters), only {{students who have}} previously taken the Chinese language as a PSLE subject are allowed <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> language course, with exceptions.|$|R

5|$|Chavez praised Del Rey's {{translation}} for {{retaining the}} manga's original identity; the header, bumper artwork, character biographies, and front covers {{are all but}} identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese.</b> Eries also thanked Del Rey's translation notes for clearing up some misconceptions for her, although she later concluded that their quality has deteriorated as the series progresses.|$|E
5|$|Collecting centres {{for native}} {{foodstuffs}} and tracks {{leading from the}} coast were bombed by the US Fifth Air Force. This reduced food stocks available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese,</b> and also drove away the native carriers that the Japanese depended on to carry their supplies up from the coast.|$|E
5|$|Dual Destinies {{was given}} a digital-only release in the West. This was {{partially}} because of the game's tight development schedule: by releasing it digitally, Capcom was able to release the English version close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> release date. Although Ace Attorney Investigations 2 has not been officially localized, it has received a full fan translation.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately the DRAM {{marketplace}} was <b>the</b> beachhead where <b>Japanese</b> firms {{would make}} their successful {{assault on the}} global semiconductor market. Mostek was unable <b>to</b> match <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> extremely aggressive pricing, and succumbed during a particularly brutal price war when Korean firms (including Samsung, now the worlds' largest electronics conglomerate) tried <b>to</b> beat <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> at their own game. Micron Technology (one of several Mostek spinoffs) would later bring suit <b>to</b> prove <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> memory manufacturers guilty of price dumping, but the ruling would {{be too late to}} save Mostek.|$|R

5|$|Konami kept Raiden's {{starring}} role in Metal Gear Solid 2 secret until the game's North American release, {{going so far as}} to replace Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials. Although Raiden appeared in several preview trailers in his scuba gear, his presence was not emphasized. Raiden's appearance in the game was announced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> press on the day of the game's release in North America.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 2008, the High Court {{handed down}} its ruling on Odex's appeal. It held that Pacific Internet had {{to release the}} names of the alleged illegal downloaders {{directly}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> anime studios. In the light of this decision, Peter Go said that the company's role would shift from active enforcement to assisting the studios in their possible courses of action.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> attempt <b>to</b> flank <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> failed. <b>The</b> troops never {{encountered}} a single Japanese troop on their trek and were unable due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> terrain <b>to</b> offer any support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Australians on the Kokoda Track. The Australians were by then preparing <b>to</b> attack <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> who had retreated all <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fortified Buna coast.|$|R
5|$|On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) {{landed on}} Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The {{objective}} was to deny the islands <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and secure starting points for a campaign to isolate the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign. The Guadalcanal campaign would last six months.|$|E

50|$|Admiral Yi wanted <b>to</b> fight <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> in <b>the</b> sea {{where there}} was more room to maneuver. Hoping <b>to</b> draw <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> into open waters, he turned his battleships around and withdrew. Apparently, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{commander}} had been observing the Korean movements and quickly ordered his captains to take {{a portion of the}} fleet anchored at Sacheon and attack the Koreans when he saw them withdraw.

5|$|Seeking a model {{agricultural}} college, Mori Arinori, the Japanese Minister to the United States, asked Horace Capron, Commissioner of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, for a recommendation.

5|$|Some {{authors have}} stated that heavy losses in {{carriers}} and veteran aircrews at Midway permanently weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy. Parshall and Tully {{have stated that}} the heavy losses in veteran aircrew (110, just under 25% of the aircrew embarked on the four carriers) were not crippling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> naval air corps as a whole; the Japanese navy had 2,000 carrier-qualified aircrew {{at the start of}} the Pacific war. The loss of four large fleet carriers and over 40% of the carriers' highly trained aircraft mechanics and technicians, plus the essential flight-deck crews and armorers, and the loss of organizational knowledge embodied in such highly trained crews, were still heavy blows <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> carrier fleet. A few months after Midway, the JNAF sustained similar casualty rates in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, and it was these battles, combined with the constant attrition of veterans during the Solomons campaign, which were the catalyst for the sharp downward spiral in operational capability.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Truk was {{considered}} successful for the Allied force, with the ships and air units gaining useful experience while suffering two fatalities {{and the loss}} of seven aircraft to combat and accidents.
