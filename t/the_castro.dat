5|$|During the Punic Wars, the Romans {{became aware}} of <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> region's rich {{deposits}} of gold and tin. Viriathus, leading Lusitanian troops, hindered {{the expansion of the}} Roman Republic north of the river Douro. His murder in 138 BC opened the way for the Roman legions. Over the following two years, Decimus Junius Brutus advanced into <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> region from south of the Douro, crushed <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> armies, and left Cividade de Terroso, in ruins.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} older {{citizens}} of the Most Holy Redeemer Parish and the gays entering <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> District were growing, however, and in 1973, when two gay men tried to open an antique shop, the Eureka Valley Merchants Association (EVMA) attempted {{to prevent them from}} receiving a business license. Milk and a few other gay business owners founded <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> Village Association, with Milk as the president. He often repeated his philosophy that gays should buy from gay businesses. Milk organized <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> Street Fair in 1974 to attract more customers to the area. More than 5,000 attended, and some of the EVMA members were stunned; they did more business at <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> Street Fair than on any previous day.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>castros</b> (fortified settlements) {{nowadays}} constitute one of {{the most}} visible elements of the Asturian landscape, the typical habitat in Asturias between the end of the Bronze Age and Roman settlement, i.e., during the Iron Age. <b>The</b> <b>castros</b> had an autonomous nature, with the defenses being the most outstanding boundary element, emblematic of these communities that appeared to be quite dissociated and divided into clans.|$|R

2500|$|Some {{critics say}} that the embargo {{actually}} helps the regime more than it hurts it, by providing it with a bogeyman for all of Cuba's misfortunes. Hillary Clinton publicly shared {{the view that the}} embargo helps <b>the</b> <b>Castros,</b> noting that [...] "It is my personal belief that <b>the</b> <b>Castros</b> {{do not want to see}} an end to the embargo and do no want to see normalization with the United States." [...] Clinton said in the same interview that [...] "we're open to changing with them." ...|$|R
5|$|In San Francisco, {{particularly}} in <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> District, gay community activists such as Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones {{found a new}} direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to gay men to avoid getting sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to <b>the</b> <b>Castro,</b> and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years. Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who would rather not deal with a disease that affected gay men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the gay men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.|$|E
5|$|In a final {{flashback}} scene, Guevara is {{aboard the}} Granma in 1956, {{looking out over}} the ocean, as the Cuban Revolution is about to begin. He sees <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> brothers alone at the bow of the ship; Fidel is talking and Raúl is taking notes. Guevara hands a peeled orange to one of his comrades and returns his gaze to the lone brothers before the scene fades to black.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of that year, the German anarchist Augustin Souchy was invited by <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> {{government}} to survey the agrarian sector. He was not impressed with what he found, and declared in his pamphlet Testimonios sobre la Revolución Cubana that the system {{was too close to}} the Soviet model. Three days after Souchy departed Cuba, the entire print run was seized by the government, and destroyed. However, an Argentinian anarchist publisher republished the pamphlet the following December. Around the same time, the ALC, alarmed at the movement of <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> government towards a Marxist–Leninist form of rule, issued a declaration, under the name Grupo de Sindicalistas Libertarios to prevent reaction against the ALC's membership. The document declared opposition to the centralism, authoritarian tendencies, and militarism of the new government. After a denunciation of the document by the Secretary General of the Partido Comunista Cubano (PCC), anarchists failed in their search for a printer who would publish a reaction to the denunciation. The publication El Libertario published its last edition that summer.|$|E

5000|$|Celtic {{presence}} in Iberia likely dates to {{as early as}} the 6th century BC, when <b>the</b> <b>castros</b> evinced a new permanence with stone walls and protective ditches.

5|$|Although {{he was a}} {{newcomer}} to <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting {{to be taken seriously}} as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered his approach and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E
5|$|Campbell {{moved from}} Seattle to San Francisco in 1975, {{getting a job}} in a {{hospital}} near <b>The</b> <b>Castro</b> and immersing himself in the political and social life of the community, which had become a center for the LGBT community over the previous few years. By 1981, he had enrolled in a training program at University of California, San Francisco, to become an adult health nurse practitioner, with a view to focusing on healthcare in the gay and lesbian community.|$|E

5|$|For preview screenings, {{the series}} was edited to an 83-minute feature film. The global premiere of the film version was on June 23, 2005, at <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> Theatre in San Francisco, for the 29th Frameline Film Festival.

After the screening, the audience greeted director Jeremy Simmons and producer Thairin Smothers with a standing ovation. A second standing ovation followed as Gabbie, T.J., Lucas, and Raci walked to the stage.|$|E
5|$|Later that evening, several police cruisers {{filled with}} {{officers}} wearing riot gear {{arrived at the}} Elephant Walk Bar on Castro Street. Harvey Milk's protégé Cleve Jones and {{a reporter for the}} San Francisco Chronicle, Warren Hinckle, watched as officers stormed into the bar and began to beat patrons at random. After a 15-minute melee, they left the bar and struck out at people walking along the street. The chief of police finally ordered the officers out of the neighborhood. By morning, 61 police officers and 100 rioters and gay residents of <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> had been hospitalized. City Hall, police cruisers, and the Elephant Walk Bar suffered damages in excess of $1,000,000.|$|E
5|$|Milk {{moved from}} New York City to San Francisco in 1972 amid a {{migration}} {{of gay and}} bisexual men to <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> District.

His theatrical campaigns earned him increasing popularity, and Milk won a seat as a city supervisor in 1977, his election made possible by, and a key component of, a shift in San Francisco politics.|$|E

5|$|The Arévalo {{government}} also floated {{the idea of}} a Central American Federation, as being the only way that a democratic government could survive in the region. He approached several leaders of democratic Central American countries, but was rejected by all except Castañeda Castro, the president of El Salvador. The two leaders began talks to build a union, and set up several commissions to look into the issue. In late 1945 they announced the formation of the union, but the formalization of the process got delayed by internal troubles in both countries, and in 1948 <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> government was toppled in a military coup led by Óscar Osorio.|$|E
5|$|The gay {{community}} of San Francisco had a longstanding {{conflict with the}} San Francisco Police Department. White's status as a former police officer intensified the community's anger at the SFPD. Initial demonstrations took place as a peaceful march through <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> district of San Francisco. After the crowd arrived at the San Francisco City Hall, violence began. The events caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars' worth of property damage to City Hall and the surrounding area, as well as injuries to police officers and rioters.|$|E

5|$|With the 1979 {{municipal}} elections occurring only {{months after the}} riot, prominent gay leaders feared a backlash at the polls. The elections continued without incident, and the gay community fared better than expected, wielding unprecedented influence. Although the virtually unknown gay Mayoral candidate David Scott {{finished third in the}} election, his showing was strong enough to force Mayor Feinstein into a runoff election against conservative City Supervisor Quentin Kopp. Feinstein's promises to appoint more gay people to public office, and her heavy campaigning in <b>the</b> <b>Castro,</b> ensured that she won enough support from the gay community to give her a full term as Mayor.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Sylvester's boyfriend, Rick Cranmer, {{became aware}} that he had become {{infected}} with HIV; with no known medical cure, his health deteriorated rapidly and he died in September 1987. Sylvester was devastated, and although recognizing that he too was probably infected, he refused to have his blood tested, only noticing the virus's first symptoms when he developed a persistent cough. Beginning work on an album that would remain unfinished, he {{moved into a new}} apartment on Collingwood Street in <b>the</b> <b>Castro,</b> and tried his best to continue performing in the Bay Area, even though he became too sick to undertake a full tour. Eventually diagnosed with AIDS, he was hospitalized for sinus surgery in late 1987, and upon returning to his apartment he began to be cared for by his mother and Tracy, before being hospitalized again in May 1988, this time with pneumocystis pneumonia. Returning to his flat, he gave away many of his treasured possessions and wrote his will.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was {{initially}} {{a supporter of}} the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution. Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms. The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the Cuban government occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971. Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist. Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since. Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.|$|E
