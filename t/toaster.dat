5|$|Matt Groening {{originally}} {{pitched the}} idea that Homer would travel through time in Time and Punishment. His original idea was that the time-travel would {{be the result of}} Homer simply jamming his hand in the <b>toaster,</b> but it was rejected by the other writers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, {{although}} {{agriculture and}} the dairy industry, particularly the production of Leigh cheese, sometimes known as Leigh <b>Toaster,</b> were important, spinning and weaving began to develop as a cottage industry. Work was supplied from Manchester by agents who brought work weekly often to an inn, and where they collected the finished cloth. At first the work was done to supplement the income of local farmers and their families. The cloth woven in Leigh was fustian, a sort of rough corduroy, and by {{the end of the}} 17th century middlemen, fustian masters, were dealing directly with weavers and selling the finished cloth in Manchester.|$|E

50|$|In 1989, Berkeley Systems {{introduced}} a computer screensaver software called After Dark for the Apple Macintosh and in 1991 for Microsoft Windows that included animated 1940s-style chrome <b>toasters</b> sporting bird-like wings (also known as flying <b>toasters).</b> The <b>toasters</b> were depicted flying {{across the screen}} with pieces of toast.|$|R
5|$|In {{the court}} case, {{it was also}} cited that the design for winged {{toasters}} was not original and that the Berkeley Systems' design was itself derived from the Jefferson Airplane album Thirty Seconds Over Winterland, which also used flying toasters adorned with wings. Berkeley argued that the firm {{was unaware of the}} previous artwork until 1991, and that the album cover's toasters had clocks in addition to their wings. Jefferson Airplane later sued Berkeley Systems in turn {{for the use of the}} same flying <b>toaster</b> emblem. The rock group lost the case as they did not trademark the album cover at the time of publication.|$|E
5|$|Director John Lasseter's first {{experience}} with computer animation was during his work as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation, when two of his friends showed him the lightcycle scene from Tron. It was an eye-opening experience which awakened Lasseter to the possibilities offered by the new medium of computer-generated animation. Lasseter tried to pitch The Brave Little <b>Toaster</b> as a fully computer-animated film to Disney, but the idea was rejected and Lasseter was fired. He {{then went on to}} work at Lucasfilm and later as a founding member of Pixar, which was purchased by entrepreneur and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs in 1986. At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the Pixar Image Computer's capabilities, and Tin Toy (1988) —a short story told {{from the perspective of a}} toy, referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys— would go on to claim the 1988 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, the first computer-generated film to do so.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Others, the Simpson family find unexplained frosty {{chocolate}} milkshakes and that their TV only shows Married... with Children. After a ghost attacks him in his sleep, Homer summons the ghosts, who are the family's former selves from The Tracey Ullman Show. Homer is attracted to the ghost Marge who prefers him to the former grumpy Homer, so the jealous living Marge kills herself to become a ghost. The ghost Homer becomes jealous and bludgeons the living Homer {{to death with a}} <b>toaster</b> while he is in the bathtub. Bart fakes suicide to join the ghosts, tricking Lisa into actually killing herself, her ghost then murders Bart as revenge. Groundskeeper Willie takes the children's corpses to make stew and it is implied that he murdered Maggie. Homer chooses his modern-day wife over the older ghost. The next morning at the breakfast table, Lisa asks if there could ever be any other incarnations of the Simpsons and a range of Simpson families based on other animations are then shown. The segment ends with the original version of Homer unsuccessfully trying to photograph a good portrait of the two families together.|$|E
50|$|The <b>toasters</b> {{were the}} subject of two lawsuits, the first in 1993, Berkeley Systems vs Delrina Corporation, over a module of Delrina's Opus 'N Bill screen saver in which Opus the Penguin shoots down the <b>toasters.</b> Delrina later changed {{the wings of the}} <b>toasters</b> to {{propellers}} in order to avoid infringing the trademark. The second case was brought in 1994 by the 1960s rock group Jefferson Airplane who claimed that the <b>toasters</b> were a copy of the winged <b>toasters</b> featured on the cover of their 1973 album Thirty Seconds Over Winterland. The case was dismissed, because the cover art had not been registered as a trademark by the group prior to Berkeley Systems' release of the screen saver.|$|R
