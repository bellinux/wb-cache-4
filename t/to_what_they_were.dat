25|$|Freud {{initiated}} the psychoanalytic critique of Surrealism with his remark that what interested him {{most about the}} Surrealists was not their unconscious but their conscious. His meaning was that the manifestations of and experiments with psychic automatism highlighted by Surrealists as the liberation of the unconscious were highly structured by ego activity, similar to {{the activities of the}} dream censorship in dreams, and that therefore it was in principle a mistake to regard Surrealist poems and other art works as direct manifestations of the unconscious, when they were indeed highly shaped and processed by the ego. In this view, the Surrealists may have been producing great works, but they were products of the conscious, not the unconscious mind, and they deceived themselves with regard <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing with the unconscious. In psychoanalysis proper, the unconscious does not just express itself automatically but can only be uncovered through the analysis of resistance and transference in the psychoanalytic process.|$|E

500|$|Revie {{was made}} player-manager at Leeds United in March 1961 {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Jack Taylor, who left after Leeds found themselves struggling in the Second Division. He had initially applied for the vacant job at Bournemouth, but Bournemouth were unable to find the £6,000 Leeds demanded, and the Leeds directors decided to instead appoint Revie as manager. At the time the club was in debt and was located in a rugby league territory, with very little football tradition. Less than 7,000 turned out for the final home game of the 1960–61 season whilst Leeds's championship game of the 1960–61 Rugby League season had an attendance of over 50,000. He immediately began to institute radical changes such as ensuring the players stayed at higher quality hotels. He instilled a [...] "family atmosphere" [...] at Elland Road, making sure to {{take an interest in}} the lives of everyone at the club from the cleaning staff to the star players and ensuring there were no [...] "big egos" [...] at the club. He showed trust in his players, leaving them mainly to their own devices though he always made sure he was fully informed as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> up to off the pitch, even {{going so far as to}} tell them to dump their girlfriends if he viewed them as unsuitable. He also introduced lengthy dossiers on opposing teams to ensure his players knew every detail about the opposition and were able to exploit weaknesses and nullify threats. Other changes were based on some of his many superstitions, such as his belief that birds were bad luck which resulted in him getting rid of the owl on the club badge and the discontinuation of the Peacocks nickname in favour of the Whites.|$|E

They're so fearful, and so hostile, and so narrow, and frightened, and uptight and dogmatic... I wrote this book because I got tired satirizing fundamentalist Christianity... I decided to satirize fundamentalist materialism for a change, because the two are equally comical... The materialist fundamentalists are funnier than the Christian fundamentalists, because they think they're rational! ...They're never skeptical about anything except the things they have a prejudice against. None of them ever says anything skeptical about the AMA, or about anything in establishment science or any entrenched dogma. They're only skeptical about new ideas that frighten them.

2500|$|As a {{magazine}} writer, Melville {{was a better}} judge of popular taste than he recently had been as a novelist, Sealts finds. He read contemporary newspapers and magazines, and paid careful attention <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> carrying. By studying the contents, Melville [...] "learned to pattern his own pieces accordingly, with respect to both form and content." [...] A number of the pieces contain references to persons, places, and events Melville witnessed himself. People whom Melville knew served {{as the basis for}} many characters in the short fiction, as some of the reviewers guessed. Never an excelling inventor of original plots, Melville elaborated on his own experiences with material from his reading. Chief among the influences upon his magazine fiction, as recognized by both contemporary reviewers of The Piazza Tales and Melville scholars of the following century, were tales and sketches by such contemporary authors as Washington Irving, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Charles Lamb, and Charles Dickens, some of whom he had read as early as 1849. These are influences of a general nature and cannot be identified to single works, or as Sealts puts it, Melville [...] "not infrequently followed the lead of others in terms of plotting, characterization, and technique of narration." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gonzalo Carrasco Museum and Cultural Center {{is located}} in the house in which the painter was born, which is {{on one side of the}} main plaza on Plaza de la Constitucion 17. It has been {{designated}} as an architectural monument. [...] The house traditionally was called the Portal El Fénix, home of the Carrasco family, who were merchants. Gonzalo Carrasco was a Jesuit, theologian and painter who was active in the late 19th century and early 20th. He studied at the Academy of San Carlos and with José María Velasco and his work adorns a number of buildings in Mexico and other countries. Portal El Fénix is a two story structure with a central courtyard. The lower floor was dedicated to businesses such as a general store, hairdressers and wine shop, with the family's residence upstairs. A number of rooms have been restored <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> like in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [...] However, the most representative part of the building was called the Tienda Grande (Large Store), a term which came to be used to refer to the entire structure. It was located in the front under the balconies. Here were sold basic necessities such as bread, fabric, wax, grains and more. [...] This house burned in 1876, but was rebuilt.|$|E

When anyone said anything against them, we knew just what that person was worth. The authorities, our teachers, even our parents, became idiots to us." [...] Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union's government {{to prevent the spread}} of the Beatles' popularity amongst their citizens, the band proved to be as popular in the USSR as it was in Britain. The government went as far as censoring the expression of all Western ideals, including the Beatles' bourgeois eccentricity, limiting the Soviet citizens' access to their music. Leslie Woodland, a documentary film maker, commented regarding what the Russian people were told about the West – [...] "Once people heard the Beatles' wonderful music, it just didn't fit. The authorities' prognosis didn't correspond <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> listening to. The system was built on fear and lies, and in this way, the Beatles put an end to the fear, and exposed the lies." [...] Pavel Palazchenko, Mikhail Gorbachev's conference interpreter, stated that the Beatles' music was a [...] "source of musical relief. They helped us create a world of our own, a world different from the dull and senseless ideological liturgy that increasingly reminded me of Stalinism...". Like Gorbachev, many Russian youth agreed that the Beatles were a way to overcome the cultural isolation imposed by the Cold War and reinforced by their current political system.|$|E
2500|$|The {{soldiers}} had to heat their forks in the coals of their fires {{to prevent the}} tines from freezing to their tongues. A blizzard on March 5 deposited over {{a foot of snow}} and significantly delayed Crook's progress. Temperatures fell so low that the thermometers of the day could not record the cold. Crook's column slowly followed the Bozeman Trail north to Old Fort Reno, reaching it on March 5. There, the expedition established its supply base, leaving the wagons and Infantry accompanying the column, Companies C, and I, of the 4th U.S. Infantry, under Captain Edwin M. Coates. The five Cavalry battalions then marched to the head of Otter Creek. On March 16, scout Frank Grouard saw two Indian warriors observing the soldiers. He identified them as Oglala Lakota and believed that the camp of Crazy Horse might be nearby. [...] This was reported to Crook, and at 5 p.m. he divided his command and sent Colonel Joseph J. Reynolds (a West Point classmate of President Ulysses S. Grant, and a combat veteran of both the Mexican-American War, and Civil War) on a night march with about 383 men, with rations for one day, following the trail of the two Oglalas southeast toward Powder River. Crook kept with him about 300 men. That night Frank Grouard and the other scouts followed the two Oglala Sioux's trail in the snow. It led right <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> looking for, an Indian village, which they described as containing more than 100 lodges on the west bank of Powder River. The scouts immediately reported this information back to Colonel Reynolds.|$|E

5000|$|Book II {{introduces}} the term [...] "nature" [...] (physis) as [...] "a source or cause of being moved and {{of being at}} rest in that to which it belongs primarily" [...] (1.192b21). Thus, those entities are natural which are capable of starting to move, e.g. growing, acquiring qualities, displacing themselves, and finally being born and dying. Aristotle contrasts natural things with the artificial: artificial things can move also, but <b>they</b> move according <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> made of, not according <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are.</b> For example, if a wooden bed were buried and somehow sprouted as a tree, it would be according <b>to</b> <b>what</b> it is made of, not what it is. Aristotle contrasts two senses of nature: nature as matter and nature as form or definition.|$|R
