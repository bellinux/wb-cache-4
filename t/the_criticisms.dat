5|$|According {{to several}} journalists {{who have worked}} {{independently}} on Opus Dei, such as John Allen, Jr., Vittorio Messori, Patrice de Plunkett, Maggy Whitehouse, Noam Friedlander many of <b>the</b> <b>criticisms</b> against Opus Dei are myths and unproven tales.

5|$|In 2007, the {{government}} unveiled {{a proposal to}} redevelop the area surrounding the historic Albert Hall into a tourist and dining precinct. This included the building of an eight-storey building and the rezoning of some waterfront land currently designated as cultural to commercial. It was met with widespread hostility from heritage activists and the general community, which submitted more than 3,300 signatories in a petition against the scheme. One of <b>the</b> <b>criticisms</b> was that the project was tilted too heavily towards business, and neglected the arts and community events. The proposal was scrapped in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Reactions {{to the new}} freeway {{were not}} all positive. In a special {{editorial}} in The Grand Rapids Press after the freeway opened in 2004, local resident Curt MacDougall summarized <b>the</b> <b>criticisms</b> of the new freeway. He cited the loss of rural farmland and wetlands as a negative effect of the highway. The editorial also discussed that the freeway does decrease travel times for some residents, but it will mean increased development. That development will mean further urban sprawl, and could spur the creation of additional highways in the area.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to survey {{critical}} opinion of the book, Gulliver’s Travels, from its publication on October 28, 1726, to the present. Gulliver’s Travels is composed of four distinct parts, {{each with its own}} mood, tone, and effect. In this thesis a chapter is devoted to <b>the</b> <b>criticism</b> of each part. Chapter I deals with Part I, “A Voyage to Lilliput”. Chapter II concerns <b>the</b> <b>criticism</b> of “A Voyage to Brobdingnag”, Part II of Gulliver’s Travels. Chapter III takes up <b>the</b> <b>criticism</b> of Part III, “A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib, and Japan”. <b>The</b> <b>criticism</b> of Part IV, “A Voyage to the Houyhnhnms”, is discussed in Chapter IV.

5|$|Based on Kinsey's scale where 0 {{represents}} {{a person with}} an exclusively heterosexual response and 6 {{represents a}} person with an exclusively homosexual one, and numbers in between represent a gradient of responses with both sexes, 6% of those interviewed ranked as a 6: exclusively homosexual. Apart from those who ranked 0 (71%), the largest percentage in between 0 and 6 was 1 at approximately 15%. However, the Kinsey Report remarked that the ranking described a period in a person's life, and that a person's orientation may change. Among <b>the</b> <b>criticisms</b> the Kinsey Report received, a particular one addressed the Institute for Sex Research's tendency to use statistical sampling, which facilitated an over-representation of same-sex relationships by other researchers who did not adhere to Kinsey's qualifications of data.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{proposed}} measure—particularly its {{denial of the}} right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. The US, UK, IMF, and World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages. Responding to <b>the</b> <b>criticisms,</b> the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law. Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza. Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} <b>the</b> <b>criticisms</b> leveled against {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and distorts {{the effect of}} money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly {{in the context of}} a limited voir dire.|$|E

To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, {{in keeping with the}} core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format. Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that {{there is no need to}} adjust their methods because either <b>the</b> <b>criticisms</b> are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{uncertain}} what role the Ten Commandments played in early Christian worship, evidence suggests they were recited during some services and used in Christian education. For example, the Commandments are included {{in one of the}} earliest Christian writings, known as the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles or the Didache. Scholars contend that the Commandments were highly regarded by the early Church as a summary of God's law. The Protestant scholar Klaus Bockmuehl believes that the Church replaced the Commandments with lists of virtues and vices, such as the seven deadly sins, from 400–1200. Other scholars contend that throughout Church history the Commandments have been used as an examination of conscience and that many theologians have written about them. While evidence exists that the Commandments were part of catechesis in monasteries and other venues, there was no official Church position to promote specific methods of religious instruction during the Middle Ages. The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) was the first attempt to remedy this problem. Surviving evidence reveals that some bishops' efforts to implement the Council's resolutions included special emphasis on teaching the Commandments in their respective dioceses. Centuries later, the lack of instruction in them by some dioceses formed the basis of one of <b>the</b> <b>criticisms</b> launched against the Church by Protestant reformers.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, Prescott {{abandoned}} {{the idea of}} a legal career because of the continued deterioration of his eyesight, and resolved to devote himself to literature. Although he initially studied a wide range of subjects, including Italian, French, English and Spanish literature, American history, classics and political philosophy, Prescott came to focus on Italian poetry. Among the works he studied during this period were such classics as Dante's Divine Comedy and Boccacio's Decameron. His first published works were two essays in the North American Review—both discussing Italian poetry. The first of these, published in 1824, was titled Italian Narrative Poetry, and became somewhat controversial after it was heavily criticized in an Italian review by Lorenzo Da Ponte, the librettist of Mozart's Don Giovanni. Prescott wrote a succinct reply to Da Ponte's fifty-page argument in the North American Review of July 1825. Da Ponte published <b>the</b> <b>criticisms</b> as an appendix to his translation of Dodley's Economy of Human life, which resulted in Prescott noticing them rather late.|$|E

5|$|The new {{classical}} school {{culminated in}} real business cycle theory (RBC). Like early classical economic models, RBC models assumed that markets clear and that business cycles {{are driven by}} changes in technology and supply, not demand. New Keynesians tried to address many of <b>the</b> <b>criticisms</b> leveled by Lucas and other new classical economists against Neo-Keynesians. New Keynesians adopted rational expectations and built models with microfoundations of sticky prices that suggested recessions could still be explained by demand factors because rigidities stop prices from falling to a market-clearing level, leaving a surplus of goods and labor. The new neoclassical synthesis combined elements of both new classical and new Keynesian macroeconomics into a consensus. Other economists avoided the new classical and new Keynesian debate on short-term dynamics and developed the new growth theories of long-run economic growth. The Great Recession led to a retrospective {{on the state of}} the field and some popular attention turned toward heterodox economics.|$|E
5|$|In 2013–14, West Ham {{finished}} 13th in the Premier League. They also {{reached the}} semi-finals of the League Cup before losing 9–0 on aggregate to eventual cup-winners Manchester City. A {{feature of the}} season were <b>the</b> <b>criticisms</b> of manager Sam Allardyce by supporters relating to his perceived negative playing tactics. West Ham finished 12th in the 2014–15 Premier League, one place higher than the previous season. Minutes after the last game of the season, on 24 May 2015, the club announced that Allardyce's contract would not be renewed {{and that they were}} seeking a new manager. By winning the Premier League Fair Play table for 2014–15, West Ham qualified for the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League, entering at the first qualifying round. On 9 June 2015, former West Ham player Slaven Bilić was appointed as manager on a three-year contract. In Bilić's fourth game in charge, the team won at Anfield {{for the first time in}} 52 years, beating Liverpool 0–3, with goals from Manuel Lanzini, Mark Noble and Diafra Sakho. In Bilić's first season as manager, West Ham finished seventh in the Premier League. The team broke several records for the club in the Premier League era, including the highest number of points (62), the highest number of goals in a season (65), the least number of games lost in a season (8) and the lowest number of away defeats (5). Following Manchester United's win in the 2016 FA Cup Final, West Ham took their Europa League place and qualified for the third qualifying round of the 2016–17 edition. In August 2016, André Ayew became the club's most expensive signing after joining for a fee of £20.5million from Swansea City. At the end of the 2016–17 Premier League season West Ham finished 11th.|$|E
