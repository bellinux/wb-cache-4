40|$|Introduction: This study {{examined}} the everyday work of eight <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments at governmental primary and secondary schools in Queensland, Australia. The small-scale study aimed to capture the scope {{and complexity of the}} activities of these teachers and the regular challenges they face in their expected everyday roles. Methods: Telephone interviews were used to collect descriptive data from the teachers. A direct field-sampling procedure was used across the governmental schools to recruit qualified and specialist teachers who met prespecified criteria, most of whom lived in Brisbane, Queensland's capital city. The content of the interviews was generated from two sequenced activities with a different group of experienced <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments. Results: The teachers carried out complex and demanding duties as part of their everyday roles. These duties were consistent with those performed by their counterparts around the world. The most frequently performed and most important activities including providing direct support to students, advocating for students' needs, and collaborating across school and community contexts. The identified challenges were linked primarily to the lack of time to undertake important activities. Discussion: Three important and interconnected findings can be drawn from the results: role complexity, time and collaboration, and the importance of the expanded core curriculum. Implications for Practitioners: The findings provide an initial snapshot of the changing role reported by the teachers. Thus, these data offer a beginning point for future probes into the workplace knowledge and skills required by <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments.

40|$|At colleges or {{universities}} {{students with}} visual impairments have to be mainstreamed. Therefore, each year quite a lot of {{students with visual}} impairments can be found in classes scattered over the different colleges and universities in every country. However, most teachers have not been instructed how to teach {{students with visual impairments}} in a mainstream classroom. Thus, they worry about changes in the syllabus, availability of suitable textbooks, and how to teach all students together in an effective way. Obtaining necessary information about the students’ problems and sources for help are paramount for the successful integration {{of students with visual impairments}} into the mainstream classroom. This paper, therefore, aims to provide information for teachers with little or no background knowledge in special education. Several of the problems discussed in this paper are of concern for <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments in general, but some aspects are of special interest for foreign language teachers and are not normally found in guidelines provided to <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments in mainstream classes...|$|E

Childhood obesity has more than doubled since 1990, and the health consequences are reflected in the rising cost of health care. There has also been a significant drop in physical activity across the country and physical education is no longer required in middle schools. The lack of physical activity and issues of weight can compromise the ability of the individual who is blind or visually impaired to maneuver through the environment safely and efficiently. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the perceptions of itinerant <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments about the importance of physical activity for their students with visual impairments and its effect on academic success and social relationship. Data was gathered from 175 <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments concerning their perceptions regarding the importance of physical activity and obesity and their relationship with academic success and social relationships. The teachers indicated that physical activity for their students is very important. They described a multitude of barriers that account for a lack of involvement in the general physical education classes in which they were enrolled. Teachers reported on their own personal physical activity levels in relationship to the importance they placed on their students' need to be active. The teachers did not indicate that being overweight was a particular issue with their visually impaired students, but they acknowledged that being overweight and a lack of physical activity create additional barriers for academic success and appropriate social relationships. The teachers also reported that the same barriers in physical education classes and access to recreation activities in the community that have been listed in past research studies were still in existence, and these barriers were also part of their dilemma in creating positive physical activity experiences for their students who are visually impaired. This study validated the necessity of further research to find the effective intervention strategies and programs to increase physical activity of students with visual impairments...|$|E

It is necessary to attract approximately 5, 000 new teachers to the field to meet the needs of the ever-increasing population of students with visual impairments requiring specialized training. This study investigated the personality and background experiences of individuals who are attracted to work as educators with students with visual impairments. A sample of 132 teachers who had been trained at either the undergraduate or graduate level and were employed within their first five years as teachers with this specialization completed the Holland Self-Directed Search (Form CP) and a Participant Profile form to ascertain the personality types and experiences of those new to the field. The study considered three variables: (1) gender, (2) race/ethnicity, (3) teacher training level and their association with Holland personality type (RIASEC). All three variables were weak predictors of the personality type of teachers of the visually impaired as indicated by Goodman and Kruskal's tau. Results of the Holland Self-Directed Search was a stronger measure of the personality type associated with becoming a teacher of students with visual impairments. The data related to the sample revealed that 65. 2 % of those responding identified themselves as Social type.

40|$|With {{inclusion}} {{of students with}} visual impairments in mainstream schools, we guarantee them the right to equally participate in all activities – including sports. However research and practice reports show, that students often do not receive the necessary sports experiences, which consequently disclose a lower level of physical fitness, lower extent of motor skills and slower motor development. On the other hand, we meet with teachers – physical education teachers, who are introduced to a very heterogenic population, with which they do not have enough knowledge, competencies and experiences to work. In the empirical part of this master’s thesis we examined to what extent the students with visual impairments were included in sports activities and with what challenges the physical education teachers are facing. For this we designed a semi-structured interview, based on theoretical findings. The results show that physical education teachers consider that students with visual impairments are included in sports activities, but at the same time they show lack of knowledge in areas of adapting the school environment, equipment, aids and usage of different teaching methods. Inclusion is also mostly dependent on whether or not the activity, which is carried out, is that of an individual or group form. Students with visual impairments tend to be excluded from activities that are in a group and ball games. The majority of the focus is on the visual impairment, rather than on a constructive and team way of solving the existing challenges. In the last part of the master’s thesis we have written the basic recommendations and guidelines that enable physical education teachers to plan, execute and evaluate the educational process easier and of better quality.

40|$|Students {{with visual}} {{impairments}} require accessible instructional materials and differentiated instruction to meet learning needs that are impacted by vision loss. <b>Teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments (TVIs) are responsible for addressing the specialized needs of learners {{who are blind or}} visually impaired, which include instruction in the use of technology. This area of instruction is crucial among the other tasks of a TVI, because students who are proficient technology users can more independently access classroom content in a timely fashion and report improved postsecondary and employment outcomes. However, a majority of TVIs remain unprepared to use and teach technology. Although challenges in technology adoption were similarly identified and largely overcome by general education classroom teachers, several barriers remain unmitigated for TVIs. This dissertation addresses and tackles this discrepancy. Among the many challenges found in TVIs’ work, the lack of an organizational space is discussed as a major factor that results in a dispersed practice. Based on this premise, the study reinforces teachers’ needs for regular, informal interactions that can support ongoing learning and advancement of basic skills learned in training. The study examines a group of TVIs who communicated in an online forum for one year following a face-to-face technology workshop. Findings of how this forum provided opportunities for learning support recommendations for the use of online communities to deliver ongoing and informal professional development. In carrying out research in this area of study that has been mostly anecdotal to date, recommendations for objective measures were also developed to more accurately evaluate TVI learning and implementation of technology. The study adopts a mixed methods approach to analyze online informal TVI interactions around what is referred to as a virtual water cooler (VWC). The VWC concept was conceived to bridge theoretical constructs in several areas of the literature, including communities of practice, social networks, workplace organization, and computer supported collaborative learning. Initial analyses of online teacher interactions confirmed that this group of teachers indeed behaved as a community of practice according to Wenger’s (1998) dimensions—domain of interest, practice, and community. Observational data (messages posted on the Yahoo Group) were coded, and it was found that 68 % of the communications exchanged between teachers were characteristic of a CoP. Social network analysis (SNA) noted {{the ebb and flow of}} participation and expertise among members of the group and contributed further evidence that this online forum was a CoP that emulated face-to-face informal teacher interactions. Lastly, interview data were analyzed to identify the mechanisms by which this VWC supported the development of an online CoP and its benefit to developing TVIs’ technology proficiency in using the iPad with students. The results included evidence of teacher learning, support and encouragement of colleagues’ technology use, along with changes in pedagogy related to how technology was implemented with students. Regarding practical implications of this research, this VWC was found to overcome barriers of time and professional isolation in learning and using technology as reported in the literature. The VWC provided an avenue for on-demand professional development, moral support, and resources on a case-by-case basis that extended beyond the basic knowledge learned in the iPad workshop. Overall, the VWC served as an online community of practice that advanced knowledge gained in initial technology training, provided informal and ongoing professional development, and ultimately influenced several TVIs’ teaching practices. Implications for research practices were also found in this study. Self-reports of technology use were found to be unreliable and recommendations support use of more objective measures to evaluate TVIs’ technology proficiency. Measures to determine the efficacy of technology training also support needs for longitudinal rather than immediate evaluation measures following a workshop. Based on TVIs’ implementation of the iPad and changes in their overall practice in the year following the initial training, membership to a CoP was found to be effective in supporting TVIs’ technology proficiency...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore teachers' {{perceptions}} and experiences of supports and obstacles to engaging <b>students</b> <b>with</b> multiple and severe disabilities (MSD) in communicative interactions at school. Eleven <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> MSD participated in two in-depth interviews. Interview transcripts were analysed for narrative structure and content themes. Inter-coder reliability for coding of content themes was 87. 5 %. Participants identified a broad range of factors, including: characteristics <b>of</b> individual <b>students,</b> attitudes, perceptions and beliefs <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> and other staff, class structure, staffing, opportunities for collegiality, resources, funding, infrastructure, collaboration with speech-language pathologists, appropriate communication education for <b>teachers,</b> the role <b>of</b> government departments, and broader societal factors. The findings suggest that there are complex contextual influences on the communicative interactions <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> MSD. While inadequate systemic supports appear to contribute to low frequencies of communication, systemic factors can be structured so that students participate in activities and have opportunities for communication. Further research is required <b>with</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> MSD to substantiate these findings...|$|R
40|$|Training {{received}} by <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in one southern state was investigated. Teachers (n = 90) reported training received via an online {{version of the}} Autism Treatment Survey. The {{most common type of}} training reported was attendance at a full- or half-day workshop; fewer than 15 % reported receiving training from teacher preparation programs at colleges or universities. The types of training received did not predict the use of evidence-based practices.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of latency on the {{accuracy}} of data recorded by special education teachers serving <b>students</b> <b>with</b> high or low incidence disabilities. A multi-element design was used to assess the validity among three different conditions during which participants recorded data to determine which condition resulted in the most accurate data and whether <b>student</b> level <b>of</b> functioning (high or low incidence disability level) made a difference. Results indicated special education teachers recorded the most accurate data during Conditions A (immediately after a student’s target behavior occurred) and B (immediately after the conclusion of the instructional lesson) when the latency between behavioral occurrence and recording is 50 minutes or less. Furthermore, visual and statistical analysis confirmed no significant differences between data recording conditions for <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> high incidence disabilities compared to <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> low incidence disabilities. Thus, <b>student</b> level <b>of</b> functioning did not make a difference in teachers’ level of accuracy.
