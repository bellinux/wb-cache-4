25|$|Titanium nitride (TiN) is a {{very hard}} ceramic {{material}} {{that can be used}} to coat a high-speed steel bit (usually a <b>twist</b> <b>bit),</b> extending the cutting life by three or more times. Even after sharpening, the leading edge of coating still provides improved cutting and lifetime.|$|E
25|$|These bits are {{available}} both in a version similar to an auger bit or brace bit, designed for low speed, high torque use with a brace or other hand drill (pictured to the right), or {{as a high}} speed, low torque bit meant for a power drill. While {{the shape of the}} cutting edges is different, and one uses screw threads and the other a <b>twist</b> <b>bit</b> for the pilot, the method of adjusting them remains the same.|$|E
2500|$|Another, different, bit {{also called}} an {{installer}} bit {{has a very}} long flexible shaft, typically up to [...] long, with a small <b>twist</b> <b>bit</b> at the end. The shaft is made of spring steel instead of hardened steel, {{so it can be}} flexed while drilling without breaking. This allows the bit to be curved inside walls, for example to drill through studs from a light switch box without needing to remove any material from the wall. These bits usually come with a set of special tools to aim and flex the bit to reach the desired location and angle, although the problem of seeing where the operator is drilling still remains.|$|E

2500|$|The diameter-to-length {{ratio of}} the drill bit is usually between 1:1 and 1:10.

50|$|Before boring {{machines}} were invented, carpenters used hand-powered augers to bore holes. Most common were T-handled augers. The {{shape of the}} drill bits changed over time, with the spoon bit and shell bit being common before {{the invention of the}} spiral or <b>twist</b> <b>bit</b> in 1771 which removes the cuttings as it turns. The exact origin of this invention is not known, but the earliest patent is in the United States in 1830 by J. Beckwith and was as tall as a man and operated by a large wheel from the side.|$|E
50|$|Another, different, bit {{also called}} an {{installer}} bit {{has a very}} long flexible shaft, typically up to 72 in long, with a small <b>twist</b> <b>bit</b> at the end.

25|$|Left-hand bits {{are almost}} always <b>twist</b> <b>bits</b> and are {{predominantly}} used in the repetition engineering industry on screw machines or drilling heads. Left-handed drill bits allow a machining operation to continue where either the spindle cannot be reversed or {{the design of the}} machine makes it more efficient to run left-handed. With the increased use of the more versatile CNC machines, their use is less common than when specialized machines were required for machining tasks.|$|R

25|$|Conventional <b>twist</b> drill <b>bits</b> tend {{to wander}} when {{presented}} to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a spotting drill bit. In wood, the lip and spur drill bit is another solution: The {{centre of the}} drill bit is given not the straight chisel of the <b>twist</b> drill <b>bit,</b> but a spur with a sharp point and four sharp corners to cut the wood. The sharp point of the spur simply pushes into the soft wood to keep the drill bit in line.|$|R

2500|$|A {{great number}} of holes with small diameters of about 1mm or less must be drilled in printed circuit boards (PCBs) used by {{electronic}} equipment with through-hole components. Most PCBs are made of highly abrasive fiberglass, which quickly wears steel bits, especially given the {{hundreds or thousands of}} holes on most circuit boards. To solve this problem, solid tungsten carbide <b>twist</b> <b>bits,</b> which drill quickly through the board while providing a moderately long life, [...] are almost always used. Carbide PCB bits are estimated to outlast high speed steel bits by a factor of ten or more. [...] Other options sometimes used are diamond or diamond-coated bits.|$|R
