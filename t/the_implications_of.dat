5|$|In Norse mythology, Ýdalir ("yew-dales") is a {{location}} containing a dwelling {{owned by the}} god Ullr. Ýdalir is solely attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources.

5000|$|The use of success-words (though neutralized), is {{of course}} a device which makes {{directly}} for plausibility.

5|$|The genus {{attracted}} {{media attention}} in 2000, when a specimen unearthed in 1993 in South Dakota, United States, was interpreted as including a fossilized heart.

5|$|Activist groups {{interpreted}} {{his comments}} as warnings to President George W. Bush about <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> nominating Supreme Court justices who {{were opposed to}} the Roe v. Wade decision. Specter maintained that his comments were a prediction, not a warning. He met with many conservative Republican senators, and based on assurances he gave them, he was recommended for the Judiciary Committee's chairmanship in late 2004. He officially assumed that position when the 109th Congress convened on January 4, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Each section, such as on {{reptiles}} at {{the start}} of Volume II (and the entire work) is introduced with an essay on distinguishing aspects of their zoology. In the case of the reptiles, the essay begins with the observation that their circulation is so arranged that only part of the blood pumped by the heart goes through the lungs; Cuvier discusses <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> this arrangement, next observing that they have a relatively small brain compared to the mammals and birds, and that none of them incubate their eggs.|$|E

5|$|Film {{historian}} Howard Hughes suggests that, despite <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> a large budget as {{a result}} of an international cast, as well as elaborate set and costume designs, there are several aspects that suggest otherwise. These include several continuity errors and revealing mistakes present throughout the film, and a variance in the quality of the film stock. In comparison to the Technicolor/Techniscope presentation most Spaghetti Westerns were filmed in, The Great Silence was filmed in the standard European widescreen format and printed in Eastmancolor.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to addressing the general questions regarding science and induction, many philosophers of science are occupied by investigating foundational problems in particular sciences. They also examine <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> particular sciences for broader philosophical questions.

5|$|Not {{only are}} groups useful to assess <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> symmetries in molecules, but {{surprisingly}} they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry.

5|$|Philosophers of science—such as Charles Sanders Peirce, Norwood Russell Hanson, Stephen Toulmin, and Karl Popper—have {{repeatedly}} {{turned to}} Kepler: examples of incommensurability, analogical reasoning, falsification, {{and many other}} philosophical concepts {{have been found in}} Kepler's work. Physicist Wolfgang Pauli even used Kepler's priority dispute with Robert Fludd to explore <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> analytical psychology on scientific investigation.|$|E

5|$|The {{cultural}} {{impact of}} extraterrestrial contact is the corpus of changes to terrestrial science, technology, religion, politics, and ecosystems resulting from {{contact with an}} extraterrestrial civilization.

5|$|The {{potential}} {{changes from}} extraterrestrial contact could vary greatly in magnitude and type, {{based on the}} extraterrestrial civilization's level of technological advancement, degree of benevolence or malevolence, and level of mutual comprehension between itself and humanity. The medium through which humanity is contacted, be it electromagnetic radiation, direct physical interaction, extraterrestrial artefact, or otherwise, may also influence the results of contact. Incorporating these factors, various systems have been created to assess <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> extraterrestrial contact.|$|E
5|$|The unnamed eagle is attested in {{both the}} Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, while Veðrfölnir is solely attested in the Prose Edda. In both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, the squirrel Ratatoskr carries messages between the unnamed eagle and Nidhöggr, the wyrm that resides below the world tree. Scholars have proposed theories about <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> the birds.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce {{approved}} of the 1830 election victory of the more progressive Whigs, though {{he was concerned about}} <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> their Reform Bill which proposed the redistribution of parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and an extension of the franchise. In the event, the Reform Act 1832 was to bring more abolitionist MPs into Parliament as a result of intense and increasing public agitation against slavery. In addition, the 1832 slave revolt in Jamaica convinced government ministers that abolition was essential to avoid further rebellion.|$|E

5|$|Writer Troy Kennedy Martin {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the political climate of the time, dominated by the Thatcher government, and the aura of secrecy surrounding the nuclear industry – and by <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> the Gaia hypothesis of environmentalist James Lovelock; these combined to his crafting a thriller that mingled real world concerns with mythic and mystical elements. Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial: he had proposed that Craven would turn into a tree but this was vetoed {{by members of the}} cast and crew.|$|E
