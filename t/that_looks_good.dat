How did {{it happen}} that RICHARDS'S name {{remained}} in Stephenson's mind as indicating the right man, and not some other man's name? <b>That</b> <b>looked</b> <b>good.</b> Yes, <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> very <b>good.</b> In fact it went on looking better and better, straight along--until by-and-by it grew into positive PROOF. And then Richards put the matter at once out of his mind, for he had a private instinct that a proof once established is better left so.|$|R

50|$|The game {{is being}} {{developed}} using the Unity game engine. It will make use of 3D graphics rather than the 2D sprites of its predecessor. The development team's main concern with the transition to 3D graphics was whether they could create an art style <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>good</b> and replicated the sprites from the original game. The use of 3D graphics would enable features such as objects with physics behaviour and rotating the camera angle.|$|R
