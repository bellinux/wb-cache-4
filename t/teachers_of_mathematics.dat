25|$|Reform {{mathematics}} is {{an approach to}} mathematics education, particularly in North America. It is based on principles explained in 1989 by the National Council of <b>Teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mathematics</b> (NCTM). The NCTM document, Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, attempted to set forth a vision for K-12 (ages 5-18) mathematics education in the United States and Canada. Their recommendations were adopted by many education agencies, from local to federal levels through the 1990s. In 2000, NCTM revised its standards {{with the publication of}} Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (PSSM). Like the first publication, these updated standards have continued to {{serve as the basis for}} many states' mathematics standards, and for many federally funded textbook projects. The first standards gave a strong call for a de-emphasis on manual arithmetic in favor of students' discovering their own knowledge and conceptual thinking. The PSSM has taken a more balanced view, but still emphasizes conceptual thinking and problem solving.|$|E

2500|$|In North America, the National Council of <b>Teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mathematics</b> has {{published}} the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics, which boosted the trend towards reform mathematics.

2500|$|Major {{changes were}} also {{made to the}} SAT {{mathematics}} section at this time, {{due in part to}} the influence of suggestions made by the National Council of <b>Teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mathematics.</b> Test-takers were now permitted to use calculators on the math sections of the SAT.

Additionally, some of these [...] "student-produced response" [...] questions could have more than one correct answer. The tested mathematics content on the SAT was expanded to include concepts of slope of a line, probability, elementary statistics including median and mode, and counting problems.|$|E

2500|$|In most countries, {{students}} use calculators for schoolwork. There was some initial {{resistance to the}} idea {{out of fear that}} basic or elementary arithmetic skills would suffer. There remains disagreement {{about the importance of the}} ability to perform calculations in the head, with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching estimation methods and problem-solving. Research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in. Others have argued that calculator use can even cause core mathematical skills to atrophy, or that such use can prevent understanding of advanced algebraic concepts. In December 2011 the UK's Minister of State for Schools, Nick Gibb, voiced concern that children can become [...] "too dependent" [...] on the use of calculators. As a result, the use of calculators is to be included as part of a review of the Curriculum. In United States, many math educators and boards of education enthusiastically endorsed the National Council of <b>Teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mathematics</b> (NCTM) standards and actively promoted the use of classroom calculators from kindergarten through high school.|$|E
2500|$|At the university, he was mentored by two {{enthusiastic}} <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mathematics,</b> Christophe Gadbled and Pierre Le Canu, who awoke his {{zeal for}} the subject. Here Laplace's brilliance as a mathematician was quickly recognised and while still at Caen {{he wrote a}} memoir Sur le Calcul integral aux differences infiniment petites et aux differences finies. This provided the first intercourse between Laplace and Lagrange for Lagrange who was the senior by thirteen years, had recently founded in his native city of Turin a journal named Miscellanea Taurinensia, in which many of his other early works were printed {{and it was in}} the fourth volume of this series the Laplace's paper appeared. About this time, recognising that he had no vocation for the priesthood, he determined to become a professional mathematician. In this connection reference may perhaps be made to the statement, which has appeared in some notices of him, that he broke altogether with the church and became an atheist. [...] Laplace did not graduate in theology but left for Paris with a letter of introduction from Le Canu to Jean le Rond d'Alembert who at that time was supreme in scientific circles.|$|E
60|$|Until the {{outbreak}} of the Revolution, the circumstances of Condorcet's life were as little externally disturbed or specially remarkable as those of any other geometer and thinker of the time. He was born at a small town in Picardy, in the year 1743. His father was a cavalry officer, but as he died when his son was only three years old, he could have exerted no influence upon the future philosopher, save such as comes of transmission through blood and tissue. Condillac was his uncle, but there is no record of any intercourse between them. His mother was a devout and trembling soul, who dedicated her child to the Holy Virgin, and for eight years or more made him wear the dress of a little girl, by way of sheltering him against the temptations and unbelief of a vile world. So long as women are held by opinion and usage in a state of educational and political subjection, which prevents the growth of a large intelligence made healthy and energetic by knowledge and by activity, we may expect pious extravagances of this kind. Condorcet was weakened physically by much confinement and the constraint of cumbrous clothing; and not even his dedication to the Holy Virgin prevented him from growing up the most ardent of the admirers of Voltaire. His earliest instructors, as happened to most of the sceptical philosophers, were the Jesuits, then within a few years of their fall. That these adroit men, armed with all the arts and traditions which their order had acquired in three centuries, and with the training of the nation almost exclusively in their hands, should still have been unable to shield their persons from proscription and their creed from hatred, is a remarkable instance how little it avails ecclesiastical bodies to have a monopoly of official education, if the spirit of their teaching be out of harmony with those most potent agencies which we sum up as the spirit of the time. The Jesuits were the great official instructors of France {{for the first half of}} the eighteenth century. In 1764 the order was thrust forth from the country, and they left behind them an army of the bitterest enemies that Christianity has ever had. To do them justice, they were destroyed by weapons which they had themselves supplied. The intelligence which they had developed and sharpened, turned inevitably against the incurable faults in their own system. They were admirable <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mathematics.</b> Condorcet, instructed by the Jesuits at Rheims, was able when he was only fifteen years old to go through such performances in analysis as to win especial applause from illustrious judges like D'Alembert and Clairaut. It was impossible, however, for Jesuits, as it has ever been for all enemies of movement, to constrain within prescribed limits the activity which has once been effectively stirred. Mathematics has always been in the eyes of the Church a harmless branch of knowledge, but the mental energy that mathematics first touched is sure to turn itself by and by to more complex and dangerous subjects in the scientific hierarchy.|$|E
