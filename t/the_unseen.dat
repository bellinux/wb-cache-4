5|$|On Growth and Form {{explained}} in detail why he believed Darwinism {{to be an}} inadequate explanation for the origin of new species. He did not openly reject natural selection, but regarded it as secondary to the origin of biological form.

5|$|D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's {{most famous}} work, On Growth and Form {{was written in}} Dundee, mostly in 1915, but {{publication}} was put off until 1917 because of the delays of wartime and Thompson's many late alterations to the text. The central theme {{of the book is}} that biologists of its author's day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics. At a time when vitalism was still being considered as a biological theory, he advocated structuralism as an alternative to natural selection in governing the form of species, with the smallest hint of vitalism as <b>the</b> <b>unseen</b> driving force.|$|E

5|$|In Canada's St. Elias Mountains, {{a frozen}} {{extraterrestrial}} body is discovered by an expedition team. Professor Arlinsky, the team's leader, sends ice core samples containing presumably alien DNA to Fox Mulder. Both Mulder and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) eventually meet Michael Kritschgau (John Finn), a Defense Department employee who claims that everything Mulder {{thinks he knows}} about aliens is a lie. Kritschgau tells Mulder that his sister Samantha Mulder's abduction was fabricated, that all evidence of alien biology are merely scientific anomalies, and that the alien body discovered in Canada was fake. Kritschgau claims that the entire alien mythos is a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. government as a cover for the military–industrial complex. Distraught by Kritschgau's claims, Mulder loses his faith. Later, the FBI investigates Mulder's apparent suicide. Scully confirms <b>the</b> <b>unseen</b> body's identity.|$|E
5|$|Jean, who had adapted and {{directed}} Hogfather in 2006, was keen {{to return to}} some of the locations used in that film to provide continuity. The scenes in the Great hall of <b>the</b> <b>Unseen</b> University were filmed in the crypt of the Guildhall in the City of London, and the same Victorian country home was used for Death's house as had been seen in Hogfather. This time around, Jean was able to film more extensive panoramic shots in the latter location, thanks to The Colour of Magic's larger budget. Other filming locations included Anglesey and Snowdonia for exterior shots, Gloucester docks as the docks of Ankh-Morpork, and the Royal Courts of Justice as the Patrician's Palace.|$|E
5|$|Lightning Returns is set {{after the}} events of Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy XIII-2. In XIII, Lightning is one of six people who are turned by a fal'Cie—one of a race created by the gods—into l'Cie, {{servants}} of the fal'Cie gifted with magical powers and a 'Focus'—an assigned task to be completed within a time limit; those that succeed in their Focus go into crystal stasis, while those that fail turn into monsters called Cie'th. The six were intended to cause the large, floating sphere named Cocoon to fall onto the world of Gran Pulse below, killing all the humans of Cocoon. At the finale of the game, two of the l'Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support Cocoon, preventing the catastrophe. The remaining l'Cie were made human again by the Goddess Etro, the deity responsible for maintaining the balance between the mortal world and <b>the</b> <b>Unseen</b> Realm. In XIII-2, it is revealed that Etro's interference allowed Chaos, an energy trapped in <b>the</b> <b>Unseen</b> Realm, to escape and distort the timeline as written {{after the fall of}} Cocoon. Lightning was drawn to Valhalla, Etro's citadel, and decided to stay and act as her protector. Three years after Cocoon's fall, Lightning's sister Serah sets out to correct the distortions and reunite with Lightning, while the people of Gran Pulse construct a new Cocoon, since the old one is destined to collapse. The protagonists unwittingly end up instigating the death of Etro, which allows Chaos to spill into the mortal world and bring an end to time itself. Serah also dies, causing Lightning to nearly lose hope. Reassured by her sister's spirit, Lightning chooses to enter crystal stasis to preserve her sister's memory and keep hope alive.|$|E

5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to <b>the</b> <b>unseen</b> force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E
5|$|O'Brien {{showed a}} portion of the {{unfinished}} script to Australian director Jim Sharman, who decided to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the Royal Court Theatre, Sloane Square, Chelsea, London, which was used as a project space for new work. O'Brien had appeared briefly in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar, directed by Sharman, and the two also worked together in Sam Shepard's <b>The</b> <b>Unseen</b> Hand. Sharman would bring in production designer Brian Thomson. The original creative team was then rounded out by costume designer Sue Blane, musical director Richard Hartley, and stage producer Michael White, who was brought in to produce. As the musical went into rehearsal, the working title, They Came from Denton High, was changed just before previews at the suggestion of Sharman to The Rocky Horror Show.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu was {{slightly}} mixed about some aspects; one critic praised the added tutorial for allowing new players to be eased {{in the series}} gameplay, while another compared the tutorial to a nagging mother and said it and <b>the</b> <b>unseen</b> Tactician representing the player might grate with series fans. Bramwell praised the integration of RPG elements and tactical gameplay, in addition to finding the permanent death of characters a suitable fit for the game's world. Dingo was positive about the level design and controls, but warned that it was quite short and lacking in depth when compared to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Massimilla found the gameplay both accessible and challenging {{as she made her}} way through the game, while Nutt was skeptical about the permanent death system and critical of the in-game economy despite generally enjoying the experience. Harris again compared it to Advance Wars, but said that Fire Emblem had enough unique elements to make it its own product, and generally praised the title's accomplishments. Burns, who had experience of earlier Fire Emblem titles, praised the game as a worthy entry in the series and a good entry for the West to experience.|$|E
