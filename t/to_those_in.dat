5|$|The {{findings}} indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens {{from the rest of}} the United States are more closely related <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Europe and Asia than <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are more closely related to the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more closely related to the pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} of MacIntyres in Scotland <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Ireland {{is not entirely}} clear. Given {{the proximity of the}} two countries and the similarity of their languages, some Scottish MacIntyres undoubtedly settled in Ireland, mainly in Ulster.|$|E

5|$|Adaptation occurs {{through the}} gradual {{modification}} of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation {{may have different}} functions in related organisms. This {{is the result of}} a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within bat wings, for example, are very similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> mice feet and primate hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor. However, since all living organisms are related to some extent, even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as arthropod, squid and vertebrate eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called deep homology.|$|E
5|$|All that {{is known}} of the {{appearance}} of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fruit}} bodies of P.bembae are roughly similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Xerocomus, species in this genus {{do not have}} the powdery veil {{characteristic}} of P.bembae. Two similar species in the same area include P.annulus and P.croceus, described in 1951 by Belgian mycologist Paul Heinemann, based on specimens collected in the Congo. Although the identity of these two species is not fully clarified because of insufficient collections, P.bembae differs from both in its larger cystidia, its cream-colored flesh with pale reddish-brown to light brown tones under the cap cuticle (compared to white in P.annulus and P.croceus), its yellow mycelium (white in P.annulus and P.croceus), and differences in ecology.|$|E

5|$|Another theory by Shinhachiro Matsumoto {{suggests}} Noh {{originated from}} outcastes struggling to claim higher social status by catering <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> power, namely the new ruling samurai {{class of the}} time. The transferral of the shogunate from Kamakura to Kyoto {{at the beginning of}} Muromachi period marked the increasing power of the samurai class and strengthened the relationship between the shogunate and the court. As Noh became the shogun's favorite art form, Noh was able to become a courtly art form through this newly formed relationship. In 14th century, with strong support and patronage from shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Zeami was able to establish Noh as the most prominent theatre art form of the time.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of heavy rainfall in Worcestershire in July 2007 the M5 motorway was blocked, leaving many stranded cars on the road. The operations manager of the service station, Quintin Speers provided {{a key role in}} helping those stranded, opening up areas of the main building to be used by those stuck on the motorway. Quintin Speers also helped drivers by pushing cars to safety and distributing blankets <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> need.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} Woolley's directorship, the 74-inch {{telescope}} he had initiated {{finally came}} online. Gascoigne, {{looking for a new}} research project and keen to use the new telescope, took up the study of globular clusters, compact groups {{of tens of thousands of}} ancient stars of similar age. With a new design of photometer, he was able to measure the exceptionally faint stars in these clusters. Gascoigne determined that the clusters in the Magellanic Clouds were both young and old, and had quite different characteristics <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the Milky Way: this information was important for modelling the evolution of galaxies.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1946, the Montreal Laboratory was {{estimated}} to have cost US$22,232,000, excluding {{the cost of the}} heavy water. The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It also provided a means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like phosphorus-32, research facilities that for a time were superior <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the United States, and a wealth of technical information related to reactor design and operation. With the passage of the Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the responsibility for the Chalk River Laboratories passed to the Atomic Energy Control Board.|$|E
5|$|Carved {{designs in}} lacquerware and designs glazed onto {{porcelain}} wares displayed intricate scenes similar in complexity <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> painting. These items {{could be found}} in the homes of the wealthy, alongside embroidered silks and wares in jade, ivory, and cloisonné. The houses of the rich were also furnished with rosewood furniture and feathery latticework. The writing materials in a scholar's private study, including elaborately carved brush holders made of stone or wood, were designed and arranged ritually to give an aesthetic appeal.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, Queen Mary instituted an {{austerity}} {{drive at}} the palace, where she rationed food, and visited wounded and dying servicemen in hospital, which caused her great emotional strain. After {{three years of}} war against Germany, and with anti-German feeling in Britain running high, the Russian Imperial Family, which had been deposed by a revolutionary government, was refused asylum, possibly {{in part because the}} Tsar's wife was German-born. News of the Tsar's abdication provided a boost <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Britain who wished to replace their own monarchy with a republic. The war ended in 1918 with the defeat of Germany and the abdication and exile of the Kaiser.|$|E

5|$|Dust {{kicked up}} by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the {{darkness}} of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly {{the sound of an}} approaching tornado, serve as any warning <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E
5|$|Flood beds {{in other}} {{locations}} upstream of Lake Lewis such as Ninemile Creek in Montana and the Sanpoil arm of glacial Lake Columbia show a corresponding regularity of flood deposits {{as well as}} deposit grading and rhythmical repetition <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Lake Lewis. Since Glacial Lake Columbia remained filled, annual deposits (varves) can be observed between flood deposits. The flood deposits can be distinguished from annually deposited varves by both their thickness {{and the presence of}} materials foreign to the immediate drainage. Atwater reports from 35 to 55 annual varves between flood deposits in Lake Columbia, supporting a period of 35 to 55 years between ice dam failures.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's heavy damage, {{homeless}} residents {{resided in}} temporary camps. Later, the Indian government set up 742relief centers housing 177,000people, utilizing schools and office buildings. However, residents did not stay {{for extended periods}} of time in the shelters, as rebuilding began within three days of the storm's landfall. Many of the displaced people returned to their homes after the storm receded. Workers restored water service and distributed potable water <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> need. Workers used cranes to remove trees from highways. Roads and communication links were quickly restored, as was the power supply. Later, damaged houses were reconstructed with tiled roofs while destroyed houses were rebuilt on concrete slabs, both to withstand stronger winds.|$|E

5|$|In 1863, two sail-driven tankers {{were built}} on England's River Tyne. These were {{followed}} in 1873 {{by the first}} oil-tank steamer, Vaderland, which was built by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company for Belgian owners. The vessel's use was curtailed by U.S. and Belgian authorities citing safety concerns. By 1871, the Pennsylvania oil fields were making limited use of oil tank barges and cylindrical railroad tank-cars similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> use today.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 a {{population}} of P.fluviatile was discovered under the ruins of Trajan's Forum {{in the heart of}} Rome, living in canals built by the Etruscans which connect to the Cloaca Maxima. Based on a genetic analysis, which demonstrated that these crabs were similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Greece, researchers believe that they had been brought by the Greeks before the founding of the city, some 3000 years ago. The crabs' unusual size, up to , and longevity (up to 15years) are also interpreted as evidence of a long-established population, by analogy with island gigantism.|$|E
