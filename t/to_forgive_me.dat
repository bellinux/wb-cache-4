500|$|With all appeal avenues {{exhausted}} and no further motivation to deny his crimes, Bundy agreed to speak frankly with investigators. To Keppel, {{he confessed to}} all eight of the Washington and Oregon homicides {{for which he was}} the prime suspect. He described three additional previously unknown victims in Washington and two in Oregon whom he declined to identify (if indeed he ever knew their identities). He said he left a fifth corpse—Donna Manson's—on Taylor Mountain, but incinerated her head in Kloepfer's fireplace. ("Of all the things I did to ," [...] he told Keppel, [...] "this is probably the one she is least likely <b>to</b> <b>forgive</b> <b>me</b> for. Poor Liz.") ...|$|E
500|$|On 28 June 1989, the 600th {{anniversary of}} the Battle of Kosovo, Đujić granted the title of vojvoda to Vojislav Šešelj, and ordered him [...] "to expel all Croats, Albanians, and other foreign {{elements}} from holy Serbian soil", stating he would return only when Serbia was cleansed of [...] "the last Jew, Albanian, and Croat". Šešelj {{was at the time}} an anti-Communist dissident and was subsequently described for his activities in the Yugoslav Wars as [...] "a man whose killer commando units operating in Croatia and Bosnia carried on the very worst of the Chetnik tradition." [...] Later Šešelj became leader of the Serbian Radical Party, a government coalition partner of Serbian President Slobodan Milosević. In 1998, Đujić publicly stated that he regretted awarding that title to Šešelj. He was quoted as saying, [...] "I was naïve when I nominated Šešelj [...] Vojvoda; I ask my people <b>to</b> <b>forgive</b> <b>me.</b> The greatest gravedigger of Serbdom is Slobodan Milošević" [...] and that he is [...] "disappointed in Šešelj for openly collaborating with Milošević's Socialist Party, with Communists who have only changed their name. [...] Šešelj has sullied the reputation of Chetniks and Serbian nationalism." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pickler's {{mother was}} {{repeatedly}} charged with writing bad checks and {{was convicted in}} 1988 for passing a forged prescription for Valium at the Albemarle Wal-Mart, where she worked. Pickler's parents split up the day after her second birthday; a year later, in July 1989, her mother vanished. During periods when her father, Bo, was incarcerated, she would live with her grandparents outside Albemarle, [...] northeast of Charlotte. In 1992, Pickler's mother returned to Albemarle, but rarely made contact with her. But in March 1995, with Bo Pickler in prison for armed robbery, her mother was granted custody. Pickler was in the fourth grade. In a February 2006 interview with The Observer, Pickler said: [...] "She got custody of me for two years... During that time, she was physically and mentally abusive of me." [...] In a 1997 court filing, Pickler's grandparents said {{that her mother had}} moved to Union County with her and treated her harshly. The court restored custody to the grandparents. Her mother vanished again, and Pickler has not heard from her since. Her father, whom she describes as an alcoholic and drug addict, served a three-year-nine-month prison sentence at Florida State Prison for aggravated assault and battery stemming from a 2003 stabbing incident. [...] He was released on May 6, 2006, a week after her elimination from Idol. In an April 2006 interview with NBC Pickler said, [...] "One thing that's so important in life is we learn to forgive others. I ask the Lord every day <b>to</b> <b>forgive</b> <b>me</b> for my sins and for things that I've done wrong. And who am I to not forgive someone for what they've done?" ..."God tells us to love everyone." ...|$|E
