40|$|Background: In 2008 the {{poisoning}} {{of about}} 12000 bee colonies was reported from Germany.

40|$|Zea mays L. is an {{important}} crop in the Midwest, and each year there is a push to plant earlier in the spring. Early planting can leave seeds and seedlings vulnerable to low temperature stress. Low temperature stress causes damage to maize seedlings.

The goal {{of this study was}} to determine if the strobilurin Stamina protects maize seedlings against mitochondrial damage due to low temperature stress. In this study, three seed treatments and two seed lots/hybrids were used. Treatments included: Stamina (binders plus active ingredients), binders only, and control (untreated) seedlings. To determine the effects of Stamina on maize respiration, seedling lengths, ADP:O ratios, respiration rates, and alternative oxidase (appendix) were measured under optimal temperature and low temperature conditions in the presence and absence of the alternative oxidase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM). Seedlings were grown in dark growth chambers at a constant 25 °C for 5 days or for 10 days at 10 °C and 4 days at 25 °C. In the optimal temperature study, seedlings from Stamina and only binders <b>treated</b> <b>seeds</b> had mesocotyl lengths that were 0. 48 cm and 0. 41 cm longer than control seeds, respectively.

Four seed lots were divided into four replications, half being treated with Carboxin + Thiran and the other half taken as controls, without treatment, and these were stored for 300 days. The germination data were transformed into probit, and a straight line was adjusted between 0 and 30 days. The <b>treated</b> <b>seed</b> lot of cv.

None of the available methods of protecting birdseed against squirrels is completely effective. We assessed the efficacy of treating birdseed with capsaicin oleoresin as a means of deterring squirrels. Consumption of treated and untreated whole, black-oil sunflower seed was compared by carrying out one-choice feeding trials at 3 sites near Ithaca, New York, from 11 May to 24 June 1999. The heat strength of the <b>treated</b> <b>seed</b> was 40, 000 Scoville Heat Units (SHUs) (2, 424 ppm) on the shell and 2, 000 SHUs (121 ppm) on the heart.

Observations of feeding behavior by squirrels, birds and Eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) were recorded throughout the 3 -hr session on 2 days per week at each site during most weeks. Untreated seed was provided in weeks 1, 2, and 4; capsaicin-treated seed was offered in weeks 3, 5, and 6. We concluded that treatment with capsaicin significantly reduced both the amount of seed taken by squirrels and the total time squirrels spent feeding.
