25|$|Spina bifida is a {{congenital}} {{disorder in}} which there is a defective closure of the vertebral arch. Sometimes the spinal meninges and also the spinal cord can protrude through <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>this</b> is called Spina bifida cystica. Where the condition does not involve this protrusion it is known as Spina bifida occulta. Sometimes all of the vertebral arches may remain incomplete.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, every bivector can {{be written}} as the sum of two simple bivectors. It is useful to choose two {{orthogonal}} bivectors for <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>this</b> is always possible to do. Moreover, for a generic bivector the choice of simple bivectors is unique, that is, {{there is only one}} way to decompose into orthogonal bivectors; the only exception is when the two orthogonal bivectors have equal magnitudes (as in the above example): in this case the decomposition is not unique. The decomposition is always unique in the case of simple bivectors, with the added bonus that one of the orthogonal parts is zero.|$|E
25|$|Profile sought {{no input}} or consent from Thorpe before doing <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>this</b> aggravated the already troubled {{relationship}} between Thorpe and Profile Records and indirectly spurred legal disagreements surrounding {{the ownership of}} the Robot Wars concept. The legal proceedings surrounding these would last until 6 February 2002. Mentorn used Thorpe as a Consultant on the series, however, and the initial series of Robot Wars in the UK was broadcast over six weeks in February and March 1998. It was an immediate hit, with more than 2 million viewers, and a further 18 episodes were commissioned by the BBC that year. 155 episodes were produced in total, and the show was seen in 26 countries. Two series were produced in the US for the TNN (now Spike) network, and a version was also shown on Nickelodeon. Series were also produced in many European countries. Although the series had various directors and producers, all were produced in the UK by Mentorn, and executive produced by Tom Gutteridge and Steve Carsey. The initial series were staged in various film studios around London but the stage and pit area became too large to fit {{into any of the}} conventional studios, so filming was later moved to an aircraft hangar at RAF Newton.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{also uses}} color and visual art {{techniques}} to convey emotional range in his {{descriptions of the}} Irati River. In Translating Modernism: Fitzgerald and Hemingway, Ronald Berman compares Hemingway's treatment of landscape {{with that of the}} post-Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne. During a 1949 interview, Hemingway told Lillian Ross that he learned from Cézanne how to [...] "make a landscape." [...] In comparing writing to painting he told her, [...] "This is {{what we try to do}} in writing, <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>this,</b> and woods, and the rocks we have to climb over." [...] The landscape is seen subjectively—the viewpoint of the observer is paramount. To Jake, landscape [...] "meant a search for a solid form.... not existentially present in [...] life in Paris." ...|$|E

500|$|The poem {{starts with}} a {{flattering}} question to the beloved—"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" [...] The beloved is [...] "more lovely and more temperate" [...] than a summer's day. The speaker lists some negative things about summer: it is short—"summer's lease hath all too short a date"—and sometimes the sun is too hot—"Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines." [...] However, the beloved has beauty that will last forever, unlike the fleeting beauty of a summer's day. By putting his love's beauty into the form of poetry, the poet is preserving it forever. [...] "So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>this</b> gives life to thee." [...] The lover's beauty will live on, through the poem which will {{last as long as}} it can be read.|$|E
500|$|Cuarón {{chose to}} shoot some scenes in East London, a {{location}} he considered [...] "a place without glamour".

In other words, we'd look at a location and then say: yes, but in Mexico there would be <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>this.</b> It was about making the place look run-down. It was about poverty." [...] He also made use of London's most popular sites, shooting in locations like Trafalgar Square and Battersea Power Station. [...] The power station scene (whose conversion into an art archive is {{a reference to the}} Tate Modern), has been compared to Antonioni's Red Desert. [...] Cuarón added a pig balloon to the scene as homage to Pink Floyd's Animals. [...] Other art works visible in this scene include Michelangelo's David, Picasso's Guernica, and Banksy's British Cops Kissing. [...] London visual effects companies Double Negative and Framestore worked directly with Cuarón from script to post production, developing [...] effects and creating [...] "environments and shots that wouldn't otherwise be possible".|$|E

2500|$|The {{writing is}} also notable for its minimal use of dialogue.

[...] Drama and all the stuff is all dialogue motivated. You {{have to figure out}} different ways to convey ideas. You don't want to overcompensate because the fear is that you're going to be boring if nothing's going on.

2500|$|Though Chamberlain {{was always}} very {{supportive}} of German imperialism, he had nothing but scorn for British imperialism, viewing Britain as the world's biggest bully, a view that he expressed more and more vehemently as the 1890s went on. In 1895, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt about the Hamidian massacres in the Ottoman Empire during 1894–96:The Armenian insurrection [...] with the inevitable retaliation of massacres and persecution (of course enormously exaggerated by those greatest liars in creation, backed by their worthy friends the English journalists) was all got up at the precise moment when English politics required a [...] "diversion". In 1896, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt:The English press is the most insufferably arrogant, generally ignorant, the most passionately one-sided and narrow-minded in its judgments that I know; it is the universal bully, always laying down the law for everybody, always speaking {{as if it were}} umpire of the universe, always abusing everybody all round and putting party spirit in all its judgments, envenoming thus the most peaceful discussions. It is <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>this</b> only which has made England hated all the world over. During the whole year 1895, I never opened an English newspaper without finding War predicated or threatened…No other nation in the world has wanted war or done anything but pray for peace-England alone, the world's bully, has been stirring it up on all sides. During the 1890s, Chamberlain was an outspoken critic of British policy in South Africa, writing to his uncle in 1898: We are the heathen nation and race par excellence. War, conquest, commerce, money and above all an eternal readiness to knock every man down who stands in our way. And the only thing thoroughly distasteful to me in England and Englishmen generally, and English politics in particular, is this eternal coquetting with a religion to which every one of their feelings and opinions and acts is in direct contradiction. At the time of the Boer War, Chamberlain supported the Boers against the British, though not publicly and he expressed much regret that two white peoples should be killing each other {{at a time when he}} believed that white supremacy around the world was being threatened by the alleged [...] "Yellow Peril". In July 1900, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt: One thing I can clearly see, that is that it is criminal for Englishmen and Dutchmen to go on murdering each other for all sorts of sophisticated reasons, while the Great Yellow Danger overshadows us white men and threatens destruction...The fact that a tiny nation of peasants absolutely untrained in the conduct of war, has been able to keep the whole united empire at bay for months, and has only been overcome-and has it been overcome?-by sending out an army superior in number to the whole population including women and children, has lowered respect for England beyond anything you can imagine on your side of the water, and will certainly not remain lost on the minds of those countless millions who have hitherto been subdued by our prestige only. Chamberlain seized upon the fact that some of the Randlords were Jewish to argue in his letters to Cosima Wagner that the war was a case of Anglo-Jewish aggression against the Germanic Afrikaners. Wagner wrote back to Chamberlain: [...] "This extermination of one of the most excellent Germanic races is so horrible that I know of nothing I have experienced which is comparable to it".|$|E
