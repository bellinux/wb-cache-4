This, Chilembwe believed, {{was the only way}} change would ever occur.|$|E
5|$|Each section, such as on {{reptiles}} at {{the start}} of Volume II (and the entire work) is introduced with an essay on distinguishing aspects of their zoology. In the case of the reptiles, the essay begins with the observation that their circulation is so arranged that only part of the blood pumped by the heart goes through the lungs; Cuvier discusses the implications of this arrangement, next observing that they have a relatively small brain compared to the mammals and birds, and <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> incubate their eggs.|$|E

5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship {{out of fear of}} violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists, so the claim <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.|$|E
5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had called in such a report.|$|E

They manage to lead the Klügs away from the reception and incapacitate them, only to find <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> has the Zephyr. Jack realizes that the Klügs have been performing a shell game: {{the government has been}} pursuing them for the Zephyr when none of them ever had it; their father (Timothy V. Murphy) had it all along. Meanwhile, the bride's father realizes he is being conned and leads Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) away at gunpoint. When Chuck and Sarah confront him, Klüg uses Morgan as a human shield, but John Casey (Adam Baldwin) takes aim at his head. However, Jack manages to talk Klüg down {{for the sake of the}} bride's happiness.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} young physicists, Rabi was closely {{following}} momentous events in Europe. He was astounded by the Stern–Gerlach experiment, which convinced {{him of the}} validity of quantum mechanics. With Ralph Kronig, Francis Bitter, Mark Zemansky and others, he set out to extend the Schrödinger equation to symmetric top molecules and find the energy states of such a mechanical system. The problem was <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> could solve the resulting equation, a second-order partial differential equation. Rabi found the answer in a book by the 19th-century mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. The equation had the form of a hypergeometric equation to which Jacobi had found a solution. Kronig and Rabi wrote up their result and sent it to Physical Review, which published it in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather in}} the area had wind up towards , with clouds and heavy rain, and some reports of turbulence. The {{aircraft}} was not equipped with ground proximity warning system, nor was this required. There was no requirement for the aircraft to have a flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), but the airline had chosen to install the latter. Interviews with the surviving passengers showed <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> perceived {{that there was any}} problems with the flight until the sudden impact. One of the passengers was a navigation professional and could see parts of the cockpit from his seat; he was thus able to confirm some of the navigational display readings. Interviews with locals indicated that the aircraft followed a normal path.|$|E

5|$|From 1936 on, several admirers {{tried unsuccessfully}} to persuade Sorabji to record Opus clavicembalisticum. Given that Sorabji had not {{recorded}} any of his works, and <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had been published since 1931, his friends and admirers began {{to be concerned about}} the fate of his output. The most ambitious attempt to ensure the preservation of his music and writings was initiated by Frank Holliday (1912–1997), who met Sorabji in 1937 and was his closest friend for about four decades. In the early 1950s Holliday organised the presentation of a letter inviting Sorabji to make recordings of his own music. Sorabji received the letter in 1953, but made no recordings then, in spite of the enclosed cheque for 121 guineas (just over £127). Holliday's perseverance and closeness to Sorabji did, however, eventually change Sorabji's attitude, and several recordings were made in Sorabji's house between 1962 and 1968. Holliday also helped with the WNCN broadcast of Sorabji's music in 1970 (which took place without Sorabji's consent). Their friendship ended in 1979 as a result of disagreements about some of Sorabji's decisions.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Commission's {{proposals}} were extensively debated. Hendrick van Kol, {{who was one}} of the leaders of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, argued that building up a strong fleet would hinder Dutch neutrality by making it impossible to avoid battle with foreign fleets which passed through NEI waters en route to other destinations. Other critics of the plan believed that it would be unwise for the Netherlands to join the naval arms race which was taking place in Europe at the time, and that competition between the major powers meant <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> would allow another nation to occupy either the Netherlands or the NEI. The Dutch Army also opposed the development of a strong fleet in the NEI, arguing that a land force centered on Java would be better able to mount a prolonged resistance against a large invasion force and that reducing the size of the Army to fund the fleet would leave it unable to suppress insurrections. The Governor-General of the NEI, Alexander Willem Frederik Idenburg, argued that both a stronger Army and Navy were necessary, and advocated for seven battleships to be stationed in the Indies. He believed that the cost of this alternative could be managed by reducing the planned battleship force in European waters to three small ships. Other supporters of the proposal, led by the Onze Vloot ("Our Fleet") naval advocacy association, argued that it was necessary to build a strong fleet which was capable of defending the NEI as the loss of the colonial empire would greatly damage the Dutch economy and reduce the country's prestige. The Dutch Naval staff also debated the relative merits of torpedo boats and battleships, and concluded that while small craft and submarines were suitable for defending the Netherlands, large warships were needed to effectively protect the sprawling East Indies.|$|E
5|$|Throughout this, Idelba {{has been}} {{secretly}} working on atomic physics {{and she and}} her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that {{it would be possible to}} make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions and fear that the military will try to create such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts concerned scientists in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to get hold of her papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss the nuclear issue. The meeting is held in Isfahan in Iran (one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war) and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> will work on the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship (they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference).|$|E
