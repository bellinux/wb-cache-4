5|$|Thrombolysis is enzymatic {{destruction}} of blood clots. This {{is achieved by}} the administration of a drug (such as urokinase or alteplase) that activates plasmin, an enzyme that occurs naturally {{in the body and}} digests clots when activated. Thrombolysis is an accepted treatment for heart attacks and stroke unrelated to dissection. In cervical artery dissection, only small case series are available. The <b>thrombolytic</b> drug is administered either intravenously or during cerebral angiography through a catheter directly into the affected artery. The data indicates that thrombolysis is safe, but its place in the treatment of VAD is uncertain.|$|E

25|$|Urokinase is used {{clinically}} as a <b>thrombolytic</b> {{agent in}} the treatment of severe or massive deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and occluded intravenous or dialysis cannulas. It is also administered intrapleurally to improve the drainage of complicated pleural effusions and empyemas. Urokinase is marketed as Abbokinase or Kinlytic and competes with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (e.g., alteplase) as a <b>thrombolytic</b> drug in infarction. However, urokinase is not very selective for clot-bound plasminogen, unlike tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) which preferentially interacts with clot-bound plasminogen. Because urokinase binds about equally to freely circulating plasminogen and clot-bound plasminogen, it causes significant fibrinogenolysis and clot fibrinolysis making its use less favorable than TPA.|$|E

25|$|Thrombolysis is the {{pharmacological}} {{destruction of}} blood clots by administering <b>thrombolytic</b> drugs including recombitant tissue plasminogen activator, which enhances the normal destruction of blood clots by the body's enzymes.

25|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (heart attack) {{occurs in}} 1–2% of aortic dissections. The {{cause of the}} infarction is involvement of the coronary arteries, which supply the heart, in the dissection. The right coronary artery is involved more commonly than the left coronary artery. If the myocardial infarction is treated with <b>thrombolytic</b> therapy, the mortality increases to over 70%, mostly due to bleeding into the pericardial sac causing pericardial tamponade.|$|E

25|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) {{or heart}} attack, {{is caused by}} ischemia, (restriction in the blood supply), often due to the obstruction of a coronary artery by a thrombus. This restriction gives an insufficient supply of oxygen to the heart muscle which then results in tissue death,(infarction). A lesion is then formed which is the infarct. MI can quickly become fatal if emergency medical treatment is not received promptly. If diagnosed within 12 hours of the initial episode (attack) then <b>thrombolytic</b> therapy is initiated.|$|E
25|$|It is {{relatively}} unusual (25% {{of the total}} number of cases) for cholesterol emboli to occur spontaneously; this usually happens in people with severe atherosclerosis of the large arteries such as the aorta. In the other 75% it is a complication of medical procedures involving the blood vessels, such as vascular surgery or angiography. In coronary catheterization, for instance, the incidence is 1.4%. Furthermore, cholesterol embolism may develop after the commencement of anticoagulants or <b>thrombolytic</b> medication that decrease blood clotting or dissolve blood clots, respectively. They probably lead to cholesterol emboli by removing blood clots that cover up a damaged atherosclerotic plaque; cholesterol-rich debris can then enter the bloodsteam.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Thrombolytic</b> {{therapy to}} abort a {{myocardial}} infarction {{is not always}} effective. [...] The degree of effectiveness of a <b>thrombolytic</b> agent {{is dependent on the}} time since the myocardial infarction began, with the best results occurring if the <b>thrombolytic</b> is used within two hours of the onset of symptoms. Failure rates of thrombolytics can be as high as 50%. In cases of failure of the <b>thrombolytic</b> agent to open the infarct-related coronary artery, the person is then either treated conservatively with anticoagulants and allowed to [...] "complete the infarction" [...] or percutaneous coronary intervention (and coronary angioplasty) is then performed. [...] Percutaneous coronary intervention in this setting is known as [...] "rescue PCI" [...] or [...] "salvage PCI". Complications, particularly bleeding, are significantly higher with rescue PCI than with primary PCI due to the action of the <b>thrombolytic.</b>|$|E
40|$|Primary {{angioplasty}} {{is considered}} the best reperfusion therapy {{in the treatment of}} ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, thrombolysis is the reperfusion method most commonly used, due to its wide availability, reduced costs and ease of administration. Aim: To compare in-hospital mortality in STEMI patients according to reperfusion therapy. Material and Methods: Patients admitted to Chilean hospitals participating in the GEMI network, from 2001 to 2005, with STEMI were included. They were divided in three groups: a) treated with <b>thrombolytics,</b> b) treated with primary angioplasty, c) without reperfusion procedure. In-hospital mortality according to gender, was analized in each group, using a logistic regression method, to assess risk factors associated with mortality. Results: We included 3, 255 patients. Global mortality was 9. 9 % (7. 5 % in men and 16. 7 % in women, p < 0. 001). Mortality in patients treated with <b>thrombolytics,</b> was 10. 2 % (7. 6 % in men and 18. 7 % in women, p < 0. 01). The figure for patients treated with primary angioplasty, was 4. 7 % (2. 5 % in men and 13 % in women, p < 0. 01), and in patients without reperfusion, was 11. 6 % (9. 8 % in men and in 15. 4 % women, p < 0. 01). In each group women were older, had a higher prevalence of hypertension and a higher percentage of Killip 3 - 4 infarctions. Logistic regression showed that angioplasty, compared with no reperfusion, was associated with a reduced mortality only in men. The use of <b>thrombolytics</b> in women was associated with a higher mortality. Conclusions: Primary angioplasty was the reperfusion therapy associated to the lower mortality in STEMI.

25|$|If an MI is {{presented}} with ECG {{evidence of an}} ST elevation known as STEMI, or if a bundle branch block is similarly presented, then reperfusion therapy is necessary. In {{the absence of an}} ST elevation, a non-ST elevation MI, known as an NSTEMI, or an unstable angina may be presumed (both of these are indistinguishable on initial evaluation of symptoms). ST elevations indicate a completely blocked artery needing immediate reperfusion. In NSTEMI the blood flow is present but limited by stenosis. In NSTEMI the same <b>thrombolytics</b> are used as for STEMI, but they are also often stabilised with antiplatelets and anticoagulants. If the condition stays stable a cardiac stress test may be offered, and if needed subsequent revascularization will be carried out to restore a normal blood flow. If the blood flow becomes unstable an urgent angioplasty may be required. In these unstable cases the use of <b>thrombolytics</b> is contraindicated.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Little {{is known}} about the {{efficacy}} of proton pump inhibitors compared with H 2 receptor antagonists in preventing adverse upper gastrointestinal complications in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) receiving aspirin, clopidogrel, and enoxaparin or <b>thrombolytics.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the efficacies of esomeprazole and famotidine in preventing gastrointestinal complications. Methods: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was performed in patients receiving a combination of aspirin, clopidogrel, and either enoxaparin or <b>thrombolytics.</b> Patients received either esomeprazole (20 mg nocte) or famotidine (40 mg nocte) orally for 4 - 52 weeks, depending on the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary end point was upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), perforation, or obstruction from ulcer/erosion ([URL] NCT 00683111). Results: In all, 311 patients were recruited, with 163 and 148 patients in the esomeprazole and famotidine groups, respectively. Mean (s. d.) follow-up was 19. 2 (17. 6) and 17. 6 (18. 0) weeks, respectively. One (0. 6 %) patient in the esomeprazole group and 9 (6. 1 %) in the famotidine group reached the primary end point (log-rank test, P= 0. 0052, hazard ratio 0. 095, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 005 - 0. 504); all had upper GIB. Conclusions: In patients with ACS or STEMI, esomeprazole is superior to famotidine in preventing upper gastrointestinal complications related to aspirin, clopidogrel, and enoxaparin or <b>thrombolytics.</b> © 2012 by the American College of Gastroenterology. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
