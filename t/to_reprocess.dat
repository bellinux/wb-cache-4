25|$|Japanese {{policy is}} <b>to</b> <b>reprocess</b> its spent nuclear fuel. Originally spent fuel was {{reprocessed}} under contract in England and France, {{but then the}} Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant was built, with operations originally expected to commence in 2007. The policy to use recovered plutonium as mixed oxide (MOX) reactor fuel was questioned on economic grounds, and in 2004 it was revealed the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry had covered up a 1994 report indicating reprocessing spent fuel would cost {{four times as much}} as burying it.|$|E
25|$|At {{one end of}} the {{spectrum}} is mixed waste collection, in which all recyclates are collected mixed in {{with the rest of the}} waste, and the desired material is then sorted out and cleaned at a central sorting facility. This results in a large amount of recyclable waste, paper especially, being too soiled <b>to</b> <b>reprocess,</b> but has advantages as well: the city need not pay for a separate collection of recyclates and no public education is needed. Any changes to which materials are recyclable is easy to accommodate as all sorting happens in a central location.|$|E
5|$|Finland, the United States and Sweden are {{the most}} {{advanced}} in developing a deep repository for high-level radioactive waste disposal.

25|$|Removal of fission {{products}} is similar <b>to</b> <b>reprocessing</b> of solid fuel elements - by chemical or physical means the highly valuable fissile fuel {{is separated from}} the waste {{fission products}}. Ideally the fertile fuel (thorium or U-238) and other fuel components (e.g. carrier salt or fuel cladding in solid fuels) can also be reused for new fuel.

25|$|There {{has been}} {{concern that the}} Sellafield area will become a major dumping ground for {{unwanted}} nuclear material, since there are currently no long-term facilities for storing High-Level Waste (HLW), although the UK has current contracts <b>to</b> <b>reprocess</b> spent fuel {{from all over the}} world. Contracts agreed since 1976 between BNFL and overseas customers require that all HLW be returned to the country of origin. The UK retains low- and intermediate-level waste resulting from its reprocessing activity, and instead ships out a radiologically equivalent amount of its own HLW. This substitution policy is intended to be environmentally neutral and to speed return of overseas material by reducing the number of shipments required, since HLW is far less bulky.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} reprocessing plant {{was built to}} extract the plutonium from spent fuel to provide fissile material for the UK's atomic weapons programme, and for exchange with the United States through the US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement. It operated from 1951 until 1964, with an annual capacity of 300 tonnes (295 L/T) of fuel, or 750 tonnes (738 L/T) of low burn-up fuel. It was first used <b>to</b> <b>reprocess</b> fuel from the Windscale Piles, and was later repurposed to process fuel from UK Magnox reactors, however following the commissioning of the dedicated Magnox Reprocessing Plant, it was itself recycled to become a pre-handling plant to allow oxide fuel to be reprocessed in the Magnox plant, and was closed in 1973.|$|E
25|$|In October 1976, {{concern of}} nuclear weapons {{proliferation}} (especially after India demonstrated nuclear weapons capabilities using reprocessing technology) led President Gerald Ford to issue a Presidential directive to indefinitely suspend the commercial reprocessing and recycling of plutonium in the U.S. On 7 April 1977, President Jimmy Carter banned the reprocessing of commercial reactor spent nuclear fuel. The key issue driving this policy was the risk {{of nuclear weapons}} proliferation by diversion of plutonium from the civilian fuel cycle, and to encourage other nations to follow the USA lead. After that, only countries that already had large investments in reprocessing infrastructure continued <b>to</b> <b>reprocess</b> spent nuclear fuel. President Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, but did not provide the substantial subsidy {{that would have been}} necessary to start up commercial reprocessing.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{different strategies}} for the conversion of VVER- 1000 reactors <b>to</b> <b>reprocessed</b> uranium fuel for estimating {{the time required to}} form a proliferation-resistant VVER- 1000 fuel load based on uranium extracted from spent fuel of reactors of the same type cleared of minor actinides and fission products. It has been shown that the change in the proliferation resistance status of generated plutonium in the VVER- 1000 spent nuclear fuel is achieved by denaturation of plutonium through the increase in the concentration of 238 Pu plutonium isotope in irradiated fuel. The initial presence of 236 U uranium isotope in fresh uranium fuel of the VVER- 1000 reactor has been shown to {{have an effect on the}} accumulation of 238 Pu, a key isotope in the context of the barrier against unauthorized proliferation. Saving of uranium resources has been additionally analyzed for the considered strategies to convert VVER- 1000 reactors <b>to</b> <b>reprocessed</b> uranium fuel for the purpose of improving the resource base of NPPs in Russia and recipient countries...|$|R

500|$|In the Orb's early DJ {{events in}} the 1980s, Paterson and Cauty {{performed}} with three record decks, a cassette player, and a CD player {{all of which were}} mixed through an Akai 12-track mixer. They used their equipment to harmonise recorded music and sound effect samples into an [...] "endless sound continuum" [...] for audiences of worn out dancers. Even after the Orb began producing original material, they kept the same sample-heavy model for live acts by spontaneously integrating obscure samples into their pre-recorded tracks. During promotional tours for Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld and U.F.Orb, they performed using a digital audio tape machine and experimented with other media sources such as dubplates. The tape machines held individual chords, rhythms, and basslines for each composition, allowing the Orb <b>to</b> <b>reprocess</b> them and mimic the act of DJ-ing. Members could then easily improvise with these samples and manipulate them using sound effect racks. Often, the Orb had a live musician accompanying them, such as Steve Hillage on guitar. Their shows in the early 1990s would often be three hours of semi-improvised, continuous music featuring a wealth of triggered samples, voices, and pre-recorded tracks which were barely identifiable as the original piece.|$|E

Under consideration were age of the SNF prior <b>to</b> <b>reprocessing,</b> plutonium and minor actinide (MA) separation from the spent fuel for recycle, fuel value of the recycled Pu and MA, age of the remaining spent fuel waste prior to emplacement in the repository, length of time that active ventilation is employed in the repository, and elemental concentration and heat limits for acceptable glass waste form durability. A secondary objective was to identify and qualitatively analyze remaining issues such as (a) impacts of aging SNF prior <b>to</b> <b>reprocessing</b> on the fuel value of the recovered fissile materials, and (b) impact of reprocessing on the dose risk as developed in the Yucca Mountain Total System Performance Assessment (TSPA).

2500|$|With Challenger, an O-ring {{that should}} not have eroded at all did erode on earlier shuttle launches. Yet {{managers}} felt that because it had previously eroded {{by no more than}} 30%, this was not a hazard as there was [...] "a factor of three safety margin". Morton-Thiokol designed and manufactured the SRBs, and during a pre-launch conference call with NASA, Roger Boisjoly, the Thiokol engineer most experienced with the O-rings, pleaded with management repeatedly to cancel or reschedule the launch. He raised concerns that the unusually low temperatures would stiffen the O-rings, preventing a complete seal during flexing of the rocket motor segments, which was exactly what happened on the fatal flight. However, Thiokol's senior managers, under pressure from NASA management, overruled him and allowed the launch to proceed. One week prior to the launch, Thiokol's contract <b>to</b> <b>reprocess</b> the solid rocket boosters was also due for review, and cancelling the flight was an action that Thiokol management wanted to avoid.
