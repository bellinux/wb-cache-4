He was also {{selected}} to the Sporting News NL All-Star team, the fourth Dodger pitcher to be named to the team twice (after Koufax, Valenzuela and Don Newcombe). On November 13, he won the NL Cy Young Award {{for the second time}} in three seasons. He became just the sixth pitcher in history to finish in the top two in voting three seasons in a row.|$|E
5|$|Kinsler {{joined the}} 30–30 club, for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> became the 12th player {{in major league}} history to have {{multiple}} 30–30 seasons. The only other infielders in major league history who had had multiple 30–30 seasons as of 2011 were Alfonso Soriano, Howard Johnson, and Jeff Bagwell. He also joined the 20 (home runs)/20 (steals) club {{for the third time}} in his career. Joe Morgan, who did it four seasons, is the only second baseman to have joined the 20–20 club more times.|$|E
50|$|Frehley’s “Rock and Roll Hell” marks <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>he’s</b> {{covered a}} {{cut from a}} Kiss LP he wasn’t {{involved}} with. In 1989, he recorded a version of “Hide Your Heart,” a song co-written by Kiss co-founder Paul Stanley with professional songwriter Holly Knight, unaware that it was tabbed as the first single from the band’s Hot in the Shade LP.|$|R

5|$|After {{a year in}} San Diego, Washington {{was traded}} again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton had missed the entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert and Randy Smith to Portland in {{exchange}} for the center. This became <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> had been traded along with Kunnert. The center signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money. There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.|$|E
5|$|At 15:30 the two battalions of the Turkish 77th Infantry Regiment were in position, {{and with}} the 27th Infantry they counter-attacked again. At 15:30 and at 16:45 McCay, now under severe pressure, {{requested}} reinforcements. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> was informed {{there was only one}} uninvolved battalion left, the 4th, and Bridges was keeping them in reserve until more troops from the New Zealand and Australian Division had been landed. McCay then spoke to Bridges direct and informed him the situation was desperate and if not reinforced the Turks would get behind him. At 17:00 Bridges released the 4th Battalion to McCay who sent them to the south forming on the left of the 8th Battalion along Bolton's Ridge. They arrived just in time to help counter Turkish probing attacks, by the 27th Infantry Regiment, from the south.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{was unable}} to afford {{university}} tuition, Truman had thought of going to the costless United States Military Academy at West Point, but he was refused an appointment because of poor eyesight. He enlisted in the Missouri Army National Guard in 1905, serving until 1911 in a Kansas City-based artillery battery and attaining the rank of corporal. At his induction, his eyesight had been an unacceptable 20/50 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left (past the standard for legal blindness). <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> took the test, he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart.|$|E

His 11 singles titles were the most of any player in two decades, and his record of 74–6 was the best since Ivan Lendl in 1986. He reached the year-end world No. 1 ranking for the first time.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time, the Italian Grand Prix {{was held at}} the Livorno Circuit rather than the {{traditional}} venue of Monza. Caracciola took pole position, and despite two false starts caused by spectators pouring onto the track, held his lead {{for the majority of the}} race and won from his teammate Lang by just 0.4seconds. In doing so Caracciola clinched the European Championship for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> backed up the win with another at the Masaryk Grand Prix two weeks later. He trailed Rosemeyer for much of the race until the Auto Union skidded against a kerb and allowed the Mercedes into the lead.|$|E
5|$|He {{successfully}} {{ran for the}} Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1998, {{representing the}} 9th Norfolk District for three terms. Brown again moved up the ladder of state politics to the state Senate in March 2004 when he won a special election to replace Democrat Cheryl Jacques. Brown was re-elected for a full term in November 2004, and again in November 2006, running without opposition <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> won re-election in November 2008, defeating Democratic candidate Sara Orozco by a 59–41 percent margin.

50|$|Rabin became prime {{minister}} for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> when <b>he</b> led Labour {{to victory in}} the 1992 elections. After his assassination on 4 November 1995, Peres took over as {{prime minister}}.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, {{after leaving}} Cincinnati, Jackson was an NFL {{offensive}} coordinator for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> when <b>he</b> served {{in that capacity}} for the Atlanta Falcons under Bobby Petrino and Emmitt Thomas (Interim).|$|R
5|$|His next {{event was}} the China Open in Beijing, where Murray reached the quarterfinals, losing to Ivan Ljubičić. Murray then won the Shanghai Rolex Masters dismissing Roger Federer in {{straight}} sets. He did not drop a single set throughout the event.

The victory was Murray's first doubles title and <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> had reached a final with his brother.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 Solti {{was invited}} to become music {{director}} of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Bearcats' offense {{came through}} the air, however. Cincinnati quarterback Tony Pike {{finished}} the game having completed 16 of his 33 pass attempts, resulting in 239 passing yards, 1 touchdown, and 4 interceptions. Pike also ran the ball five times for four yards. Pike's four interceptions were a career-high and marked only <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> threw more than one interception in a game. For Virginia Tech, quarterback Tyrod Taylor finished the game with 13 completions from 22 pass attempts, resulting in 140 passing yards and 1 interception. In addition to his passing, Taylor ran with the ball 15 times, gaining 47 {{yards and a touchdown}} in the process.|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{fought for}} the final time in 1965. He lost via {{unanimous}} decision to Joey Archer. Famed sports author Pete Hamill mentioned {{that one of the}} saddest experiences of his life was watching Robinson lose to Archer. He was even knocked down and Hamill pointed out that Archer had no knockout punch at all; Archer admitted afterward that it was only <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> had knocked an opponent down in his career. The crowd of 9,023 at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh gave Robinson several standing ovations, even while he was being thoroughly outperformed by Archer.|$|E
5|$|Usain Bolt also {{competed in}} the men's 200meters race. Although he participated in the men's 100meters and the men's 4 × 100meters relay in {{addition}} to the 200meters, this race {{was the only one in}} which he had competed at the Olympics for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>time</b> (<b>he</b> previously raced in the 200meters in Athens). During the August 17 qualification round, Bolt {{competed in the}} fifth heat. He ran the race in 20.64seconds, placing second out of the nine athletes in his heat. Rondel Sorrillo of Trinidad and Tobago placed ahead of him (20.58seconds), while Belgium's Kristof Beyens placed behind him (20.69seconds). Out of 62 finishing athletes, Bolt tied Poland's Marcin Jedrusinski for 17th place. He advanced to the next round.|$|E
