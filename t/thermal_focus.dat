40|$|A {{computational}} model utilizing grid and finite difference methods {{were developed to}} simulate focused ultrasound functional neurosurgery interventions. The model couples the propagation of ultrasound in fluids (soft tissues) and solids (skull) with acoustic and visco-elastic wave equations. The {{computational model}} was applied to simulate clinical focused ultrasound functional neurosurgery treatments performed in patients suffering from therapy resistant chronic neuropathic pain. Datasets of five patients were used to derive the treatment geometry. Eight sonications performed in the treatments were then simulated with the developed model. Computations were performed by driving the simulated phased array ultrasound transducer with the acoustic parameters used in the treatments. Resulting focal temperatures {{and size of the}} thermal foci were compared quantitatively, in addition to qualitative inspection of the simulated pressure and temperature fields. This study found that the computational model and the simulation parameters predicted an average of 24 ± 13 % lower focal temperature elevations than observed in the treatments. The size of the simulated <b>thermal</b> <b>focus</b> was found to be 40 ± 13 % smaller in the anterior–posterior direction and 22 ± 14 % smaller in the inferior–superior direction than in the treatments. The location of the simulated <b>thermal</b> <b>focus</b> was off from the prescribed target by 0. 3 ± 0. 1 [*]mm, while the peak focal temperature elevation observed in the measurements was off by 1. 6 ± 0. 6 [*]mm. Although the results of the simulations suggest that there could be some inaccuracies in either the tissue parameters used, or in the simulation methods, the simulations were able to predict the focal spot locations and temperature elevations adequately for initial treatment planning performed to assess, for example, the feasibility of sonication. The accuracy of the simulations could be improved if more precise ultrasound tissue properties (especially of the skull bone) could be obtained...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{occurrence}} of focus shift in high power fiber laser welding has been reported. The {{small percentage of}} laser light absorbed in the optical elements of the welding head leads to a <b>thermal</b> <b>focus</b> shift. Contaminations on the optical surfaces are enhancing the absorption and thus the focus shift. Thus, {{one of the main}} influencing factors on focus shift is the condition of the optics of the head. The topic of this paper is the experimental characterization of focus shift behavior, {{and the development of a}} novel method to measure the shift of the focal plane during processing. This method allows for considering the shift caused by every optical element within the path of the beam. The online focus shift measurement is the missing part for a closed loop focus shift control during high power fiber laser welding...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Noninvasive {{electromagnetic}} hyperthermia, used {{in combination}} with radio-therapy or chemotherapy, is a promising technique {{in the treatment of}} large, deep-lying tumours. One of the major difficulties in effective implementation, however, is that the spatial distribution of electric fields within the patient is strongly influenced by tissue morphology and dielectric properties, and is therefore difficult to model. Even when desired heating profiles are achieved experimentally, the specific absorption rate at the focus generally does not reach its theoretical maximum value since the E-fields are not completely coherent. In this article, a new method, phase interference mapping, is developed to address this latter problem and is demonstrated in phantoms. The complete process for optimizing spatial and temporal control of electromagnetic heating has three separate steps. The first involves phase calibration of the individual dipoles of a phased array applicator with a noninvasive E-field probe placed {{on the surface of the}} phantom. In the second step, an iterative feedback method is used to rapidly steer the <b>thermal</b> <b>focus</b> as close as possible to the desired location. Noninvasive mapping of the temperature and specific absorption rate is realized by magnetic resonance imaging. The final step in the process consists of phase interference mapping of the dipoles, to maximize E-field coherence.

40|$|A {{review is}} {{presented}} of phenomena involving <b>thermal</b> <b>focusing</b> and optical bistability {{arising from the}} temperature dependence of the refractive index in ferroelectrics. Aperiodic spatio-temporal oscillations have been observed in the light transmitted and reflected by parallel-sided crystal and ceramic samples of the thermo-optic ferroelectrics PMN (lead magnesium niobate, Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3), PLZT (lanthanum doped lead zirconium titanate, Pb(Zr 1 -xTix) O 3 :La), BNN (barium sodium niobate, Ba 2 NaNb 5 O 15) and Ce:SBN (cerium doped strontium barium niobate, Ce 3 +:Srx Ba 1 -xNb 2 O 6) under steady illumination by an incident c. w. laser beam of finite beamwidth. Such materials focus the incident beam due to the temperature dependence of the refractive index {{and the establishment of}} a radial temperature gradient. The shape of the resulting thermal lens varies in time as a result of variation in the absorbed energy arising from both <b>thermal</b> <b>focusing</b> and optical bistability (Fabry-Pérot resonance). Whereas PMN and PLZT exhibit relaxation oscillations, the beam oscillations produced by BNN and Ce:SBN have equal rise and fall times. We compare the predictions of theoretical models with experimental results for ferroelectric ceramics and crystals. The principal conclusions from the present work are that (1) there are two distinct mechanisms for aperiodic oscillation in dispersively nonlinear plates, viz., focusing oscillations and Fabry-Pérot switching oscillations, of which only the latter involves bistability; (2) in Fabry-Pérot etalons with a diffusive nonlinearity, as contrasted with the systems (e. g. laser tubes) originally described by Gordon et al, the diffusive quantity (i. e. temperature) can exhibit bistable and multistable switching behaviour, leading to regenerative oscillations in other variables (e. g. light output); (3) there are two characteristic relaxation times involved in these oscillations, differing by several orders of magnitude; (4) the spatio-temporal characteristics of the transmitted beam patterns in the near and far fields can be quantitatively predicted and (5) comparison between theory and experiment can provide information on the temperature dependence of conductivity and thermo-optic coefficient near the ferroelectric phase transition...|$|R

For {{high power}} and {{repetitive}} Nd:Glass laser, there would appear serious thermal effect {{due to the}} significantly-enhanced pumping optical power density in laser rod, which would induce thermal double refraction, phase distortion, <b>thermal</b> <b>focusing,</b> <b>thermal</b> depolarization, etc. Thus, the laser output power and beam quality would be influenced severely. Influence of thermal lens effect and depolarization effect caused by thermal stress double refraction on laser beam were studied in this paper for high power and repetitive laser. In the experiment of thermal lens effect, change of the laser spot by thermal lens effect was recorded after a TEM 00 He-Ne laser beam passing through the Nd:Glass rod pumped by Xe lamp, and the corresponding optical compensator was applied to eliminate the thermal lens effect to improve the beam quality. Configuration of polarizer was designed in our experiment to research the depolarization effect caused by thermal stress double refraction. First, emergent light distribution and loss factor caused by double refraction was calculated according to the theoretical model.

Global warming (with ∆T ~ 10 K) of the ESI plume is reported while the size of the droplet decreases along the plume.
