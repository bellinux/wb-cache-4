We subsequently compared locally gathered species richness data <b>to</b> estimates <b>gathered</b> <b>by</b> trained biologists. Our results provide further evidence that devolved monitoring protocols can provide similar data <b>to</b> that <b>gathered</b> <b>by</b> scientists. In addition, our results show that local inhabitants can effectively pass on learned information to other community members, which is particularly important for the longevity of community-based monitoring initiatives...|$|R
