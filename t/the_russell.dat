5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Russell</b> Family is {{a fictional}} family who {{appeared}} on American soap opera Passions, which aired on NBC (1999–2007) {{and later on}} DirecTV (2007–08).

Russell, and their children, Whitney and Simone Russell. The Russells are one of the four core families in the fictional town of Harmony, and are characterized by their friendship with the Bennetts and Lopez-Fitzgeralds and their feud with the Cranes. As the series progressed, four more characters were added to the family: Eve's vengeful, adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne; Eve's child with Julian Crane, Vincent Clarkson; Whitney's husband and Liz's son, Chad Harris-Crane; and Eve's aunt Irma Johnson. Most of the characters left during the show's transition from NBC to DirecTV, leaving Eve and Vincent as the only representatives of <b>the</b> <b>Russell</b> family in the series finale.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the American Kennel Club {{explored}} {{the possibility of}} recognising <b>the</b> Jack <b>Russell</b> terrier.
