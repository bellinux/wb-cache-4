40|$|Preliminary {{shielding}} calculations {{were performed}} for a prototype National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program (NSNFP) <b>transport</b> <b>cask.</b> This analysis {{is intended for}} use in the selection of cask shield material type and preliminary estimate of shielding thickness. The radiation source term was modeled as cobalt- 60 with radiation exposure strength of 100, 000 R/hr. Cobalt- 60 was chosen as a surrogate source because it simultaneous emits two high-energy gammas, 1. 17 MeV and 1. 33 MeV. This gamma spectrum is considered to be large enough that it will upper bound the spectra of all the various spent nuclear fuels types currently expected to be shipped within the prototype cask. Point-kernel shielding calculations were performed {{for a wide range of}} shielding thickness of lead and depleted uranium material. The computational results were compared to three shielding limits: 200 mrem/hr dose rate limit at the cask surface, 50 mR/hr exposure rate limit at one meter from the cask surface, and 10 mrem/hr limit dose rate at two meters from the cask surface. The results obtained in this study indicated that a shielding thickness of 13 cm is required for depleted uranium and 21 cm for lead in order to satisfy all three shielding requirements without taking credit for stainless steel liners. The system analysis also indicated that required shielding thicknesses are strongly dependent upon the gamma energy spectrum from the radiation source term. This later finding means that shielding material thickness, and hence cask weight, can be significantly reduced if the radiation source term can be shown to have a softer, lower energy, gamma energy spectrum than that due to cobalt- 60...|$|E
