40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{manganese}} content and additions of aluminum, silicon, and possibly other alloying elements, <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels</b> possess a stacking fault energy that favors twinning as the predominant deformation mechanism together with ordinary dislocation gliding [1]. Among all common deformation and/or transformation processes, twinning has the most beneficial effect on the strain hardening rate of austenitic <b>steels.</b> <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels</b> start to yield at relatively low stress levels but exhibit moderate-to-high tensile strengths combined with extremely high total elongations, making the steels very suitable for forming applications while still leaving good strength and energy absorption potential to the manufactured parts. Because of these properties, <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels</b> have become very attractive especially for the automotive industry, where increasing safety requirements {{and the need for}} weight reduction of the car body are motivating the search for new structural materials. At the same time, good formability allows considerable cost reductions during the manufacturing process. Besides the chemical composition, also temperature affects the stacking fault energy, and therefore a change in the governing deformation process occurs with the changing deformation temperature of <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels.</b> At very low temperatures, a change from the twinning transformation process to partial martensitic phase transformation can be observed, while at high temperatures, dislocation glide becomes the dominant (and sole) deformation mechanism. At the same time, strain hardening and deformation mechanisms in <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels</b> usually depend also on strain rate, which is an important aspect for the automotive safety.

Although <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels</b> are optimal candidates for structural automobile components, their implementation {{is still in its infancy}} owing to the limited understanding of the physical mechanisms of these materials. In order to contribute to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that determine the deformation and annealing behavior of <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels,</b> the microstructure and texture evolution was analyzed and correlated with each other in the current work. Three <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels</b> with low Stacking Fault Energy (SFE) values (25 mJ/m 2 - 29 mJ/m 2) were subjected to cold rolling and Equal-Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) for analysis of the deformation behavior. In addition to changing the strain path, the SFE was also changed by increasing the deformation temperature during ECAP. Both the cold-rolled and the ECAP-deformed specimens were then heat treated in order to investigate the annealing behavior. The respective deformation and annealing microstructures were also correlated with the mechanical behavior of these alloys. The microstructures and textures were characterized experimentally by means of optical microscopy, SEM/EBSD, TEM, and X-ray diffraction, whereas the mechanical properties were analyzed using uniaxial and multi-axial deformation techniques. Furthermore, computer simulations in terms of the Crystal Plasticity Finite Element Method (CP-FEM), Visco-Plastic Self-Consistent (VPSC), and Cellular Automaton (CA) model were used to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that determine the behavior of <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels.</b> During cold rolling in the range between 10 % and 80 % thickness reduction the deformation texture transformed from a Copper-type texture with the dominant Cu, S, and Brass texture components at low deformation degrees (10 %- 20 %) over a transition stage (30 %- 50 %) to a Brass-type texture that was dominated by the Brass, Goss, CuT, and S texture components and by an additional γ-fiber (60 %- 80 %). By contrast, the deformation by ECAP at 300 °C for 1, 2, and 4 passes following route BC caused a strongly different microstructure due to the high imposed shear strain and due to the increased SFE resulting from the increased deformation temperature. As a consequence of less pronounced deformation twinning, a transition texture was formed during ECAP. Subsequent annealing of the cold-rolled and ECAP-deformed <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels</b> led to recovery and discontinuous recrystallization. The texture after recrystallization was found to be a weak retained deformation texture that formed due to oriented nucleation and recrystallization twinning. In order to analyze the influence of microstructure heterogeneities, such as heterogeneously distributed dislocation and nuclei densities, experimentally supported and coupled CP-FEM and CA simulations were performed. Based on the necessity for yield strength enhancement of <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels,</b> a processing route consisting of cold rolling and recovery annealing was suggested and applied to two of the <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels.</b> In order to understand the material behavior during this processing scheme, a correlation between the mechanical properties, the processes occurring during heat treatment, and the specific features of the microstructure after cold rolling and annealing was established. Furthermore, texture analysis was introduced as a new reliable method to determine the optimal cold rolling and annealing parameters for this processing approach.

40|$|International audienceStrong {{incompatibility}} stresses {{may develop}} at grain or twin boundaries because of elastic and plastic anisotropies. Their knowledge at Σ 3 twin boundaries {{may be of}} interest for {{a better understanding of}} the mechanical behaviour of f. c. c. materials that can display lamellar twin structures such as <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels</b> or general nanotwinned materials. In this paper, incompatibility stresses arising at general twin boundaries are explicitly derived for a given twin volume fraction. They are deduced from the solutions of the general infinite bicrystal, which is equivalent to a periodic layered structure. In the case of pure elasticity and Σ 3 twin boundaries, the result is of remarkable simplicity. The incompatibility stress field reduces to a shear stress acting upon a plane orthogonal to twin plane. Simple analytical expressions of the resolved shear stresses are also determined according to the twin boundary orientation, the twin volume fraction and the elastic anisotropy factor. Such expressions allow performing a comprehensive study of slip initiation. In particular, there exists a large physical domain, depending on the three above parameters, where simultaneous slip parallel to twin plane in the parent and in the twin is greatly promoted. There is also a restricted domain where simultaneous single slip parallel to twin plane is promoted. The conditions for these promotions are realistic considering the literature data on <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels.</b> The present results hence support the high ductility and strong contribution of kinematic hardening observed in <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels</b> and agree with composite hardening models with single and multislip deforming grains...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Austenitic high-Mn (15 – 30 wt. %) based twinning-induced {{plasticity}} (<b>TWIP)</b> <b>steels</b> provide {{great potential}} in applications for structural {{components in the}} automotive industry, owing to their excellent tensile strength-ductility property combination. In certain cases, these steels might also substitute austenitic Cr-Ni stainless steels. The aim of this present work is to investigate the high-temperature flow resistance, recrystallisation {{and the evolution of}} microstructure of high-Mn steels by compression testing on a Gleeble simulator. The influence of Al alloying (0 – 8 wt. %) in the hot rolling temperature range (800 °C– 1100 °C) is studied in particular, but also some observations are made regarding the influence of Cr alloying. Microstructures are examined in optical and electron microscopes. The results are compared with corresponding properties of carbon and austenitic stainless steels. In addition, the mechanical properties are studied briefly, using tension tests over the temperature range from - 80 °C to 200 °C. Finally, a preliminary study is conducted on the corrosion behaviour of <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels</b> in two media, using the potentiodynamic polarization technique. The results show that the flow stress level of high-Mn <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels</b> is considerably higher than that of low-carbon steels and depends on the Al concentration up to 6 wt. %, while the structure is fully austenitic at hot rolling temperatures. At higher Al contents, the flow stress level is reduced, due to the presence of ferrite. The static recrystallisation kinetics is slower compared to that of carbon steels, but it is faster than is typical of Nb-microalloyed or austenitic stainless steels. The high Mn content is one reason for high flow stress as well as for slow softening. Al plays a minor role only; {{but in the case of}} austenitic-ferritic structure, the softening of the ferrite phase occurs very rapidly, contributing to overall faster softening. The high Mn content also retards considerably the onset of dynamic recrystallisation, but the influence of Al is minor. Similarly, the contribution of Cr to the hot deformation resistance and static and dynamic recrystallisation, is insignificant. The grain size effectively becomes refined by the dynamic and static recrystallisation processes. The tensile testing of <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels</b> revealed that the Al alloying and temperature have drastic effects on the yield strength, tensile strength and elongation. The higher Al raises the yield strength because of the solid solution strengthening. However, Al tends to increase the stacking fault energy that affects strongly the deformation mechanism. In small concentrations, Al suppresses martensite formation and enhances deformation twinning, leading to high tensile strength and good ductility. However, with an increasing temperature, SFE increases, and consequently, the density of deformation twins decreases and mechanical properties are impaired. Corrosion testing indicated that Al alloying improves the corrosion resistance of high-Mn <b>TWIP</b> <b>steels.</b> The addition of Cr is a further benefit for the passivation of these steels. The passive film that formed on 8 wt. % Al- 6 wt. %Cr steel was found to be even more stable than that on Type 304 steel in 5 – 50 % HNO 3 solutions. A prolonged pre-treatment of the steel in the anodic passive regime created a thick, protective and stable passive film that enhanced the corrosion resistance also in 3. 5 % NaCl solution...|$|R
