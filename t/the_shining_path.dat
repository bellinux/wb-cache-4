The presumed link between <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> and narcotics trafficking was unclear, because the coca farmers gave most of their crops to drug traffickers who then paid <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> to operate within certain regions.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that in Peru, throughout the 12 year internal conflict, women were frequent victims of sustained war rape perpetrated by government security forces and <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path.</b> It has also been reported that during the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, an estimated 5,000 Kuwaiti women were raped by Iraqi soldiers.|$|E

5000|$|The next day, the BBC {{released}} {{an interview with}} [...] "Comrade Artemio," [...] identified as Florindo Eleuterio Flores-Hala.

5000|$|Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path's</b> {{war against}} <b>the</b> Peruvian state faltered, and Abimael Guzmán {{and several other}} {{high-ranking}} <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> members were captured in Lima in 1992. On September 10, 2002, Abimael Guzmán told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission [...] "We, doctors, reiterate {{that we will not}} avoid our responsibility the Lucanamarca massacre. I have mine, I'm the first one responsible, and I will never renounce my responsibility, that wouldn't make any sense." ...|$|R
25|$|In his {{military}} career, Humala was {{also involved in}} the two major Peruvian conflicts of the past 20 years, the battle against the insurgent organization Shining Path and the 1995 Cenepa War with Ecuador. In 1992 Humala served in Tingo María fighting the remnants of <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> and in 1995 {{he served in the}} Cenepa War on the border with Ecuador.|$|E
25|$|In late 2001, the Directorate against Terrorism {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path,</b> a terrorist movement {{which has been}} active since the eighties, was organizing along new fronts and infiltrating protests, blocking highways, and organizing student marches. The government reacted by reestablishing five counterinsurgency bases, which soon assisted in destroying six Shining Path camps. But terrorist activity continued and in 2003, Toledo declared {{the first of several}} states of emergency due to the terrorist threat.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1960s and the 1970s, {{paramilitary}} {{extremist groups}} such as the Red Army Faction in Germany, the Japanese Red Army and <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> Maoist movement in Peru used red as their color. But in the 1980s, some European socialist and social democratic parties, such as the Labour Party in Britain and the Socialist Party in France, moved away from the symbolism of the far left, keeping the red color but changing their symbol to a less-threatening red rose.|$|E
25|$|The La Cantuta massacre, {{in which}} a {{university}} professor and nine students from Lima's La Cantuta University were abducted by a military death squad, took place in Peru on 18 July 1992 during the presidency of Alberto Fujimori. The incident occurred two days after <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path's</b> Tarata bombing left over 40 dead in Lima Province.|$|R

25|$|The son of Isaac Humala, a labour lawyer, Humala {{entered the}} Peruvian Army in 1981. In the {{military}} he achieved {{the rank of}} Lieutenant Colonel; in 1991 he fought in the internal conflict against <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> and three years later he participated in the Cenepa War against Ecuador. In October 2000, Humala attempted an unsuccessful coup d'etat by soldiers in {{the southern city of}} Tacna against President Alberto Fujimori; he was pardoned by the Peruvian Congress after the downfall of the Fujimori regime.|$|E
25|$|Insurgent {{activity}} was in decline {{by the end}} of 1992, and Fujimori took credit for this abatment, claiming that his campaign had largely eliminated the insurgent threat. After the 1992 auto-coup, the intelligence work of the DINCOTE (National Counter-Terrorism Directorate) led to the capture of the leaders from MRTA and <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path,</b> including notorious Shining Path leader Abimael Guzmán. Guzmán's capture was a political coup for Fujimori, who used it to great effect in the press; in an interview with documentarian Ellen Perry, Fujimori even notes that he specially ordered Guzmán's prison jumpsuit to be white with black stripes, to enhance the image of his capture in the media.|$|E
25|$|The most densely {{populated}} districts {{lie in the}} northern and southern ends of the city (Spanish: Cono Norte and Cono Sur, respectively) and they are mostly composed of Andean immigrants who arrived during the mid- and late- 20th century looking for a better life and economic opportunity, or as refugees of the country's internal conflict with <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the case of Cono Norte (now called Lima Norte), shopping malls such as Megaplaza and Royal Plaza were built in the Independencia district, on the border with the Los Olivos district (the most residential neighborhood in the northern part). Most inhabitants are middle or lower middle class.|$|E
50|$|On September 26, 2006, a news {{crew from}} the {{television}} show Panorama interviewed Artemio in a jungle base established by <b>Shining</b> <b>Path.</b> They also filmed about 50 <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> militants, {{all of whom were}} masked. Artemio demanded that the Peruvian government grant amnesty to imprisoned <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> members and open a peace dialogue with <b>the</b> remaining <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> members. Days after the report, the National Police raided the site where Artemio gave <b>the</b> interview. Some <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> members were arrested, but Artemio was not. In November, 2007, police claimed to have killed Artemio's second-in-command, a guerrilla known as JL.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{testimony}} of <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> militants {{interviewed by the}} Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, <b>the</b> twelfth <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> detachment in Lima, commanded by [...] "Comrade Daniel" [...] (later identified as Carlos Mora La Madrid in the Commission's records), was responsible for conducting the attack.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2004, a {{man known}} as Comrade Artemio and {{identifying}} himself {{as one of}} <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path's</b> leaders, said in a media interview that the group would resume violent operations unless the Peruvian government granted amnesty to other top <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> leaders within 60 days. Peru's Interior Minister, Fernando Rospigliosi, said {{that the government would}} respond [...] "drastically and swiftly" [...] to any violent action. In September that same year, a comprehensive sweep by police in five cities found 17 suspected members. According to the interior minister, eight of the arrested were school teachers and high-level school administrators.|$|R
25|$|García faced {{his first}} major {{political}} defeat of his second term in office on January 11, 2007 when his proposal to introduce the death penalty as a punishment for captured Shining Path rebels was rejected by Congress in a vote of 49 to 26. García had promised to introduce {{the death penalty for}} Shining Path rebels during the 2006 Presidential election. Following the defeat of the proposal, García suggested a national referendum on the issue but it was blocked by Congress. Legislators who voted against the bill stated {{that it would be a}} breach of the American Convention on Human Rights to which Peru is a signatory. Approximately 3000 supporters of the proposal marched in Lima holding up photos of victims of attacks by <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, {{which had}} been {{implemented}} by interim president Paniagua, was tasked with examining largescale acts of violence and atrocities committed within Peru between 1980 and 2000, to assess responsibility and {{pave the way for}} reparations. The Commission's final report to President Toledo was issued in 2003, and concluded that approximately 69,000 people had been killed by <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> and other extremist groups, the bulk of the victims being innocent peasants. In January of that year, the Constitutional Court repealed several anti-terrorism measures enacted during Fujimori's administration. It was estimated that 54% of these victims were killed by the extremist guerrilla group Shining Path, 30% by the Peruvian Military and police forces, and the rest were by rural or peasant self-defense militias. These investigations were financed by a portion of the US$360million discovered in foreign accounts {{which had been}} stolen by Fujimori officials. Toledo wasted no time in pursuing suspected terrorists, arresting 199 of them in 2002 alone.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} turbulence exacerbated social {{tensions in}} Peru and contributed {{in part to}} the rise of the violent rebel movement known as <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path,</b> which launched the internal conflict in Peru and began attacking electrical towers, causing a number of blackouts in Lima. The García administration unsuccessfully sought a military solution to the growing terrorism, allegedly committing human rights violations, which are still under investigation. These include the Accomarca massacre, where 47 campesinos were gunned down by Peruvian armed forces in August 1985, the Cayara massacre (May 1988) in which some thirty people were killed and dozens disappeared, and the summary execution of more than 200 inmates during prison riots in Lurigancho, San Juan Bautista (El Frontón) and Santa Bárbara in 1986. According to an official inquiry, an estimated 1,600 forced disappearances took place during García's presidency. His own personal involvement in these events is not clear. García was allegedly tied to the paramilitary Rodrigo Franco Command, which is accused of carrying out political murders in Peru during García's presidency. A U.S. declassified report, written in late 1987, said that García's party, APRA, and top government officials were running a paramilitary group, responsible for the attempted bombing of the El Diario newspaper, then linked to Shining Path, had sent people to train in North Korea and may have been involved in executions. According to investigative journalist Lucy Komisar, the report made it clear that it believed García had given the orders.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{charge that}} to achieve <b>the</b> defeat of <b>Shining</b> <b>Path,</b> <b>the</b> Peruvian {{military}} engaged in widespread human rights abuses, {{and that the}} majority of the victims were poor highland countryside inhabitants caught in a crossfire between the military and insurgents. The final report of the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, published on 28 August 2003, brought out that Peruvian armed forces were also guilty of destroying villages and murdering countryside inhabitants whom they suspected of supporting insurgents. The majority of the atrocities committed between 1980 and 1995 however were indeed <b>the</b> work of <b>Shining</b> <b>Path.</b>|$|R
50|$|María Elena Moyano Delgado (29 November 1958 - February 15, 1992) was a Peruvian {{community}} organizer and activist of Afro-Peruvian descent who was assassinated by <b>the</b> Maoist <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> (Sendero Luminoso) Terrorist group.

500|$|Gagnon began {{rebuilding}} {{the mission and}} it was complete in 1988. [...] In June 1989 members of <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> arrived at the mission and demanded supplies. Gagnon's mission paid a tax to them of writing supplies during this period. In November 1989, <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> once again assaulted the mission and burned the buildings. [...] while Gagnon was in the United States. Two mission leaders and two schoolteachers {{were killed by the}} guerillas, and a war broke out between the people at Cutivireni and <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> fighters. Gagnon returned to Peru, staying in Satipo and attempting to visit on December 26. Warned not to land, he dropped Christmas presents and salt from the plane. There continued to be casualties on both sides.|$|E
500|$|In September 1990, {{the village}} {{that they had}} built of houses in the remote {{location}} was surrounded and attacked by guerillas of <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> while Gagnon was in Lima strategizing with others on ways to protect the indigenous people from being killed, enslaved, or indoctrinated. [...] The Asháninka escaped, but <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> captured their village. Gagnon arranged for 213 Asháninka {{to be taken to}} a Dominican mission in Urubamba. He arranged 20 airlifts to transport the refugees approximately 150 miles to safety. On September 22, 1990, after the Asháninka were safe with the Dominicans, Gagnon left the indigenous people and his mission.|$|E
500|$|In 1980 the Communist Party of Peru, {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path,</b> {{launched}} an insurgency {{against the government}} of Peru. This conflict followed Maoist tactics of guerrilla warfare. In 1983, Gagnon met {{with members of the}} Peruvian government to let them know about the difficulties in Cutivireni. While he was meeting with authorities in Lima, members of <b>the</b> <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> burned down the mission and threatened that they would kill him if he came back in May 1984. [...] The Franciscans who were working with the Asháninka did not have a coordinated strategy to provide for their defense, but Gagnon was able to secure weapons from the Peruvian army, and approached the United States military for support as well.|$|E

50|$|On September 12, 1992, Peruvian police {{captured}} Guzmán {{and several}} <b>Shining</b> <b>Path</b> leaders {{in an apartment}} above a dance studio in the Surquillo district of Lima.
