25|$|In food production, {{the goal}} is not to simply change the {{configuration}} of double bonds while maintaining the same ratios of hydrogen to carbon.

This changes the consistency of the fatty acid and makes it less prone to rancidity (in which free radicals attack double bonds). Production of <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> is therefore an undesirable side effect of partial hydrogenation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Fatty</b> <b>acid</b> {{measurements}} especially <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> {{has gained}} interest in recent times. Among the various available biomarkers, adipose tissue {{is considered to}} be the best for the long term dietary intake but the invasive nature of tissue aspiration reduces its utility. Phlebotomy is a much less invasive method of sample collection when a large number of participants are involved in the study and therefore is an alternative, most suitable for large population based studies. In the present study <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (with special emphasis on <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid)</b> extraction from blood spotted and dried on filter paper was carried out to simplify the sample collection procedure and transportation. Methods Blood samples were collected from 19 healthy volunteers. The blood was spotted (30 spots of 10 μl each) on filter paper, dried at room temperature and stored at 4 °C in zip-lock poly bags. For comparison whole blood stored at - 70 °C was simultaneously analyzed. Results A good agreement was seen between <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> values obtained in dried blood and whole blood as evident from the pearson correlation coefficients ('r' for monounsaturated (trans) 0. 70 and for polyunsaturated (trans) 0. 692 respectively).

2500|$|Hydrogenated {{vegetable}} oils differ in two major ways from other oils which are equally saturated.

This makes the resulting fat more brittle than a tropical oil; soy margarines are less [...] "spreadable" [...] The other difference is that <b>trans</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (often called trans fat) are formed in the hydrogenation reactor, and may amount to as much as 40 percent by weight of a partially hydrogenated oil.

2500|$|The use of {{hydrogenated}} oils {{in foods}} {{has never been}} completely satisfactory.
