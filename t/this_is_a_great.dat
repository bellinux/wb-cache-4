25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some that {{this is perhaps the}} most interesting of all the series events, including the race itself. In this event there are heats of 5–8 riders, depending on the number of riders signed up for the day. These heats are seeded according to the results of each rider's ITT. Riders are placed along the starting line in order from fastest (on the inside) to slowest (on the outside) and are then given one lap to get the position they want in the pack and to gain some speed. Once they cross the start/finish line again, the race begins. The riders race around the track and every time the pack crosses the start/finish line, the last one to cross is out and must leave the track. Riders keep racing until there are only three riders left. These three riders {{move on to the next}} round. This process continues until the final heat of 8. In this heat, riders continue to race and get out until you have the last three and then they commence a one lap full out sprint and the first, second, and third-place winners are determined by the order in which the riders cross the start/finish line. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> event because it really measures the skill of a rider, because in order to win, a rider must be more than just fast. If a rider hopes to win, she must also have good drafting skills, the ability to find good positioning, the intuition to know when to get out of the pack and sprint around the outside, and the endurance to be able to do this all day.|$|E
25|$|One {{case study}} with coral reef {{restoration}} {{was conducted on}} the island of Oahu in Hawaii. The University of Hawaii {{has come up with a}} Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program to help relocate and restore coral reefs in Hawaii. A boat channel on the island of Oahu to the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology was overcrowded with coral reefs. Also, many areas of coral reef patches in the channel had been damaged from past dredging in the channel. Dredging covers the existing corals with sand, and their larvae cannot build and thrive on sand; they can only build on to existing reefs. Because of this, the University of Hawaii decided to relocate some of the coral reef to a different transplant site. They transplanted them with the help of the United States Army divers, to a relocation site relatively close to the channel. They observed very little, if any, damage occurred to any of the colonies while they were being transported, and no mortality of coral reefs has been observed on the new transplant site, but they will be continuing to monitor the new transplant site to see how potential environmental impacts (i.e. ocean acidification) will harm the overall reef mortality rate. While trying to attach the coral to the new transplant site, they found the coral placed on hard rock is growing considerably well, and coral was even growing on the wires that attached the transplant corals to the transplant site. This gives new hope to future research on coral reef transplant sites. As a result of this coral restoration project, no environmental effects were seen from the transplantation process, no recreational activities were decreased, and no scenic areas were affected by the project. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> example that coral transplantation and restoration can work and thrive under the right conditions, which means there may be hope for other damaged coral reefs.|$|E

[...] allows one to envelop body parts and even inanimate forms with a force akin to an invisible armor that possesses defensive and offensive properties.

(If a person is not gifted, then no matter how much they train they {{will never be able to}} use it). The Color of the Conquering King enables one to overpower the will of the weak-willed. It can be used to mind-control or even render the victim unconscious. Note that strong willed people can withstand, or even completely ignore, the effects of this Haki, even if they do not possess this ability themselves. This Haki can also have physical impacts, such as causing tremors and destruction to the user's surrounding area. It is shown that when it is used too much Haki will stop working for certain periods of time.|$|E

[...] It hinted that using a joystick for control may make certain sections of the game [...] "less annoying to play." [...] Amiga Computing gave it the Gamer Gold award, calling the game [...] "excellent", [...] "down-right bloody enchanting" [...] and Core Design's [...] "easily greatest and most impressive game yet," [...] and even advising to [...] "buy it today because if you don't you will more than likely commit suicide, it's that good." [...] Tony Gill of CU Amiga gave the game the CU Gold Screen award and said that while [...] "some of the puzzles are a bit illogical, the further into the game you get the more luxurious it becomes.

[...] Les Ellis of Amiga Power said {{it was one of}} funniest games he has ever played and called it [...] "a classic adventure, which with a few tweaks could have easily beaten the Monkey Island [...] and a worthy addition to any collection and will stand as a challenge to any adventurer." [...] According to Amiga Power one year later, [...] "with such a high degree of humour this adventure is {{well on its way to}} becoming a classic.

Although he found the game too easy [...] "even at the toughest difficulty level", he found {{this to be a}} minor issue that did not detract from the experience. He considered the game's online play to be a high point, and he finished, [...] "Destruction Derby is a blast, and a welcome change of pace from high-end driving simulations." [...] Peter Olafson of Computer Gaming World called the game [...] "a great simulation" [...] of demolition derbies, and he wrote that the wrecks are [...] "convulsive and realistic". He believed that the game [...] "has never-before-seen quality that will instantly make it a showpiece game to demonstrate to open-mouthed friends and relatives", and he considered the car damage to be [...] "especially marvelous—and unprecedented for this sort of game". However, he found that its [...] "useful life span is surprisingly short" [...] and he hoped for a track editor in its sequel. He summarised, [...] "Despite its limitations, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> game, but it has a lot more potential." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation remarked that while the game is a straight port of the PlayStation version, it is an impeccably accurate one.
