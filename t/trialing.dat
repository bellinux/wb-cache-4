5|$|The route {{was noted}} {{to appeal to}} many types of riders, be they climbers, sprinters, or time trialists. The race had seven flat stages which figured into end in mass sprints, and the hilly mixed stages were {{inviting}} for breakaways. Sastre, {{one of the first}} riders to announce he would ride the Giro, commented that the route was much harder than that of the 2009 Giro, and would demand a very strong climber to be its champion. Zomegnan concurred that the route favored climbers, noting that the distance spent time <b>trialing</b> was not great and that it would take errors from climbing specialists to allow a rider better suited for time <b>trialing</b> to be Giro champion.|$|E

25|$|A {{new version}} of the Zero, which served with the Japanese Naval units, was causing great concern, and {{battered}} examples were retrieved from the Buna-Gona area of New Guinea in January 1943. Field inspections gave some answers, but comparative rebuilding and <b>trialing</b> of it against Allied fighters, engaging in combat exercises, was needed. This aircraft was eventually named the Hamp (originally Hap after US Army Air Force Chief of Staff General Hap Arnold) and later named Zeke 32 when it was found to be a variant of Zeke 21, a Mitsubishi A6M3, Naval Type O Model 32 fighter. Australian ground forces were the first to come upon the new Zeke 32 when they occupied Buna airstrip on New Guinea in January 1943.|$|E
5000|$|Studies often compare blocked {{and mixed}} visual search <b>trials</b> to measure intertrial priming. Blocked <b>trials</b> are multiple, {{successively}} presented visual search <b>trials</b> {{that include the}} same target, and mixed <b>trials</b> are a randomised series of <b>trials,</b> each <b>trial</b> consisting of different targets. For example, a blocked <b>trial</b> condition may include searching for a green circle in <b>trial</b> 1, and in multiple successive preceding <b>trials,</b> whereas a mixed <b>trial</b> condition may include searching a for a green circle in <b>trial</b> 1, but a red circle in the proceeding <b>trials.</b> Blocking <b>trials</b> can control for effects of variability in targets. When a target with the same defining feature is repeated across <b>trials</b> (blocked conditions), participants reaction times are faster than when the target {{is not the same}} across <b>trials</b> (mixed conditions). [...] This repetition effect is also cumulative. As the number of target repetitions increases, up to a certain point, participants reaction times are faster each time they are exposed to the same target in repeated <b>trials.</b> [...] In mixed and blocked <b>trials</b> there can be a disparity in intertrial priming that results in faster reaction times in the blocked <b>trials.</b> Reaction times may be faster in blocked <b>trials</b> because participants are required to respond to targets that differ in only one dimension from non-targets.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trials</b> {{consists}} of three portions — <b>Trial</b> of Attack, <b>Trial</b> of Defense, and Endless <b>Trials.</b> All of the portions are round-based battles. <b>Trial</b> of Attack rewards score according to how well a player can chain the attacks. <b>Trial</b> of Defense rewards score according to how well a player guard attacks and counterattacks. Endless <b>Trials</b> essentially combine both of the above <b>trials</b> and endless stages much like survival mode.|$|R

500|$|Most of {{the first}} [...] "day attack" [...] AV-8B Harrier IIs were {{upgraded}} to Night Attack Harrier or Harrier II Plus standards, with the remainder being withdrawn from service. The AV-8B cockpit was also used for the early <b>trialing</b> of Direct Voice Input (DVI), which allows the pilot to use voice commands to issue instructions to the aircraft, using a system developed by Smiths Industries. The main attack avionics system in original aircraft was the nose-mounted Hughes AN/ASB-19 angle-rate bombing system. The system combined a TV imager and laser tracker to provide a highly accurate targeting capability. Defensive equipment include several AN/ALE-39 chaff-flare dispensers, an AN/ALR-67 radar warning receiver, and an AN/ALQ-126C jammer pod.|$|E
500|$|Fignon {{had won the}} Tour twice before, in 1983 and 1984, and was a {{very capable}} time trialist. It seemed {{improbable}} that LeMond could take 50 seconds off Fignon over the short course. This would require LeMond to gain two seconds per kilometer {{against one of the}} fastest chrono-specialists in the world. LeMond had done wind tunnel testing in the off season and perfected his riding position. He rode the time trial with a [...] rear disc wheel, a cut-down Giro aero helmet and the same Scott clip-on aero bars which had helped him to the Stage 5 time trial win. Holding his time <b>trialing</b> position LeMond was able to generate less aerodynamic drag than Fignon, who used a pair of disc wheels but chose to go helmetless and did not use the aero bars that are now commonplace in time trials. Instructing his support car not to give him his split times, LeMond rode flat-out and finished at a record pace to beat Fignon by 8 seconds and claim his second Tour de France victory. As LeMond embraced his wife and rejoiced on the Champs-Élysées, Fignon collapsed onto the tarmac, then sat in shock and wept.|$|E

40|$|Background: There is {{a paucity}} of {{clinical}} <b>trials</b> informing specific questions faced by infectious diseases (ID) specialists. The ClinicalTrials. gov registry offers an opportunity to evaluate the ID clinical <b>trials</b> portfolio. Methods: We examined 40, 970 interventional <b>trials</b> registered with ClinicalTrials. gov from 2007 – 2010, focusing on study conditions and interventions to identify ID-related <b>trials.</b> Relevance to ID was manually confirmed for each programmatically identified <b>trial,</b> yielding 3570 ID <b>trials</b> and 37, 400 non-ID <b>trials</b> for analysis. Results: The number of ID <b>trials</b> {{was similar to the}} number of <b>trials</b> identified as belonging to cardiovascular medicine (n = 3437) or mental health (n = 3695) specialties. Slightly over half of ID <b>trials</b> were treatment-oriented <b>trials</b> (53 %, vs. 77 % for non-ID <b>trials)</b> followed by prevention (38 %, vs. 8 % in non-ID <b>trials).</b> ID <b>trials</b> tended to be larger than those of other specialties, with a median enrollment of 125 subjects (interquartile range [IQR], 45 – 400) vs. 60 (IQR, 30 – 160) for non-ID <b>trials.</b> Most ID studies are randomized (73 %) but nonblinded (56 %). Industry was the funding source in 51 % of ID <b>trials</b> vs. 10 % that were primarily NIH-funded. HIV-AIDS <b>trials</b> constitute the largest subset of ID <b>trials</b> (n = 815 [23 %]), followed by influenza vaccine (n = 375 [11 %]), and hepatitis C (n = 339 [9 %]) <b>trials.</b> Relative to U. S. and global mortality rates, HIV-AIDS and hepatitis C virus <b>trials</b> are over-represented, whereas lower respiratory tract infection <b>trials</b> are under-represented in this large sample of ID clinical <b>trials...</b>|$|R
