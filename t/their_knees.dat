5|$|In 1911–12, Lehman {{played for}} the New Westminster Royals of the newly founded Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He played three seasons for New Westminster, winning the league {{championship}} in his first season. In 1914–15, Lehman joined the Vancouver Millionaires of the PCHA. In his first season with the Millionaires, Lehman posted a 14–3 record, with a 4.08goals-against average, which {{was a very good}} average in an era when goaltenders were not allowed to drop on <b>their</b> <b>knees</b> to make a save. In the Stanley Cup playoffs, Lehman helped the Millionaires become the first PCHA team to win the Stanley Cup, with a 3–0 record and 2.67goals against average. This would be the only Stanley Cup victory of Lehman's career, as he was on the losing side in seven other attempts. The Millionaires squad consisted of seven future members of the Hockey Hall of Fame when they won the Cup: Lehman, Frank Nighbor, Cyclone Taylor, Si Griffis, Barney Stanley, Frank Patrick, and Mickey MacKay.|$|E
5|$|Small {{pieces of}} gold foil {{featuring}} engravings dating from the Migration Period into the early Viking Age (known as gullgubber) have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia, almost 2,500 at one location. The foil pieces have been found largely at sites of buildings, only rarely in graves. The figures are sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes {{a man and a}} woman with a leafy bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with <b>their</b> <b>knees</b> bent. Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are partaking in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings, as well as linked to the Vanir group of gods, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál; the coming together of Gerðr and Freyr.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Expert opinion {{recommends}} cushioned {{and supportive}} footwear {{for people with}} knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, {{little is known about}} the footwear advice people receive from healthcare professionals, or the beliefs and footwear habits of people with knee OA. This study aimed to determine i) what types of shoes people are advised to wear for <b>their</b> <b>knee</b> OA and by whom; ii) establish which types of shoes people with knee OA believe are best for managing <b>their</b> <b>knee</b> OA symptoms and (iii) which shoes they wear most often. METHODS: 204 people with symptomatic knee OA completed an online survey. The survey comprised 14 questions asking what footwear advice people had received for <b>their</b> <b>knee</b> OA and who they received it from, individual beliefs about optimal footwear styles for <b>their</b> <b>knee</b> OA symptoms and the types of footwear usually worn. RESULTS: Only one third (n[*]=[*] 69, 34 %) of participants reported receiving footwear advice for <b>their</b> <b>knee</b> OA, and this was most frequently received from a podiatrist (n[*]=[*] 47, 68 %). The most common advice was to wear sturdy/supportive shoes (n[*]=[*] 96, 47 %) or shoes with arch supports (n[*]=[*] 84, 41 %). These were also amongst the shoe styles that participants believed were best for <b>their</b> <b>knee</b> OA (n[*]=[*] 157 (77 %) and n[*]=[*] 138 (68 %) respectively). The type of shoes most frequently worn were athletic (n[*]=[*] 131, 64 %) and sturdy/supportive shoes (n[*]=[*] 116, 57 %). CONCLUSIONS: Most people with knee OA who completed our survey had not received advice about footwear for <b>their</b> <b>knee</b> OA symptoms. Our participants typically believed that sturdy/supportive shoes were best for <b>their</b> <b>knee</b> OA and this shoe style was most frequently worn, which is reflective of expert opinion. Future research is needed to confirm whether sturdy/supportive shoes are indeed optimal for managing symptoms of knee OA. Open Acces...|$|R

5|$|The Russian army withdrew {{and retreated}} past Moscow. Napoleon entered the city, {{assuming}} its fall {{would end the}} war and Alexander would negotiate peace. However, on orders of the city's governor Feodor Rostopchin, rather than capitulation, Moscow was burned. After five weeks, Napoleon and his army left. In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the Malet coup of 1812. His army walked through snow up to <b>their</b> <b>knees</b> and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death {{on the night of}} 8/9 November alone. After the Battle of Berezina Napoleon managed to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train. On 5 December, shortly before arriving in Vilnius, Napoleon left the army in a sledge.|$|E
5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto <b>their</b> <b>knees</b> and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E

Elector Joachim I Nestor renewed his protest, and when the Pomeranian dukes received their flags from the emperor, he stepped forward and {{put his hands on}} each of them. This formalized procedure was thence repeated at every new investiture.|$|E
50|$|The use of knee sleeves in unequipped powerlifting {{has brought}} about much debate as to whether certain {{neoprene}} knee sleeves can actually assist a lifter during the squat.

This led to the IPF mandating that lifters put on <b>their</b> <b>knee</b> sleeves unassisted.|$|R

Scorpions, pseudoscorpions and some harvestmen have evolved muscles that extend two leg joints (the femur-patella and patella-tibia joints) at once.

25|$|The Gelflings were {{designed}} and sculpted by Wendy Midener. They {{were difficult to}} perform, as {{they were meant to}} be the most human creatures in the film, and thus their movements, particularly their gait, had to be as realistic as possible. During scenes when the Gelflings' legs were off-camera, the performers walked on <b>their</b> <b>knees</b> {{in order to make the}} character's movements more lifelike. According to Odell, the character Jen was Henson's way of projecting himself into the film. Jen was originally meant to be blue, in homage to the Hindu deity Rama, but this idea was scrapped early on.|$|E
25|$|With {{the passage}} of time, the temples fell into disuse and {{eventually}} became covered by sand. By the 6th century BC, the sand already covered the statues of the main temple up to <b>their</b> <b>knees.</b> The temple was forgotten until 1813, when Swiss orientalist Jean-Louis Burckhardt found the top frieze of the main temple. Burckhardt talked about his discovery with Italian explorer Giovanni Belzoni, who travelled to the site, {{but was unable to}} dig out an entry to the temple. Belzoni returned in 1817, this time succeeding in his attempt to enter the complex. A detailed early description of the temples, together with contemporaneous line drawings, can be found in Edward William Lane's Description of Egypt (1825–1828).|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus, with its Baroque nature {{emphasised}} by the zigzag form of its stairways, influenced many other sites in Portugal (like Lamego) and colonial Brazil, like the Sanctuary of Congonhas. As the pilgrims climbed the stairs, (by tradition encouraged to do so on <b>their</b> <b>knees)</b> they encountered a theological programme that contrasted the senses of the material world with {{the virtues of the}} spirit, {{at the same time as}} they experienced the scenes of the Passion of Christ. The culmination of the effort was the temple of God, the church on the top of the hill. The presence of several fountains along the stairways give the idea of purification of the faithful.|$|E
