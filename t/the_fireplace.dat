5|$|Alone in her {{assigned}} room, Annabelle examines a note {{slipped to}} her which reveals {{the location of}} the family jewels, fashioned into an elaborate necklace. She follows the note's instructions and soon discovers the hiding place, in a secret panel above <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> She retires for the night, wearing the diamond-encrusted necklace and begins to toss and turn.|$|E
25|$|The present {{floor and}} <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces</b> are from <b>the</b> {{rebuilding}} in 1924-38.|$|R

5|$|Inside, {{the main}} room is a conference room {{on the main floor}} that {{includes}} a large projection system {{that can be used for}} remote feeds, such as from the state capitol across the street. A painting by John Fery is displayed over <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> which <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> was part of the original structure in the conference room. The remainder of the interior of the building has a modern look with glass-enclosed offices surrounding an open common area. Artwork owned by the university's Hallie Ford Museum of Art is displayed in this area. The main floor of the three-story building is the second floor, which rests atop the look-out basement. A small meeting room is located above a small portion of the main floor.|$|E
5|$|The largest room on {{the first}} floor is the Withdrawing Room, {{situated}} above the Great Hall. It has an elaborate plaster ceiling, and the overmantel above <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> bears the arms of Queen Elizabeth I. The frieze of the Withdrawing Room incorporates shields of arms representing marriages of the Davenports.|$|E
5|$|The most {{remarkable}} {{room in the}} suite is the Mazarin Room. This drawing room is lined with Italian gilded and painted polychrome boiseries by craftsmen brought to France by Cardinal Mazarin, who was related by marriage to the Grimaldi. Cardinal Mazarin's portrait hangs above <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b>|$|E
50|$|Inside, the {{original}} layout is almost intact. Much of {{the original}} trim remains, including <b>the</b> marble <b>fireplace</b> mantel in each room. One of <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces</b> has a coal stove attached. Many {{of the original}} light fixtures remain, hanging from plaster medallions in the ceilings.|$|R
5000|$|The tiles that {{surround}} <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces</b> and cover <b>the</b> solarium floor {{were designed by}} the Ernest Batchelder Tile Company.|$|R
50|$|Little {{remains of}} the {{original}} interior except <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces.</b> <b>The</b> ground floor has been converted into kitchen, dining, sitting, music and bathrooms and the first floor into bedrooms, around a wide open two-level gallery connected by a new central staircase.|$|R
5|$|Her father {{found her}} {{correspondence}} and sifted through it, burning letters and photographs in <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> At 5:10 pm {{he called the}} Halstead Funeral Home, who contacted the police. The police arrived at 5:30 pm, accompanied by the deputy coroner. At {{the time of her}} death she was under surveillance by the FBI, and her phone had been tapped, so {{one of the first people}} informed about it was FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, via a teletype link. The news of her death was reported in Bay Area newspapers.|$|E
5|$|In the present, {{the events}} of the episode never occurred, and Walter, having time to {{contemplate}} the letter to Peter instead of being called to the case, tosses it into <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> Later, he receives an envelope in the mail—the one Alistair had prepared and instructed to be delivered to Walter on this specific date. Inside, Walter finds a drawing of a white tulip.|$|E
5|$|Once {{they are}} all assembled, the Simpson family sit down to Thanksgiving dinner. When Lisa places the {{centerpiece}} on the table, she argues with Bart about where it should go {{since there is no}} room left for the turkey. In the ensuing fight, Bart accidentally throws the centerpiece into <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> and it burns up. Devastated, Lisa runs to her room crying, while Bart is sent to his room by his parents for causing the incident.|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} {{has some}} original paneling and trim, particular around <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces</b> in <b>the</b> main block. Most {{of the other}} trim is from the Colonial Revival restoration in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|The upper {{walls are}} covered in arts and craft tiles by William De Morgan, and <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces</b> have {{surrounds}} of tiles created by Walter Crane, an early example of Art Nouveau.|$|R
5|$|The {{conversion}} to be a dovecote took place around 1780. Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically kept for their eggs, flesh, and dung. Although {{it is now}} a roofless ruin with some of the windows blocked up, it previously had a chimney and <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> can still be seen. The National Trust acquired the freehold from Sir Henry Hugh Arthur Hoare of the Hoare baronets, whose family seat was at Stourhead, in 1915. The tower was subsequently designated as a scheduled monument in 1953 and a listed building (Grade II*) in 1961.|$|E
5|$|The dining room, on {{the other}} hand, saw {{extensive}} remodeling in 1895. The room size was increased by {{the construction of a}} bay window, parquet floor was installed, and the room was decorated in cherry woodwork, with a gilt and crystal chandelier and sconces. The only original item remaining left in the room was <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> mantel. The Pink Room, named for the pink damask which covered the walls in 1895, the library, the Best Chamber (Daisy Grubb's bedroom), was also extensively remodeled.|$|E
5|$|The spiral {{staircase}} {{to the second}} floor is original. The floor continues the two-room design, and the roof, largely a post-war replacement with only a few surviving medieval timbers, is intended to resemble the original medieval design. <b>The</b> <b>fireplace</b> and windows are original, as probably is the 14th-century wooden door to the floor. Both the wall between the two rooms, and its stone doorway, were built in the 18th century. The room contains a display {{on the history of the}} tower, and some of the original wooden foundations of the building.|$|E
50|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century, Paul Ardier had busted <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>fireplace.</b> <b>The</b> coats of arms {{of his family}} adorn the amounts.|$|R
50|$|There are twenty {{buildings}} constructed out of notched Western Larch logs: {{a dining}} hall, 15 sleeping cabins, two bathhouses, and caretaker facilities. Uncut native stone {{was used for}} <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces.</b> <b>The</b> camp {{was ready for the}} summer season in 1940. However, about 1941-1942 The Boy Scouts moved their camp to Melita Island on Flathead Lake.|$|R
5000|$|... 97% {{of all of}} {{the tower}} units at Washington Square have {{fireplaces}} and decks. All <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces</b> at Washington Square are metered separately so the residents will only pay for their own gas usage.|$|R
5|$|During one Occlumency lesson, Snape {{is called}} away and Harry, left alone, looks into Snape's Pensieve, viewing {{a memory of}} his time {{as a student at}} Hogwarts. Harry is shocked to witness his father, James Potter, and Sirius {{bullying}} and humiliating Snape. Snape catches Harry and, enraged, refuses to continue the lessons. Distraught at this revelation of his father's character, Harry talks to Sirius and Lupin by using Floo powder through <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> in Umbridge's own office and learns more about his parents and their background. After helping Harry break into Umbridge's office, Fred and George then leave Hogwarts to start a joke-shop in Diagon Alley.|$|E
5|$|Nevill {{was found}} in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying over an {{overturned}} chair next to <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> amid a scene suggestive of a struggle. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle was a few inches from his skin. The remaining shots to his body had occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridges were found—three in the kitchen and one on the stairs—the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally.|$|E
5|$|The 17th-century room, S2, {{used the}} south {{wall of the}} {{existing}} structure as its own north wall, and was largely built using materials salvaged from S1, although the standard of the work was poorer. The new room had a double fireplace, {{but there was no}} evidence of a dividing wall between the two hearths. Limestone blocks, identical to the quoins in S1, were used as structural and decorative features in <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> In addition to the pantiles taken from S1, there were Cornish slate roof tiles. Whether they formed part of the roof of S2 or were associated with the possible wooden extension is unclear.|$|E
50|$|As {{with many}} old buildings, the {{ceilings}} are quite low. An original bread-oven {{is next to}} one of <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces.</b> It has a large beer garden with different seating arrangements, as well as seats out the front.|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{the floor}} plan is asymmetrical. Many of the {{original}} moldings and other wood trim remain, especially the Gothic fluted surrounds on the bay windows, which emerge from nearby pilasters. <b>The</b> <b>fireplaces</b> have their original marble mantels.|$|R
5000|$|The North Dining Room: In oval niches above <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces</b> Aelius Verus# & Juno#, {{flanking}} the apse Marcus Aurelius# & Caesar Geta#, {{these last two}} busts have white marble heads mounted on Post-Rome bodies of variegated marble.|$|R
5|$|The French motto Quant Je Puis (As Much as I Can) {{is central}} to the ethos of the school, which focuses upon the all-round {{development}} of the individual. It is inherited from the Shireburn family who once owned the original mansion on the site; the family emblem is emblazoned, in stone, with the motto, above <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> in the Top Refectory. At {{the far end of the}} same room, once the dining room of the Shireburns, the motto can be seen again, carved into the minstrel's gallery: Quant Je Puis. Hugo Sherburn armig. me fieri fecit. Anno Domini 1523. Et sicut fuit sic fiat.|$|E
5|$|The TARDIS materialises on a {{seemingly}} derelict spaceship drifting in space. The Doctor, Rose, and Mickey explore {{the ship and}} are puzzled to find an eighteenth-century French fireplace. When he looks through <b>the</b> <b>fireplace,</b> the Doctor sees a young girl and asks who she is. She replies that her name is Reinette and that she lives in Paris in 1727. The Doctor deduces that <b>the</b> <b>fireplace</b> is a time window, a device that allows direct access to another time and place. The Doctor steps through the time window and arrives in Reinette's bedroom {{only to find that}} months have passed there. He discovers a ticking humanoid wearing eighteenth century clothing and a jester's mask hiding under Reinette's bed. After it threatens him with a saw-like device that slides out of its arm, the Doctor tricks the creature into returning through the time window to the spacecraft, where he and his companions learn that it is actually an intricate clockwork android. The android teleports away, and the Doctor warns Mickey and Rose not to go looking for it. The Doctor returns to Reinette's bedroom while Mickey and Rose arm themselves and go looking for the android. While trying to find Rose and Mickey, the Doctor discovers a horse that stepped through a time window, who he later names Arthur. Returning to Reinette's bedroom, the Doctor discovers that she is now a young woman. She flirts with the Doctor and they kiss, before she leaves to join her mother. The Doctor then realises that she is Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV.|$|E
5|$|The Walronds was {{probably}} built in 1605 {{which is the}} date over the hall fireplace. John Peter, a lawyer, acquired the property by marriage into the Paris family and his initials are over <b>the</b> <b>fireplace.</b> The plan is a traditional one with the ground floor hall divided from the entrance passage by a screen. The main range has three storeys {{and there are two}} wings which are both two storeys high. In the upper south-east room is a barrel shaped ceiling and a second fireplace with the date 1605. The association with the prominent local gentry family of Walrond of Bradfield House only dates from the eighteenth century.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} is decorated, {{in the arts}} and craft style, with simple panelling and boldly projecting, simplified mouldings. <b>The</b> <b>fireplaces,</b> though classically derived, have attenuated column mantelshelf supports rather similar to Charles Voysey's designs; <b>the</b> central hall <b>fireplace</b> has a carved datestone: 'GSB 1900'. The involved shape of the oak staircase in the central hall forms a half-landing above the main entrance lobby.|$|R
50|$|Its {{interior}} {{has been}} modified for its present {{use as a}} day care center, but still retains original woodwork such as the banister on the stairway. The hearth of one of <b>the</b> <b>fireplaces</b> still has its original tiling.|$|R
60|$|Lady Ella {{had come}} round to <b>the</b> marble <b>fireplace.</b> <b>The</b> mantel-piece was a {{handsome}} work by a Princhester artist in the Gill style--with contemplative ascetics as supporters.|$|R
