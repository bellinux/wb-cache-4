40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study and {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> Norwegian <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system {{and its impact on}} Wilhelmsen Group. Background/Problem: The maritime sector has always been highly affected by financial and political shocks. So when Norway introduced their new <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system, it came as a great shock for shipping companies located in Norway. They now had to decide whether to enter the new system or not. Method: To solve the purpose, Wilhelmsen's annual reports has been scruti-nised in order to create an overview look of the impacts of <b>the</b> new <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system. In addition, useful information has come from several journals and seminars attended at BI 2008. Conclusion: The findings of this thesis argues that <b>the</b> New Norwegian <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system is in its core state, where many changes are still being made. However what has been established is that <b>the</b> new <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> system is profitable, and that Wilhelmsen group wants to apply for this new system, shows its successfulness...|$|R

40|$|The tax {{treatment}} of the shipping industry over the last 30 years exhibits alternative forms of corporate taxation systems implemented by various governments.

The focus of the study is on the UK registry, investigating the impact of the introduction of the UK tonnage tax. Noteworthy results emerge along with the understanding that, in the long run, <b>the</b> <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> seems to be connected more with the 'flagging out' of foreign owned tonnage than with the 'flagging in' of nationally owned vessels.

40|$|The Ministry of Finance {{commissioned}} {{a report from}} Etlatieto Ltd on maritime operating conditions, competitiveness and the adaptability of this sector. The competitiveness of cargo ship has significantly improved when mixed-nationality crews were allowed and <b>the</b> <b>Tonnage</b> <b>Tax</b> Act went into force. The use of non-EU seamen reduces the labour costs of a ship by 20 to 30 %. <b>The</b> <b>Tonnage</b> <b>Tax</b> Act cuts the taxation of cargo vessels from 10 - 30 million euros to half a million euros. The mixed-nationality crew agreement {{does not apply to}} passenger ships. It is not worthwhile for them to shift to being taxed under <b>the</b> <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax,</b> because their store sales would be subject to special taxes, which would cut profitability significantly. In 2015, 0. 1 % sulphur limits for maritime transport will go into effect. In new ships, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emissions must be limited. In addition, bilge water and waste disposal regulations will become stricter. These will result in significant pressure on investments. The EU is considering removing the VAT-free sales status of the internal transport, which would lower sales of passenger ships by 55 million euros and profit margins by 25 million euros. If the prevalence of mixed-nationality crews grows at current rates, this would lower shipping subsidies - in 2015 the savings would amount to over 10 million euros. Savings would also come from the rationalization of fragmented training, which would allow raising the level of training. Maritime rescue and VTS centres' control functions could be combined in Helsinki and Turku. The government should concentrate ice breaking operations on safeguarding the transport of foreign trade and give up offshore business activities. The sale of offshore businesses and multipurpose icebreakers would finance new investments in the ice-breaking fleet without any additional debt and its interest expenses...|$|E
40|$|The {{acceleration}} of economic globalisation, {{over the past}} few decades, has put the role of the state, as an important actor in the management of the global economy, in the spotlight. The question that continues to dominate the globalisation debate is whether or not individual states, operating within a neoliberal paradigm, {{are in a position to}} effectively regulate the economic activities of powerful multinational capital, manage domestic economies and protect labour. The main aim of this thesis is to assess how effectively nation states can respond to globalisation and mitigate negative impacts such as the decline of domestic industries and local labour markets while maximising the benefits. Shipping is one of the most globalised industries and one where capital is highly mobile. The challenges facing nation states in their attempt to manage domestic economies and protect local industries are therefore well illustrated in the relationship between the state and multinational shipping capital. The UK, along with other Traditional Maritime Nations, has been dramatically affected by the globalisation of the industry. Following a huge decline in the UK's merchant shipping fleet, the UK government has attempted to respond, by way of a tonnage tax. This is primarily a tax incentive to encourage ship-owners to register and operate their ships in the UK. <b>The</b> <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> regime contains within it a training commitment by which the ship-owners undertake to recruit and train UK cadets. An assessment of the performance of the strategy reveals that, whereas it has boosted significant growth in UK registered tonnage, it has achieved little success with regard to increasing the number of qualified junior officers. It is this paradox that comprises the focus of this study. Using interview data collected from key stakeholders in the UK shipping industry the thesis analyses the form and impact of <b>the</b> <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax.</b> The main conclusion is that, having initially committed to the advocacy of the neoliberal agenda and the concept of free capital markets, states are no longer capable of effectively responding to globalisation and the consequent negative impact on domestic economies. Because of the growing influence of corporate capital and the fear of capital flight, the limitations of state policies is especially evident in the British shipping industry in relation to the decline of local seafaring labour.

This paper considers the nature and limits of state intervention per se in declining economic sectors in the context of globalisation and a neoliberal approach to governance.

40|$|South Africa is an {{open economy}} and its {{economic}} growth, prosperity and welfare depend on fully accessing global trade opportunities. Consequently, government is continuously seeking to improve the country’s trade and investment environment. This is to be achieved through a host of interventions {{to reduce the cost}} of doing business and investing in South Africa. These measures include the introduction of an industrial policy framework, establishment of a robust and predictable tax system, customs administration and tariff reforms, and the stepping up of investments in road, rail and ports infrastructure. In the 2005 Budget, government announced its intention to investigate the possible introduction of a tonnage tax regime in keeping with long-term trade facilitation initiatives. This notional or presumptive corporate income tax system would align South Africa’s shipping tax regime with the fiscal systems of other major maritime nations. <b>The</b> <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> will also form an integral part of Government’s Maritime Transport Agenda: 2010 which, inter alia, seeks to arrest the decline of the domestic shipping register.

40|$|The Swedish {{merchant}} fleet has declined sharply since the 1970 s, {{largely because of}} the lack of competitive conditions compared with many other countries, for instance Denmark. A large number of ships flagged out from Sweden, some shipping companies have even closed down offices and moved abroad which meant jobs being lost as a result. To prevent ships from flagging out, Sweden introduced various support measures such as subsidies for shipping and TAP agreements, which would reduce the crew costs for Swedish flagged vessels. These measures have not completely slowed down the flagging out, as it has continued to do so in recent years. Other European countries, such as Denmark and Norway, chose to adopt more parts of the Commission's State Aid Guidelines, for instance the international ship register and tonnage tax, which has increased their competitiveness against Sweden. To prevent further vessels from flagging out and promote regrowth in Swedish shipping, Sweden has decided to introduce tonnage tax in the summer of 2016, which has made the shipping industry very happy. The report was written in 2016 to find out what the Swedish shipping companies require to flag into Sweden, and if <b>the</b> <b>tonnage</b> <b>tax</b> will affect shipping companies to register their ships in Sweden. To find out, six shipping companies were interviewed, as well as the industry organization Swedish Shipowner’s Association and one of the unions. Overall the shipping companies are satisfied with some of the actions that has been adopted, including tonnage tax and the delegation of flag state inspections from the Transport Agency to classification societies. However, they demand long-term and reliable maritime transport politics, as well as that the Swedish Transport Agency should continue to improve, for example, their customer service and the procedure of flagging into Sweden. Furthermore, some of the companies want to see that the Maritime Officers' Association provides temporary or permanent exception from the requirements to have a Swedish master and chief engineer. In the Swedish Government Official Reports, SOU 2010 : 73, parts of the proposed actions have been implemented. The net wage model has been increased and the Swedish Transport Agency has appointed a supervisor to handle the matters regarding the registration of ships. However, the TAP agreement has not become a central contract or been increased...|$|E

In the UK, merchant sailing vessels were historically measured using Builder's Old Measurement to measure <b>tonnage</b> and <b>taxed</b> according. Due to the complications with accurately measuring of the internal volume of a sailing vessel (think of the calculus that would be involved to determining the 3 dimensional area (or volume) of a ship's hull and its continually changing curvature from the bow to the stern) a set of distances at points on the hull was defined to be measured and entered into a formula which then defined <b>the</b> <b>tonnage</b> and hence <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> to be paid to the government of the day. As each ship was measured on the same basis it did not matter that <b>the</b> <b>tonnage</b> measurement was not a 100% accurate measure of volume as all vessels were measured on the same basis which led to an equitable basis of allocating tax.This system of measuring or rating merchant sailing ships has a long, well established history, so <b>tonnage,</b> and <b>the</b> calculus involved was naturally also used to measure or rate a sailing yacht.|$|R
