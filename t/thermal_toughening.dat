50|$|An {{alternative}} {{chemical toughening}} process involves forcing a surface layer of glass at least 0.1 mm thick into compression by ion exchange of the sodium ions {{in the glass}} surface with potassium ions (which are 30% larger), by immersion of the glass into a bath of molten potassium nitrate. Chemical toughening results in increased toughness compared with <b>thermal</b> <b>toughening</b> and {{can be applied to}} glass objects of complex shapes.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{stainless}} steel, glass, zirconium and titanium enamel surfaces on the <b>thermal</b> and photooxidative <b>toughening</b> mechanism of dehydrated castor oil films deposited on these surfaces was investigated using different analytical and spectroscopic methods. The conjugated and non-conjugated double bonds {{were identified and}} quantified using both Raman spectroscopy and 1 D and 2 D NMR spectroscopy. The disappearance of the double bonds in thermally oxidised oil-on-surface films was shown to be concomitant {{with the formation of}} hydroperoxides (determined by iodometric titration). The type of the surface had a major effect on the rate of thermal oxidation of the oil, but all of the surfaces examined had resulted in a significantly higher rate of oxidation compared to that of the neat oil. The highest effect was exhibited by the stainless steel surface followed by zirconium enamel, titanium enamel and glass. The rate of thermal oxidation of the oil-on-steel surface (at 100 °C, based on peroxide values) was more than five times faster than that of oil-on-glass and more than 21 times faster than the neat oil when compared under similar thermal oxidative conditions. The rate of photooxidation at 60 °C of oil-on-steel films was found to be about one and half times faster than their rate of thermal oxidation at the same temperature. Results from absorbance reflectance infrared microscopy with line scans taken across the depth of thermally oxidised oil-on-steel films suggest that the <b>thermal</b> oxidative <b>toughening</b> mechanism of the oil occurs by two different reaction pathways with the film outermost layers, i. e. furthest away from the steel surface, oxidising through a traditional free radical oxidation process involving the formation of various oxygenated products formed from the decomposition of allylic hydroperoxides, whereas, in the deeper layers closer to the steel surface, crosslinking reactions predominate...|$|R
40|$|Epoxy-based nanocomposites were {{prepared}} with natural nanotubes from halloysite, a clay mineral with the empirical formula Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) (4). The morphology of the nanotubes was examined by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and was found geometrically similar to multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The thermal and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical analysis, Charpy impact and three-point bending tests. The results demonstrated that blending epoxy with 2. 3 wt% halloysite nanotubes increased the impact strength by 4 times without scarifying flexural modulus, strength and <b>thermal</b> stability. Unique <b>toughening</b> mechanisms for this improvement were investigated and discussed. It was proposed that impact energy was dissipated via the formation of damage zones {{with a large number}} of micro-cracks in front of the main crack. The micro-cracks were stabilized by nanotube bridging. Nanotube bridging, pull-out and breaking were also observed and proposed as the major energy dissipating events. The findings of this work suggest that halloysite nanotube may be an effective impact modifier for epoxy and other brittle polymers. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} {{will be more}} aggressively designed to protect gas turbine engine hot-section components {{in order to meet}} future engine higher fuel efficiency and lower emission goals. In this presentation, thermal barrier coating development considerations and performance will be emphasized. Advanced thermal {{barrier coatings}} have been developed using a multi-component defect clustering approach, and shown to have improved thermal stability and lower conductivity. The coating systems have been demonstrated for high temperature combustor applications. For thermal barrier coatings designed for turbine airfoil applications, further improved erosion and impact resistance are crucial for engine performance and durability. Erosion resistant thermal barrier coatings are being developed, with a current emphasis on the toughness improvements using a combined rare earth- and transition metal-oxide doping approach. The performance of the <b>toughened</b> <b>thermal</b> barrier coatings has been evaluated in burner rig and laser heat-flux rig simulated engine erosion and thermal gradient environments. The results have shown that the coating composition optimizations can effectively improve the erosion and impact resistance of the coating systems, while maintaining low thermal conductivity and cyclic durability. The erosion, impact and high heat-flux damage mechanisms of the thermal barrier coatings will also be described...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{blankets}} {{are used}} extensively on spacecraft to provide {{passive thermal control}} of spacecraft hardware from thermal extremes encountered in space. <b>Toughened</b> <b>thermal</b> blankets have been developed that greatly improve protection from hypervelocity micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) impacts. These blankets can be outfitted if so desired with a reliable means to determine the location, depth and extent of MMOD impact damage by incorporating an impact sensitive piezoelectric film. Improved MMOD protection of thermal blankets was obtained by adding selective materials at various locations within the thermal blanket. As given in Figure 1, three types of materials {{were added to the}} thermal blanket to enhance its MMOD performance: (1) disrupter layers, near the outside of the blanket to improve breakup of the projectile, (2) standoff layers, {{in the middle of the}} blanket to provide an area or gap that the broken-up projectile can expand, and (3) stopper layers, near the back of the blanket where the projectile debris is captured and stopped. The best suited materials for these different layers vary. Density and thickness is important for the disrupter layer (higher densities generally result in better projectile breakup), whereas a highstrength to weight ratio is useful for the stopper layer, to improve the slowing and capture of debris particles...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} {{of a range of}} two-part toughened epoxy adhesives has been assessed in a number of modes. The structural behaviour of the adhesives in the bulk mode (cohesive) {{as a function of the}} level of cure applied has been evaluated through extensive mechanical experimentation. Thermal analysis has also been performed upon the adhesives in order to quantify the variation in both the degree of conversion and the glass transition temperature as a function of cure. Correlations between adhesive and bulk cohesive behaviour were made possible through the {{performance of}} fundamental joint strength tests. Fracture surfaces of flexural test specimens were analysed using SEM techniques allowing more detailed analysis to be made of the adhesive microstructure, specifically the morphology of the toughening phase. The mechanical {{performance of a}} range of adhesives in the presence of drawing oil was assessed as a function of cure level and substrate condition. The oil is used upon sheet steel by the automotive industry to aid forming processes and is frequently left upon substrates that are to be bonded. The effect of the presence of oil upon adhesive performance has been quantified through joint strength tests, absorption experiments and <b>thermal</b> analysis. The <b>toughening</b> components employed are of great importance to the fracture behaviour of the adhesive. When such elements are used correctly, significant gains in material performance can be made. Fracture mechanics tests were performed for various cure levels. Identical levels were also used in tests designed to monitor the phase out process of the toughening element in order to facilitate direct comparison. Using a bespoke light box and photocell, the turbidity of a model epoxy system was measured in both toughened and untoughened forms. The fracture behaviour is then directly correlated to the toughener phase out process. This method also allowed for deductions to be made on the morphology of the toughener. The work has also made many recommendations for improved processing controls as the performance of the adhesive can be tailored by alterations to not only cure temperature and durations but also substrate condition and joint design. These suggestions, when considered in combination, contribute significantly to the improvement of two part epoxy adhesive usage. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
