5|$|Mrs. Tittlemouse {{is a tale}} {{in which}} no humans play a part and one in which events are treated as though they have {{occurred}} since <b>time</b> <b>immemorial</b> and far from human observance. It is a simple story, and one likely to appeal to young children.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{have been}} venerated since <b>time</b> <b>immemorial.</b> To the ancient Celts, certain trees, {{especially}} the oak, ash and thorn, held special significance as providing fuel, building materials, ornamental objects and weaponry. Other cultures have similarly revered trees, often linking {{the lives and}} fortunes of individuals to them or using them as oracles. In Greek mythology, dryads {{were believed to be}} shy nymphs who inhabited trees.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{cultural}} {{trait of}} Chiprovtsi shared {{with much of}} the region is the veneration of a family patron saint, named svetets ("saint") and akin to Serbian slava. The practice exists since <b>time</b> <b>immemorial</b> and the family saint is thought to have been chosen by the taking of a random candle by an unaware person. The svetets is associated to the family house: when a daughter-in-law comes to live there, she accepts the family saint of the home, and when a family member or a foreign settler moves out or builds a new house, they adopt a new svetets.|$|E
5|$|Vegetables {{have been}} part of the human diet from <b>time</b> <b>immemorial.</b> Some are staple foods but most are {{accessory}} foodstuffs, adding variety to meals with their unique flavors and at the same time, adding nutrients necessary for health. Some vegetables are perennials but most are annuals and biennials, usually harvested within a year of sowing or planting. Whatever system is used for growing crops, cultivation follows a similar pattern; preparation of the soil by loosening it, removing or burying weeds, and adding organic manures or fertilisers; sowing seeds or planting young plants; tending the crop while it grows to reduce weed competition, control pests, and provide sufficient water; harvesting the crop when it is ready; sorting, storing, and marketing the crop or eating it fresh from the ground.|$|E
5|$|Puffins {{have been}} hunted by man since <b>time</b> <b>immemorial.</b> Coastal {{communities}} and island dwellers with few natural resources at their disposal, made {{good use of}} the seafoods that they found on their cliffs and shores. Puffins were caught and eaten fresh, salted in brine or smoked and dried. Their feathers were used in bedding and their eggs were eaten, {{but not to the}} same extent as those of some other seabirds, being more difficult to extract from the nest. In most countries, Atlantic puffins are now protected by legislation, and in the countries where hunting is still permitted, strict laws prevent over-exploitation. They are still caught and eaten in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but there have been calls for an outright ban on hunting them in Iceland because of concern over the dwindling number of birds successfully raising chicks.|$|E
50|$|The temple {{occupies}} {{an important}} {{place in the}} scriptures as several of the Siva-leelas and Shakti-mahimas were enacted on or around it, making the region a place of unequaled spiritual significance and attracting pilgrims since <b>times</b> <b>immemorial.</b>|$|R
50|$|Archaeological discoveries, {{have shown}} that people have {{inhabited}} {{the valley of the}} Dnieper (Dnipro) River since the <b>times</b> <b>immemorial.</b> The oldest objects excavated on the territory of the region date back to the Stone Age - the Palaeolithic period.|$|R
50|$|These {{historical}} antecedents however make {{no difference}} {{to the people of}} the chiefdom in terms of their unity and brotherliness. The identity of these people lies more on the traditional and cultural heritage they share which is more solid and dates back to <b>times</b> <b>immemorial.</b>|$|R
5|$|The thistle {{has been}} one of the {{national}} emblem of the Scots nation since the reign of Alexander III (1249–1286) and was used on silver coins issued by James III in 1470. Today, it forms part of the emblem of the Scottish Rugby Union. As legend has it, an invading army had attempted to sneak up at night on the Scots. One, perhaps barefooted, unwelcome foreign soldier stumbled upon a Scots Thistle, and cried out in pain, thus alerting Scots to their presence. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the Battle of Largs, which marked the beginning of the departure of the Viking monarch Haakon IV of Norway, who had harried the coast for some years. Spiky plants such as brambles appear to have been used around forts since <b>time</b> <b>immemorial,</b> so the story, whether it factually relates to the Haakon episode or not, likely is the culmination of more than one such event over time. In some variants, it is invading English which stumble on a thistle, but the story predates this time.|$|E

50|$|Although panchayats {{have been}} in {{existence}} in India since <b>times</b> <b>immemorial,</b> in post-Independence India, most of the rural development and community development projects have been sought to be executed through panchayats. In the federal Indian polity, different states had different laws governing {{the powers of the}} gram panchayats and sarpanches.|$|R
25|$|One {{enters the}} rose garden via the sacristy. It is the last remains of the ancient wood in which St Francis and his friars lived. Here he talked to the turtle doves, {{inviting}} them to praise the Lord. Doves have been nesting since <b>times</b> <b>immemorial</b> {{in the hands of}} the statue of St. Francis in this rose garden.|$|R

25|$|Human-powered {{transport}} is {{the transport}} of person(s) and/or goods using human muscle power. Like animal-powered transport, human-powered transport has existed since <b>time</b> <b>immemorial</b> {{in the form of}} walking, running and swimming.

25|$|Punjab {{has been}} the cradle of {{civilisation}} since <b>times</b> <b>immemorial.</b> The ruins of Harappa show an advanced urban culture that flourished over 8000 years ago. Ancient Taxila, another historic landmark also stands out as a proof of {{the achievements of the}} area in learning, arts and crafts. The ancient Hindu Katasraj temple and the Salt Range temples are regaining attention and much-needed repair.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>times</b> <b>immemorial,</b> {{the tribal}} {{communities}} of India {{have had an}} integral and close knit relationship with the forests and have been dependent on the forests for livelihoods and existence. The relationship was mutually beneficial and not one sided. However, rights were rarely recognized by the authorities {{and in the absence}} of real ownership of the land, the already marginalized local dwellers suffered.|$|R
50|$|Although Ata {{must have}} been known to Tongans from <b>times</b> <b>immemorial,</b> as it {{features}} in old myths, it may have been mixed up with Atā, and it is alleged not to have been remembered until the Tongans were told about it by the Europeans. In fact the following myth is rather from the original Tongans in the Lau Islands (Fiji) than from Tonga proper itself.|$|R
25|$|The river {{has been}} used for {{commercial}} shipping since <b>time</b> <b>immemorial,</b> but was straightened and improved many times including in 1753 and 1812. A straight course (new cut) was made at Bardney and the lock built in 1770 was re-built in 1865.|$|E

50|$|Gender Sensitization is one basic {{requirement}} for the normal development of an individual. Without being sensitive {{to the needs of}} a particular gender, an individual may refrain from understanding the opposite gender and in some acute cases even him or herself. The need for this sensitivity has been felt and realised through <b>times</b> <b>immemorial</b> and in almost all kinds of human existence, across the globe.|$|R
25|$|Elk Island National Park is {{situated}} in the Beaverhills area, which with its aspen thickets and easy access to water, has provided shelter for wintering herds of elk, bison and moose since <b>times</b> <b>immemorial.</b> Though {{there was never any}} permanent First Nations settlement in the area, there are over 200 archaeological remains of campsites and stone toolmaking sites. The land has been influenced by the Blackfoot, Sarcee and Cree peoples.|$|R

60|$|Where our prophet {{would have}} been {{most likely to have}} erred {{would have been}} in under-estimating the recuperative power of the Latin end of Europe and in {{ignoring}} the latent forces of the Arabian desert. Arabia would have seemed what it had been for <b>times</b> <b>immemorial,</b> the refuge of small and bickering nomadic tribes. No Semitic people had founded an empire now for more than a thousand years.|$|R
40|$|From <b>times</b> <b>immemorial</b> Canarium spp. nuts ('Nangai' in Vanuatu) {{have been}} selected, tended and {{cultivated}} in Melanesia for their abundant and tasty nuts, {{which are also}} sold as confectionary and as source of oil. However, their genetic and cultivated diversity is under threat due to logging, changing food production systems, lack of replanting and loss of ethnobotanical knowledge. The South Pacific Regional Initiative on Forest Genetic Resources (SPRIG) has just ended a targeted survey and collection of nut morphotypes of Canarium indicum and C. harveyi on Vanuatu in order to conserve germplasm in- and ex-situ. Seedlings of selected trees are now being propagated at a field station of the Ministry of Forestry.
