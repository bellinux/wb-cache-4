Although not as destructive as the volcanism at vent sites of the mid-ocean ridges, the dynamics of shallow hydrate formation and movement will clearly affect sessile animals that form part of the seepage barrier. There is potential of a catastrophic event where an entire layer of shallow hydrate could break free of the bottom and considerably affect local communities of chemosynthetic fauna. At deeper depths (>1,000 m, >3,281ft), the bottom-water temperature is colder (by approximately 3°C) and undergoes less fluctuation. The formation of more stable and probably deeper hydrates influences the flux of light hydrocarbon gases to the sediment surface, thus influencing <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>morphology</b> and characteristics of chemosynthetic communities. Within complex communities such as Bush Hill, petroleum seems less important than previously thought (MacDonald, 1998b).|$|E

50|$|This sort of mantle {{layering}} {{is further}} {{supported by the}} 'basalt barrier' mechanism, which states that subducted basaltic crust is positively buoyant between the mantle depths of 660-750 km, and negatively buoyant at other depths, and can accumulate {{at the bottom of}} the transition zone and cause mantle layering. The breakdown of mantle layering and consequent mantle overturns would lead to dramatic episodes of volcanism, formation of large amounts of crust, and tectonic activity on the planet's surface, as has been inferred to have happened on Venus around 500 Ma from <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>morphology</b> and cratering.

50|$|Unlike the {{techniques}} {{presented in the}} last section in which probe size can be relatively large compared to island size, surface microscopies such scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and Atomic force microscopy (AFM) offer the opportunity for direct viewing of deposit/substrate combination events. The extreme magnifications afforded by these techniques, often down to the nanometer length scale, make them particularly applicable for visualizing the strongly 3D islands.

50|$|The deposit spreads to {{a maximum}} width of 20 km and is bounded by levees higher than 40 m, which are less {{prominent}} on the eastern side. As later parts of the collapse overrode the earlier segments, they formed a northeast-trending scarp in the deposit, across {{which there is a}} striking difference in <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>morphology</b> of the collapse. The landslide deposit has been stratigraphically subdivided into two units, the Monturaqui unit and the El Cenizal unit. The first unit forms most of the surface and consists itself of several subunits, one of which includes basement rocks that were integrated into the collapse as it occurred. Likewise, the El Cenizal unit included basement rocks as well, such as playa deposits. The amount of basement material is noticeably large and might form as much as 80% of the landslide volume; the topography of the northwestern side of the volcano may have prevented the mass failure from being localized along the basement-edifice surface area, explaining the large volume of basement involved. Further, the basement-derived material was probably mechanically weak and thus allowed the landslide to move over shallow slopes. This basement material forms part of the white surfaces in the landslide deposit; other bright areas are formed by fumarolically altered material. The basement material was originally considered to be pumice.|$|E
50|$|As for triboelectric nanogenerators, {{maximizing the}} charge {{generation}} {{on opposite sides}} {{can be achieved by}} selecting the materials with the largest difference in the ability to attract electrons and changing <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>morphology.</b> In such a case, the output of the TENG depends on the type and concentration of molecules adsorbed {{on the surface of the}} triboelectric materials, which can be used for fabricating chemical and biochemical sensors. As an example, the performance of the TENG depends on the assembly of Au nanoparticles (NPs) onto the metal plate. These assembled Au NPs not only act as steady gaps between the two plates at strain free condition, but also enable the function of enlarging the contact area of the two plates, which will increase the electrical output of the TENG. Through further modification of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) molecules on the assembled Au NPs, the high-output nanogenerator can become a highly sensitive and selective nanosensor toward Hg2+ ions detection because of the different triboelectric polarity of Au NPs and Hg2+ ions. With its high sensitivity, selectivity and simplicity, the TENG holds great potential for the determination of Hg2+ ions in environmental samples. The TENG is a future sensing system for unreachable and access-denied extreme environments. As different ions, molecules, and materials have their unique triboelectric polarities, we expect that the TENG can become either an electrical turn-on or turn-off sensor when the analytes are selectively binding to the modified electrode surface. We believe this work will serve as the stepping stone for related TENG studies and inspire the development of TENG toward other metal ions and biomolecules such as DNA and proteins in the near future.|$|E
