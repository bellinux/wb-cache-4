[...] She carries a unique, 2'11" [...] diameter, 160psi boiler, which gives her the same <b>theoretical</b> <b>power</b> output as the medium boiler locomotives, but in reality she was inclined to run short of steam on heavy trains. [...] She was purchased by a preservationist group in 1978 with a view to complete restoration and in 1988 the boiler was lifted from the frames and sent to the workshops of the Severn Valley Railway for re-construction. [...] This was a long-term project and as relationships between the owners and management soured, the project did not reach fruition. [...] Happily, the owners offered the boiler (now complete) to donor locomotive No. 1 Sutherland so that she could return to service for the Steam 125 celebrations in 1998 and after an agreed three years in No. 1 the boiler was lifted into No. 8 which operated {{as a member of the}} active fleet until early summer 2008. Being the sole representative of the smaller engines (No. 4 has been rebuilt to a medium configuration) she was often to be seen on lighter trains, specials and acting as station pilot. [...] She operated in May 2010 on non-passenger duties as part of the annual Rush Hour event and since this time a long dispute has been settled and the locomotive returned to railway ownership in April 2012 seeing service once again for the Rush Hour event. No. 8 made a return to the site of Peel Station for display to commemorate the 140th anniversary of the Peel line on 1 July 2013, placed on a short length of display track next to the former water tower at the station..|$|E

In order to account for systematic forecasting errors that may be due to the NWP model or to their modeling approach, physical modelers often integrate Model Output Statistics (MOS) for post-processing power forecasts.|$|E
