To achieve surprise, the battalion maneuvered to attack at 3:00 AM from the west, as the Egyptians were preparing for further attacks {{from the south and}} east. As the Israelis attacked, Lieutenant Colonel Brom was killed barely thirty meters from Egyptian positions, disrupting his battalion's assault. The Israelis sustained losses, but managed to retreat. Soon after, a tank company attacked the crossroads at 4:00 AM on October 16, but also withdrew after losing three tanks.|$|E
5|$|Göth {{was also}} the officer {{in charge of the}} {{liquidation}} of Szebnie concentration camp, which interned 4,000 Jewish and 1,500 Polish slave labourers. Evidence presented at Göth's trial indicates he delegated this <b>task</b> <b>to</b> a subordinate, SS-Hauptscharführer Josef Grzimek, who was sent to assist camp commandant SS-Hauptsturmführer Hans Kellermann with mass killings. Between 21 September 1943 and 3February 1944 the camp was gradually liquidated. Around a thousand of the victims were taken to the nearby forest and shot, and the remainder were sent to Auschwitz, where most were gassed immediately on arrival.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the armed conflict, there are other explanations for this situation: Municipalities tend to use their financial resources from the Sistema General de Participaciones or General Participation System (Law 715 of 2001) mainly in urban areas.

5|$|The {{criticism}} {{against the}} artistic freedom of giving a personal {{interpretation of a}} distant historic event, could have been directed at many other historic paintings of the 19th century. The criticism against Midvinterblot {{would be in the}} same vein during the following years. Larsson retorted that he would happily delegate the <b>task</b> <b>to</b> a younger talent—but he made a second version in oil (№ 237) in which he made the temple wider and where he added an executioner in the centre. The sets of characters were more closely assembled and the frieze-like quality was enhanced.|$|E

5|$|What {{was needed}} was a new bombsight, one that could be very quickly set up, had useful {{illumination}} of the crosshairs for night use and was stabilized so the bomb aimer could watch the approach as the bomber was manoeuvring. An early attempt was the Mk.

It was no easy <b>task</b> <b>to</b> manually calculate the range angle on the Course and Speed Calculator. Although introduced in 1941, only a small number were produced.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{availability}} of the simplified tasks for the step-by-step practice of the judo throwing techniques. Participants were 12 college students who have attended the national College judo tournaments and the 16 principal throwing techniques were employed for the experiments. The simplified tasks of the throwing techniques were designed based on the opponent’s postures that were one knee and half sitting. Participants were asked to throw the opponents who assumed two kinds of the postures by 16 throwing techniques. 4 kinds of Taisabaki, which meant how to move legs, were used for the throwing trials. Binomial tests were conducted and results demonstrated that both the throwing <b>tasks</b> <b>to</b> one knee and the throwing <b>tasks</b> <b>to</b> half sitting were available for 9 throwing techniques. Neither the throwing <b>tasks</b> <b>to</b> one knee nor the throwing <b>tasks</b> <b>to</b> half sitting were available for 2 throwing techniques. The throwing <b>tasks</b> <b>to</b> one knee were not available, but the throwing <b>tasks</b> <b>to</b> half-sitting were available for 5 throwing techniques. Furthermore, appropriate Taisabaki was considered for each of the throwing techniques. The findings of this study would contribute to devise appropriate ways and means of judo practice for novices...|$|R

However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town and never came back. The hero then heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people went in never came back; thus the hero heads in that direction and returns to his world.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1940, Hitler asked Himmler {{to draft}} a new plan for the {{elimination}} of the Jews of Europe, and Himmler passed along the <b>task</b> <b>to</b> Heydrich. His draft proposed the deportation of the Jews to the Soviet Union via Poland. The later Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting the entire population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, either for use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat. After the Axis failure in the Battle of Moscow and the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Since transporting masses of people into a combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E

5|$|Demosthenes was {{determined}} to prevent the capture of the city, and went on an embassy to Byzantion, which agreed to form an alliance with Athens. The Athenians general Chares {{was already in the}} vicinity with 40 ships, and was sent to support Byzantion; furthermore, Byzantion's other allies, Chios, Rhodes and Kos also sent aid to the city. Since he still did not control the seas, Philip already faced a difficult <b>task</b> <b>to</b> besiege Byzantion, made all the more difficult by the outside support. Again, Philip's engineers set to work, and created a breach; a night assault was then made, but was repulsed. Frustrated in the two sieges, Philip now lost patience with the Athenians, and wrote to them, declaring war. In Athens, Demosthenes proposed that the Athenians should respond by declaring war on Philip; the motion was passed, and the stone tablet recording the peace of Philocrates destroyed. The Athenians prepared another fleet under the command of Phocion, and dispatched it to Byzantion.|$|E
5|$|In late 1971, John Dean, the White House Counsel, {{pushed to}} expand the {{existing}} intelligence program ahead of the 1972 re-election campaign. Dean delegated the <b>task</b> <b>to</b> Jack Caulfield, {{a member of his}} staff who was a former New York police officer. According to Dean, Caulfield himself was interested in work outside of politics; he intended to create a private security company, and felt that if the Nixon cabinet were an early client, it would lead to lucrative future clients within the private sector. Fred Emery, a journalist for The Times and BBC, refutes this, claiming in his book Watergate: The Corruption & Fall of Richard Nixon that the idea of a private sector security firm was simply a front for a committed campaign of surveillance working Nixon and the Republican Party, with political donations to the re-election campaign able to be diverted through the company as though they were unrelated transactions.|$|E

He made three proposals: a pontoon or suspension bridge between Foldrøyhomen and Litlaneset; a suspension bridge between Setraneset and Sokkbleikjo, which would terminate just south of the new airport; and a combined fixed link between Spissøy and Digernes, without passing via the Fitjar Archipelago. The latter was the first time a fixed link to the mainland was proposed. The Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration protested against a possible suspension bridge near the airport, but stated that one closer further away would be fine.|$|E
