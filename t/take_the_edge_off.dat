The hallways are stenciled with {{phrases such as}} [...] "the perfect human being is all human", which were found at the Etobicoke School for the Arts, {{one of the many}} schools that set designers used during their original research. The washroom set has graffiti on the walls to look authentic, and is used for the girls' and boys' room; urinals are installed and removed as needed. The set used for the cafeteria is [...] "purposefully bland to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> the rest of the school looking so beautiful." [...] It is also used as the studio's cafeteria where the cast and crew eat.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan Potter as Hiro Hamada, a 14-year-old {{robotics}} prodigy. Speaking of the character, co-director Don Hall said [...] "Hiro is transitioning from boy to man, it's a {{tough time}} for a kid and some teenagers develop that inevitable snarkiness and jaded attitude. Luckily Ryan is a very likeable kid. So {{no matter what he}} did, he was able to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> the character {{in a way that made}} him authentic, but appealing".|$|E
2500|$|Mackintosh {{thereafter}} {{became a}} bitter disappointment to Hazlitt. Looking {{back at the}} elder man's change of political sentiments, Hazlitt observed that the lecturer struck a harsh note if he felt it were a triumph to have exulted {{in the end of}} all hope for the [...] "future improvement" [...] of the human race; rather it should have been a matter for [...] "lamentation". The two later again crossed paths, when Hazlitt, as a political reporter, attended Mackintosh's [...] "maiden speech" [...] in Parliament, in 1813, leading Hazlitt to think deeply about what constitutes an effective speech in a legislative body (Mackintosh's was presented as a counter-example in Hazlitt's 1820 essay on the subject). [...] By this time, Mackintosh's return to the liberal camp had begun to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> Hazlitt's bitterness, although he regretted that the nature of his talents kept Mackintosh from being an effective ally in Parliament.|$|E

60|$|His {{serenity}} lessened the earl's anxieties, but bewildered him; and it <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> malicious pleasure which Rotherby {{was beginning}} to experience.|$|R
6000|$|... 'By God, Rupert,' he said, 'I'd {{just come}} to the {{conclusion}} that nothing in the world mattered except somebody to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> one's being alone: the right somebody.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better, Sterling--so much the better. You shall <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> the next affair, {{by way of}} giving you another chance. I rely on the Blenheim, and on her captain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{might be}} a sort of {{protection}} for me, if you remained in it,' said Mr Boffin; 'you might stand betwixt him and me, and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> him. Don't {{you feel as if you}} could make a show of remaining in it, Venus, till I had time to turn myself round?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> victory," [...] he murmured. [...] "I {{thought the}} {{six of us}} would have a jolly time {{for the rest of the}} day." ...|$|R
50|$|The 1929 New Orleans {{streetcar}} {{strike was}} one of the last of its kind. The rise of private automobile ownership <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> its impact, as an article in the Chicago Tribune observed as early as 1915.|$|R
50|$|The major {{developer}} of Stoicism, Chrysippus, <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> strict necessity. Like Democritus, Aristotle, and Epicurus before him, {{he wanted to}} strengthen the argument for moral responsibility, in particular defending it from Aristotle's and Epicurus' indeterminate chance causes.|$|R
60|$|The cuirassiers {{were too}} much {{in a hurry to}} get through the guichet, which was a defile, and too steady to cut me down in passing; and, first giving them a few minutes to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> the affair, if there was to be any fighting, I {{followed}} them to the quay.|$|E
60|$|Montgomery smiled. A {{pleasant}} {{sense of}} relief thrilled softly through him. What blessed safety-valve was this through which his jangled nerves might find some outlet. The provocation was so gross, the insult so unprovoked, {{that he could have}} none of those qualms which <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> a man's mettle. He finished sealing the bottle upon which he was occupied, and he addressed it and placed it carefully in the rack.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "no wonder they looked so thin; {{and no wonder}} they're beginnin' {{to be a little}} better in flesh now, wi' the legs o' mutton an' chops an' such like things that I get in to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> my appetite--which, as you justly observe, Miss Ruth, is not a bad one. I'm glad you've told me this, however, for I'll go in for extra heavy feedin' now." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2000 he {{directed}} The Waiting List, which tells the humorous {{story of a}} group of passengers waiting for a bus that will never appear.

5000|$|The Guardian: [...] "Herreweghe's {{accounts}} are typically thoughtful, {{not at all}} theatrical or dramatically driven, and that slightly laid-back approach <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Magnificat too, though {{the quality of the}} solo and choral singing, and the careful shaping of the orchestral lines are all exemplary." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{was twenty}} years since we'd played Slane. And it was thrilling {{to go back}} to our home town and play to that many people.

60|$|The flies are {{incredibly}} numerous just now. The unsightly blot {{a little higher}} up was occasioned by a very fine one who fell into the inkstand, and came out, unexpectedly, on the nib of my pen. We are all quite well, thank Heaven, and had a very interesting journey here, of which, {{as well as of}} this place, I will not write a word, lest I should <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> those agreeable conversations with which we will beguile our walks.|$|E

He finished sealing the bottle upon which he was occupied, and he addressed it and placed it carefully in the rack. [...] "Look here!"

Wait outside in the waiting-room if you wish to wait at all." ...|$|E
60|$|But I {{kept the}} book and read it as a neutral observer, {{and came to the}} {{conclusion}} that these South Sea Islands, a land where it was always afternoon, must be a charming place, in which perhaps the stars of the Tropics and the scent of the flowers might enable one to forget a little, or at least <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> memory. Why should I not visit them and escape another long and dreary English winter? No, I could not do so alone. If Bastin and Bickley were there, their eternal arguments might amuse me. Well, why should they not come also? When one has money things can always be arranged.|$|E
60|$|Captain Horton {{found his}} vis-a-vis a {{somewhat}} unsatisfactory companion. She drank several glasses of champagne, ate scarcely anything, and rushed him away {{before he had}} <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> his appetite. He {{brought her to the}} Duchess and went back in a huff to finish his supper alone. Lady Carey went downstairs and discovered Mr. Brott, who had scarcely moved.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes,' said Jonas, plying his own {{knife and}} fork very fast. 'He eats--when he's helped. But he don't care whether he waits a minute or an hour, as long as father's here; so when I'm at all sharp set, as I am to-day, I come to him after I've <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> my own hunger, you know. Now, Chuffey, stupid, are you ready?' ...|$|R
60|$|Cheenbuk made no reply. Eskimo manners did {{not require}} an answer in the circumstances. But when he had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> his appetite--and it took {{a good deal of}} dental {{grinding}} to do that--he looked across at Adolay with a genial expression and began to give his mother and sister a second, and much more graphic, edition of the speech which he had just delivered to the men.|$|R
60|$|Supper was {{the family}} meal of the day--the one meal at which Johnny {{encountered}} his younger brothers and sisters. It partook {{of the nature of}} an encounter, to him, for he was very old, while they were distressingly young. He had no patience with their excessive and amazing juvenility. He did not understand it. His own childhood was too far behind him. He was like an old and irritable man, annoyed by the turbulence of their young spirits that was to him arrant silliness. He glowered silently over his food, finding compensation in the thought that they would soon have to go to work. That would <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> of them and make them sedate and dignified--like him. Thus it was, after the fashion of the human, that Johnny made of himself a yardstick with which to measure the universe.|$|E
60|$|But, {{truth to}} say, on this July day I {{reflected}} but {{little on the}} condition of the civilised world. Whatever sinister passions were heaving under its splendid and complex surface, I was too agitated by a simple and innocent desire of my own, to notice the signs or interpret them correctly. The most innocent of passions will <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> one's judgment. The desire which possessed me was simply the desire to travel. And that being so it would have taken something very plain in the way of symptoms to shake my simple trust in the stability of things on the Continent. My sentiment and not my reason was engaged there. My eyes were turned to the past, not to the future; the past that one cannot suspect and mistrust, the shadowy and unquestionable moral possession the darkest struggles of which wear a halo of glory and peace.|$|E
60|$|We entered France in July, 1826, {{and having}} {{remained}} in {{and about the}} French capital until February, 1828, we thought it time to change the scene. Paris is effectually the centre of Europe, and a residence in {{it is the best}} training an American can have, previously to visiting the other parts of that quarter of the world. Its civilisation, usages, and facilities <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> our provincial admiration, remove prejudices, and prepare the mind to receive new impressions, with more discrimination and tact. I would advise all our travellers to make this their first stage, and then to visit the North of Europe, before crossing the Alps or the Pyrenees. Most people, however, hurry into the South, with a view to obtain the best as soon as possible; but it is with this, as in most of our enjoyments, a too eager indulgence defeats its own aim.|$|E
50|$|Toy Love were {{together}} {{for less than}} two years (1978-80) and spent a large part of that time in Australia. They released just one (self-titled) album, however the band members were apparently appalled by the mixing of <b>the</b> tracks which <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> band's deliberately raw sound. Allmusic gave the album a 3/5 rating. In April 2005, this album was remastered and released along with a bunch of demos and unreleased tracks as a double CD entitled Cuts.|$|R

5000|$|Publishers Weekly gave Taking On the System a starred review, {{describing}} {{it as an}} [...] "informative and entertaining book" [...] that [...] "moves easily among the current campaign cycle, pop culture phenomena such as Stephen Colbert and the successes and failures of the progressive movement in America." [...] The review notes that the book's [...] "pragmatic, inclusive tone <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> Moulitsas's sometimes didactic insistence that 'there's no reason anyone should whine or complain {{that they are being}} shut out of the system.' [...] " ...|$|R
60|$|We called duly upon Ida, {{that very}} hour, and Ida {{certainly}} behaved herself remarkably well. She was so charmingly frank and pretty, she apologized so simply to Annie for her ignorance of English etiquette, {{and she was}} so obviously guileless and innocent-hearted in all her talk, that even Annie herself--who is, I must confess, a typical don's wife--was gradually mollified. To my great surprise, Annie even asked her to dinner en famille the same evening, and suggested that I should make an arrangement with the Junior Proctor to take my work, and join the party. I consented, not without serious misgivings; but I felt that if Ida was really going to stop a week, it would be well to put the best face upon it, and to show her up in company with Annie as often as possible. That might just conceivably <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> the keen blade of University scandal.|$|E
60|$|MONDAY NIGHT. - The {{drums and}} fifes {{up in the}} Castle are {{sounding}} the guard-call through the dark, {{and there is a}} great rattle of carriages without. I have had (I must tell you) my bed taken out of this room, so that I am alone in it with my books and two tables, and two chairs, and a coal-skuttle (or SCUTTLE) (?) and a DEBRIS of broken pipes in a corner, and my old school play-box, so full of papers and books that the lid will not shut down, standing reproachfully in the midst. There is something in it that is still a little gaunt and vacant; it needs a little populous disorder over it to give it the feel of homeliness, and perhaps a bit more furniture, just to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> the sense of illimitable space, eternity, and a future state, and the like, that is brought home to one, even in this small attic, by the wide, empty floor.|$|E
60|$|Anne was lonely; Diana, {{during the}} whole of the holidays, was imprisoned at home with a bad attack of bronchitis. She could not come to Green Gables and it was rarely Anne could get to Orchard Slope, for the old way through the Haunted Wood was impassable with drifts, and the long way over the frozen Lake of Shining Waters was almost as bad. Ruby Gillis was {{sleeping}} in the white-heaped graveyard; Jane Andrews was teaching a school on western prairies. Gilbert, to be sure, was still faithful, and waded up to Green Gables every possible evening. But Gilbert's visits were not what they once were. Anne almost dreaded them. It was very disconcerting to look up {{in the midst of a}} sudden silence and find Gilbert's hazel eyes fixed upon her with a quite unmistakable expression in their grave depths; and it was still more disconcerting to find herself blushing hotly and uncomfortably under his gaze, just as if--just as if--well, it was very embarrassing. Anne wished herself back at Patty's Place, where there was always somebody else about to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> a delicate situation. At Green Gables Marilla went promptly to Mrs. Lynde's domain when Gilbert came and insisted on taking the twins with her. The significance of this was unmistakable and Anne was in a helpless fury over it.|$|E
6000|$|... "In that case, Miss Oliver dear, the German {{official}} reports {{ought to}} be all you need," [...] said Susan sarcastically. [...] "I never read them now because they make me so mad I cannot put my thoughts properly on my work after a dose of them. Even this news about Warsaw has <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> my afternoon's plans. Misfortunes never come singly. I spoiled my baking of bread today--and now Warsaw has fallen--and here is little Kitchener bent on choking himself to death." ...|$|R
500|$|The Leipziger Weihnachtskantaten {{recording}} by the Collegium Vocale Gent, {{conducted by}} Philippe Herreweghe, was reviewed as with [...] "bracing but not rushed tempos, infectiously energetic and technically solid {{contributions from the}} chorus, and an intelligently paced flow from movement to movement." [...] The Guardian wrote: [...] "Herreweghe's accounts are typically thoughtful, not at all theatrical or dramatically driven, and that slightly laid-back approach <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Magnificat too, though {{the quality of the}} solo and choral singing, and the careful shaping of the orchestral lines are all exemplary." ...|$|R
60|$|After a {{considerable}} time symptoms of satiety began to appear, {{in the shape}} of an occasional remark. Soon Bounce uttered a deep sigh, and announced his belief that, having <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> his appetite, it was time to begin with the marrow-bones. Thereupon, with the marrow-bones he began, and his example was quickly followed by his companions. There was a business-like steadiness of purpose {{in the way in which}} that meal was eaten, and in the whole of the procedure connected with it, that would have been highly diverting to a disinterested spectator.|$|R
