The treatment of chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by using a similar strategy using lamivudine has been developed.|$|E

5|$|The west gate is {{the rear}} {{entrance}} to the Vizianagaram fort. This gateway is also built in Rajasthani style with a pavilion on top. The gate provides access to the royal tombs, and is a traditional gateway to take out dead bodies for cremation.

5|$|This {{homophonic}} choral {{passage is}} followed by the first of three short four-bar orchestral ritornellos, with a texture that has already been heard very briefly in the bar when the chorus pause between the fugato and homophonic passages. As in the opening sinfonia, the instruments play in four distinct groups—alto recorders, oboes, upper strings and continuo—but the sparseness <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> replaced by a jubilant canzona-style flourish.|$|E
5|$|Active {{elliptical}} galaxies of a form {{similar to}} M87 {{are believed to}} form {{as a result of}} one or more mergers between smaller galaxies. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> little dust remaining to form the diffuse nebulae where new stars were created, so the stellar population is dominated by old, population II stars that contain relatively low abundances of elements other than hydrogen and helium. M87's elliptical shape is maintained by random orbital motions of its member stars, in contrast to the more orderly rotational motions found in a spiral galaxy such as the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|Alpha {{silicon carbide}} (α-SiC) {{is the most}} {{commonly}} encountered polymorph; it is formed at temperatures greater than 1700°C and has a hexagonal crystal structure (similar to Wurtzite). The beta modification (β-SiC), with a zinc blende crystal structure (similar to diamond), is formed at temperatures below 1700°C. Until recently, the beta form has had relatively few commercial uses, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> increasing interest in its use as a support for heterogeneous catalysts, owing to its higher surface area compared to the alpha form.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{foundation}} in the United Kingdom, Scouting {{spread around the}} globe. The first association outside the British Empire was founded in Chile in May 21, 1909 after a visit to Baden Powell. In most countries of the world, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> at least one Scouting (or Guiding) organization. Each is independent, but international cooperation continues {{to be seen as}} part of the Scout Movement. In 1922 the WOSM started as the governing body on policy for the national Scouting organizations (then male only). In addition to being the governing policy body, it organizes the World Scout Jamboree every four years.|$|E

5|$|Rùm is {{also noted}} for its bird life. The {{population}} of 70,000 Manx shearwaters {{is one of the}} largest breeding colonies in the world. These migrating birds spend their winters in the South Atlantic off Brazil, and return to Rùm every summer to breed in underground burrows high in the Cuillin Hills. White-tailed sea eagles were exterminated on the island by 1912 and later became extinct in Scotland. A programme of reintroduction began in 1975, and within ten years 82 young sea eagles from Norway had been released. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> a successful breeding population in the wild.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of home baking in Israel arising from the years when {{there were very few}} bakeries to meet demand. Many professional bakers came to Israel from Central Europe and founded local pastry shops and bakeries, often called konditoria, thus shaping local tastes and preferences. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> a local style with a wide selection of cakes and pastries that includes influences from other cuisines and combines traditional European ingredients with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ingredients, such as halva, phyllo dough, dates, and rose water.|$|E

5|$|Two planarian {{species have}} been used {{successfully}} in the Philippines, Indonesia, Hawaii, New Guinea, and Guam to control populations of the imported giant African snail Achatina fulica, which was displacing native snails. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> concern that these planarians may themselves become {{a serious threat to}} native snails. In northwest Europe, there are concerns about the spread of the New Zealand planarian Arthurdendyus triangulatus, which preys on earthworms.|$|E
5|$|Helena, knowing Ruiz is soon {{scheduled}} to testify, makes {{a deal with}} Juan Obregón (Bratt), lord of the drug cartel, who forgives the Ayala family's debt and has Ruiz poisoned. Ayala is released, much to the dissatisfaction of Gordon, who is still angry over his partner's death. During a phone conversation between Ayala and Metzger, Ayala deduces that it was Metzger who originally informed on Ruiz. Evidently in a bid for power with another drug cartel in Mexico, Metzger accepted $3 million to inform on Ruiz to the FBI and facilitate the Ayala organization's downfall. Ayala says that Metzger was planning on taking over Ayala's empire completely. As Ayala hangs up the phone, Metzger {{looks up to see}} two hit men entering his office. Soon after Ayala's release, Gordon bursts into the Ayala home during his homecoming celebration. Bodyguards wrestle him to the ground, but Gordon is able to surreptitiously plant a listening bug under Ayala's desk. Gordon is forced from the property, with the satisfaction of knowing that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> a new opportunity to trap Ayala.|$|E
5|$|Pagan priests, too, were {{interested}} in suppressing any threat to traditional religion. The Christian Arnobius, writing during Diocletian's reign, attributes financial concerns to provisioners of pagan services:The augurs, the dream interpreters, the soothsayers, the prophets, and the priestlings, ever vain...fearing that their own arts be brought to nought, and that they may extort but scanty contributions from the devotees, now few and infrequent, cry aloud, 'The gods are neglected, and in the temples <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> a very thin attendance. Former ceremonies are exposed to derision, and the time-honoured rites of institutions once sacred have sunk before the superstitions of new religions.'They believed their ceremonies were hindered {{by the presence of}} Christians, who were thought to cloud the sight of oracles and stall the gods' recognition of their sacrifices.|$|E
