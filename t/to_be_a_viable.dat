5|$|The {{continued}} {{exploration of}} Saturn {{is still considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> option for NASA {{as part of their}} ongoing New Frontiers program of missions. NASA previously requested for plans to be put forward for a mission to Saturn that included an atmospheric entry probe and possible investigations into the habitability and possible discovery of life on Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} {{managers}} of pop groups {{knew about the}} income music merchandising could generate, as very few artists survived long enough in the pop domain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> investment. As far as Epstein was concerned it was merely good public relations, and any revenue that arose {{from the sale of}} Beatles-endorsed products was regarded as merely extra money that supplemented the Beatles' individual incomes from live performances and record sales. Epstein had not recognised an industry which had grossed $20 million for Elvis Presley in 1957 alone.|$|E
5|$|The Sega Neptune was a two-in-one Genesis and 32X console which Sega {{planned to}} release in fall 1995, with the retail price {{planned to be}} {{something}} less than US$200. Sega cancelled the Neptune in October 1995, citing fears that it would dilute their marketing for the Saturn while being priced {{too close to the}} Saturn <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> competitor. Electronic Gaming Monthly used the Sega Neptune as an April Fools' Day prank in its April 2001 issue. The issue included a small article in which the writers announced that Sega had found a warehouse full of old Sega Neptunes, and were selling them on a website for only $50.|$|E

5|$|The 1904 Democratic National Convention {{was held}} in July in St. Louis, Missouri, then also hosting the 1904 World's Fair and the 1904 Summer Olympics. Parker's mentor David B. Hill—having {{attempted}} and failed to capture the nomination himself at the 1892 convention—now led the campaign for his protege's nomination. William Jennings Bryan, who had been nominated but defeated by William McKinley in both 1896 and 1900, was no longer considered by delegates <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> alternative. Radicals in the party supported publisher William Randolph Hearst but lacked sufficient numbers to secure the nomination due to opposition from Bryan and Tammany Hall, a powerful New York political machine. Small clusters of delegates pledged support to other candidates, including Missouri Senator Francis Cockrell; Richard Olney, Grover Cleveland's Secretary of State; Edward C. Wall, a former Wisconsin State Representative; and George Gray, a former Senator from Delaware. Other delegates spoke of nominating Cleveland, who had already served two nonconsecutive terms, but Cleveland was no longer popular outside the party or even within it, due to his rift with Bryan.|$|E
25|$|It is arguable that {{in such a}} retail/planning policy {{environment}} use of bicycles ceases <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> {{option for}} many shoppers and access to a private motor-car or public transport becomes a necessary prerequisite for access to basic services.|$|E

25|$|GNU Hurd is the multiserver {{microkernel}} {{written as}} part of GNU.

25|$|In {{doing so}} the master {{constraint}} programme has been satisfactorily {{tested in a}} number of model systems with non-trivial constraint algebras, free and interacting field theories. The master constraint for LQG was established as a genuine positive self-adjoint operator and the physical Hilbert space of LQG was shown to be non-empty, an obvious consistency test LQG must pass <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> theory of quantum General relativity.|$|E
25|$|Electron capture is a {{decay mode}} for {{isotopes}} that will occur {{when there are}} too many protons in the nucleus of an atom and insufficient energy to emit a positron. However, it continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> decay mode for radioactive isotopes that can decay by positron emission. K-electron capture was discovered by Luis Alvarez, who demonstrated it in 1937 and reported it in The Physical Review in April 1938.|$|E

50|$|Buses began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> alternative <b>to</b> streetcars, {{because they}} were much less expensive to purchase.

They installed solar heating panels and a huge water slide, as well as additional dry-side activities to try to improve {{the viability of the}} pool.

25|$|Mauritius {{became the}} focus of the Great Experiment, as its {{plantation}} economy was still in a state of expansion, hence with room for agricultural flexibility, in contrast to those of the West Indies, which were considered exhausted. The long term planning needed in agriculture meant that plantations were generally unable to respond to the sudden market changes. When the sugar beet proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> and cheaper alternative to the sugar cane, the established sugar plantations throughout the Caribbean became economic liabilities, while thousands of their contracted workers and slaves were left to wallow. In addition, the island's proximity to India was also an advantage.|$|E

25|$|Penn {{received}} a hearty welcome upon his arrival {{and found his}} province much changed in the intervening 18 years. Pennsylvania was growing rapidly and now had nearly 18,100 inhabitants and Philadelphia over 3,000. His tree plantings were providing the green urban spaces he had envisioned. Shops were full of imported merchandise, satisfying the wealthier citizens and proving America <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> market for English goods. Most importantly, religious diversity was succeeding. Despite the protests of fundamentalists and farmers, Penn's insistence that Quaker grammar schools be open to all citizens was producing a relatively educated work force. High literacy and open intellectual discourse led to Philadelphia becoming a leader in science and medicine. Quakers were especially modern in their treatment of mental illness, decriminalising insanity and turning away from punishment and confinement.|$|E
25|$|Some life extensionists {{suggest that}} {{therapeutic}} cloning and {{stem cell research}} could one day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as reproductive cloning) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. Recently, the US Department of Defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice. Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, {{have not yet been}} replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to rejection and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of 2006, the implantation of bio-engineered bladders grown from patients' own cells has proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> treatment for bladder disease. Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Hitchens (13 April 1949 – 15 December 2011) was a British-American author, polemicist, debater and {{journalist}} {{who in his}} youth took part in demonstrations against the Vietnam War, joined organisations such as the International Socialists while at university and began to identify as a socialist. However, after the 11 September attacks he no longer regarded himself as a socialist and his political thinking became largely dominated by the issue of defending civilization from terrorists and against the totalitarian regimes that protect them. Hitchens nonetheless continued to identify as a Marxist, endorsing the materialist conception of history, but believed that Karl Marx had underestimated the revolutionary nature of capitalism. He sympathized with libertarian ideals of limited state interference, but considered libertarianism not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> system. In the 2000 U.S. presidential election, he supported the independent candidate Ralph Nader. After 9/11, Hitchens advocated the invasion of Iraq. In the 2004 election, he very slightly favored the incumbent Republican President George W. Bush or was neutral and in 2008 he favored the Democratic candidate Barack Obama.|$|E
