Croxall argues that [...] "the essay should be taken seriously by a musician, because it makes one think, and <b>think</b> <b>hard</b> enough to straighten many of one's ideas; ideas, I mean, not only on art, but on life" [...] {{and goes on to}} discuss the psychological, existential, and musical value of the work.|$|E
500|$|Toscanini, Beecham {{and many}} others {{regarded}} Sargent as the finest choral conductor in the world. Even orchestral musicians gave him credit: the principal violist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra wrote of him, [...] "He is able to instil into the singers a life and efficiency they never dreamed of. You have only to see {{the eyes of a}} choral society screwing into him like hundreds of gimlets to understand what he means to them." [...] However, another of Sargent's colleagues, Sir Adrian Boult, said of him, [...] "e was a great all-rounder but never developed his potentialities, which were enormous, simply because he didn't <b>think</b> <b>hard</b> enough about music – he never troubled to improve on a successful interpretation. He was too interested in other things, and not single-minded enough about music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{breakdown}} of negotiations in 2008, there have been repeated attempts to revive the talks, so far without success. Intense negotiations, mostly between the US, China, and India, were held {{at the end of}} 2008 seeking agreement on negotiation modalities, an impasse which was not resolved. In April 2011, then director-general Pascal Lamy [...] "asked members to <b>think</b> <b>hard</b> about 'the consequences of throwing away ten years of solid multilateral work'."
