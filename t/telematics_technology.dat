40|$|Abstract: The European laws on {{privacy and}} {{personal}} data protection and the Italian law on {{personal data protection}} in particular, together with the wide employment of informatics and <b>telematics</b> <b>technologies</b> in Health Care systems, require strong authentication solutions in order to grant access to medical information in a secure way. Many technologies are available, some having been used for years, some others being relatively new. In this paper a critical outline of them is made, focusing on Smart Card technologies and standards. New hardware-token devices are considered and the tests performed at our Health Telematics Laboratory are presented. Technical and economic comparisons and considerations are made, in order to underline new possibilities to deploy security services inside Health Care structures and to the citizen. Mature technologies (such as web access to clinical data, and usage of e-mail to exchange private information) {{can take advantage of}} strong authentication, to be used in critical Health Care environments, thus allowing for wide implementation, acceptance and usage of services based on informatics and <b>telematics</b> <b>technologies</b> in medicine...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} impacts {{that may}} be expected from new information and telecommunication systems applied to transport are considerable. However, {{as is the case}} with any new technological innovation, at the basis of success of transport telematics lies the acceptance by potential users, which suggests that there is a clear need to investigate the user side of these technologies. Given this need to explore the interaction between human behaviour and transport telematics, the aim of this paper is to investigate behavioral factors and their interrelationships in the use and diffusion of new <b>telematics</b> <b>technologies.</b> We will focus our attention on those systems which provide information to various categories of users, viz. public transport users and private car users. A conceptual framework is presented that covers all variables of interest for the investigation of user responses to these technologies. An important explanatory variable for acceptance of new <b>telematics</b> <b>technologies</b> is user segmentation; it has to be recognized that the effects of respective technological innovations will vary between various groups of transport users. In analyzing in more detail the dynamics of individual behaviour, we will also present a theoretical concept of information use by...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{main goal}} of the PROMPT project has been to develop <b>telematics</b> <b>technologies</b> to provide high quality patient services, {{particularly}} {{in the management of}} clinical knowledge and its integration with patient data to offer relevant and timely support for clinical decision making at the point of care. To achieve this goal, the project has built the components of an integrated care station centred on a multimedia electronic patient record, decision and protocol support software, and <b>telematics</b> communications <b>technologies.</b> The care station offers a wide range of services based on support for the provision of protocol and guideline-based healthcare. Both the PROMPT electronic patient record, designed to be at the centre of a cancer shared care network built in South West France, and PROMPT protocol and decision support technology (PROforma) have been shown to offer state-of-the-art functionality in the field of healthcare telematics products. Validation activities undertaken by the project have confirmed their high potential for impact on the practice and quality of healthcare, and both are currently being successfully commercialised. This paper describes the development, evaluation, dissemination and exploitation of advanced information technologies for healthcare built by the PROMPT project. 1...|$|R

Flexible and {{effective}} information services in transport call for novel and emerging <b>telematics</b> <b>technologies.</b> Such services require integration and {{processing of data}} coming from different information sources together with simple interfaces to make them available via static and mobile devices. A significant development for transport information services can be achieved exploiting networks featuring mobile nodes –with different characteristics and properties- represented by vehicles moving on road network. A semantic-based approach applied to such networks, allows building a high level infrastructure-mobile semantic grid- able to meet requirements of mobile grid with the interaction between connected devices and generic users provided with a simple interface, e. g. a handheld device. In this context the city of Bari, the test site for Pitagora project, represents the first step towards {{the development of a}} mobile semantic grid at a real scale. In this grid buses represent nodes as elements of intermodal transport system. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} a fully {{cooperative}} control scheme that produces both effective traffic schedules for the traffic lights and suitable speeds for oncoming vehicles {{to get through}} intersections during green-light time. The {{ultimate goal is to}} reduce substantially the delay, fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission. The proposed system is shown to have achieved this goal, compared to a base-line system. More specifically, the controller optimizes traffic signals of a single intersection online. The mathematical model used {{to solve the problem of}} scheduling is a Markov Decision Process, and the solution is found by Approximate Dynamic Programming. The controller employs a simulation-based method to compute suitable speeds for vehicles to get through intersections during green lights. The speeds are broadcast to vehicles via <b>telematics</b> (<b>technologies</b> that allow communications between vehicles and infrastructure). The controller is implemented and evaluated in a microscopic simulation environment. A fixed-time controller is built from schedules produced by the TRAffic Network StudY Tool (TRANSYT) software.
