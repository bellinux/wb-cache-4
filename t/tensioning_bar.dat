40|$|The use of externally-bonded (EB) or near-surface mounted (NSM) FRP {{reinforcement}} in {{the strengthening}} of reinforced concrete (RC) beams in flexure has become increasingly popular in recent years. Such beams are likely to fail by end cover separation in which a major crack in the concrete initiates at a cut-off point of the FRP reinforcement and propagates along the level of steel <b>tension</b> <b>bars,</b> leading to the detachment of the FRP reinforcement together with the cover concrete. Due {{to the complexity of}} this failure mode, no reliable finite element (FE) approach for its accurate prediction has been published despite many previous experimental and theoretical studies on the problem. This paper presents a novel FE approach for predicting end cover separation failures in RC beams strengthened in flexure with either externally bonded or near-surface mounted FRP reinforcement. In the proposed FE approach, careful consideration is given to the constitutive modelling of concrete and interfaces. Furthermore, the critical debonding plane at the level of steel <b>tension</b> <b>bars</b> is given special attention: the radial stresses exerted by the steel <b>tension</b> <b>bars</b> onto the surrounding concrete are identified to be an important factor {{for the first time ever}} and are properly included in the FE approach. The proposed FE approach is shown to provide accurate predictions of test results, including load-deflection curves, failure loads and crack patterns.

50|$|The Ransome Victory Plough's most {{recognizable}} {{feature is the}} vertically adjustable pivot wheel {{in front of the}} ploughshare (as opposed to a cutting knife or wheel). This pivot wheel, combined with an offset <b>tension</b> <b>bar</b> to which the chain from the yoke is connected, causes the forward motion of oxen to force the blade into the soil. However, the <b>tension</b> <b>bar</b> is typically far weaker than the main plough beam, and is likely {{the first part of the}} plough to break. The difficulty of accessing spare parts causes many farmers to simply chain the oxen to the front of the beam, after which the ploughman must use his own strength to keep the plowshare in the soil. Another notable feature is the relatively short mouldboard, which lessens the amount of draft force necessary to pull the plow.|$|R

The {{other end of the}} levers is coupled via universal joints to <b>tension</b> <b>bars,</b> which are then coupled via more universal joints to the driving rail wheel.|$|R
40|$|Kolsky <b>tension</b> <b>bar</b> {{techniques}} were modified for dynamic high-temperature tensile characterization of thin-sheet alloys. An induction coil heater {{was used to}} heat the specimen while a cooling system was applied to keep the bars at room temperature during heating. A preload system was developed to generate a small pretension load in the bar system during heating in order {{to compensate for the}} effect of thermal expansion generated in the high-temperature tensile specimen. A laser system was applied to directly measure the displacements {{at both ends of the}} tensile specimen in order to calculate the strain in the specimen. A pair of high-sensitivity semiconductor strain gages was used to measure the weak transmitted force due to the low flow stress in the thin specimen at elevated temperatures. As an example, the high-temperature Kolsky <b>tension</b> <b>bar</b> was used to characterize a DOP- 26 iridium alloy in high-strain-rate tension at 860 [*]s− 1 / 1030 [*]∘C...|$|R
40|$|Uniaxial tensile {{experiments}} {{were performed on}} pig skin to investigate the tensile stressestrain response at both quasi-static and dynamic rates of deformation. A Kolsky <b>tension</b> <b>bar,</b> also called a split Hopkinson <b>tension</b> <b>bar</b> (SHTB), was modified to conduct the dynamic experiments. Semiconductor strain gages were {{used to measure the}} low levels of the transmitted signal from pig skin. A pulse shaper technique was used for generating a suitable incident pulse to ensure stress equilibrium and approximate constant strain rate in the specimen of a thin skin sheet wrapped around the ends of the bars for minimizing radial inertia. In order to investigate the strain-rate effect over a wide range of strain rates, quasi-static tests were also performed. The experimental results show that pig skin exhibits rate-sensitive, orthotropic, and non-linear behavior. The response along the spine direction is stiffer at lower rate but is less rate sensitive than the perpendicular direction. An Ogden model with two material constants is adopted to describe the rate-sensitive tensile behavior of the pig skin...|$|R

Due to a later improved calibration of the split-Hopkinson <b>tension</b> <b>bar,</b> the stresses had to be corrected and were about 5 % lower than initially presented in [9]. For completeness, the corrected data is used in this work for Table 2, Figs. 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21.|$|R

50|$|Juravsky {{was able}} {{to prove that the}} closer to a bridge's pillars, the greater the strain on the {{vertical}} <b>tension</b> <b>bars</b> and diagonal braces. So, he proposed to make the truss members of varying thickness depending on a specific location. His ideas were endorsed by Whistler, and then used in the construction of other rail bridges on this line. As the road was built in the forward direction, it was necessary to build 278 artificial structures.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{thermomechanical}} behavior of aluminum. Experimental {{work has been}} conducted {{for a wide range}} of temperatures and strain rates for three AA 6060 alloys in both quasi-static and split-Hopkinson <b>tension</b> <b>bar</b> test rigs. An induction heater system, pyrometer and high-speed camera was used to obtain elevated temperatures and information about the geometry in the necked section of the specimen. Some tests show slightly different material behavior between the alloys studied with respect to yield stress and strain hardening. However, no coherent difference can be established as the deviations are not seen from all tests, and are probably not significant. Three material models have been fitted with an available database containing material data for a similar alloy {{for a wide range of}} strain rates and temperatures. No adequate fit is obtained for the investigated models using the procedure described, but some significant differences between the models are seen. Numerical simulations of the split-Hopkinson <b>tension</b> <b>bar</b> experiments have been performed, but no good prediction for the material behavior until fracture was found. The reason for this is believed to be the material model parameters implemented. Numerical simulations with damage coupling have also been performed and show that fracture is predicted earlier. </p...|$|R
40|$|Tension {{testing in}} Kolsky bars {{has been used}} to {{determine}} dynamic material behavior since 1960. In the classical Kolsky compression bar, pulse shaping has been developed in order to subject the specimen to desired dynamic loading conditions. This usually entails dynamic equilibrium of the specimen. Pulse shaping methods in Kolsky <b>tension</b> <b>bars</b> have not matured as quickly as compression setups due to the complexity of loading methods and the gripping of the specimen. Developing an apparatus that can utilize the better-understood compression pulse shaping methods is then advantageous. A modified Kolsky <b>tension</b> <b>bar</b> where a hollow incident tube is used to carry the incident stress waves has been developed. The incident tube also acts as a gas gun barrel that houses the striker for impact. The striker impacts {{on the end of the}} incident tube through compression pulse shapers that are attached to the end cap. In order to accommodate free travel of the striker pressure-release slots are added to the tube. The effect of discontinuities on the stress pulse and interface interactions will be discussed. In order to validate the testing technique material behavior for Al 6061 -T 6511, AISI 4130 steel, and TWIP (Twinning Induced Plasticity) steel have been tested. ...|$|R

These higher dowel forces together with the highly concentrated bond stresses in HSC beams, result in higher bond-splitting stresses where the shear cracks cross the longitudinal <b>tension</b> <b>bars.</b> These combined effects can lead finally to brittle shear failures. The applicability of the resistance-demand procedure is examined by comparing the predictions of the procedure with the experimental shear strength of the beams. The results of the comparison are presented and discussed.|$|R

For carbon fiber reinforced composites commonly the specimen are mounted using glued end caps. An alternative mounting concept is presented.

The results showed that for low striker velocities of 4 m/s the alternative mounting is suitable. With this alternative approach other specimen dimensions are possible and the testing is less time consuming...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} {{number of studies have}} been conducted on the shear strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) beams with externally bonded fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement in the forms of strips, plates or sheets. However, most of these studies have been experimentally based and only a very limited amount of research is available on the numerical modelling of such beams using the finite element (FE) method. The lack of in-depth FE studies is chiefly due to the challenging nature of modelling shear cracking in RC beams and the interfaces between different materials. This paper presents the results of a recent study in which an advanced FE model was employed to investigate the effects of different modelling assumptions for the interfaces between concrete and steel stirrups, between concrete and steel <b>tension</b> <b>bars,</b> and between concrete and FRP on the predicted shear behaviour of RC beams shear-strengthened with FRP. It first outlines the FE model followed by a number of numerical examples to validate it. The effect of varying the bond-slip modelling approach for each interface is then investigated to illustrate its significance. The results presented in this paper show that proper modelling of the bond behaviour of all three types of interfaces is essential in order to accurately simulate the shear behaviour of RC beams shear-strengthened with FRP and that the effects of the assumed bond behaviour of steel stirrups or steel <b>tension</b> <b>bars</b> are very complex and need much further research...|$|R

This testing apparatus is intended for material characterization requiring large amounts of elongation, necessitated either by large specimen dimensions, or large strains to failure. The design proposed here can be assembled from off the shelve components {{without the need for}} specialized machining tools. The simple mechanical design is accompanied by a comparatively low-cost, yet high-speed, means of independently measuring specimen strain using a fast line scan camera. The performance of this SHTB implementation is demonstrated by obtaining intermediate strain rate results for tensile yield strength of Polycarbonate in an unprecedented quality...|$|R
40|$|Split Hopkinson <b>tension</b> <b>bar</b> (SHTB) is {{a common}} device for the {{characterization}} of high-rate tensile behavior of engineering materials. However, when the specimen is a soft material, challenges are encountered in the efforts to design and grip the specimen, to achieve dynamic stress equilibrium, and to measure the weak transmitted signals. In this research, we modified the SHTB on the loading pulse, the equilibrium-monitoring system, and the specimen geometry. The results on a soft rubber indicate that the specimen deforms under dynamic stress equilibrium at a nearly constant strain rate. Inertia effects commonly encountered in dynamic characterization of soft materials have been minimized in both axial and radial directions...|$|R

The structures of the coverings are determined and the coordinates of each circle are calculated with high precision using a mathematical model for an idealized physical structure consisting of <b>tensioned</b> <b>bars</b> and frictionless pin joints. Best found coverings of a square with up to 30 circles are displayed, 17 of which are new or improve on earlier published coverings...|$|R

In this paper, momentum traps were introduced for rendering the conventional Split Hopkinson <b>Tension</b> <b>Bar</b> suitable for loading-unloading experiment. The new technique allows a specimen to be loaded to a preset strain for post-test characterization. This technique was applied to study the dynamic mechanical properties of pure titanium.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the present paper is to show how and to what extent the {{introduction}} of refined, shear sensitive models improves on previous ones, based on triaxiality only, for the phenomenological description of ductile damage in bulk cold metal forming processes. Wire-drawing and wire rolling are taken as examples. A set of mechanical tests has been conducted: round <b>bar</b> <b>tension,</b> notched <b>bar</b> <b>tension,</b> plane strain tension, and torsion for pure shear deformation. Both constitutive and damage model parameters have been carefully identified, with back-computation of the laboratory tests for validation. Application of the models to the cold forming processes, described here, shows the superiority of the shear-enhanced models for locating maximum damage in flat wire rolling, where a significant amount of shear is present (“blacksmith's cross” deformation pattern). On the contrary, it proves unnecessary for low-shear processes such as wire-drawing. The cavity-growth Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman model seems to be the best basis for damage prediction in patented high carbon steel, a very ductile material...|$|R

The small-scale yielding problem is modeled, and expressions for crack tip opening displacement, shear singularity amplitude, and plastic zone extent are derived. A finite element solution to the large-scale yielding of a circumferentially cracked round <b>tension</b> <b>bar</b> is obtained.
