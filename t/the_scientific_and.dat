5|$|After the war, Bacher {{returned}} to Ithaca to head Cornell's Laboratory for Nuclear Studies. He agreed with Bethe that what Cornell needed {{to become a}} major player in high energy nuclear physics was a new synchrotron, but first he needed to find somewhere to put it. However, in 1946 Bacher was appointed to <b>the</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>and</b> Technical Subcommittee of the new United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, along with fellow United States representatives Tolman and Oppenheimer. Bacher therefore had to divide his time between Ithaca and New York City.|$|E

5|$|Hazard maps {{showing that}} Armero would be {{completely}} flooded after an eruption were distributed {{more than a month}} before the eruption, but the Colombian Congress criticized <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> civil defense agencies for scaremongering.

5|$|In 1952, the Technicolor Corporation {{contracted}} with SRI {{to develop a}} near-instantaneous, electro-optical alternative to the manual process of timing during film copying. In 1959, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented <b>the</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>and</b> Engineering Award jointly to SRI and Technicolor for their work on the design {{and development of the}} Technicolor electronic printing timer which greatly benefited the motion picture industry. In 1954, Southern Pacific asked SRI to investigate ways of reducing damage during rail freight shipments by mitigating shock to railroad box cars. This investigation led to William K. MacCurdy's development of the Hydra-Cushion technology, which remains standard today.|$|E
5|$|Ostrom's {{description}} of Deinonychus in 1969 {{has been described}} as the most important single discovery of dinosaur paleontology in the mid-20th century. The discovery of this clearly active, agile predator did much to change <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> (<b>and</b> popular) conception of dinosaurs and opened the door to speculation that dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded. This development has been termed the dinosaur renaissance. Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the forefeet of Deinonychus and that of birds, an observation which led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs. Forty years later, this idea is almost universally accepted.|$|E

30|$|The {{motivation}} of the approximate translation invariance {{is to take}} the relation between <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> market <b>and</b> <b>the</b> social network into consideration. In rough approximation, <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> market <b>and</b> <b>the</b> social network can be considered as relatively independent. Consequently, their contributions to φ(w) are additive. Summing (6), and (7), we obtain (8), i.e., approximate translation invariance. The Eq. 8 therefore expresses some kind of linear superposition of the effect of <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> market <b>and</b> <b>the</b> social network. This superposition is not valid in the general case.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> {{technological}} {{impact of}} extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves {{would probably be}} quite small, especially at first. However, if the message contains {{a large amount of}} information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the human species itself, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come to know that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization.|$|E

5|$|Apollo Hall opened {{soon after}} the city's {{founding}} in 1859 and staged many plays for eager settlers. In the 1880s Horace Tabor built Denver's first opera house. After {{the start of the}} 20th century, city leaders embarked on a city beautification program that created many of the city's parks, parkways, museums, and the Municipal Auditorium, which was home to the 1908 Democratic National Convention and is now known as the Ellie Caulkins Opera House. Denver and the metropolitan areas around it continued to support culture. In 1988, voters in the Denver Metropolitan Area approved <b>the</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>and</b> Cultural Facilities Tax (commonly known as SCFD), a 0.1% (1 cent per $10) sales tax that contributes money to various cultural and scientific facilities and organizations throughout the Metro area.

5|$|Croatia and Hungary {{have agreed}} to the Cultural Cooperation Programme, which defines {{cooperation}} and cultural exchange {{in the fields of}} music, theatre and dance, and with respect to the arts, museums, galleries, literature, publishing, libraries, archives, film and cultural-heritage protection. The programme was agreed to on 7 November 2011 in Budapest by secretaries of the Croatian Ministry of Culture and the Hungarian Ministry of National Resources. The programme pertains to the 20122014 period and represents a continuation of cultural cooperation through cultural exchange, outside the framework of formal agreements. Cultural, educational and scientific cooperation between the two countries is covered by a treaty of 16 March 1994, with additional treaties regulating diploma recognitions since 16 June 1997 and additional treaties and protocols on scientific and technological cooperation signed in 2002 and 2009. <b>The</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> educational cooperation entails the awarding of scholarships and bilateral research projects.|$|E
5|$|In 1778, {{he went to}} Germany to take a {{teaching}} position as a Natural History professor at the Collegium Carolinum in Kassel, where he met Therese Heyne, the daughter of classicist Christian Gottlob Heyne. She later {{became one of the}} first independent female writers in Germany. They married in 1785 (which was after he left Kassel) and had three children, but their marriage was not happy. From his time in Kassel on, Forster actively corresponded with important figures of the Enlightenment, including Lessing, Herder, Wieland and Goethe. He also initiated cooperation between the Carolinum in Kassel and the University of Göttingen where his friend Georg Christoph Lichtenberg worked. Together, they founded and published <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> literary journal Göttingisches Magazin der Wissenschaften und Litteratur. Forster's closest friend, Samuel Thomas von Sömmering, arrived in Kassel shortly after Forster, and both were soon involved with the Rosicrucians in Kassel.|$|E

5|$|This {{problem has}} been the object of growing concern. For example, {{researchers}} at the University of Hohenheim are studying how bees can be poisoned by exposure to seed disinfectants. In France, the Ministry of Agriculture commissioned an expert group, <b>the</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>and</b> Technical Committee for the Multifactorial Study on Bees (CST), to study the intoxicating and sometimes fatal effects of chemicals used in agriculture on bees. Researchers at the Bee Research Institute and the Department of Food Chemistry and Analysis in the Czech Republic have pondered the intoxicating effects of various chemicals used to treat winter rapeseed crops. Romania suffered a severe case of widespread bee intoxication and extensive bee mortality from deltamethrin in 2002. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) even has published standards for testing chemicals for bee intoxication.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the ascent}} of the Bourbon monarchy in Spain in 1700, {{each of the}} regions of Spain {{retained}} its own system of measurement. The new Bourbon monarchy tried to centralise control {{and with it the}} system of measurement. There were debates regarding the desirability of retaining the Castilian units of measure or, in the interests of harmonisation, adopting the French system. Although Spain assisted Méchain in his meridian survey, the Government feared the French revolutionary movement and reinforced the Castilian units of measure to counter such movements. By 1849 however, it proved difficult to maintain the old system and in that year the metric system became the legal system of measure in Spain.The Government was urged by the Spanish Royal Academy of Science to approve the creation of a large-scale map of Spain in 1852. The following year Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero was appointed to undertake this task. All <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> technical material had to be created. Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero and Saavedra went to Paris to supervise the production by Brunner of a measuring instrument which they had devised and which they later compared with Borda's double-toise N°1 which was the main reference for measuring all geodetic bases in France and whose length was 3.8980732 metres.|$|E
5|$|We {{shall not}} feel that the generalization, {{unqualified}} and to be taken literally, is meant to march out of its context to compete with <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>and</b> philosophical generalizations which dominate our world. 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty' has precisely the same status, and the same justification as Shakespeare's 'Ripeness is all.' It is a speech 'in character' and supported by a dramatic context. To conclude thus may seem to weight the principle of dramatic propriety with more than it can bear. This would not be fair {{to the complexity of}} the problem of truth in art nor fair to Keats's little parable. Granted; and yet the principle of dramatic propriety may take us further than would first appear. Respect for it may at least insure our dealing with the problem of truth at the level on which it is really relevant to literature.|$|E
