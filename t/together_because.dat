5|$|Several reviewers {{compared}} Tipping the Velvet to Jeanette Winterson's Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for {{a similar}} story of a woman's sexual awakening. Waters credits Winterson as an influence in lesbian writing, but states that the books are quite different and her writing is not like Winterson's at all. Waters suggests that reviewers have bracketed them <b>together</b> <b>because</b> Winterson {{was the only other}} lesbian author they could recall.|$|E
5|$|At the airport, Jai is {{overwhelmed}} with guilt and asks Sahil to leave, {{to which he}} protests. Jai refutes his advances to reconcile, and tells him that they can never be <b>together</b> <b>because</b> they have vastly different lives. They part ways as a heartbroken Sahil watches him leave. As he is walking away into the airport, Jai sends a text message to Sahil saying that he loves him. Alex arrives at the airport to pick Sahil up, much to his surprise. He tries {{to make up for}} his mistakes by offering Sahil a heartfelt apology as the two drive back to their apartment.|$|E

50|$|Classical {{mechanics}} and special relativity are lumped <b>together</b> here <b>because</b> special relativity {{is in many}} ways intermediate between general relativity and classical mechanics, and shares many attributes with classical mechanics.|$|R
5|$|Cecil {{was drawn}} to {{resemble}} David Hyde Pierce, but still look similar to Bob. According to director Pete Michels, {{it was difficult to}} draw Bob and Cecil standing <b>together</b> <b>because</b> their feet are both so big. There was a scene featuring Hans Moleman and his house, which was cut, but his house can still briefly be seen in the scene where Cecil throws Bart off a cliff. The sequence was cut in order {{to make room for the}} explanation of why Bob was sent back to prison. Ken Keeler has said that it is his favorite deleted scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} is thought by some foreign policy analysts {{to be the}} basis for President George W. Bush's axis of evil line in his 2002 State of the Union Address, in which he accused Iraq, Iran, and North Korea of being state sponsors of terrorism and of pursuing weapons of mass destruction. The Rumsfeld Commission grouped the three countries <b>together</b> <b>because</b> they all were believed to be pursuing ballistic missile programs based on the Scud missile. In the pre-9/11 days of the Bush presidency, the administration had focused heavily on developing a national missile defense system to counter such threats. A month after the address, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who appointed Rumsfeld as head of the commission, mentioned the importance of the commission's findings in relation to the US ability to predict the threat posed by the axis members.|$|E

25|$|In practice, {{cards are}} rarely ganged <b>together</b> <b>because</b> open-collector {{operation}} has problems {{at high speeds}} and increases power consumption. Newer versions of the SD specification recommend separate lines to each card.|$|E
25|$|Bonatti, aged 81, died {{alone at}} a private clinic where the {{hospital}} management would not allow his partner of more than 30 years spend the last minutes of his life <b>together</b> <b>because</b> the two were not married. His funeral took place in Lecco on 18 September 2011, where he was cremated and the ashes interred in the cemetery of Porto Venere.|$|E
25|$|The five {{parts were}} {{initially}} separate works, {{but it was}} the elder Tolkien's express wish that they be published <b>together.</b> <b>Because</b> J. R. R. Tolkien died before he finished revising the various legends, Christopher gathered material from his father's older writings to fill out the book. In a few cases, this meant that he had to devise completely new material in order to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in the narrative.|$|E

2500|$|Enid Stubin calls Sam and Elenor Slovoda [...] "figures in {{a cautionary}} tale of {{contemporary}} courtship." [...] Their relationship is characterized by inertia: {{they seem to be}} <b>together</b> only <b>because</b> it would require more effort to part.|$|R

25|$|Taxonomy is {{the branch}} of biology that names and classifies all living things. Scientists use {{morphological}} and genetic similarities {{to assist them in}} categorising life forms based on ancestral relationships. For example, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans all belong to the same taxonomic grouping referred to as a family—in this case the family called Hominidae. These animals are grouped <b>together</b> <b>because</b> of similarities in morphology that come from common ancestry (called homology).|$|E
25|$|When {{drawing for}} UEFA European Championships Qualification a special measure {{is put in}} place where by Gibraltar and Spain cannot be drawn <b>together</b> <b>because</b> of the Disputed status of Gibraltar. The same system is in place for Azerbaijan and Armenia because of the poor {{relations}} between the two countries. The same measure was put in place for Russia and Georgia after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War but was however lifted for the Euro 2016 tournament when the two agreed to play each other again.|$|E
25|$|Archeologists {{from the}} University of Arkansas have {{determined}} {{the first people}} to occupy the area were Bluff Dwellers or Rock Shelter Indians. By the artifacts, arrowheads, rock hammers, and crude knives which have been found, they can tell which native peoples were here first. They also note that for each period of time there was a vast improvement in their relics. During this time several families lived <b>together</b> <b>because</b> the caves or shelters under bluffs were larger. These shelters were always near to a clear spring of bubbling water.|$|E
50|$|Valentina Zhuravleva was {{the wife}} of Genrich Altshuller, the {{inventor}} of TRIZ and a science fiction writer himself. They wrote many stories <b>together,</b> but <b>because</b> of anti-Semitic restrictions, they were published under the single name of Valentina Zhuravleva.|$|R
50|$|Several of the outtakes {{were later}} {{included}} on the 1996 reissues of the first four albums. The remixes of the tracks on The Family That Plays <b>Together</b> (necessitated <b>because</b> the master mix was lost shortly after the album's release) {{are different from the}} 1996 re-release.|$|R
50|$|Mountain hemlock often succeeds {{lodgepole}} pine or subalpine fir when these species pioneer on drier sites. It {{also tends to}} replace Engelmann spruce when the two species occur <b>together,</b> possibly <b>because</b> hemlock is better able to withstand the allelopathic effects of spruce than are other associated species.|$|R
25|$|On November 15, 1970, a {{memorial}} service {{was held at the}} indoor, 8,500-seat Veterans Memorial Fieldhouse with moments of silence, remembrances, and prayers. The following Saturday another Memorial Service was held at the outdoor, 18,000-seat Fairfield Stadium. Across the nation many expressed their condolences. Classes at Marshall, along with numerous events and shows by the Marshall Artists Series (and the football team's game against the Ohio Bobcats), were canceled and government offices were closed. A mass funeral was held at the Field House and many of the dead were buried at the Spring Hill Cemetery, some <b>together</b> <b>because</b> bodies were not identifiable.|$|E
25|$|In {{practice}} high {{rank and}} high status always go <b>together</b> <b>because</b> no high ranking woman would ever marry a commoner, and no chief would ever marry a low ranking woman. In fact when prince Alaivahamamao eloped with {{the daughter of}} a low chiefess Tuimala, he was stripped from his royal status and had to flee to Hawaii. Children from that marriage, grandchildren of the king, would have obtained no significant rank. Albeit later, after a divorce, Alai was reconciled with his father and married princess Alaileula from Sāmoa. He did not however become prince again and died in 2004 with only the noble title Māatu.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Erwin {{instituted a}} profit sharing and bonus program for all mill workers, {{something}} that was rare at a textile mill, especially in the South. Employees at the mill approved of Erwin’s supervision and many knew him on a personal level, as he visited {{all areas of the}} factory on a daily or weekly basis. He also funded and threw huge celebrations for the workers on holidays, particularly on July 4. The ability of mill’s management to keep workers happy was a major factor in holding the community of West Durham <b>together</b> <b>because</b> it ensured that workers had long careers at the mill, with their families residing in the mill town for many years.|$|E

25|$|On the 20th, Hood led Longstreet's assault that {{exploited}} {{a gap in}} the Federal line, {{which led}} to the defeat of Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans's Union Army of the Cumberland. However, Hood was once again wounded severely; his right femur was fractured and his leg was amputated four inches (100mm) below the hip. Hood's condition was so grave that the surgeon sent the severed leg along with him in the ambulance, assuming that they would be buried <b>together.</b> <b>Because</b> of Hood's bravery at Chickamauga, Longstreet recommended that he be promoted to lieutenant general as of that date, September 20, 1863; the confirmation by the Confederate Senate occurred on February 11, 1864, as Hood was preparing to return to duty.|$|E
25|$|His {{first years}} there were plagued by marital troubles: his wife's infidelity, and her {{gambling}} debts, which {{amounted to a}} sum larger than Telemann's annual income. The composer was saved from bankruptcy by the efforts of his friends, and by the numerous successful music and poetry publications Telemann made during the years 1725 to 1740. By 1736 husband and wife were no longer living <b>together</b> <b>because</b> of their financial disagreements. Although still active and fulfilling the many duties of his job, Telemann became less productive in the 1740s, for {{he was in his}} 60s. He took up theoretical studies, as well as hobbies such as gardening and cultivating exotic plants, something of a fad in Hamburg at that time, and a hobby shared by Handel.|$|E
25|$|Physicist John Taylor, who has {{investigated}} parapsychological claims, {{has written that}} an unknown fifth force causing psychokinesis would have to transmit {{a great deal of}} energy. The energy would have to overcome the electromagnetic forces binding the atoms <b>together,</b> <b>because</b> the atoms would need to respond more strongly to the fifth force than to electric forces. Such an additional force between atoms should therefore exist all the time and not during only alleged paranormal occurrences. Taylor wrote there is no scientific trace of such a force in physics, down to many orders of magnitude; thus, if a scientific viewpoint is to be preserved, the idea of any fifth force must be discarded. Taylor concluded that there is no possible physical mechanism for psychokinesis, and it is in complete contradiction to established science.|$|E
2500|$|McCartney and Starr both responded very {{positively}} to the completed album.
