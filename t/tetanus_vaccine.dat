25|$|<b>Tetanus</b> <b>vaccine,</b> {{also known}} as tetanus toxoid (TT), is an {{inactive}} vaccine used to prevent tetanus.|$|E
25|$|Tetanus can be {{prevented}} through the highly effective <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine,</b> which is a tetanus toxin inactivated with formaldehyde to be immunogenic but not pathogenic. The vaccine can be formulated as simple or adsorbed <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine,</b> combined tetanus and killed polio vaccine, or the older (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) (DPT) vaccine. Side effects are rare, {{but if they do}} occur, include fever, pain (sometimes long lasting) at the injection site, unexplained crying in infants, and irritability in older children or adults.|$|E
25|$|In {{children}} under the age of seven, the <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine</b> is often administered as a combined vaccine, DPT/DTaP vaccine, which also includes vaccines against diphtheria and pertussis. For adults and children over seven, the Td vaccine (tetanus and diphtheria) or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) is commonly used.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the Uniject {{has been called the}} single greatest leap forward in the battle against tetanus because it has allowed <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccines</b> to be used in places which were previously inaccessible to health programs.|$|R
40|$|Vaccines are {{of crucial}} {{importance}} to prevent {{morbidity and mortality}} due to infectious diseases in childhood. A modulation of the fetal/neonatal immune system (considered immature) toward Th 1 or Th 2 dominance could modify responses to vaccines administered in early life. T. cruzi is the agent of Chagas' disease, in Latin America currently infecting about 2 million women at fertile ages who are susceptible to transmitting the parasite to their fetus. In previous studies we showed that T. cruzi-infected mothers can induce a pro-inflammatory environment in their uninfected neonates (M+B−), whereas congenitally infected newborns (M+B+) are able to develop a pro-Th 1 parasite-specific T cell response. In the present study, we analysed the cellular and/or antibody responses to Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), hepatitis B birus (HBV), diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccines</b> in 6 - to 7 -month-old infants living in Bolivia. M+B− infants produced more IFN-γ in response to BCG, whereas M+B+ infants developed a stronger IFN-γ response to hepatitis B, diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccines</b> and enhanced antibody production to HBs antigen. These results show that both maternal infection with T. cruzi and congenital Chagas disease do not interfere with responses to BCG, hepatitis B, diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccines</b> in the neonatal period and that T. cruzi infection in early life tends to favour type 1 immune responses to vaccinal antigens...|$|R
40|$|In 1974 it was {{recommended}} that pertussis vaccine {{should continue to}} be offered in a triple vaccine together with diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Further data on the prevalence of whooping cough and the incidence of adverse reactions have shown no reason to change this policy; the hazard of whooping cough remains greater than that of immunization...|$|R
25|$|Tetanus {{has become}} {{uncommon}} in the United States, {{with an average}} of 29 reported cases per year from 1996 through 2009. Nearly all cases of tetanus are among those who have never received a <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine,</b> or adults who don't stay up to date on their 10-year booster shots.|$|E
25|$|Guidelines on {{prenatal}} {{care in the}} United States state that, if an urgent need for tetanus protection occurs during pregnancy, Td vaccine should be administered. If no urgent need arises and the woman has previously received <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine,</b> Td vaccination should be delayed until the postpartum period. All postpartum women who have not received Td or Tdap vaccine {{in the last two}} years are recommended to receive Tdap prior to discharge after delivery. It is recommended for pregnant women who have never received <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine</b> (i.e., have never received DTP, DTaP or DT as child or Td or TT as adult) to receive a series of three Td vaccinations starting during pregnancy to ensure protection against maternal and neonatal tetanus. In such cases, administration of Tdap is recommended after 20 weeks' gestation, and in earlier pregnancy a single dose of Tdap can be substituted for one dose of Td, and then the series completed with Td.|$|E
25|$|Infection can be {{prevented}} by proper immunization with the <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine.</b> In {{those who have a}} significant wound and less than three doses of the vaccine, both immunization and tetanus immune globulin are recommended. The wound should be cleaned and any dead tissue should be removed. In those who are infected tetanus immune globulin or, if it is not available, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used. Muscle relaxants may be used to control spasms. Mechanical ventilation may be required if a person's breathing is affected.|$|E

40|$|Recombinant {{derivatives}} of {{tetanus toxin}} (TeTx) were isolated {{and used to}} immunize mice. Recombinant TeTx light chain, a derivative of fragment C that had {{lost the ability to}} bind neurons, and a recombinant TeTx holotoxoid that could protect mice against TeTx challenge were identified. Tetanus toxin (TeTx), a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani, is a 150 -kDa protein, containing a 50 -kDa amino-termi-nal light-chain disulfide bonded to a 100 -kDa heavy chain (4, 6, 16). Fragment C, the 50 -kDa carboxy-terminal portion of the heavy chain, has ganglioside binding (9, 10, 14, 15) and protein binding (23) activities. Light chain, a zinc-dependent protease (24), mediates the blockade of inhibitor release from neurons by proteolysis of synaptobrevin (22). <b>Tetanus</b> <b>vaccines</b> are manufactured by formaldehyde inactivation of TeTx obtained from C. tetani. New <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccines</b> based upon recombinant antigens are in development. Recombinant fragment C puri-fied from Escherichia coli (5, 13), yeast cells (20), or culture...|$|R
25|$|Another {{option for}} infants is DT {{which is a}} vaccine that is a {{combination}} of diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccines.</b> This is given as an alternative to infants who have conflicts with the DTaP vaccine. Quadrivalent, pentavalent, and hexavalent formulations contain DTaP with {{one or more of the}} additional vaccines: inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate, Hepatitis B, with the availability varying in different countries.|$|R
25|$|A {{diphtheria}} {{vaccine is}} effective for prevention and {{available in a}} number of formulations. Three or four doses, given along with <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine</b> and pertussis vaccine, are recommended during childhood. Further doses are recommended every ten years. Protection can be verified by measuring the antitoxin level in the blood. Treatment is with the antibiotics erythromycin or benzylpenicillin. These antibiotics may also be used for prevention in those who have been exposed to the infection. A surgical procedure known as a tracheotomy is sometimes needed to open the airway in severe cases.|$|E
25|$|This ruling {{held that}} <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine</b> caused a {{particular}} case of optic neuritis even though no scientific evidence supported the petitioner's claim. Other rulings have allowed petitioners to gain awards for claims that the MMR vaccine causes fibromyalgia, that the Hib vaccine causes transverse myelitis, and that the hepatitis B vaccine causes Guillain–Barré syndrome, chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy, and multiple sclerosis. In the most extreme of these cases, a 2006 petitioner successfully claimed that a hepatitis B vaccine caused her multiple sclerosis despite several studies showing that the vaccine neither causes nor worsens the disease, and despite a conclusion by the Institute of Medicine that evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} vaccine {{combinations}} include the <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine</b> such as DTaP and Tdap which contain diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine, and DT and Td which contain diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine.</b> DTaP and DT {{are given to}} children less than seven years old while Tdap and Td are given to those seven years old and older. The lowercase d and p denote lower strengths of diphtheria and pertussis vaccines.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{discovery}} and productions of the <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccines,</b> {{the occurrence of}} tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis has decreased. Using US population derived figures, following vaccination, 95% of people are protected from diphtheria, 80% to 85% of people are protected from pertussis, and 100% of people are protected from <b>tetanus.</b> Before the <b>vaccine</b> there was an average of 580 annual cases of tetanus and 472 annual deaths from tetanus. But since the vaccine there is an average of 41 annual cases of tetanus and 4 annual deaths from tetanus. This is 93% reduction in occurrence of tetanus and a 99% reduction in fatalities resulting from tetanus.|$|R

50|$|The <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine</b> was {{developed}} in 1924 and became available in the United States in the 1940s. Its use resulted in a 95% decrease {{in the rate of}} tetanus. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 0.17 and 0.65 USD per dose as of 2014. In the United States a course of <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine</b> is between 25 and 50 USD.|$|E

40|$|The use of mice for the assay of tetanus toxoids {{would offer}} {{considerable}} advantages {{over the use}} of guinea-pigs, but mice cannot readily be immunized with the fluid tetanus toxoid at present designated as the International Standard. This study shows, however, that the mouse is a very suitable laboratory animal for the comparison of adsorbed tetanus toxoids, and that an AlPO 4 -adsorbed vaccine, which is stable at 4 °C, is a satisfactory reference preparation. The log-dose-response lines of toxoids adsorbed on different quantities of AlPO 4 and on various quantities of another adsorbent ran parallel to those of the reference vaccine. The 95 % confidence limits for the potencies of <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccines,</b> diphtheria-tetanus vaccines, and diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccines, determined by assay against the reference vaccine in mice, showed a high degree of reproducibility of the results...|$|R
40|$|Many {{infections that}} {{occur at the}} {{extremes}} of age are preventable by active or passive immunization. The immune response to vaccines in neonates and the elderly may be diminished when compared with other age groups, however this is usually outweighed by the benefits of providing protection at the age when the need is greatest. Immunoprophylactic agents used at birth include BCG vaccine, oral polio vaccine, varicella-zoster immunoglobulin and hepatitis B vaccine and immuno-globulin. In the elderly, influenza, pncumococcal and <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccines</b> are often indicated, although the uptake {{in this age group}} is poor in comparison with neonates...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{previously}} {{showed that}} newborns congenitally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi (M+B+) display a strong type 1 parasite-specific T cell immune response, whereas uninfected newborns from T. cruzi-infected mothers (M+B 2) {{are prone to}} produce higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines than control neonates (M 2 B 2). The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine if such fetal/neonatal immunological environments could alter the response to standard vaccines administered in early life. Methodology: Infants (6 – 7 months old) living in Bolivia, an area highly endemic for T. cruzi infection, and having received Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), hepatitis B virus (HBV), diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccines,</b> were enrolled into the M+B+, M+B 2, M 2 B 2 groups mentioned above. The production of IFN-c and IL- 13, as markers of Th 1 and Th 2 responses respectively, by peripherical blood mononuclear cells stimulated with tuberculin purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPD) or the vaccinal antigens HBs, diphtheria toxoid (DT) or tetanus toxoid (TT), as well as circulating levels of IgG antibodies against HBsAg, DT and TT were analyzed in infants. Cellular responses to the superantigen SEB were also monitored in M+B+, M+B 2, M 2 B 2 infants and newborns. Principal Findings: M+B+ infants developed a stronger IFN-c response to hepatitis B, diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccines</b> than did M+B 2 and M 2 B 2 groups. They also displayed an enhanced antibody production to HBsAg. This was associated with...|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} induce a {{stronger}} immune response, some versions of human chorionic gonadotropin-based anti-fertility vaccines were designed as conjugates of the β subunit of HCG covalently linked to tetanus toxoid. It has been alleged that a non-conjugated <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine</b> used {{in developing countries}} is laced with a human chorionic gonadotropin based anti-fertility drug and is distributed {{as a means of}} mass sterilization. [...] This charge has been vigorously denied by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF. [...] Others have argued that a hCG laced vaccine could not be used for sterilization since the effects of the anti-fertility vaccines are reversible (requiring booster doses to maintain immunity) and a non-conjugated vaccine is likely to be ineffective. [...] Finally, independent testing of the <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccine</b> by Kenya’s health authorities has revealed no traces of the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 In Africa, {{helminth}} and HIV {{infection is}} highly prevalent, making co-infection with helminths and HIV likely common. Both infections impact the host immune response through immune suppression and dysregulation, which {{also may have}} implications for vaccine efficacy and efforts to decrease vaccine preventable deaths. We sought to determine the impact of helminth infection on humoral immune responses to HIV and to previously administered measles and <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccines.</b> We developed a method to evaluate HIV-specific antibody responses using protein microarray and principal components analysis, and identified distinct patterns of HIV-specific antibody responses that correlate with concurrent viral load and subsequent change in CD 4 count. Within two randomized trials examining the effect of deworming on HIV disease progression, we conducted nested serologic studies to {{examine the impact of}} helminth infection (n= 100) and deworming (n= 35) on specific antibody responses. The prevalence of HIV specific antibody responses was similar between individuals with any helminth infection compared to helminth uninfected individuals. However, those with schistosomiasis infection had significantly lower HIV specific antibody responses compared to helminth uninfected adults. The prevalence of measles and tetanus antibody responses were similar between helminth infected and uninfected individuals. Comparing dewormed to placebo treated Ascaris and HIV co-infected adults, changes in measles and tetanus antibody responses over 3 months were comparable between treatment groups. Though helminths did not alter antibody responses to previously administered measles and <b>tetanus</b> <b>vaccines,</b> antibody responses to concurrent HIV infection may be diminished in individuals who are co-infected with some helminth species...|$|R
