5|$|As {{with other}} Bond novels, such as Casino Royale, {{gambling}} is a theme, {{with not only}} golf {{as part of the}} novel, but opening with the canasta game as well. Raymond Benson identified times in the novel when Bond's investigation of Goldfinger was a gamble too and cites Bond tossing a coin to decide on his tactics in relation to his quarry. Once more (as with Live and Let Die and Dr. No) it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem and this can be seen as Fleming's reaction to the lack of US support over the Suez Crisis in 1956 as well as Bond's warning to Goldfinger not <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> the English.|$|E
5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), nicotinic acid preparations or fibrates. Control of {{other risk factors}} for cardiovascular disease is required, as risk remains somewhat elevated even when cholesterol levels are controlled. Professional guidelines recommend {{that the decision to}} treat a person with FH with statins should not be based on the usual risk prediction tools (such as those derived from the Framingham Heart Study), as they are likely <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> the risk of cardiovascular disease; unlike the rest of the population, FH have had high levels of cholesterol since birth, probably increasing their relative risk. Prior to the introduction of the statins, clofibrate (an older fibrate that often caused gallstones), probucol (especially in large xanthomas) and thyroxine were used to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{took office}} on 25 May 2003. Roberto Lavagna, {{credited}} with the economic recovery during Duhalde's presidency, was retained as minister of economy and continued his economic policies. Argentina negotiated a swap of defaulted debt and repaid the International Monetary Fund. The National Institute of Statistics and Census intervened <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> growing inflation. Several Supreme Court judges resigned while fearing impeachment, and new justices were appointed. The amnesty for crimes committed during the Dirty War in enforcing the full-stop and due-obedience laws and the presidential pardons were repealed and declared unconstitutional. This led to new trials for the military who served during the 1970s. Argentina increased its integration with other Latin American countries, discontinuing its automatic alignment with the United States dating to the 1990s. The 2005 midterm elections were a victory for Kirchner, and signaled the end of Duhalde's supremacy in Buenos Aires Province.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between maximum displacement (dmax) and fault length (L) {{has been studied}} extensively, mainly in attempts to understand how fault geometry varies over different length scales. Individual data sets are sampled over limited length scales, and values of dmax and L are generally poorly correlated, thus relationships are usually postulated {{on the basis of}} combining different data sets. There are problems in sampling both dmax and L in a consistent manner over these different length scales, especially where different data collection methods are used (e. g., field and seismic reflection data). Failure to resolve low-displacement tips and damage zones leads <b>to</b> <b>underestimates</b> of L, and exclusion of fault drag leads <b>to</b> <b>underestimates</b> of dmax. Measurement of non-central fault traces leads <b>to</b> <b>underestimates</b> of both dmax and L and an underestimate of dmax/L. In this paper, we examine factors that control the measured displacement–fault length relationships of natural faults. We suggest that there may be systematic differences between the dmax/L ratios where length is measured parallel or normal to the displacement vector, and where the growth histories of individual faults vary due to the nature and number of slip events, linkage, and reactivation. Controlling factors also include material properties and fault types. It is explained how each controlling factor contributes to the dmax/L ratio and should be considered in the statistical analysis of fault dat...|$|R
5|$|Traditionally, most texts, {{following}} Owen's {{estimate of}} 1841, give a body length of thirty feet or nine metres for Megalosaurus. The {{lack of an}} articulated dorsal vertebral series {{makes it difficult to}} determine an exact size. David Bruce Norman in 1984 thought Megalosaurus was seven to eight metres long. Gregory S. Paul in 1988 estimated the weight tentatively at 1.1 tonnes, given a thighbone seventy-six centimetres long. The trend in the early twenty-first century to limit the material to the lectotype inspired even lower estimates, disregarding outliers of uncertain identity. Paul in 2010 stated Megalosaurus was six metres long and seven hundred kilogrammes heavy. However, the same year Benson claimed that Megalosaurus, though medium-sized, was still among the largest of Middle Jurassic theropods. Specimen BMNH 31806, a thighbone 803 millimetres long, would indicate a body weight of 943 kilogrammes, using the extrapolation method of J.F. Anderson — which method, optimised for mammals, tends <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> theropod masses by at least a third. Furthermore, thighbone specimen OUM J13561 has a length of about eighty-six centimetres.|$|E

40|$|Condoms {{are most}} {{effective}} when they are applied before intercourse. This study assessed the prevalence of 'condom cheats'-instances of condom use in which the condom is put on after initial penetration. As part of a prospective study of safer sexual behaviour, 103 heterosexual tertiary students completed a condom use diary {{over a period of}} up to 6 months. Of the 464 condoms used by study participants, 13 % were put on after initial penetration. Thiry-eight percent of condom users reported at least one instance of late application of a condom. Late application of condoms is common and places individuals at risk of infection with HIV and many other STDs. The widespread practice of this behaviour casts doubt on the validity of self-reports of condom use.

The Germans believed that it accounted for only 12 to 15 percent of all logistical traffic, {{and the nature of}} the Soviet terrain meant that rail was relied upon to deliver around 90 percent of Soviet supplies to the front, making it the prime target. The civil air organisation was deemed too primitive and ineffective. In wartime, it would contribute significantly to supporting logistics.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{important}} to note that recombination frequency tends <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> the distance between two linked genes.

Double or even number of crossovers between the two genes results in them being cosegregated to the same gamete, yielding a parental progeny instead of the expected recombinant progeny. As mentioned above, the Kosambi and Haldane transformations attempt to correct for multiple crossovers.|$|E

The expedition was a disaster; the Gorkhali army easily overpowered those who had not succumbed to malaria or desertion. This ineffectual British force provided the Gorkhali with firearms and filled the Gorkhas with overconfidence, causing them <b>to</b> <b>underestimate</b> their opponents in future wars.|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{epidemiologic}} {{studies may}} use genotypic clustering of isolates {{as an indicator}} of recent transmission. It has been shown that missing cases lead <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> clustering, and modelling studies suggested that they may also lead <b>to</b> <b>underestimating</b> odds ratios for clustering. Using a national, comprehensive database from the Netherlands covering 15 years between 1993 and 2007 and including over 12, 000 patients and their isolates, the authors determined the effects of sampling at random, in time, and by geographic area. As expected, sampling reduced the observed clustering percentages. However, sampling did not reduce the observed odds ratios for clustering. The main explanations for this discrepancy with model outcomes were that a substantial proportion of clustered cases were found in large clusters and that risk factors for clustering tended to be-among clustered cases-also risk factors for large clusters. The authors conclude that, in settings where risk factors for clustering may be interpreted as risk factors for recent transmission, these risk factors are also associated with larger cluster sizes. As a result, odds ratios would show limited sampling bia...|$|R
