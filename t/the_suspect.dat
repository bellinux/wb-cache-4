5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> and find his latest victim. After Don kills <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} {{unless and until}} <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> {{actually}} stated that he was relying on that right, his subsequent voluntary statements {{could be used in}} court and police could continue to interact with (or question) him. The mere act of remaining silent was, on its own, insufficient to imply <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> has invoked his or her rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence could be construed as implying a waiver.|$|E
5|$|Detective Gibson, {{who was in}} plainclothes, {{was shot}} after <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> entered DeLay's office. Despite being mortally wounded, Detective Gibson was able to return fire and wound <b>the</b> <b>suspect,</b> who was apprehended in that office. A female tourist was grazed by bullets on her {{shoulder}} and face. She was treated for her injuries and released. Also injured was USCP Officer Douglas McMillian. Future Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tennessee, a heart surgeon who had been presiding on the Senate floor just before the shooting, resuscitated the gunman and accompanied him to D.C. General Hospital.|$|E
50|$|The police {{offered a}} 500 lira reward {{to anyone with}} {{information}} on <b>the</b> <b>suspects.</b> <b>The</b> Jewish Agency offered a 1000 lira reward to anyone with information on <b>the</b> <b>suspects.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Hebron {{governor}} Kamel Hmeid and Hamas spokesman Salah Bardawil both called <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> martyrs. Hamas leader Khaled Mashal {{also called}} <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> [...] "martyrs" [...] and [...] "heroes".|$|R
5|$|Dutch {{counter-terrorism}} agency NCTb {{said that}} it had started a probe into where <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> originated. Dutch officials also said that they will now use 3D full-body scanning X-ray technology on flights departing to the U.S., despite protests from privacy advocates. Dutch officials said that security must take priority over {{the privacy of the}} individuals being scanned, but the scanners are not designed to compromise an individual's privacy, as the imagery resolution is only high enough to detect non-metallic objects under clothing, such as powdered explosives. Members of the Second Chamber (Lower House) of the Dutch parliament demanded an explanation from Minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin, asking how <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> managed to smuggle explosives on board, despite Schiphol's reportedly strict security measures.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008 {{the police}} {{announced}} their increased surveillance of the Internet had stopped a potential attack against a Finnish school. They {{did not specify}} which school was under threat, but revealed <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> was receiving treatment.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>suspect</b> in the {{attempted}} bombing was Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian {{born into a}} middle-class family. Abdulmutallab was raised in Kaduna, in Nigeria's Muslim-dominated north, a place he returned to on his vacations.|$|E
50|$|May 9, 1980. Prolonged shootout {{and chase}} between police in Norco, California, and five heavily armed bank robbers wearing military-style {{fatigues}} and armed with assault rifles, thousands of rounds of hollow-point bullets {{as well as}} various explosive and incendiary devices.Police responded to a bank robbery call in Norco. Upon arriving the police were ambushed and outgunned. After the robbers unloaded over 300 rounds at police cruisers, the officers were forced to retreat behind their cruisers or nearby obstacles, all the while being fired upon. <b>The</b> <b>suspects</b> attempted to escape in their own vehicle. During this attempt, the driver of <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> {{was killed by a}} stray police shot. <b>The</b> <b>suspects</b> then hijacked a nearby vehicle and became involved in a prolonged chase, in which <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> shot at police and disabled and destroyed 33 police vehicles (as well as civilian cars) with explosives thrown from the back of a truck. <b>The</b> <b>suspects</b> also disabled a police helicopter by shooting at it. Later, <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> lay in wait for police as they chased them, and ambushed them, resulting in the death of a police officer and wounding 2 others. Heavily outgunned, the police were pinned down until one officer arrived with an AR-15 carbine. After the police engaged <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> with <b>the</b> AR-15, <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> fled. One of <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> was killed in the shootout, one during a later standoff with the police the next day, and three were later captured. 8 officers were also wounded during the events.|$|R
50|$|While {{she was at}} {{the drug}} buy, with the policemen monitoring, <b>the</b> two <b>suspects</b> changed <b>the</b> {{location}} of the buy. She was informed not to follow <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> to <b>the</b> new location. Her police handlers lost track of her when she agreed with <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> to change <b>the</b> plans and left the buy spot with <b>the</b> two <b>suspects</b> in their stolen silver BMW. While in transit, <b>the</b> two <b>suspects</b> allegedly executed her with the gun she was supposed to buy.|$|R
50|$|In May 2009 {{the case}} against two of <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> was deemed {{completed}} and passed to the court (only one of <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> is charged with murder). According to the prosecution, the crime had no direct motives, thus no hate crime clauses were invoked. However, <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> insist that <b>the</b> attack, indeed, had a motive: they mistook Nelyubin for a neo-nazi. According to <b>the</b> <b>suspects,</b> on <b>the</b> New Year night one of their friends was beaten by skinheads and called for help; {{they ran out of}} the hostel and attacked Nelyubin party, believing that these were the alleged skinheads.|$|R
5|$|Altgens {{returned}} to Dealey Plaza {{to photograph the}} assassination site for diagramming purposes, then was sent to Dallas City Hall to retrieve the work of another AP photographer who had pictures of accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald in custody. This {{was the only time}} he saw <b>the</b> <b>suspect,</b> and Altgens thought Oswald showed signs of having been thoroughly interrogated.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{reports of}} a sniper {{shooting}} cars along I-96 in four counties led to a federal investigation and a multi-jurisdictional task force of 100law enforcement officials. As of October 30, 2012, 25shootings had been linked to one suspect. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and Crime Stoppers offered a $102,000 reward {{for information leading to}} the arrest of the perpetrator. <b>The</b> <b>suspect,</b> Raulie Casteel of Wixom, was arrested on November 5, 2012, and ordered to stand trial in 2013 in Oakland County for 60charges in one case, with a second trial on terrorism and murder charges to be brought by the Michigan Attorney General. On October 30, 2013, <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> pleaded no contest, but mentally ill, in the Oakland County case, and he was sentenced to serve anywhere from six years and eight months to 10 years in prison on multiple assault charges (as well as two concurrent years on weapons charges) for that case on February 4, 2014. The trial for the Livingston County case began on January 14, 2014, and after being convicted on the terrorism charge, Casteel was sentenced to 16 to 40 years in state prison.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 2006, Suffolk Constabulary {{reported}} that they had arrested a 37-year-old man on suspicion of murdering all five women. The man was arrested at 07.20 at a house in Trimley St. Martin near Felixstowe, Suffolk. The detention of <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> was extended by magistrates by a further period of 24 hours, to the maximum of 96 hours allowed under English law.|$|E
50|$|The {{photographs}} of 11 of <b>the</b> <b>suspected</b> killers {{were added to}} Interpol's most wanted list on 18 February, with a note specifying {{that they had been}} published since the identities adopted by <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> were faked. Dubai airport officials carried out routine retinal scans on 11 of <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> sought in <b>the</b> assassination when they entered the country and Dubai police said they would publish the scans through INTERPOL.|$|R
5000|$|A team of SAS {{soldiers}} {{was sent}} to intercept and arrest them on conspiracy charges, in an operation code-named Operation Flavius. The team, {{in accordance with their}} training, shot and killed <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> which at <b>the</b> time was justified by the teams to be in response to <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> reaching for what they believed were the detonators. The inquest into the shootings found no breach of Article 2 of the Gibraltar constitution. At the time of <b>the</b> shootings <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> had neither a detonator nor any explosives. A car was however found registered under one of <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> names which had been laced with explosive devices of 'ticking time bomb' type and not remote detonators. It appeared that <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> were on a reconnaissance-mission and had parked their car to save a space for the actual car containing the explosives.|$|R
50|$|The court {{proceedings}} started on 24 October 2016 in closed session, as {{requested by the}} son of the main victim. <b>The</b> <b>suspects</b> continued to maintain their innocence. Two of <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> demanded a trial by jury.|$|R
5|$|On February 16, 2008, at {{approximately}} 3:30a.m., a PGSO SWAT team member {{was shot and}} critically wounded while serving a warrant {{as part of a}} task force with Deputy U.S. Marshals. <b>The</b> <b>suspect,</b> Aaron M. Lowry, was wanted for the shooting of a Washington, D.C. police officer. The injured deputy was flown to Baltimore Shock Trauma Center where he had surgery and was upgraded to serious but stable condition, and survived.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2009, a posting on the 4chan /b/ {{board said}} there would be a school {{shooting}} at St Eskils Gymnasium in Eskilstuna, Sweden, leading 1250 students and 50 teachers to be evacuated. A 21-year-old man was arrested after 4chan provided the police with the IP address of the poster. Police said that <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> called it off as a joke, and they released him after they found no indication that the threat was serious.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, {{two days}} after the murder, police arrested their suspect. Hayden {{provided}} a confession and subsequently pleaded guilty in court. Hayden's legal representative, Randolph Williams, urged the judge to show leniency because <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> had shown remorse for his crime from the moment of his arrest. The judge, Justice Basil Reid, sentenced Hayden to life in prison with the possibility of parole after fifteen years.|$|E
25|$|The {{families}} of the victims were sceptical that <b>the</b> announced, alleged <b>suspects</b> were <b>the</b> perpetrators. In late January 2013, the RAB announced that the DNA identified by the labs had failed to match 13 samples, including samples from <b>the</b> <b>suspects.</b> Journalists had also been sceptical that <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> were <b>the</b> perpetrators.|$|R
40|$|An assault {{occurred}} during which a bite was inflicted {{on the left}} ear of the victim, producing a laceration and severing a portion of tissue from the ear. During {{the course of their}} investigation police recovered a lacerated fragment of tissue thought to be of a person's left ear. Impressions of a suspect's dentition were made and cast in dental stone. Positive replicas of the occlusal surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> dentition were subsequently made using acrylic resin. The ear fragment displayed a lacerated border and a surface which exhibited indentations. When compared with the details of <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> lower anterior teeth, correspondence was visible between the shape of the indentations and characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> dentition. <b>The</b> use of transparent acrylic replicas of <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> dentition facilitated <b>the</b> interpretation and comparison between the marks retained in the ear fragment and the features of <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> dentition...|$|R
50|$|On 22 September 2014, {{three men}} {{were arrested in}} a police raid related to <b>the</b> incident. <b>The</b> <b>suspects</b> {{identified}} as Juan Flores Riquelme, Guillermo Durán Méndez and Nataly Casanova Muñoz. According to the authorities gunpowder and other bomb making materials {{were found in the}} suspects' homes, with Requelme being the mastermind behind <b>the</b> organisation. <b>The</b> <b>suspects</b> were officially charged with the crime on September 23. Despite the evidence presented by <b>the</b> authorities, <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> denied any involvement in the incident.|$|R
5|$|The Supreme Court {{extended}} the standard from Berghuis v. Thompkins in Salinas v. Texas, 570 U.S. ___ (2013), on June 17, 2013, holding that a suspect's silence {{in response to}} a specific question posed during an interview with police when <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> was not in custody and <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> had been voluntarily answering other questions during that interview could be used against him in court where he did not explicitly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence in response to the specific question. Of the five justices who concluded that the suspect's silence could be used against him in these circumstances, Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy concluded that the defendant's Fifth Amendment claim failed because he did not expressly invoke the privilege. The other two Justices, Thomas and Scalia, concluded that the defendant's claim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege, on the theory that the prosecutor's comment at the trial—regarding the defendant's silence {{in response to a}} question during the police interview—did not compel the defendant to give self-incriminating testimony.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} a murder for which <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> presents an incredible alibi—that the death was foretold by an old man able to see into the future. Upon investigating the case, the duo discover an increasingly bizarre {{series of events that}} leads Mulder to believe time travel is involved.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>suspect</b> (later {{identified}} as David Lace) was discovered when {{the profile of}} the killer showed a partial match on the national database, which belonged to a sibling of a previous suspect. A further sample was taken from another sibling, who was not on the database, to help confirm the match via a process called familial searching. At first the police refused to release the identity of the new prime suspect, except to reveal that he had committed suicide in 1988, and had confessed to DeSimone's murder while in custody for an unrelated crime in 1983, 18 months after Hodgson's conviction. His body was exhumed at Kingston cemetery in Portsmouth on 12 August 2009 in order to compare his DNA to that found at the crime scene. Hampshire Constabulary said the breakthrough in the case was only possible because of advances in forensic science and tests on the body would take six weeks, after which a file on the dead suspect could then be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service. Visitors to the cemetery in Portsmouth said the grave of <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> had no headstone and was untended. Police revealed that the suspect's confession was one of seven which had been made since Hodgson's conviction.|$|E

5|$|A Boston man (Joe Towne) is {{attacked}} by a shadowy, ghost-like figure; his wife (Michelle Harrison) returns home to find he disintegrates into ash upon being touched. After learning all of the victims had recently visited a hospital before dying, Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick) explains the case is similar to one he had trouble with in the past, in which his obsessive behavior effectively ended his marriage to his wife Diane. <b>The</b> <b>suspect,</b> an Eastern European man, had contacted him four years ago sounding distraught {{and asked him to}} figure out a special formula, which Broyles was unable to solve. Walter (John Noble) and Peter (Joshua Jackson) study the victim's remains at their lab and begin studying the formula given to Broyles.|$|E
50|$|Hotel {{surveillance}} footage {{released to}} the public shows <b>the</b> <b>suspects,</b> who had arrived on separate flights, meeting in the hotel. While <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> used personal communication devices among themselves to avoid surveillance, a number of telephone calls were made to a number in Austria. When al-Mabhouh arrived at around 3 pm, two of <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> followed him to his room. They then checked into the room opposite al-Mabhouh's. At 8 pm al-Mabhouh left the hotel and while several of <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> kept watch, two tried to gain entry to his room, but were disturbed when a tourist exited the nearby elevator. While another <b>suspect</b> distracted <b>the</b> tourist, four <b>suspects</b> allegedly entered his hotel room using an electronic device, and waited for him to return. Hotel computer logs indicated that an attempt was made to reprogram al-Mabhouh’s electronic door lock at this time.|$|R
