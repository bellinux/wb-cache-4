It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> been estimated {{to be close to}} 70% of the indigenous population. The damage done by this disease significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population.|$|E

The population reached 380 or more in the nineteenth century, when a fishing station was opened at Crabbaberry in West Voe. Subsequently, there was a steady decline in population, although <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> increased from a low of 16 in the 1970s.|$|E

A significant number of Italian-Americans still reside in the area, although <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> decreased over the years.

2500|$|Square {{roots and}} reciprocals do not obey this law. Also, Benford's {{law does not}} apply to unary systems such as tally marks. [...] Telephone {{directories}} violate Benford's law because <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> a mostly fixed length and do not have the initial digit 1. [...] Benford's law is violated by the populations of all places with population at least 2500 from five US states according to the 1960 and 1970 censuses, where only 19% began with digit 1 but 20% began with digit 2, {{for the simple reason that}} the truncation at 2500 introduces statistical bias. The terminal digits in pathology reports violate Benford's law due to rounding, and the fact that terminal digits are never expected to follow Benford's law in the first place.|$|E
2500|$|Wine expert Tom Stevenson {{describes}} the wines {{of the area}} as being a [...] "microcosm of the Loire Valley", featuring wines made from every grape variety and in almost every style produced in the entire Loire wine region. Among the wines of Anjou, Savennières is noted for its dry Chenin blanc wines and the Coteaux du Layon for its sweet dessert wines that includes the botrytized wines of Bonnezeaux and Quarts de Chaume. Various rosé wines are produced in the region under different AOC designation include Rosé d'Anjou, the most basic level made predominantly from Grolleau, and Cabernet d'Anjou which is usually made from Cabernet Franc or Cabernet Sauvignon. For most of its history, dry red wines have represented {{a small percentage of}} Anjou winemaking but in recent years <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> been steadily increasing—aided, in part, by the 1987 establishment of the Anjou-Villages AOC designation for red wines which can be made from only Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. The Gamay grape of the Beaujolais wine region has had a long history in the Anjou with its own Anjou-Gamay AOC. Grapes from around the region can go into basic Anjou blanc and Anjou Rouge AOC wines.|$|E

60|$|I {{have felt}} much doubt in {{limiting}} this genus: the six recent species which it contains, differ more {{from each other}} than do the species in the previous genera. Mr. Gray has proposed or adopted generic names for four of the species, and a fifth certainly has equal claims to this same rank. These genera have been founded almost exclusively {{on the number of}} the valves; and oddly enough, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> generally been given wrongly, namely, in Scalpellum, Calantica, Thaliella, and Xiphidium. Scalpellum blends through S. villosum into Pollicipes; and this latter genus has an equal right with Scalpellum, to be divided into sub-genera, three in number. Hence, no less than eight genera might be made out of the twelve recent species of Scalpellum and Pollicipes, and their formation, in some degree, be justified; but, in my opinion, this inordinate multiplication of genera destroys the main advantages of classification. At one time, I even thought that {{it would be best to}} follow Lamarck, and keep the twelve recent species in one genus; but considering the number of fossil species, I believe the more prudent course has been followed, in retaining the two genera Scalpellum and Pollicipes; more especially as I can hardly doubt, that several other species will be hereafter discovered.|$|E
