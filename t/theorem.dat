5|$|Any general {{property}} of Banach spaces {{continues to hold}} for Hilbert spaces. The open mapping <b>theorem</b> states that a continuous surjective linear transformation from one Banach space to another is an open mapping meaning that it sends open sets to open sets. A corollary is the bounded inverse <b>theorem,</b> that a continuous and bijective linear function from one Banach space to another is an isomorphism (that is, a continuous linear map whose inverse is also continuous). This <b>theorem</b> is considerably simpler to prove {{in the case of}} Hilbert spaces than in general Banach spaces. The open mapping <b>theorem</b> is equivalent to the closed graph <b>theorem,</b> which asserts that a function from one Banach space to another is continuous if and only if its graph is a closed set. In the case of Hilbert spaces, this is basic in the study of unbounded operators (see closed operator).|$|E

Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little <b>theorem</b> to what is now known as Euler's <b>theorem.</b> He contributed significantly to the theory of perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. He proved that the relationship shown between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes earlier proved by Euclid was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the Euclid–Euler <b>theorem.</b> Euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The concept is regarded as a fundamental <b>theorem</b> of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Automated {{reasoning}} of inductive <b>theorems</b> {{is considered}} important in program verification. To verify inductive <b>theorems</b> automatically, several implicit induction methods like the inductionless induction and the rewriting induction {{methods have been}} proposed. In studying inductive <b>theorems</b> on higher-order rewritings, {{we found that the}} class of the <b>theorems</b> shown by known implicit induction methods does not coincide with that of inductive <b>theorems,</b> and the gap between them is a barrier in developing mechanized methods for disproving inductive <b>theorems.</b> This paper fills this gap by introducing the notion of primitive inductive <b>theorems,</b> and clarifying the relation between inductive <b>theorems</b> and primitive inductive <b>theorems.</b> Based on this relation, we achieve mechanized methods for proving and disproving inductive <b>theorems...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1908, Zermelo {{published}} his axiom system for set theory.

5|$|Noether's <b>theorem</b> {{has become}} a {{fundamental}} tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool. Her <b>theorem</b> allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's <b>theorem</b> provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon: if the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's <b>theorem</b> guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.|$|E
