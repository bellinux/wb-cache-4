Anderson saw the completed film and felt [...] "there are good, fun parts the film but the language wasn't to my liking." [...] National Review Online has named the film #24 in its list of [...] "The Best Conservative Movies". Brian C. Anderson wrote, [...] "the film's utter disgust with air-headed, left-wing celebrity activism remains unmatched in popular culture." [...] However, political and social commentator Andrew Sullivan considers the film brilliant in its skewering of both the left and right's approach on terrorism. Sullivan (a fan of Stone and Parker's other work, as well) popularized the term [...] "South Park Republican" [...] to describe himself and other like-minded fiscal conservatives/social libertarians. Parker himself is a registered Libertarian. In August, Internet news aggregator Matt Drudge blasted Paramount and the filmmakers for trying to [...] "mock the terror war." [...] A week later, the conservative group Move America Forward criticized the film, saying it was [...] "inconceivable" [...] that filmmakers would have spoofed the Nazis during World War II. In reality, many films mocking the Nazis were produced during the war, including Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator, which was nominated for five Academy Awards. Before Team America was released, statements were released by a [...] "senior Bush administration official" [...] condemning the film.

5000|$|This is what Ukrainian {{music critic}} and {{journalist}} Oleksandr Yevtushenko wrote {{in one of}} his compilations on contemporary Ukrainian music:"I first heard the group OPALNYI PRYNZ on the broadcasts of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty. The songs Hey Ukraino!, Nash Prapor were played every day. That {{was at the end of}} the 1980s. But to find out anything about the group was only possible after the release of their first album Mandry. And after that as music of the [...] "secretive inhabitants of Lviv" [...] Ukrainian Radio started to play them and the became radio-hits. Rostyslav Shtyn and company came out into the information field. But they did not try to conquer it, because first and foremost they were concerned with the creation of a European level of musical infrastructure with their own agency, recording studio. What we are <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>here</b> is a well equipped national factory of stars. The idea didnt leave Rostyslav alone. Thank God, that he gathered his organizational skills and musical talent. First of all there was his musical education - Rostyslavs education is as a violinist. There was the persistent work with stars of multifarious stages. At the end of the 1980s the main matter became his group OPALNYI PRYNZ. It was created by: Yuri Shtyn (his younger brother), who plays keyboards, sings, and writes the music and lyrics, Toomas Vanem - lead guitar and still one other keyboardist Roman Brytsky and singer and guitarist Rostyslav Shtyn. The path of OPALNYI PRYNZ cardinally is different from generally accepted schemes. Because for they had the idea of technical and financial independence and perfect quality of how they sounded. The group signed a contract with one German producers centre and received the possibility of publishing its materials on both sides of the Iron Curtain. At the end of 1990 OPALNYI PRYNZ realizes its next project - the album Nova Revolyutsiya. Indisputably, all the tracks of the album are woven with the tectonic changes in the life of Ukrainian society. Its impregnated with movement towards freedom, the feeling of change. Concurrently it is beautifully recorded. And the video clip to the song Nash Prapor was shown on Ukrainian television all the way through to the year 2000. Some people confirm, that this clip was shown on MTV in honor of Ukraines declaration of independence in 1991. Nova Revolyutsiya - these are very strong and unique compositions Khlib po vodi (Bread upon the water), Rozmyti dorohy (Washed out roads), Ty na viyni (You are at war), Simnadtsyate veresnya (1939 The Seventeenth of September), Braty po zbroyii (Brothers in Arms). These are songs that one does not forget. Regardless of their primarily studio plane of existence, OPALNYI PRYNZ had a considerable influence on the formation of Ukrainian rock-music, certain models in their sound in particular, we are talking about the synthesis of ethnic music with rock. It is possible that they were the first that did it delicately and convincingly. Its incredible, but OPALNYI PRYNZ even today sounds fresh and real." ...|$|E
