5|$|Despite the band's intent, {{a future}} album {{from the group}} was uncertain. On June 12, 2008, Atlantic Records {{filed a lawsuit against}} Weiland and Eric Kretz, {{claiming}} the two had threatened to terminate their contract unless changes were made. Stone Temple Pilots had delivered six albums (five studio records and the compilation, Thank You) and Atlantic wanted a seventh album with an option for two more. In a statement made by email, the band said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> and disappointed by the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|The joke {{became an}} {{international}} sensation when publications from Europe, Hong Kong {{and other countries}} reprinted the trick without verifying it or asking EGMs permission. A Hong Kong comic based on Street Fighter II by Jademan Comics altered their story to include the character. Players tried unsuccessfully for weeks to unlock Sheng Long, until it was revealed in the December issue of EGM {{that it was a}} hoax, with the staff stating <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> at the worldwide coverage the joke had received.|$|E
5|$|Following Jefferson's {{return to}} Grimsby, Marstrand's were puzzled by Orsborne's actions, but {{initially}} {{thought that he}} had taken on another engineer in Dover and had gone fishing, perhaps in new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> by the arrival of bills from Corcubión, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9February, two New Zealand-crewed Beaufighters from No.489 Squadron {{conducted}} a patrol of the Norwegian coast. These aircraft first sighted a 1,500-ton merchant ship in Stong Fjord. Continuing north, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> to find a Narvik-class destroyer accompanied by a minesweeper and two flak ships in Førde Fjord. The aircraft continued their patrol and spotted five large merchant ships in the Nord Gulen and two minesweepers and a flak ship near Bremanger. Despite the pilots' surprise, the Allied command was aware that Z33 was in the area from Ultra signals intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{surrender}} of Thickety Fort, Shelby joined a band of partisans under Lieutenant Elijah Clarke. This unit was pursued by British Major Patrick Ferguson. On the morning of August 8, 1780, some of Shelby's men were gathering peaches from an orchard when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> by some of Ferguson's men on a reconnaissance mission. Shelby's men quickly readied their arms and drove back the British patrol. Soon, however, the British were reinforced and the colonists fell back. The pattern continued, with one side being reinforced and gaining an advantage, followed by the other. Shelby's men were winning the battle when Ferguson's main force of 1,000 men arrived. Outmanned, they retreated to a nearby hill where British musket fire could not reach them. Now safe, they taunted the British, and Ferguson's force withdrew from the area. Thus ended the Battle of Cedar Springs.|$|E
5|$|On 3 January 1944, VMF-214 {{was among}} 75 U.S. {{aircraft}} raiding near Rabaul when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> by 300 Japanese aircraft. Boyington {{was shot down}} and parachuted into the St. George's Channel. The next day, Bolt led a flight of four Corsairs from VMF-214 in search of Boyington. Despite hazy weather {{and the need to}} take an indirect route to avoid Japanese radar, Bolt managed to lead the flight to the area where the battle had taken place the day before. Although they did not spot Boyington, they discovered and engaged a flotilla of Japanese barges, destroying six of them. Bolt also claimed his sixth victory against a Japanese aircraft attempting to defend the barges.|$|E

5|$|Other {{researchers}} also investigated electromagnetic isotope separation. At Princeton University, a {{group led by}} Henry D. Smyth and Robert R. Wilson developed a device known as an isotron. Using a klystron, {{they were able to}} separate isotopes using high-voltage electricity rather than magnetism. Work continued until February 1943, when, in view of the greater success of the calutron, work was discontinued and the team was transferred to other duties. At Cornell University a group under Lloyd P. Smith that included William E. Parkins, and A. Theodore Forrester devised a radial magnetic separator. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> that their beams were more precise than expected, and, like Lawrence, deduced that it was a result of stabilization of the beam by air in the vacuum chamber. In February 1942, their team was consolidated with Lawrence's in Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on their}} {{experience}} with the ancient surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, scientists expected to see numerous impact craters in Voyager 1s first images of Io. The density of impact craters across Io's surface would have given clues to Io's age. However, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> {{to discover that the}} surface was almost completely lacking in impact craters, but was instead covered in smooth plains dotted with tall mountains, pits of various shapes and sizes, and volcanic lava flows. Compared to most worlds observed to that point, Io's surface was covered in a variety of colorful materials (leading Io to be compared to a rotten orange or to pizza) from various sulfurous compounds. The lack of impact craters indicated that Io's surface is geologically young, like the terrestrial surface; volcanic materials continuously bury craters as they are produced. This result was spectacularly confirmed as at least nine active volcanoes were observed by Voyager 1.|$|E
5|$|During their 15-day {{rest periods}} the company's men congregated around the Belgian-owned Elizabeth Hotel, in {{the centre of}} the city at the corner of Causeway and Manica Road. Many of them became seriously disaffected when they first {{received}} their salary from the Rhodesian Army. Having apparently been misled about wages of up to R$1,000 per month (₣7,000) by the French recruiters, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> to find that their basic monthly pay was actually R$245 (₣1,800), the same as a regular Rhodesian soldier. Moreover, some were upset that they had been paid in Rhodesian dollars, which because of the country's international isolation could not easily be exchanged for foreign currencies. Although it was not as much as they had been expecting, one disenchanted veteran of the unit afterwards admitted that the tax-exempt R$245 wage, which came with a $10 special-unit supplement, was still more than enough money for them to live comfortably in Salisbury during their time off.|$|E

50|$|The {{registry}} {{process should}} allow gift purchasers to be discreet {{about what they}} have bought. This is so the gift's recipient will not know who purchased which items until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> {{at the time of}} gift giving.|$|R
5|$|Game {{development}} costs gradually increased, and Nintendo {{did not provide}} Rare with more capital nor did they purchase the company's remaining stake. According to Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> that Nintendo did not directly acquire the studio. Rare then looked for potential buyers. In early 2000, workers from Activision and Microsoft began visiting Rare with purchase offers. Rare was interested in Activision's offer, but the deal collapsed and on 24 September 2002 Microsoft purchased Rare for $375 million. Rare became a first-party developer for Microsoft's Xbox. Character trademarks from games developed by Rare for Nintendo consoles, such as Conker of Conker's Bad Fur Day and Banjo of the Banjo-Kazooie series, were retained by Rare; intellectual property created by Nintendo, such as Donkey Kong and Star Fox, were retained by Nintendo. This left Donkey Kong Racing, due for release for the GameCube, unreleased. 30 employees left Rare during the transition.|$|E
5|$|Rod Jones {{was known}} as a hard hitter and a {{world-class}} track star, but was a controversial selection because, coming from the run-heavy Southwest Conference, his pass-coverage skills were unknown. At 5'11", 165lbs., he was considered undersized for the NFL. Jones was the first defensive back selected, but was rated no better than fifth-best by most scouting services. The Buccaneers were criticized for taking linebacker Jackie Walker with their third pick, when Kevin Murphy of the national champion Oklahoma Sooners was still available. The Buccaneers did eventually draft Murphy, who <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> to find still available with their 40th overall selection. Murphy was believed to have fallen due to rumors of a knee injury. The Buccaneers had rated both Walker and Murphy among the top 15 players in the draft. Craig Swoope was rated as the best safety in the draft, but fell to the fourth round because of a previous charge (and acquittal) of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Swoope was eventually the only Buccaneer to achieve any kind of postseason honors in 1986, being selected to the Football Digest All-Rookie team. The team went for big offensive linemen in the later rounds. One of them was J.D. Maarleveld, the first cancer patient drafted by the NFL. Maarleveld was considered to have been a second-round talent, but fell {{all the way to the}} fifth round. Belief that Maarleveld was worth much more money than the average fifth-rounder caused his agent, Greg Marotta, to advise him to reject the Buccaneers' offer and sign with the USFL Baltimore Stars. Maarleveld was eventually able to reach agreement with the Buccaneers.|$|E
5|$|Tokyopop's {{localized}} volumes {{appeared on}} ICv2's monthly top one-hundred selling graphic novels. The Rozen Maiden manga has received generally positive reviews. Anime News Network praised Peach-Pit's works as always {{being able to}} evoke excitement or laughter from its readers but was critical about Rozen Maidens lack of plot and criticized how the dialogue or layout can be vague. Comic Book Bin wrote that while Rozen Maiden was not a splendid manga, its emphasis on psychology and emotion was something American comics should follow to expand their readership. Active Anime praised several aspects of the series: the combination of mystery, comedy, and cuteness with a balance of fantasy and drama; the visual esthetics of the images and characters; and a broadness that extends towards teens and adults. Initially, Anime Land praised the balance between comedic daily life and the underlying {{dark side of the}} plot. In later volumes though, Anime Land criticized the story's pacing and the abrupt ending. In their review of the sequel, Anime Land wrote <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> by the dark tone and how the plot was confusing even with knowledge from the first series. Manga-News also praised the story's alteration between moments of peace and conflict but panned the latter volumes for being rushed and losing the story's complexity. In their review of the sequel, Manga-News praised the introduction for being interesting and accessible to new readers.|$|E

25|$|Jutland was a {{crippling}} {{blow to the}} reputation of the existing battlecruisers.

25|$|Meanwhile, in Rossio, after Paiva de Couceiro's {{departure}} {{with the}} battery, {{the morale of}} the monarchical troops, which considered themselves helpless, deteriorated even more due to the threats of bombardment by the naval forces.
