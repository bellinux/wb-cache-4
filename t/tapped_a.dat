5|$|Conversations {{with the}} {{previous}} game's protagonists increased the Cadet's standing with them: if the player <b>tapped</b> <b>a</b> special button on-screen during timed sections of the conversation, the bond statistic with the chosen character would be increased. The relationships built up by the player triggered special character interactions during the final chapter. Agito featured sub-missions, the game's version of side-quests, some of which changed depending on the real-world day of the week. They were given by NPCs, and could range from crafting new spells and equipment to performing certain actions within a combat mission. Completing quests yielded rewards such as new equipment and items.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound effects}} were {{designed}} by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his phaser sounds more like his blasters from Star Wars, because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady beams of energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he <b>tapped</b> <b>a</b> long spring against a contact microphone, and combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional hum to the warping and transporting sounds.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{lost its}} second preseason game, played against the Baltimore Colts in 100-degree heat in Toledo, Ohio. Browns placekicker Lou Groza opened the scoring with an 18-yard field {{goal in the}} first quarter, and a {{touchdown}} by fullback Ollie Cline later in the period put the Browns up 10–0. Baltimore responded {{in the second quarter}} with a touchdown pass by quarterback Y. A. Tittle to receiver Jake Leicht. Cline ran for another touchdown soon thereafter, however, once more giving the Browns a 10-point lead. Colts receiver Lamar Davis caught a 25-yard touchdown pass {{at the end of the}} second quarter. Cleveland led 17–14 at halftime. Neither team scored again until the fourth quarter, when Baltimore's Bus Mertes ran for a 38-yard touchdown and secured the 21–17 win. A number of Cleveland players suffered injuries during the game. Graham hurt his hand, Motley strained his back and end Dante Lavelli suffered a broken leg. Lavelli's injury sidelined him for the first seven games of the regular season. During the game, Baltimore players Hub Bechtol and Lew Mayne, a former Brown, <b>tapped</b> <b>a</b> phone line that went from Cleveland's press box to its sideline. This allowed the Colts to listen in on coaches' conversations and anticipate the Browns' play-calling.|$|E

25|$|Instead of a cost, tapping {{can also}} be {{the effect of a}} spell or ability. In such a case, it makes no {{difference}} if that permanent was already <b>tapped.</b> <b>A</b> creature that attacks also gets tapped, unless it has vigilance, but a defending creature does not. Unless stated otherwise, tapping does not stop continuous abilities (e.g. enchantments or equipments) or triggered abilities from taking effect, nor does it disallow the use of abilities that do not require tapping.|$|E
25|$|The {{electricity}} {{sector in}} Colombia {{is dominated by}} large hydropower generation (65%) and thermal generation (35%). Despite the country’s large potential in new renewable energy technologies (mainly wind, solar and biomass), this potential has been barely <b>tapped.</b> <b>A</b> 2001 law designed to promote alternative energies lacks certain key provisions to achieve this objective, such as feed-in tariffs, and has had little impact so far. Large hydropower and thermal plants dominate the current expansion plans. The construction of a transmission line with Panama, which will link Colombia with Central America, is underway.|$|E
25|$|The first {{investigations}} led to {{the arrest}} of Vincenzo Scarantino on 26 September 1992, accused by pentiti of having stolen the car used in the explosion. (Scarantino later became a pentito himself.) The magistrates also discovered the phone of Borsellino's mother had been <b>tapped.</b> <b>A</b> first trial for the massacre ended on 26 January 1996, with Scarantino sentenced to 18 years in prison, while Giuseppe Orofino, Salvatore Profeta and Pietro Scotto, those who prepared the bomb and intercepted the phone, were sentenced to life imprisonment. Scotto and Orofino, however, were acquitted on appeal. A second trial was started in 2002 after Scarantino changed his statements; this time, bosses Riina and Pietro Aglieri were accused of having ordered the massacre. Riina, Aglieri, Salvatore Biondino, Giuseppe Graviano, Carlo Greco, Gaetano Scotto, Francesco Tagliavia, Cosimo Vernengo, Giuseppe La Mattina, Natale Gambino, Lorenzo Tinnirello, Giuseppe Urso and Gaetano Muran were sentenced to life imprisonment. A third trial involved 26 other mafia bosses who had been involved in the massacre in various ways, ending with life sentences for Bernardo Provenzano, Pippo Calò, Michelangelo La Barbera, Raffaele Ganci, Domenico Ganci, Francesco Madonia, Giuseppe Montalto, Filippo Graviano, Cristoforo Cannella, Salvatore Biondo and another Salvatore Biondo.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary reviewers {{and modern}} critics have {{postulated}} numerous possible {{sources of the}} story, a search Jershua McCormack argues is futile because Wilde [...] "has <b>tapped</b> <b>a</b> root of Western folklore so deep and ubiquitous that the story has escaped its origins {{and returned to the}} oral tradition." [...] Wilde claimed the plot was [...] "an idea that is as old as the history of literature but to which I have given a new form". Modern critic Robin McKie considered the novel to be technically mediocre, saying that the conceit of the plot had guaranteed its fame, but the device is never pushed to its full.|$|E
500|$|One {{of the few}} primary network {{programs}} {{outside of}} news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era {{became one of the}} most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in radio program, which launched on November 3, 1975, with Herb Jepko as host. Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of KSL in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversy that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by Long John Nebel, before Mutual <b>tapped</b> <b>a</b> local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. Larry King made his national debut on Mutual on January 30, 1978; by 1980, his show was being carried by around 200 stations and was credited with attracting many new affiliates to the network. King continued his Mutual call-in show until 1994, even after he began appearing on CNN television in 1985. [...] From 1970 through 1977, Mutual was the national radio broadcaster for Monday Night Football.|$|E
500|$|Despite his struggles at {{the plate}} during the regular season, Ruiz was an {{integral}} part of the Phillies' postseason success. After the Phillies clinched the 2008 National League Championship Series, he commented that the glory of winning a crucial baseball game that clinched the series, which he had witnessed while growing up in Panama on television, [...] "happened to me", noting the aura of the moment, and that it culminated and validated the hard work he had put in over the years. Subsequently, in game 3 of the 2008 World Series, Ruiz <b>tapped</b> <b>a</b> ground ball up the third-base line for a walk-off infield single, the first in MLB history. Ruiz noted, [...] "I heard them cheering. And that's when I knew, 'Okay it's over'... I'll take a win." [...] The Phillies eventually won the World Series for the first time since 1980, doing so in five games, the last of which began on October 27 and ended on October 29 after it was suspended part-way through due to rain. For his performance in the playoffs, he earned the nickname [...] "Señor Octubre" [...] (Mr. October in Spanish).|$|E

500|$|The Lower Basin {{states also}} sought to develop the Colorado for {{municipal}} supplies. Central Arizona initially relied on the Gila River and its tributaries through projects such as the Theodore Roosevelt and Coolidge Dams – completed in 1911 and 1928, respectively. Roosevelt was the first large dam constructed by the USBR and provided the water needed to start large-scale agricultural and urban development in the region. The Colorado River Aqueduct, which delivers water nearly [...] from near Parker Dam to 10million people in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, was completed in 1941. The San Diego Aqueduct branch, whose initial phase was complete by 1947, furnishes water to nearly 3million people in San Diego and its suburbs. The Las Vegas Valley of Nevada experienced rapid growth {{in part due to}} Hoover Dam construction, and Las Vegas had <b>tapped</b> <b>a</b> pipeline into Lake Mead by 1937. Nevada officials, believing that groundwater resources {{in the southern part of}} the state were sufficient for future growth, were more concerned with securing a large amount of the dam's power supply than water from the Colorado; thus they settled for the smallest allocation of all the states in the Colorado River Compact.|$|E

2500|$|In 1967, the PPP <b>tapped</b> <b>a</b> wave {{of anger}} against Ayub Khan and {{successfully}} called for major labour strikes in the country. Criticism on the United States and Ayub Khan further damaged Ayub Khan's {{authority in the}} country. By the end of 1968, Ayub Khan forwarded the Agartala Case {{which led to the}} arrests of many of Awami League leaders, but was forced to withdraw after a serious provisional uprising in East Pakistan. Under pressured from the PPP, [...] public resentment, and anger against his administration, Ayub Khan resigned from the presidency in poor health and handing over his authority to army commander, a little known personality and heavy alcoholic, General Yahya Khan, who imposed martial law and suspended the constitution, thus dissolving the presidential republic.|$|E
2500|$|After the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, the {{cultural}} revolution, resentment, hostility towards {{the government began}} to arise when the population felt that [...] "Kashmir cause" [...] was betrayed by President Ayub Khan. Problems further mounted after Foreign minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was sacked and vowed to take a revenge. After gathering and uniting the scattered democratic socialist and Marxist masses, Bhutto founded the Pakistan Peoples Party in 1967. The socialists <b>tapped</b> <b>a</b> wave of antipathy against the United States-allied president. The socialists integrated in poor and urban provinces of West Pakistan, educating people to cast their vote for their better future, {{and the importance of}} democracy was widely sensed in the entire country. The socialists, under Bhutto's guidance and leadership, played a vital role in managing labour strikes and civil disobedience to challenge Khan's authority. The military government responded fiercely after arresting the senior socialists' leadership, notably Bhutto, Mubashir Hassan, and Malick Mirage. This sparked gruesome violence in West Pakistan, thereby increasing pressure on Khan that he was unable to endure. Khan called for a Round Table Conference in Rawalpindi, but socialists led by Bhutto refused to accept Ayub's continuation in office and rejected the 6 Point Movement for regional autonomy put forth in 1966 by East Pakistani politician Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.|$|E
2500|$|The {{water was}} {{stored in the}} tanks and then {{released}} suddenly, the wave of water sweeping away the soil to reveal the bedrock and any gold-bearing veins beneath. Pliny the Elder gives a dramatic account in his Naturalis Historia of the method, possibly derived from his experiences in Spain. The method is known as hushing and survived in use until the 19th century in Britain, and into the 20th century in the goldfields of Africa. A not dissimilar method is used today in exploiting alluvial tin deposits, and is known as hydraulic mining. A smaller scale {{version of the same}} method is placer mining, and both may have been used to work alluvial placer deposits next to the river Cothi itself, judging by a large aqueduct which tapped the river a mile or so upstream, and enters the site at a low level compared with the other known aqueducts on the site. The water supply of the aqueducts was also used for washing crushed gold ore, and also possibly driving stamping mills for comminution of the ore (Lewis and Jones, 1969). One of the first aqueducts was built at a high level on the east slope of Allt Cwmhenog and <b>tapped</b> <b>a</b> small stream about [...] away. There is a large tank at its end, where it sweeps around the brow of the hill onto {{the west side of the}} ridge. A gold vein must have been discovered here, because there is a large opencast below the tank. Yet the larger and longer aqueduct (with a gradient of 1 in 800) taps the river Cothi about [...] to the north-east and traverses the same opencast, so must be later in date.|$|E
