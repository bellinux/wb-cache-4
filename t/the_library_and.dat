Compared to other libraries in Malaya which lost nearly half of their collections, only some 500 reference books were looted according to a stocktake done after the war.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to improve the {{acoustic}} environment in <b>libraries</b> <b>and</b> to construct <b>the</b> model of the desirable acoustic environment in <b>libraries,</b> based on <b>the</b> theory of soundscape and soundscape design. In order to think of soundscape in <b>libraries,</b> <b>the</b> author set up the following 3 levels: (1) public space, (2) cultural information centers, <b>and</b> (3) <b>libraries,</b> <b>and</b> examined some examples of soundscape design and the possibility of applying them to each levels. First of all, it is important to clarify the existing acoustic environment of the facilities. Therefore the author investigated the existing acoustic environment of <b>the</b> <b>libraries</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> acoustic environmental awareness of librarians by questionnaire, focussing on <b>the</b> public <b>libraries</b> in Saitama <b>and</b> Yamanashi prefectures.

5|$|The {{building}} did {{not last}} very longâ€”damage to the Inn during the Blitz completely destroyed <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> <b>and</b> {{a large part of}} its collection, although the rare manuscripts, which had been moved elsewhere, survived. After the destruction of much of the Inn's collection, George VI donated replacements for many lost texts. A prefabricated building in the Walks was used to hold the surviving books while a new Library was constructed, and the new building (designed by Sir Edward Maufe) was opened in 1958. It is similar in size to the old Holker Library, but is more workmanlike and designed to allow for easy access to the books.|$|E

5|$|At 3 a.m. about 120 {{bank and}} trust company {{officials}} assembled {{to hear a}} full report {{on the status of}} the failing trust companies. While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in <b>the</b> <b>library</b> <b>and</b> pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed the bankers to go home.|$|E
5|$|At its {{session of}} 23 November 2006, the {{planning}} {{committee of the}} city council charged its staff with examining how the Altes Stadthaus could be used for large-scale retail without damaging it as an architectural landmark. The report, which was presented at the end of December, recommended reuse of the already modified internal space housing <b>the</b> <b>library,</b> <b>and</b> creation of additional usable space up to a total of approximately 1600mÂ². This could be done by lowering the floor to street level and modifying stairway areas without changing the external appearance of the building, which is characteristic of government buildings of the 1920s, particularly in its blocky ground floor. Changes to the upper floors, which remained largely in their original condition, were not recommended.|$|E
