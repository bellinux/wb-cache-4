500|$|Paul remains {{interested}} in the rundown motel and tries to convince Steph and Doug Willis (Terence Donovan) to become investors, so he can buy the business. He organises a Citizen of the Year event at the motel, but it is stolen by Lassiter's after Steph accidentally costs the motel their liquor licence. Paul asks Cecilia Saint (Candice Alley) to sabotage the event, but is horrified when the hotel boiler explodes, injuring Daniel and killing Josh and Doug. While supporting a grieving Terese, admitting {{to her that he}} loves her, Paul worries that Cecilia caused the explosion. Paul persuades Nene to lie to the police to support his false alibi. Paul is arrested after he is found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>deleted</b> CCTV footage of him in the boiler room. Steph visits Paul in prison, where he maintains his innocence. They put up the motel for Paul's bail and he is released. Terese is angry when he comes to Josh's funeral and later says she hates him. Paul investigates alternative suspects, but Mark tells him to stop. After Julie Quill (Gail Easdale) accuses Paul of harassment, his bail conditions are reviewed and he is required to wear an ankle monitor. Aaron becomes Paul's PR adviser. Paul does an interview with Piper which is put online. Paul's position becomes worse when Cecilia tells the police that Paul confessed. Aaron then advises Paul {{to take part in a}} voluntary clean-up, which is criticised by Nate. Paul is hit by a car and taken to hospital. After being discharged, Paul decides to run away and he steals $3000 from the motel. Paul meets Jacka in the bush and seeks his help in getting a passport. He then calls Steph asking her to bring him money, but she refuses.|$|E

He explains that he wants her to leave Erinsborough as he does not want her near Jimmy. Paul swaps Steph's medication for psychotropic drugs, which triggers a relapse. He offers to drive her to her doctor in Bendigo, but he swerves to avoid another car and crashes into a tree. When Paul regains consciousness, he sees that Steph has found the drugs in his pocket and forces him to tell her his plan. She later blackmails him into giving her a job and money in exchange for not reporting him to the police. Paul is forced to liquidate his assets to pay off his debts. The bank sells Lassiter's to the Quill Group and Paul is escorted from the penthouse by the police. Paul lives in the Men's Shed until Terese invites him to live at her house. Paul plans to start a new business, making gazebos, in partnership with Amy. He needs to borrow money to get started and Dimato offers to lend to him, but after learning about Paul's scheme to gaslight Steph, Amy refuses {{to go ahead with the}} gazebo project with Paul. Dimato tells Paul he is considering buying a rundown motel and renovating it, and offers to make Paul the manager. However Paul later discovers Dimato is attempting to frame Paige Smith (Olympia Valance) for burglary, and blackmails Dimato into leaving town. Terese kisses Paul and invites him to her bedroom, but does not take things further and tells Paul that she just wants to be friends. Paul remains interested in the rundown motel and tries to convince Steph and Doug Willis (Terence Donovan) to become investors, so he can buy the business.

He then calls Steph asking her to bring him money, but she refuses. After hearing a conversation between Steph and Amy, Jimmy finds Paul in the bush. Jimmy has an allergic reaction to a bee sting and Paul takes him to hospital, resulting in him being arrested and remanded in custody. Toadie agrees to represent Paul, but only if he pleads guilty. Paul pleads not guilty and Steph persuades Toadie to defend him. At the end of the trial Terese admits to having bribed Cecilia to commit perjury. Despite this, Paul is found guilty and sentenced to eighteen years jail with a non-parole period of fourteen years. Paul decides not to appeal and urges Steph, Amy and Jimmy not to visit him in jail. Another prisoner warns Paul that he is in danger of being assaulted in jail. Paul asks Gary Canning to protect him, however Gary is then granted parole. Paul is assaulted and taken to hospital. He is later released from prison after Julie Quill confesses to blowing up the hotel. On learning that the Quill group is selling Lassiter's, Paul plans to buy it back and he intends to sack Terese if successful, but Terese oganises a counter-bid and wins Lucy's approval. Paul then involves Gary in secretly photocopying the hotel's strategic plan. Paul plans to open a new restaurant called [...] "Flame Trees" [...] at his motel and wants Madison to sing at the opening but Lassiter's is planning to hold a pigeon race on the same day. Paul releases Piper's cat among the pigeons and two are killed, but not Gary's. Paul discovers that Brad is making payments to Maxine Cowper, who he meets.

40|$|Background: Glucokinase (GCK) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. In the liver, phosphorylation of glucose to glucose- 6 -phosphate by GCK is the first step for both glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. However, some vertebrate species are deficient in GCK activity in the liver, despite containing GCK genes that appear to be compatible with function in their genomes. Glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) is the most important post-transcriptional regulator of GCK in the liver; it participates in the modulation of GCK activity and location depending upon changes in glucose levels. In experimental models, loss of GCKR has been shown to associate with reduced hepatic GCK protein levels and activity. Methodology/Principal Findings: GCKR genes and GCKR-like sequences were identified in the genomes of all vertebrate species with available genome sequences. The coding sequences of GCKR and GCKR-like genes were identified and aligned; base changes likely to disrupt coding potential or splicing were also identified. Conclusions/Significance: GCKR genes could not be found in the genomes of 9 vertebrate species, including all birds. In addition, in multiple mammalian genomes, whereas GCKR-like gene sequences could be identified, these genes could not predict a functional protein. Vertebrate species that were previously reported to be deficient in hepatic GCK activity were found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>deleted</b> (birds and lizard) or mutated (mammals) GCKR genes.

40|$|This is {{a genetic}} study of {{flowering}} time in cultivated barley {{with the aim}} to identify the alleles contributing to rapid flowering and frost resistance. We have genotyped a collection of 23 historic barley varieties for the crucial genes [VRN- 1, VRN- 2, VRN- 3 (HvFT), Ppd-H 1, CO, and Vrs 1]. We have amplified the polymorphic mutations by PCR-based methods, and sequenced them to identify possible haplotype groups. The row type was not determined of all accessions, but all the Scandinavian varieties were found to carry mutant alleles of Vrs 1, that indicates them to be six-row barleys. The deletion of the crucial segment of VRN- 1 vernalization contributes dominant spring growth habit. We found haplotype groups 2 and 4 to be dominant in Northern barleys whereas haplotype groups 1 and 5 dominated in south. The presence of dominant allele VRN- 2 gene is addressed to floral repression until plants get vernalized. Most of the 23 varieties were found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>deleted</b> allele of VRN- 2, which is connected with a spring growth habit. The only four of the accessions that have the dominant allele of Ppd-H 1 that contribute flowering are generally from the south of Europe. HvFT and CO genes CO-interact to influence flowering time. CO haplotype grouping suggest a geographical distribution of different alleles but needs more disseminations. Certain HvFT alleles cause extremely early flowering during apex development in the varieties that have deletion of VRN- 2 alleles under long days. VRN- 3 alleles of 14 varieties were identified...|$|E

40|$|A novel trypanocide, 2, 5 -bis(4 -amidinophenyl) furan (DB 75), in its prodrug amidoxime-derivative form, 2, 5 -bis(4 -amidinophenyl) furan-bis-O-methylamidoxime (DB 289), is in trials as {{the first}} orally {{administered}} drug for human African trypanosomiasis. DB 75 is a diamidine. Resistance to some diamidines correlates to loss of uptake via the P 2 aminopurine transporter. We show here that uptake of DB 75 into Trypanosoma brucei also occurs principally via the P 2 transporter. Uptake of tritiated DB 75 occurred via a high-affinity (Km app, 3. 2 μM) carriermediated route that was inhibited by adenosine, adenine, and pentamidine, all known substrates of the P 2 transporter. Trypanosomes lacking the TbAT 1 gene that encodes the P 2 transporter demonstrated an 11 -fold reduction in sensitivity to DB 75 when measured under controlled in vitro conditions. These knockout cells were also less sensitive to DB 75 than wild-type cells in mice. Initial uptake rates of DB 75 into the Δtbat 1 knockout cell line were greatly reduced compared with rates in wild-type cells. A trypanosome cell line selected in vitro for DB 75 resistance was shown to have lost P 2 -mediated DB 75 uptake. The TbAT 1 gene was mapped to chromosome V of the T. brucei genome and the DB 75 -resistant parasites were shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>deleted</b> both alleles of this gene. Fluorescence microscopy of DB 75 -treated trypanosomes revealed that DB 75 fluorescence localizes rapidly within the DNA-containing organelles of wild-type trypanosomes, whereas no fluorescence was observed in Δtbat 1 -null parasites or in the parasites selected for resistance to DB 75...|$|E
40|$|Dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) is {{a leading}} cause for cardiac transplantation with an estimated prevalence of 36. 5 per 100, 000 individuals in the USA.   DCM is a disorder characterized by ventricular dilation and systolic contractile dysfunction.   It {{is the result of}} a heterogenous group of inherited and acquired disorders and is an important cause of heart failure.   Idiopathic DCM is the most common cause of DCM and accounts for ~ 50 % of cases with a familial basis found in up to 35 %. A genome wide screen in four generations of a Puerto Rican kindred with autosomal dominant isolated familial dilated cardiomyopathy (FDCM) was conducted.   Two-point linkage analysis mapped the disease locus to chromosome 14 q 11. 2 - 13 (lod score = 5. 11 at q  = 0).   The b-myosin heavy chain (b-MHC) candidate gene mapped to this region and direct sequencing identified a single nucleotide T 168 C mutation (Ser ®Pro 532) which was highly conserved across a range of different species.   A novel mismatch primer that converted the half-site to a full recognition site for the Sph I endonuclease independently confirmed the mutation and its absence in 192 normal chromosomes.   A further disease causing mutation 2378 C ®G  replacing Phe 764 Leu in b-MHC was identified in an unrelated family.   A further two unrelated FDCM families were found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>deleted</b> one of four tandem lysine residues (DLys 210) of the cardiac troponin T gene.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{analyzed}} the performance of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in Colombia with discrepancies in performance being attributed to a combination of factors such as parasite levels, interpretation of RDT results and/or the handling and storage of RDT kits. However, some of the inconsistencies observed with results from Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP 2) -based RDTs could also be explained by the deletion of the gene that encodes the protein, pfhrp 2, and its structural homolog, pfhrp 3, in some parasite isolates. Given that pfhrp 2 - and pfhrp 3 -negative P. falciparum isolates have been detected in the neighboring Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon regions, we hypothesized that parasites with deletions of pfhrp 2 and pfhrp 3 may also be present in Colombia. In this study we tested 100 historical samples collected between 1999 and 2009 from six Departments in Colombia for the presence of pfhrp 2, pfhrp 3 and their flanking genes. Seven neutral microsatellites were also used to determine the genetic background of these parasites. In total 18 of 100 parasite isolates were found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>deleted</b> pfhrp 2, a majority of which (14 of 18) were collected from Amazonas Department, which borders Peru and Brazil. pfhrp 3 deletions were found in 52 of the 100 samples collected from all regions of the country. pfhrp 2 flanking genes PF 3 D 7 _ 0831900 and PF 3 D 7 _ 0831700 were deleted in 22 of 100 and in 1 of 100 samples, respectively. pfhrp 3 flanking genes PF 3 D 7 _ 1372100 and PF 3 D 7 _ 1372400 were missing in 55 of 100 and in 57 of 100 samples. Structure analysis of microsatellite data indicated that Colombian samples tested in this study belonged to four clusters and they segregated mostly based on their geographic region. Most of the pfhrp 2 -deleted parasites were assigned to a single cluster and originated from Amazonas Department although a few pfhrp 2 -negative parasites originated from the other three clusters. The presence of a high proportion of pfhrp 2 -negative isolates in the Colombian Amazon may have implications for the use of PfHRP 2 -based RDTs in the region and may explain inconsistencies observed when PfHRP 2 -based tests and assays are performed. 26151448 PMC 449481...|$|E

40|$|A aplicação de ar quente em videiras foi primeiramente realizada na fazenda do Sr. Florenzo Lazo, localizada no Chile, onde havia a necessidade de combater os efeitos negativos das freqüentes geadas que resultava em severos danos à lavoura. Por este motivo o Sr. Florenzo inventou uma máquina que aplicava ar quente com baixa umidade e tinha por objetivo dispersar o ar frio proveniente das geadas. Após certo tempo, foi observado pelo produtor que {{no local}} onde a máquina havia operado com maior frequência as plantas apresentavam-se com uma coloração mais escura e com sinais de maior vitalidade. Seguindo estas observações, relacionamos estes efeitos a um possível aumento nos fito-hormônios relacionados ao estresse vegetal e à SAR (Systemic Resistence Adquired), como o ácido salicílico (AS), ácido jasmônico (AJ) e ácido abscísico (ABA), além de fazer uma correlação com alguns resultados de pós-colheita importantes para a comercialização, como: Sólidos solúveis, firmeza e coloração. Para isso foi montado um experimento que foi conduzido em duas parcelas, sendo uma com tratamento TPC e outra apenas com o tratamento convencional com distância padronizada em 3, 2 metros entre linhas por 2, 0 metros entre planta. As amostras eram coletadas diariamente e devidamente acondicionadas. Ao final da safra, as amostras foram transportadas para o laboratório de estresse e neurofisiologia da universidade de São Paulo (LEPSE), onde foram novamente armazenadas em um Ultra-freezer - 86 ºC. As analises fisiológicas de pós-colheita foram {{realizadas}} no departamento de pós-colheita da universidade de São Paulo onde foram analisados os teores de sólidos solúveis, coloração e firmeza das bagas de uva. As amostras de folhas foram maceradas e uniformizadas no LEPSE e enviadas para o laboratório de ecotoxicologia do Centro de Energia Nuclear na Agricultura (CENA) onde foram mensurados os teores dos fito-hormônios pelo método de espectrometria de massa. Para ambas as analises foram feitos testes estatísticos utilizando o programa SAS®. Não houve alteração de SS e firmeza entre os dois tratamentos para as características fisiológicas de póscolheita. Entretanto foi notado uma redução na coloração avermelhada para os cachos tratados com TPC seguindo o sistema de colorimetria proposto pelo CIE. Não houve alterações significantes para as variáveis ABA, AJ e AS para o efeito tratamento e para a analise de correlação. Entretanto notou-se significância entre o efeito dias para as variáveis ABA e AJ. Não foi notada significância para o efeito dias para a variável AS. Por se tratar de um estresse rápido, a TPC parece não causar estresse imediato nas plantas, entretanto notou-se indução de estresse ao longo do tempo, possivelmente devido à resposta lenta de ABA que aparentemente está envolvida com RNA e à síntese de proteínas S e R- ABA que são igualmente efetivas. Já para o AJ sugere-se que houve a produção de H 2 O 2 por derivados de oligogalacturonideos, liberados por ação da enzima poligalacturonase, e um segundo mensageiro que ativam genes defensivos (genes tardios). O aumento na biossíntese do ABA e do AJ parece ter suprimido genes envolvidos na biossíntese do AS. The application {{of hot air}} in grapevines was first held on the farm of Mr. Florenzo Lazo, located in Chile, to combat {{the negative effects of}} frequent frosts that resulted in severe damage to the crop. For this reason Mr. Florenzo invented a machine that applied hot air with low humidity and aimed to disperse the cold air from the frost. After a while, it was observed by the producer that where the machine had operated more frequently plants showed up with a darker and more signs of vitality. Following these observations, these effects relate to a possible increase in phytohormones related to plant stress and SAR (Systemic Resistance Adquired), such as salicylic acid (AS), jasmonic acid (AJ) and abscisic acid (ABA), besides making a correlation with results of some important postharvest for marketing, such as soluble solids, firmness and color. For this experiment was created that was conducted in two installments, the first one was treated with TPC and second one was applied only conventional treatment with standardized distance of 3. 2 meters between lines by 2. 0 meters between plant. The samples were collected daily and properly packed. At the end of the season, samples were transported to the laboratory stress and neurophysiology from the University of São Paulo (LEPSE), where they were again stored in an Ultra-freezer - 86 degrees. The physiological analyses of post-harvest were performed at the Department of Postharvest in University of Sao Paulo where we analyzed the levels of soluble solids, firmness and color in grape berries. The leaf samples were uniform macerated at LEPSE and sent to the laboratory of ecotoxicology in the Center for Nuclear Energy in Agriculture (CENA) where we measured the levels of the phytohormones by the method of mass spectrometry. For both analyzes were performed statistical tests using SAS ® program. There wasn`t change between the two treatments on physiological post-harvest characteristics. There was no change of SS and firmly between the two treatments for the physiological of post-harvest characteristics. However it was noted a reduction in red color for bunches treated with TPC following the colorimetry system by CIE. There were no significant changes to the variables ABA, AJ and AS for the treatment effect and to analyze the correlation. However significance was noted between the effect variables ABA days and AJ. No significant effect was noted for days variable for AS. Since it is a stress fast TPC does not seem to cause immediate stress in plants but it was noticed induction of stress over time, possibly due to slow response to ABA which apparently is involved in the synthesis of RNA and proteins S and R-ABA that are equally effective. As for AJ suggests that there was the production of H 2 O 2 by derivatives of oligogalacturonides, released by action of the enzyme polygalacturonase, and a second messenger that activates defensive genes (late genes). The increase in ABA biosynthesis and AJ appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>deleted</b> genes involved in the biosynthesis of AS...|$|E
