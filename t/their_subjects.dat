40|$|Recent {{events in}} England and Wales {{would suggest that}} {{geography}} teachers need to re-engage with <b>their</b> <b>subject</b> matter {{to enable them to}} improve how they teach the geography. However, this requires a detailed understanding of how teachers use <b>their</b> <b>subject</b> knowledge. This paper outlines how two geography teachers experience tension between how they understand geography at an academic level and the ways they prefer to teach it. How they resolve these conflicts shows that these teachers have an active relationship with <b>their</b> <b>subject</b> that enables them to develop curricula in line with their values about geography...|$|R

Groups may be mixed around year by year.|$|E
5|$|Crusades were expensive, and as {{the wars}} {{increased}} in number, their costs escalated. Pope UrbanII called upon the rich to help First Crusade lords such as Duke Robert of Normandy and Count Raymond of Toulouse, who subsidised knights in their armies. The total cost to King LouisIX of France of the 1284–85 Crusades was estimated at six times the king's annual income. Rulers demanded subsidies from <b>their</b> <b>subjects,</b> and alms and bequests prompted by the conquest of Palestine were additional sources of income. The popes ordered that collection boxes be placed in churches and, beginning in the mid-12th century, granted indulgences in exchange for donations and bequests.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists {{often make}} a {{critical}} distinction that masculine bias in economics {{is primarily a}} result of gender, not sex. In other words, when feminist economists highlight the biases of mainstream economics, they focus on its social beliefs about masculinity like objectivity, separation, logical consistency, individual accomplishment, mathematics, abstraction, and lack of emotion, {{but not on the}} gender of authorities and subjects. However, the over-representation of men among economists and <b>their</b> <b>subjects</b> of study is also a concern.|$|E
25|$|From {{the human}} soul there {{naturally}} issue forth powers pertaining to two orders, the organic and the non-organic. The organic powers, among which are the senses, have the composite as <b>their</b> <b>subject.</b> The non-organic powers have the soul alone as <b>their</b> <b>subject.</b> Hence, the intellect is a power intrinsically independent of any bodily organ.|$|R

5|$|Giving Jharokha Darshan {{from this}} jharokha was a daily feature. This {{tradition}} was also continued by rulers who followed Akbar (r. 1556–1605 CE). Jahangir (r. 1605–27 CE) and Shah Jahan (r. 1628–58 CE) also appeared before <b>their</b> <b>subjects</b> punctiliously. However, this ancient practice was discontinued by Aurangzeb during his 11th year of reign as he {{considered it a}} non-Islamic practice, a form of idol worship. In Agra Fort and Red Fort, the jharokha faces the Yamuna and the emperor would stand alone on the jharokha to greet his subjects.|$|E
5|$|In Ireland, Dál Riata formed part of Ulster, {{ruled by}} Báetán mac Cairill of the Dál Fiatach. The other major {{grouping}} in Ulster were the disunited tribes of the Cruithne, later {{known as the}} Dál nAraidi. The most important Cruithne king in Áedán's time was Fiachnae mac Báetáin. Beyond the kingdom of Ulster, and generally hostile to it, were the various kingdoms and tribes of the Uí Néill and <b>their</b> <b>subjects</b> and allies. Of the Uí Néill kings, Áed mac Ainmuirech of the Cenél Conaill, Columba's first cousin once removed, {{was the most important}} during Áedán's reign.|$|E
5|$|Lyrical poets {{often took}} <b>their</b> <b>subjects</b> from myth, but their {{treatment}} became gradually less narrative and more allusive. Greek lyric poets, including Pindar, Bacchylides and Simonides, and bucolic poets such as Theocritus and Bion, relate individual mythological incidents. Additionally, myth {{was central to}} classical Athenian drama. The tragic playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides took most of their plots from myths {{of the age of}} heroes and the Trojan War. Many of the great tragic stories (e.g. Agamemnon and his children, Oedipus, Jason, Medea, etc.) took on their classic form in these tragedies. The comic playwright Aristophanes also used myths, in The Birds and The Frogs.|$|E

50|$|The {{concepts}} of c-selection and subcategorization overlap in meaning and use {{to a significant}} degree.

Traditionally, predicates are interpreted as NOT subcategorizing for <b>their</b> <b>subject</b> argument because the subject argument appears outside of the minimal VP containing the predicate. Predicates do, however, c-select <b>their</b> <b>subject</b> arguments, e.g.|$|R

5|$|Many princes {{were also}} {{pressured}} by popular sentiment favouring integration with India, which meant {{their plans for}} independence had little support from <b>their</b> <b>subjects.</b> The Maharaja of Travancore, for example, definitively abandoned his plans for independence after the attempted assassination of his dewan, Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer. In a few states, the chief ministers or dewans {{played a significant role}} in convincing the princes to accede to India. The key factors that led the states to accept integration into India were, however, the efforts of Lord Mountbatten, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon. The latter two were respectively the political and administrative heads of the States Department, which was in charge of relations with the princely states.|$|E
5|$|Marriages among ruling dynasties and <b>their</b> <b>subjects</b> have {{at times}} been common, with the marriages {{such as that}} of Edward the Confessor, King of England with Edith of Wessex and Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland with Elizabeth Granowska being far from unheard of in medieval Europe. However, as dynasties {{approached}} absolutism and sought to preserve loyalty among competing members of the nobility, most eventually distanced themselves from kinship ties to local nobles by marrying abroad. Marriages with subjects brought the king back down to the level of those he ruled, often stimulating the ambition of his consort's family and evoking jealousy—or disdain—from the nobility. The notion that monarchs should marry into the dynasties of other monarchs to end or prevent war was, at first, a policy driven by pragmatism. During the era of absolutism, this practice contributed to the notion that it was socially, as well as politically, disadvantageous for members of ruling families to intermarry with <b>their</b> <b>subjects</b> and pass over the opportunity for marriage into a foreign dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Particularly for kings, itineration was a {{vital part}} of governance, and in many cases kings would rely on the {{hospitality}} of <b>their</b> <b>subjects</b> for maintenance while on the road. This could be a costly affair for the localities visited; there was not only the large royal household to cater for, but also the entire royal administration. It was only {{towards the end of the}} medieval period, when means of communication improved, that households, both noble and royal, became more permanently attached to one residence.|$|E

5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that G-spot and clitoral orgasms are of the same origin. Masters and Johnson {{were the first to}} determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. Upon studying women's sexual response cycle to different stimulation, they observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of <b>their</b> <b>subjects</b> could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On this basis, Masters and Johnson argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.|$|E

Atangana set up a cabinet based on those he had observed in Spain, but he never allowed it to do much, and its members were not accustomed to European-style administration. It disbanded in 1925.|$|E
5|$|The Turkic-speaking Bulgars {{arrived in}} the territories west of the river Dniester around 670.

They soon imposed their authority {{over some of the}} neighboring tribes. The great variety in burial rites evidences the multi-ethnic character of the Bulgarian Empire. Even the Bulgars were divided in this respect; some of them practiced inhumation and others cremation. Initially, a sharp distinction existed between the Bulgars and <b>their</b> <b>subjects,</b> but the Slavicization of the Bulgars soon began.|$|E

5|$|The royal touch (also {{known as}} the king's touch) {{was a form of}} laying on of hands, whereby French and English monarchs touched <b>their</b> <b>subjects,</b> {{regardless}} of social classes, with the intent to cure them of various diseases and conditions. The thaumaturgic touch was most commonly applied to people suffering from tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis (better known as scrofula or the King's Evil), and exclusively to them from the 16th century onwards. The disease rarely resulted in death and often went into remission on its own, giving the impression that the monarch's touch cured it. The claimed power was most notably exercised by monarchs who sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of their reign and of their newly founded dynasties.|$|E
5|$|Two {{enduring}} royal traditions {{emerged in}} Imerina {{as a consequence}} of the power struggle between Andriamasinavalona and his older brother. Some versions of oral history describe a combat between their armies at Ambohibato in which Andriamasinavalona emerged victorious. He erected a commemorative stone at the battle site that he named Ankazonorona, designating it the site where newly enthroned kings would stand to receive their first expression of hasina (homage, affirmation of authority) from <b>their</b> <b>subjects.</b> Andriamasinavalona also introduced the practice of gathering his subjects to consult them and obtain their consent before making certain decisions. This practice was continued by subsequent rulers in Imerina.|$|E
5|$|While many documentaries {{maintain}} an emotional distance from <b>their</b> <b>subjects,</b> Meerkat Manor – {{due to its}} extended length, soap opera-like narration, romanticization of the animals' lives, and close-up filming techniques, provides a closer, more personal view of the meerkats. Viewers describe being emotionally involved in the animals' lives, sometimes forgetting they are watching a documentary. The meerkats' frequently short lives and brutal deaths become surprising and disturbing to some audiences. This experimental format was seen as expanding the boundaries of both the nature documentary genre {{and the nature of}} reality TV.|$|E
