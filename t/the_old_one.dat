5|$|The {{changes to}} unit {{structure}} in the 4th century were reduction of unit sizes and increase in unit numbers, establishment of new unit types and establishment of a hierarchy of units more complex than <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one</b> of legions and auxilia.|$|E
5|$|They then {{rebuilt the}} local church, {{and created a}} new model village to the north-west of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one.</b> Built in about 1840 of red sandstone, it {{consists}} of a row of cottages and a school.|$|E

50|$|The epic {{deals with}} two white horses owned by Genghis Khan. The younger one feels their {{services}} for the ruler are not being appreciated enough, and tries to convince <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>one</b> to move away together. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>one</b> is reluctant, but after the younger one runs away on his own, <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>one</b> follows.|$|R
5000|$|They {{arrive to}} find out by Scarlett's {{housekeeper}} that Scarlett's father has rushed her to Hong Kong on apparent [...] "urgent business". Matt is very disappointed by this news and he, Jamie and Richard have a meeting with The Nexus where Matt finally discovers <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Ones' plan. <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> have trapped Scarlett in Hong Kong, China in hope of luring Matt there too by using Scarlett as the bait. It is then discovered that <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> want <b>the</b> Gatekeepers to have the diary, {{so that they can}} discover where the doors around the world are, and as there is one in Hong Kong <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> hope <b>the</b> Gatekeepers will go through the door where <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> will capture them all and torture them, whilst <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> take over <b>the</b> world. It is then revealed that Scarlett's father works for Nightrise and so will give Scarlett to <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b>|$|R
5|$|After TransNet was renewed in November 2004, {{planning}} {{continued for}} widening the remaining portion of SR76 west of I-15, {{due to the}} frequent accidents that occurred on the eastern portion, although some claimed that the habits of drivers were at fault. The 2007 environmental impact report recommended constructing the new roadway along the route of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one,</b> rather than moving the entire highway south.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Denison, {{a wealthy}} banker, {{purchased}} the estate in about 1787, and it {{remained in the}} Denison family until 1849, when it passed to Thomas Cubitt, a master builder. At the time, Cubitt was working on Osborne House for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and the mansion he designed to replace <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one</b> was a more modest version of Osborne. It was still a substantial building though, in the Italianate style, with almost 100 rooms on three storeys.|$|E
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates' {{bodies and}} {{appendages}} {{are covered with}} a tough cuticle made mainly of chitin and chemically hardened proteins. Since this cannot stretch, the animals must molt to grow. In other words, they grow new but still soft cuticles, then cast off <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one</b> {{and wait for the}} new one to harden. Until the new cuticle hardens the animals are defenseless and almost immobilized.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> were a {{race that}} had evolved even earlier than the Necrontyr, but along {{substantially}} different lines. Where the Necrontyr developed purely on science and technology, leaving spirituality and mysticism in the dark annals of their history, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> embraced both science and their spirituality. In their alternate philosophies and mystic practices, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> eventually gained access to the primordial Warp, but not the Warp {{as it is known}} in the 41st Millennium. In the days of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> <b>the</b> Warp was a shining parallel reality where emotions, thoughts, and even dreams were intensely reflected and molded together. Through natural fluency and masterful concentration, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> used <b>the</b> Warp to become a civilization of powerful psykers, with supernatural abilities far exceeding any other sentient race in the galaxy. These abilities gave <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> a harmonious bond with (as well as control over) great cosmic forces, bestowing onto them the gift of immortality and near-omniscience. It is not known why <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> refused to trade or even interact with the expanding Necrontyr empire at the time, however their continual refusal to share their knowledge, most especially on the secrets of immortality, would eventually garner the enmity of the short-lived Necrontyr. This simmering hatred was used as a basis by the Triarchs to wage war with <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> created two massive gates at {{the poles}} that allowed instant {{transport}} between the Warhammer world and wherever <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> came from. Later, {{in the coming}} of Chaos, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> either went missing, or sacrificed themselves to try to destroy the polar gates and halt the never-ending tide of Chaos in a cataclysmic explosion. Every race formed by <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> fought against <b>the</b> threat of Chaos, including the great armies of the Lizardmen which consisted of billions of Saurus. After the wars, the Slann immediately put defences and wards in place to better contain the threat of Chaos.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fictional}} {{universe}} of Warhammer 40,000, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> traveled through space manipulating minor species on several planets and growing them into tools for their {{battle against the}} C'tan. The Slann were probably their servants. Although a reference in the novel Ghostmaker (2000) might indicate that <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> could be <b>the</b> Eldar, all other instances that refer to both the Eldar and <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> make clear that the two are separate races, the Eldar always being less powerful than [...] - [...] and usually servants and/or creations of [...] - [...] <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b>|$|R
5|$|Princeton University {{built the}} chapel {{to replace the}} Marquand Chapel, which stood between where the present chapel and McCosh Hall stand until it {{burned to the ground}} in 1920. The {{location}} for the new chapel was chosen for two reasons: symbolically, the new chapel would rise from the ashes of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one,</b> and practically, it would locate the new chapel centrally as the campus expanded eastward.|$|E
5|$|Radyr Cricket Club {{was founded}} in 1890 by the Earl of Plymouth, who granted a hundred-year lease for the current {{riverside}} ground to the local residents for a nominal sum. The pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1973 while the team were away on tour. Under {{the leadership of the}} new Chairman Keith Terry, a huge fund-raising effort was made and a new pavilion opened on the footprint of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one</b> in 1975. Radyr currently plays in the first division of the South Wales Premier Cricket League.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbering}} scheme for the point releases up to Debian 4.0 was {{to include the}} letter r (for revision) after the main version number and then {{the number of the}} point release; for example, the latest point release of version 4.0 is 4.0r9. This scheme was chosen because a new dotted version would make <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one</b> look obsolete and vendors would have trouble selling their CDs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> are <b>the</b> main villains in Anthony Horowitz's book series The Power of Five (2005-2012). As shapeshifting demons, {{they can}} take many forms. In <b>the</b> series, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> ruled Earth ten {{thousand}} years ago and suppressed numerous human rebellions before finally being banished into another dimension by the Gatekeepers, who are later reincarnated into modern teenagers {{in order to stop}} <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> when their prison is unlocked.|$|R
5000|$|Gwei {{is used as}} a {{collective}} term for <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> in Anthony Horowitz's The Power of Five (2005-2012). Gwei is the Chinese name for <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> and means [...] "evil spirit" [...] in the series.|$|R
5000|$|Halfrek {{refers to}} the First Evil when she says, [...] "Something's rising. Something <b>older</b> than <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> and everybody's tail is twitching," [...] therefore, The First Evil is a {{powerful}} force that predates even <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b>|$|R
5|$|The town got {{its first}} {{permanent}} library in 1938 {{in a building}} on Exeter Hill. In September 2011, a new library opened on a new site, which was four {{times the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one</b> and cost three million pounds. This was followed shortly afterwards, in December 2011, by the opening of the Cullompton Community Centre, costing 1.5 million pounds. The Tiverton Dramatic Society used the new venue to stage the first pantomime to be performed in Cullompton for 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Further, {{he points}} out that the {{language}} used by the Beowulf poet was already archaic, and the choice of words was at the time recognisably poetic. Tolkien gives as an example beorn, which meant both 'bear' and 'warrior', but only in heroic poetry could it be used to mean 'man'. He advises the translator to prefer 'striking' and 'smiting', and to avoid 'hitting' and 'whacking'. But on the other hand, he criticises William Morris for using the dead and unintelligible 'leeds' for OE leode ('freemen', 'people'; cf German leute), even if antiquarians feel that the word ought to have survived. Tolkien does not accept the etymological fallacy either: mod means 'pride', not 'mood'; burg is 'stronghold', not 'borough', even though the modern word derives from <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one.</b> After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the Lizardmen begins {{with the arrival of}} <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> in <b>the</b> Warhammer world; some of the Slann {{traveled}} among the stars with their godlike masters. When <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> arrived on <b>the</b> Warhammer world, they settled in Lustria where they created the Sub species of the Lizardmen (Saurus, Skinks and Kroxigors) from creatures already living there as servants that would help the Slann to fulfill the Plan of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b> During this time, generations of Slann were spawned on the earth as it was being shaped to how <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> wished it. Armies of Saurus destroyed unwanted races, and <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> created <b>the</b> races of Elves (powerful magicians), Dwarfs (magic resistant), and Men. Sometime during the earliest days of the Warhammer world, the Orcs and Goblins came into being, probably the result of some interstellar spore or parasite that had hitched a ride on <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Ones' ship. They were not part of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> Plan, but despite many attempts to exterminate this parasitic race, the Greenskins survived, and to this day, they are the bane of the civilised races.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the few}} races <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> {{encountered}} {{that were}} already sentient without their intervention were the Necrontyr. Where <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> were long-lived, with an average lifespan lasting for many Terran millennia, and had access to technology {{that allowed them to}} travel from settled world to world instantaneously through a network of Warpgates called the Webway, the Necrontyr were short-lived, and were bound to but one world. The Necrontyr grew increasingly jealous of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> and eventually set about going to war with them to wipe them out and claim their technology. <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> easily outmaneuvered these early, clumsy Necrontyr strikes by making use of their Webway, and the Necrontyr were soon defeated.|$|R
50|$|The village roads can {{be divided}} into two: <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ones,</b> which formed part of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> village and <b>the</b> newly {{constructed}} <b>ones.</b> <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>ones</b> were all named after various saints, {{but on the other hand}} the recent ones were named using several other criteria.|$|R
5|$|In direct {{opposition}} to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866. Beset with personal loss as well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson {{may have been too}} overcome to keep up her previous level of writing. Carlo died during this time after providing sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret O Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that her family brought in a permanent household servant, Margaret Maher, to replace <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one.</b> Emily once again was responsible for chores, including the baking, at which she excelled.|$|E
5|$|On December1, 2008, {{the bridge}} {{carrying}} NY270 over Tonawanda Creek (also the Erie Canal) {{was closed to}} traffic to allow construction to begin on a replacement bridge over the creek. The existing bridge was built in 1941 and considered to be structurally deficient. During construction, commuter traffic was detoured onto Tonawanda Creek and Bear Ridge Roads while trucks were instructed to follow NY263, NY78, and NY93 around the closed bridge. The new bridge was opened to traffic in July 2009. NY270's intersections with Tonawanda Creek Road (Erie CR2) and Tonawanda Creek Road North (Niagara CR60) on {{the north and south}} approaches to the bridge were reconstructed as part of the $10.9 million project. The new bridge is similar to the former, two-lane structure; however, unlike <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one,</b> it has wide shoulders for bicyclists and includes new sidewalks for pedestrians.|$|E
5|$|The Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge, {{the first}} bridge {{to connect the}} two towns, had become {{functionally}} obsolete. Its narrow road had only two lanes with no shoulders. Because of its location near a sharp bend in the Mississippi River, the bridge had become a hazard to river traffic; barges and towboats frequently collided with it. In 1994, a study concluded that a new bridge was needed and <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one</b> should be torn down. Construction was begun in 2001 and the new bridge opened in 2010. In 2011, the process of removing the old bridge began.|$|E
50|$|In Being Human (UK), <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> are a {{group of}} vampires of varying ages. They are {{introduced}} with Ivan in series 2, and Hal Yorke, {{a member of the}} series 4-5 trio, is an <b>Old</b> <b>One.</b> Series four's main plot revolves around <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> trying to take over the world. The vampire world takes great effort to prepare for them, including rituals, Cutler's plan, even such things as red carpets. <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> are unaffected by religious symbols. Mr. Snow is an <b>Old</b> <b>One</b> and also one of the first vampires, whose blood can be found in every vampire.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{also the}} first novel in the series which {{prominently}} features a somewhat divine opposition against <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> with <b>the</b> introduction of the Librarian. The Librarian's role is brief and never elaborated upon, but it is made clear the Librarian has vast power. It is obvious he is there to combat <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b> This marks a significant change because {{in the first three}} novels <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> had seemingly invincible power and the Five had to face them themselves with no help.|$|R
30|$|New {{industries}} emerge, replacing <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>ones.</b>|$|R
5|$|The dam {{was built}} by the Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company to meet the {{electrical}} energy needs for mining operations. The dam continues to be fully functional for hydroelectric generation, {{as one of the}} drinking water sources to Juneau city and for aquaculture and fishing. When built, adoption of the constant arch design for the dam reduced costs by 20% because less concrete was needed to construct the dam. Of the two hydroelectric power stations built at the initial stage (one at the upper level and the other at the lower level) â€“ the latter one is still in use after a new powerhouse was built adjoining <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one</b> â€“ it produces the inexpensive electricity in Alaska while meeting 10% of the energy needs of Juneau city. When built, the dam and its two power plants were considered engineering wonders. Both are operated and maintained by the Alaska Electric Light & Power (AEL).|$|E
5|$|The {{return to}} Allsvenskan {{was the start}} of the {{successful}} early 2000s, under the management of Tom Prahl, when the club finished in the top three three times in a row. In 2004, it won Allsvenskan, the club's fifteenth Swedish Championship. In 2005, the club reached the last qualifying round for the UEFA Champions League but were defeated by FC Thun. Successful sponsor work and player sales also made MalmÃ¶ FF the richest club in Sweden, a position they still hold as of 2013. The club moved from MalmÃ¶ Stadion to Swedbank Stadion in 2009, a stadium built entirely for football and located next to <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} based on a real {{experience}} Carrier had as a child in Sainte-Justine, Quebec in 1946 as a fan of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team and its star player, Maurice Richard. Carrier and his friends all wear Canadiens' sweaters with Richard's number 9 on the back. When his mother orders a new sweater from the department store in the big city after <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>one</b> has worn out, he is mistakenly sent a sweater of Montreal's bitter rival, the Toronto Maple Leafs, instead. Carrier faces the persecution of his peers and his coach prevents him from playing.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to in Palladium Books publications as <b>the</b> Great <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> or <b>the</b> Unnameable Beings) are a fictional race of Alien Intelligences within the megaversal setting of Palladium Books' game module PFRPG. <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> are <b>the</b> most powerful forces ever to have existed in the various Palladium game settings, and their power dwarfs that of 'ordinary' Alien Intelligences, beings which are in general far {{more powerful than the}} gods themselves.|$|R
50|$|In their travels, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> seeded many worlds with life, and {{encouraged}} {{the development of}} indigenous animal and intelligent life on many more. Life on Earth {{is believed to have}} been created in this way as <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> probably first seeded it with primitive, single-celled lifeforms.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{very rare}} breed of Saurus that are marked by <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> {{indicated}} by <b>the</b> fact their scales are pure white. These Albino Saurus are seen as prophets, chosen by <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> for their Grand Scheme. A good example {{of one of these}} albino Saurus is Gor-Rok.|$|R
