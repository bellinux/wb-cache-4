5|$|At {{the urging}} of friends in the anti-slavery movement, Coffin moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1847 to operate a {{warehouse}} that sold only free-labor goods. Despite making considerable progress with the business, the free-labor venture proved unprofitable and he abandoned the enterprise in 1857. From 1847 through 1857, Coffin continued to assist hundreds of runaway slaves by lodging <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Ohio home. When slavery was abolished after the American Civil War, Coffin traveled around the Midwest and overseas to France and Great Britain, where he was instrumental in forming aid societies that provided food, clothing, funds, and education to former slaves. Coffin retired from public life in the 1870s and wrote an autobiography, Reminiscences of Levi Coffin, published in 1876, a year before his death.|$|E
5|$|Born in Philadelphia to {{a family}} active in Whig {{politics}}, Randall shifted to the Democratic Party after the Whigs' demise. His rise in politics began in the 1850s with election to the Philadelphia Common Council {{and then to the}} Pennsylvania State Senate. Randall served in a Union cavalry unit in the American Civil War before winning a seat in the federal House of Representatives in 1862. He was reelected every two years thereafter until his death. The representative of an industrial region, Randall became known as a staunch defender of protective tariffs designed to assist domestic producers of manufactured goods. While often siding with Republicans on tariff issues, he differed with <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> resistance to Reconstruction and the growth of federal power.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{began his}} {{four years as}} a state senator as a {{political}} unknown; he ended them {{as one of the}} most popular figures in the Ohio Republican Party. He always appeared calm and displayed humility, characteristics that endeared him to fellow Republicans even as he passed <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> political rise. Legislative leaders consulted him on difficult problems. It was usual at that time for state senators in Ohio to serve only one term, but Harding gained renomination in 1901. After the assassination of McKinley in September (he was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt), much of the appetite for politics was temporarily lost in Ohio. In November, Harding won a second term, more than doubling his margin of victory to 3,563 votes.|$|E

5|$|Historian Matti Moosa {{considered}} Marrash to be {{the first}} truly cosmopolitan Arab intellectual and writer of modern times. Marrash adhered to the principles of the French Revolution and defended <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own works, implicitly criticizing Ottoman rule in Western Asia and North Africa. He was also influential in introducing French romanticism in the Arab world, especially through his use of poetic prose and prose poetry, of which his writings were the first examples in modern Arabic literature, according to Salma Khadra Jayyusi and Shmuel Moreh. His modes of thinking and feeling, and ways of expressing them, have had a lasting influence on contemporary Arab thought and on the Mahjari poets.|$|E

Although he hates tournaments, K' uses the King of Fighters tournaments to find NESTS members and defeat <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> search, he meets allies who have the same goal and joins forces with them.

5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing {{that members of}} the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw {{it as a way to}} demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E

5|$|Schindler's List is a 1993 American epic {{historical}} period drama film {{directed and}} co-produced by Steven Spielberg and scripted by Steven Zaillian.

The film relates a period in the life of Oskar Schindler, an ethnic German businessman, during which he saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees from the Holocaust by employing <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> factories during World War II. It stars Liam Neeson as Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as SS officer Amon Göth, and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern.|$|E

5|$|Solti took up {{the musical}} {{directorship}} of Covent Garden in August 1961. The press gave him a cautious welcome, but there was some concern that under him {{there might be a}} drift away from the company's original policy of opera in English. Solti, however, was an advocate of opera in the vernacular, and he promoted the development of British and Commonwealth singers in the company, frequently casting <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> recordings and important productions in preference to overseas artists. He demonstrated his belief in vernacular opera with a triple bill in English of L'heure espagnole, Erwartung and Gianni Schicchi. As the decade went on, however, more and more productions had to be sung in the original language to accommodate international stars.|$|E
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} indeed {{the golden age of}} the chair, {{especially}} in France and England (including Colonial America), between which there was considerable give and take of ideas. Even Diderot could not refrain from writing of <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Encyclopédie. The typical Louis Seize chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such gay tapestry woven with Boucher or Watteau-like scenes, is a very gracious object, in which the period reached its high-water mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes, comfortable enough no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration. English Empire chairs were often heavier and more sombre than those of French design.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese were {{intrigued}} with European technology, but so were visiting Europeans of Chinese technology. In 1584, Abraham Ortelius (1527–1598) featured in his atlas Theatrum Orbis Terrarum the peculiar Chinese innovation of mounting masts and sails onto carriages, just like Chinese ships. Gonzales de Mendoza also mentioned this {{a year later}} – noting even the designs of them on Chinese silken robes – while Gerardus Mercator (1512–94) featured <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> atlas, John Milton (1608–74) {{in one of his}} famous poems, and Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest (1739–801) in the writings of his travel diary in China.|$|E
