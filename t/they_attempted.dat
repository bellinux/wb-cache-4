Janus and Epimetheus have orbits {{with only a few}} kilometers difference in semi-major axis, close enough that they would collide if <b>they</b> <b>attempted</b> to pass each other. Instead of colliding, however, their gravitational interaction causes them to swap orbits every four years.|$|E

40|$|The Holy Grail in the {{phenomenology}} {{of religion}} (and, {{to a lesser}} extent, the sociology of religion) is a definition of religion that actually works, but, so far, this {{seems to have been}} elusive. Classical definitions of religion—substantive (e. g. Tylor) and functionalist (e. g. Durkheim) —fail, in part because <b>they</b> <b>attempt</b> to be in three places at once, as it were: <b>they</b> <b>attempt</b> to distinguish religion from non-religion; <b>they</b> <b>attempt</b> to capture what religions have in common; and <b>they</b> <b>attempt</b> to grasp the 'heart', or 'core', of religion. Consequently, family resemblance definitions of religion replace certainty and precision for its own sake with a more pragmatic and heuristic approach, embracing doubt and putting forward definitions that give us a better understanding (Verstehen) of religion. In this paper, I summarise some 'new' definitions of religion that take this approach, before proposing and defending another one, defining religion as non-propositional and 'apophatic', thus accepting that doubt is central to religion itself, {{as well as to the}} analysis of religion...|$|R

5|$|During this period, Royal Arsenal {{started to}} win local trophies, winning both the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity Cup in 1889–90 and the London Senior Cup in 1890–91; they also entered the FA Cup {{for the first}} time in 1889–90. However, the gulf between Arsenal and the {{professional}} sides from the North soon became apparent, and Arsenal faced the threat of their amateur players being lured away by the money professional sides could offer; after Derby County had played Arsenal in an FA Cup tie in 1891, <b>they</b> <b>attempted</b> to sign two of Arsenal's amateur players on professional contracts.|$|E

This ruling was so unpopular with the Relief Party that <b>they</b> <b>attempted</b> to remove him from office, but the 5935 vote fell just short of the needed two-thirds majority. Fayette County circuit court judge Francis P. Blair issued a similar ruling in the case of Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E
