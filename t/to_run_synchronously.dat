50|$|Synchronet was {{originally}} written by Rob Swindell (a.k.a.

The bulk of the programming for the first version of Synchronet was done during a two-month period in 1991 when Swindell was house-ridden while he recovered from surgery. The software was named for its ability <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>synchronously</b> on a network.|$|E
50|$|Johnson {{desired to}} {{make a couple of}} clocks with {{sufficiently}} uniform pendulums that they would beat synchronously, however he could not accomplish this. He presented this problem to science professors at the University of Michigan. They pointed out to Johnson that it was impossible. The subject of astronomy came up in their talks and the part the stars play in the determining of correct time.The professors loaned books on mathematics and astronomy to Johnson. He mastered algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and basic astronomy. In 1887 he met a Professor Harrington of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The professor taught him that no two clocks could be made <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>synchronously</b> independent on their own to where they ran at exactly the same time on the same beat and swing of the pendulums. He explained {{that the only way to}} arrive at the correct time was to use fixed stars. The stars could be seen by the use of a transit telescope. In 1889 Johnson bought one so he could observe stars in getting accurate readings for time measurements. He was able to receive assistance in his more complicated mathematical calculations from a Professor Hussey of Stanford University.|$|E
50|$|Example: A Core 2 Duo E6600 {{processor}} {{is listed}} as 2.4 GHz with a 1066 MHz FSB. The FSB {{is known to be}} quad-pumped, so its clock frequency is 1066/4 = 266 MHz. Therefore, the CPU multiplier is 2400/266, or 9×. The DDR2 RAM that it is compatible with is known to be double-pumped and to have an Input/Output Bus twice that of the true FSB frequency (effectively transferring data 4 times a clock cycle), so <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the system <b>synchronously</b> (see Front side bus) the type of RAM that is appropriate is quadruple 266 MHz, or DDR2-1066 (PC2-8400 or PC2-8500, depending on the manufacturer's labeling.).|$|R

40|$|Testbeds are {{indispensable}} for debugging and evaluating wireless embedded systems. While existing testbeds provide ample opportunities for realistic, large-scale experiments, they {{are limited in}} their ability to closely observe and control the distributed operation of resource-constrained nodes— access to the nodes is restricted to the serial port. This paper presents FlockLab, a testbed that overcomes this limita-tion by allowing multiple services <b>to</b> <b>run</b> simultaneously and <b>synchronously</b> against all nodes under test in addition to the traditional serial port service: tracing of GPIO pins to record logical events occurring on a node, actuation of GPIO pins to trigger actions on a node, and high-resolution power profiling. FlockLab’s accurate timing information in the low microsecond range enables logical events to be correlated with power samples, thus providing a previously unattained level of visibility into the distributed behavior of wireless embedded systems. In this paper, we describe FlockLab’s design, benchmark its performance, and demonstrate its ca-pabilities through several real-world test cases...|$|R

40|$|The {{first phase}} of the ISAC II project {{consists}} of the acceleration of radioactive ions by 20 superconducting DTL's with a total effective voltage of ~ 20 MV. Each of these cavities will be powered at a frequency of 106. 08 MHz to a maximum field gradient of 6 MV/m. With unloaded cavity Q's of ~ 109, the RF control system for these superconducting cavities is based on a self-excited feedback loop. The self-excited frequency is stabilized by an internal analogue Phase-Locked Loop.

The MAGIC experiment makes use of a dedicated data quality check software, running {{at the end of}} each observation night.

Data quality check plots are produced daily and are accessible through a MAGIC internal web page to provide useful information about the telescopes and to pinpoint a possible failure or degradation of the performance. Each morning, a dedicated analyzer checks the automatically produced daily check report and alerts the experts in case of any major anomaly that could affect the data quality. In addition, for each data run a hardware data quality bit is generated, indicating the hardware status of the entire system as well as a weather quality bit. The data quality check software is being updated whenever a crucial hardware change has been introduced...|$|R

40|$|We {{show how}} the {{synchronous}} programming language Esterel can be extended by a new statement to implement mutual exclusive code sections.

Additionally, we show that the translation fits well into different verification approaches. 1 Introduction Synchronous languages like Esterel [1, 3] allow to describe multithreaded systems where the threads run in a synchronous manner. The synchronization of threads is for free since it is achieved directly by the semantics of the language: Most of the statements of synchronous languages do not consume time. Instead, consumption of time must be explicitely enforced by special statements, as e. g. the pause statement of Esterel. As it is only possible to consume a multiple of a logical unit of time, all threads of a system <b>run</b> <b>synchronously</b> <b>to</b> each other 1.

40|$|Sorting {{is one of}} a set of {{fundamental}} problems in computer science. In this paper we present the first wait-free algorithm for sorting an input array of size N using P N processors to achieve optimal running time. Known sorting algorithms, when made wait-free through previously established transformation techniques have complexity O(log 3 N). The randomized algorithm we present here, when run in the CRCW PRAM model executes in optimal O(log N) time when P = N and O(N log N=P) otherwise. The wait-free property guarantees that the sort will complete despite any delays or failures incurred by the processors. This is a very desirable property from an operating systems point of view, since it allows oblivious thread scheduling as well as thread creation and deletion, without fear of losing the algorithm's correctness. We further present a variant of the algorithm which is shown to suffer no more than O(p P) contention when <b>run</b> <b>synchronously.</b> 1 Introduction Sorting is a basic alg [...] ...|$|R
