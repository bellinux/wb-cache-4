40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 42 - 63) Cancer is {{a devastating}} disease. The {{realities of the}} illness and its treatment, however, are {{only a part of}} the cancer patient???s life. Cancer causes a whirlpool of emotional and social problems in the lives of both patients and <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Cancer patients and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> need to manage their emotional reactions to this life-threatening disease, get through treatment, and redefine their life priorities. They may be challenged to adjust to new family roles, and reestablish their social support systems. Such problems cannot be resolved with a simple prescription. In addition to medical support, cancer patients and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> need psychosocial support. 	This project features a workbook designed for mental health professionals who will be, or are interested in, working with cancer patients and <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> This project contains a literature review of previous studies and research regarding psychosocial support for cancer patients and <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Such studies indicate that although concepts of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) are more socially accepted, and thus, more psychosocial support for caner patients and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> is available, there still are many cancer patients and families who struggle with difficult cancer-related problems, and feel isolated and hopeless. 	The purpose of this workbook is to help mental health professionals support cancer patients and <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> This workbook includes, therefore, useful information about cancer, psycho-oncology, psychosocial needs of cancer patients and <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> and psychotherapeutic interventions to meet such needs. The workbook also contains information about hospice care, palliative care, and loss and grief...|$|R
