40|$|Using data {{drawn from}} the U. S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we explore the {{relationship}} between the donating behaviour of parents and that of their children aged less than 18. Furthermore, we exploit information relating to whether or not parents encourage their children <b>to</b> donate <b>to</b> <b>charity</b> in order <b>to</b> unveil information related to the intergenerational transmission of philanthropic behaviour. Our findings suggest that whether a child donates <b>to</b> <b>charity</b> is influenced by positive effects from whether the parent donates <b>to</b> <b>charity</b> as well as from whether the parent talks to their child about donating <b>to</b> <b>charity.</b> In addition, whether the parent donates <b>to</b> <b>charity</b> has an indirect influence via its positive effect on the probability that the parent talks to the child about donating <b>to</b> <b>charity.</b> Further, we find that the influence of whether the parent donates <b>to</b> <b>charity</b> on the probability that the child donates <b>to</b> <b>charity</b> is particularly heightened in terms of both magnitude and statistical significance in the context of parental donations to religious causes...|$|R
40|$|Why people donate <b>to</b> <b>charity</b> or {{how people}} may be persuaded <b>to</b> donate <b>to</b> <b>charity</b> is a widely studied topic. What happens after people donated <b>to</b> <b>charity,</b> however, is largely understudied. On the one hand, {{people may be}} {{motivated}} to behave morally in subsequent decisions because of consistency concerns. On the other hand, people may feel licensed to behave less morally in subsequent decisions. In a quasi-experimental field study, we show that donating <b>to</b> <b>charity</b> may have a dark side to it, as it negatively affects subsequent, seemingly unrelated moral behavior. Specifically, our study shows the licensing effect in a real-world setting, as we find that people who donated <b>to</b> <b>charity</b> subsequently show lower intentions to be environmentally friendly...|$|R

50|$|The Indiana University Center on Philanthropy has {{reported}} that approximately 65% of household earning $100,000 or less donate <b>to</b> <b>charity,</b> and nearly every household exceeding that amount donated <b>to</b> <b>charity.</b> More particularly, according to studies by the Chronicle of Philanthropy, the rich (those making over $100,000 a year) give a smaller share, averaging 4.2%, <b>to</b> <b>charity</b> than those poorer (between $50,000 - $75,000 a year), who give an average of 7.6%.|$|R

5|$|Since it {{was first}} held in 1971, the Roskilde Festival, a rock music festival, has been held {{annually}} on the fairgrounds {{south of the city}} centre.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model where people {{differ in their}} altruistic {{preferences}} and can serve the public interest in two ways: by making donations <b>to</b> <b>charity</b> and by taking a public service job and exerting effort on the job. Our theory predicts {{that people who are}} more altruistic are more likely to take a public service job and, for a given job, make higher donations <b>to</b> <b>charity.</b> Comparing equally altruistic workers, those with a regular job make higher donations <b>to</b> <b>charity</b> than those with a public service job by a simple substitution argument. We subsequently test these predictions using the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, which contains data on self-reported altruism, sector of employment, and donations <b>to</b> <b>charity</b> for more than 7, 500 workers. We find support for most of our predictions...|$|R

5|$|Across the German Empire nagelfiguren, war {{memorials}} {{made from}} iron nails embedded in wood, became popular, particularly in Austria. These took various forms, including knights, shields, eagles and crosses, {{as well as}} submarines. This practice had medieval origins, and the memorials were reinforced by the promotion of burgfrieden during the war, a medieval pact in which disparate German communities would put aside their differences during a conflict. In some cases, relatives of the deceased were encouraged to hammer memorial nails in {{as part of the}} ceremonies, while children might be encouraged to read out poems in a medieval style. At some nagelfiguren a charge was made for each nail used, with the revenues donated <b>to</b> <b>charities</b> supporting soldiers, orphans and others affected by the conflict.|$|E

5|$|Harry asked printer James E.

After taking Virginia home to Bowring Park in the evening, Harry would often return to the office and work throughout the night, pausing only to go to the Pier Head to buy a cup of tea and a hot pie at four in the morning. Virginia's parents helped the paper during this time, as they paid for classified ads, and arranged for Harry and his future wife's first photographs together.|$|E
5|$|Winners of the Branch Rickey Award have {{undertaken}} different causes. Many winners, including Todd Stottlemyre, Jamie Moyer, John Smoltz, Torii Hunter, Vernon Wells, and Shane Victorino, worked {{with children in}} need.

Other winners devoted their work to aiding individuals who had a specific illness, such as Curt Schilling, who raised money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Trevor Hoffman, who lost a kidney as an infant and devoted himself to working with individuals with nephropathy. Also, some winners devoted themselves to work with major disasters and tragedies.
