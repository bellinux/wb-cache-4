5|$|As the {{persecution}} worsened, thousands of Quakers left North Carolina for the Old Northwest, where slavery was prohibited and land was less expensive. (A large Quaker community {{that had already}} settled in what became Ohio and Indiana had been influential in securing a territorial ban on slavery.) In 1822 Coffin accompanied Benjamin White <b>to</b> <b>Indiana</b> and stayed in Indiana with the Whites for about a year. On his return to North Carolina, Coffin brought back reports of Indiana and its prosperity. Convinced that Quakers and slaveholders could not co exist, Coffin decided to move <b>to</b> <b>Indiana.</b>|$|E

5|$|Born in North Carolina, Coffin {{was exposed}} to and {{developed}} an opposition to slavery as a child. He followed his family and immigrated <b>to</b> <b>Indiana</b> in 1826, following the slaveholders' persecution of Quakers. In Indiana he became a local business leader, merchant, and farmer. Coffin's accumulated wealth from his business interests allowed {{him to become a}} major investor in the Richmond, Indiana, branch of the Second State Bank of Indiana, where he served as director in the 1830s. Coffin's financial position and standing in the community also provided the mead to supply food, clothing, and transportation for the Underground Railroad operations in the region.|$|E
5|$|Burnside {{was born}} in Liberty, Indiana and was the fourth of nine {{children}} of Edghill and Pamela (or Pamilia) Brown Burnside, a family of Scottish origin. His great-great-grandfather Robert Burnside (1725–1775) {{was born in}} Scotland and settled in the Province of South Carolina. His father {{was a native of}} South Carolina; he was a slave owner who freed his slaves when he relocated <b>to</b> <b>Indiana.</b> Ambrose attended Liberty Seminary as a young boy, but his education was interrupted when his mother died in 1841; he was apprenticed to a local tailor, eventually becoming a partner in the business.|$|E
5|$|Coffin {{continued}} to farm after moving <b>to</b> <b>Indiana</b> {{and within a}} year of his arrival he opened the first dry-goods store in Newport. In later years Coffin credited the success of his business, which he expanded in the 1830s, with providing him the ability to become heavily involved in the costly enterprise of the Underground Railroad, a costly and risky enterprise that provided a network of stopover sites for fugitive slaves as they traveled north into Canada.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{constant}} {{attention to the}} business, the poor supply and insufficient supply of free-labor products proved to be insurmountable, {{making it impossible for}} Coffin to find a replacement to run the company so that he could return <b>to</b> <b>Indiana.</b> The company remained in business primarily through the financial support of wealthy benefactors. Coffin sold the business in 1857, after deciding {{it would be impossible to}} maintain a profitable business.|$|E

5|$|Harding's Socialist {{opponent}} in the 1920 election, Eugene Debs, was serving a ten-year sentence in the Atlanta Penitentiary for speaking against the war.

There was opposition from veterans, including the American Legion, and also from Florence Harding. The president did not feel he could release Debs until the war was officially over, but once the peace treaties were signed commuted Debs' sentence on December 23, 1921. At Harding's request, Debs visited the president at the White House before going home <b>to</b> <b>Indiana.</b>|$|E

Lilly {{grew up in a}} Methodist household, and his family was prohibitionist and anti-slavery; their beliefs served as part of their motivation for moving <b>to</b> <b>Indiana.</b> Lilly and his family were members of the Democratic Party during his early life, but they became Republicans during the years leading up to the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, a {{few months}} after the start of the American Civil War, Lilly enlisted in the Union Army. He joined the 21st Indiana Infantry Regiment and mustered into service on July 24.
