Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to blow up the lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E
5|$|When Allen {{and his men}} landed above St. John and scouted the situation, {{they learned}} that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching. Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which {{significantly}} outnumbered his tired company, Allen withdrew {{to the other side}} of the river, where the men collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through the night. They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river. The Boys, in a panic, piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver. When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, some of the men were greatly disappointed that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> show for the effort and risks they took. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point proved to be crucial in the Revolutionary War because it secured protection from the British to the North and provided vital cannon for the colonial army; some even speculate that if the attempts to capture the two forts had been unsuccessful, the colonists might not have won the war.|$|E

25|$|The best-known mole {{is named}} after the city of Puebla, mole poblano. The origin of this sauce is disputed {{and there are two}} {{versions}} of the legend that are most often cited. The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had just found out that the archbishop was going to visit them and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to mix together many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types of chili peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. They let the sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the turkey meat. Fortunately, the archbishop was very pleased with the meal and the nuns were able to save face.|$|E

500|$|As {{members of}} the Round Table moved into ventures outside New York City, inevitably the group drifted apart. By the early 1930s the Vicious Circle was broken. Edna Ferber said she {{realized}} it when {{she arrived at the}} Rose Room for lunch one day in 1932 and found the group's table occupied by a family from Kansas. Frank Case was asked what happened to the group. He shrugged and replied, [...] "What became of the reservoir at Fifth Avenue and Forty-Second Street? These things do not last forever." [...] Some {{members of the}} group remained friends after its dissolution. Parker and Benchley in particular remained close up until his death in 1945, although her political leanings did strain their relationship. Others, as the group itself would come to understand when it gathered following Woollcott's death in 1943, simply realized that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> say to one another.|$|E
500|$|The {{premise of}} Community {{was based on}} Harmon's real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his {{relationship}} with his then-girlfriend, he once enrolled in Glendale Community College, north of Los Angeles, where they would take Spanish together. Harmon got involved in a study group and – somewhat against his own instincts – became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. [...] "...I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them," [...] he explained, [...] "even though <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with the film industry and I had nothing to gain from them and nothing to offer them." [...] With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself. He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realised the value of connecting with other people.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the joke}} {{originally}} stemmed from Evel Knievel and not Kanye West, Parker and Stone said they realized West {{would probably be}} extremely humorless about the joke and not understand it, so they decided the episode should revolve mostly around him. After {{coming up with the}} idea, Parker and Stone waited a long time before they finally wrote the script because, Stone said, [...] "It just seemed too dumb. Are we really going to do a whole episode about this?" [...] Stone said the jokes about Carlos Mencia were [...] "just a complete afterthought" [...] that came about during the writing process. During one scene in [...] "Fishsticks", Cartman steals credit from Jimmy for a joke he did not write. This was inspired by people Parker and Stone have worked with in the television business who were present for discussions the duo had, then later claimed credit for the idea even though <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with it. Stone said, [...] "They truly believe they did it. That's the really sinister part. It's not where they're trying to steal part of the glory. ...

500|$|The coins {{were sold}} {{to the public for}} $1 each through the Fifth National Bank and other outlets. Bulk sales were made to certain groups. The coins did not sell as well as expected, and 55,000 were returned, after which they were placed in circulation. [...] Relatively few are known in worn condition, causing author and coin dealer Q. David Bowers to {{conclude}} the public picked them out of pocket change. Money from the Huguenot-Walloon half dollar was used towards a celebration in New York in May 1924, during which the National Huguenot Memorial Church on Staten Island was dedicated. There was some debate in the pages of The Numismatist, the ANA's journal, both as to whether William and Coligny should have appeared on the coin since <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with the voyage, and whether the Churches of Christ should be allowed to sponsor a coin in view of the First Amendment's prohibition of an establishment of religion. There was controversy in the press, which criticized the inclusion of William and Coligny as irrelevant to the commemoration and as religious propaganda. This in 1925 made politically infeasible the attempts of Minnesota Representative Ole Juulson Kvale, a Lutheran pastor, to obtain a coin for the Norse-American Centennial; he instead settled for a congressionally authorized medal.|$|E
500|$|From {{these early}} meetings, {{according}} to biographer Mark Nicholls, John exhibited [...] "little sign of doubt or scruple thereafter". [...] He remained {{close to the}} heart of the conspiracy, moving his family to Lapworth in Warwickshire, and stabling horses there. By March 1605 Christopher had joined the conspiracy as well, but in October that year, as the plan was nearing its culmination, its existence was revealed to the authorities by an anonymous letter delivered to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, warning him to stay away from Parliament. [...] Uncertain of its meaning Monteagle delivered the letter to the English Secretary of State, Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. [...] Monteagle's servant was closely related to Christopher's wife, Margaret, and thus the plotters soon became aware of its existence. Catesby, by then at White Webbs near Enfield Chase with the Wright brothers, decided that the letter did not constitute a sufficiently serious threat to the scheme, and he decided to forge ahead. On 4 November Percy visited his patron, Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, to see if he could discern what rumours surrounded the letter. [...] He returned to London and assured John, Thomas Wintour and Robert Keyes that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> be concerned about. [...] That same evening John probably set off for the Midlands with Catesby and his servant Thomas Bates, while the others moved into their positions, ready for the planned explosion the following day. At about midnight the authorities made a search of the House of Lords, and in the chamber's undercroft they discovered and arrested Fawkes, who was guarding the gunpowder the conspirators had placed there.|$|E

500|$|The {{letter was}} shown to the King on Friday 1 November {{following}} his arrival back in London. Upon reading it, James immediately seized upon the word [...] "blow" [...] and felt that it hinted at [...] "some strategem of fire and powder", perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence the one that killed his father, Lord Darnley, at Kirk o' Field in 1567. [...] Keen not to seem too intriguing, and wanting to allow the King to take the credit for unveiling the conspiracy, Salisbury feigned ignorance. [...] The following day members of the Privy Council visited the King at the Palace of Whitehall and informed him that, {{based on the information}} that Salisbury had given them a week earlier, on Monday the Lord Chamberlain Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk would undertake a search of the Houses of Parliament, [...] "both above and below". [...] On Sunday 3November Percy, Catesby and Wintour had a final meeting, where Percy told his colleagues that they should [...] "abide the uttermost triall", and reminded them of their ship waiting at anchor on the Thames. [...] By 4November Digby was ensconced with a [...] "hunting party" [...] at Dunchurch, ready to abduct Princess Elizabeth. [...] The same day, Percy visited the Earl of Northumberland—who was uninvolved in the conspiracy—to see if he could discern what rumours surrounded the letter to Monteagle. [...] Percy returned to London and assured Wintour, John Wright, and Robert Keyes that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> be concerned about, and returned to his lodgings on Gray's Inn Road. [...] That same evening Catesby, likely accompanied by John Wright and Bates, set off for the Midlands. [...] Fawkes visited Keyes, and was given a pocket watch left by Percy, to time the fuse, and an hour later Rookwood received several engraved swords from a local cutler.|$|E
500|$|The {{question}} {{of the status of}} Antioch and the adjacent Cilician cities troubled the Empire for many years afterwards. Although the Treaty of Devol never came into effect, it provided the legal basis for Byzantine negotiations with the crusaders for the next thirty years, and for imperial claims to Antioch during the reigns of John II and Manuel I. Therefore, John II attempted to impose his authority, traveling to Antioch himself in 1137 with his army and besieging the city. The citizens of Antioch tried to negotiate, but John demanded the unconditional surrender of the city. After asking the permission of the King of Jerusalem, Fulk, which he received, Raymond, the Prince of Antioch, agreed to surrender the city to John. The agreement, by which Raymond swore homage to John, was explicitly based on the Treaty of Devol, but went beyond it: Raymond, who was recognized as an imperial vassal for Antioch, promised the Emperor free entry to Antioch, and undertook to hand over the city in return for investiture with Aleppo, Shaizar, Homs and Hama as soon as these were conquered from the [...] Muslims. Then, Raymond would rule the new conquests and Antioch would revert to direct imperial rule. The campaign finally failed, however, partly because Raymond and Joscelin II, Count of Edessa, who had been obliged to join John as his vassals, did not pull their weight. When, on their return to Antioch, John insisted on taking possession of the city, the two princes organized a riot. John found himself besieged in the city, and was forced to leave in 1138, recalled to Constantinople. He diplomatically accepted Raymond's and Joscelin's insistence that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with the rebellion. John repeated his operation in 1142, but he unexpectedly died, and the Byzantine army retired.|$|E

The end result was that a group of loathsome people who spend every second of their lives trying to attract free publicity for themselves got a whole hour of it courtesy of the BBC. Ah, the joys of public service television." [...] Writing for The Observer, Kathryn Flett was critical of the choice of title for the documentary, commenting, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America? Says who? Louis Theroux? BBC2? Ooh, I don't like a sweeping statement of a documentary title. Not that the family who comprise the majority of the 71 congregants of the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, aren't appalling, but the title definitely infers that they are the family most hated by most Americans, when I doubt most Americans have the faintest idea who they are."
