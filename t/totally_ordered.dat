40|$|This work {{provides}} an efficient paradigm for object replication using the State Machine approach, overcoming network partitions and reconnects. The Consistent Object Replication Layer (COReL) supplies the application builder with long-term {{services such as}} reconciliation of states among recovered and reconnected processors and global message ordering. COReL is a high-level communication service layer, designed in the Transis environment. It supplies the services defined for the Replication Service layer in HORUS and Transis. We present an algorithm for <b>totally</b> <b>ordering</b> messages {{in the face of}} network partitions and site failures. The novelty of this algorithm is that it always allows a majority (or quorum) of connected processors in the network to make progress (i. e. <b>totally</b> <b>order</b> messages), if they remain connected for sufficiently long, regardless of past failures. Furthermore, our algorithm always allows processors to initiate messages, even when they are not members of a connected [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} one event {{happening}} before {{another in a}} distributed system is examined, and is shown to define a partial ordering of the events. A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks {{which can be used}} to <b>totally</b> <b>order</b> the events. The use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems. The algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become.

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes Clock-RSM, a {{new state}} machine {{replication}} protocol that uses loosely synchronized physical clocks to <b>totally</b> <b>order</b> commands for geo-replicated services. Clock-RSM assumes realistic non-uniform latencies among replicas located at different data centers. It provides low-latency linearizable replication by overlapping 1) logging a command at a majority of replicas, 2) determining the stable order of the command from the farthest replica, and 3) notifying the commit of the command to all replicas. We evaluate Clock-RSM analytically and derive the expected command replication latency. We also evaluate the protocol experimentally using a geo-replicated key-value store deployed across multiple Amazon EC 2 data centers. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—State-machine {{replication}} is {{a well-established}} ap-proach to fault tolerance. The {{idea is to}} replicate a service on multiple servers so that it remains available despite the failure {{of one or more}} servers. From a performance perspective, state-machine replication has two limitations. First, it introduces some overhead in service response time, due to the requirement to <b>totally</b> <b>order</b> commands. Second, service throughput cannot be augmented by adding replicas to the system. We address the two issues in this paper. We use speculative execution to reduce the response time and state partitioning to increase the throughput of state-machine replication. We illustrate these techniques with a highly available parallel B-tree service. I...|$|R

We explain here the steps required {{to go from}} the original algorithm to a working infrastructure capable of monitoring an existing distributed application producing millions of log entries per day. The main challenge is to correctly and efficiently monitor the trace interleavings obtained by <b>totally</b> <b>ordering</b> actions that happen at the same time. We provide solutions based on formula transformations and monitoring representative traces. We also report, for the first time, on statistics {{on the performance of}} our monitor on real-world data, providing evidence of its suitability for nontrivial applications. I...|$|R

Based on the votes, the log service outputs the transaction’s outcome. The service also <b>totally</b> <b>orders</b> non-concurrent transactions and makes the sequence of updates performed by each resource man-ager available as a means to consistently recover resource managers without relying on their local state. Besides the specification, we overview two highly available implemen-tations of this service and present an experimental perfor-mance evaluation. 1...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{logic of}} {{conditional}} preferences is defined, with {{a language that}} allows the compact representation of certain kinds of conditional preference statements, a semantics and a proof theory.

The paper derives various sufficient conditions {{for a set of}} conditional preferences to be consistent, along with algorithmic techniques for checking such conditions and hence confirming consistency. These techniques can also be used for <b>totally</b> <b>ordering</b> outcomes {{in a way that is}} consistent with the set of preferences, and they are further developed to give an approach to the problem of constrained optimisation for conditional preferences...|$|R

40|$|Introduction In [5], a {{representation}} of bounded lattices within so-called standard topological contexts has been developed. Based on the theory of formal concept analysis [14] it includes Stone's representation of Boolean algebras by totally disconnected compact spaces [10], Priestley's representation of bounded distributive lattices by <b>totally</b> <b>order</b> disconnected compact spaces [7] as well as Urquhardt's representation of bounded lattices by so-called L-spaces [11]. In the present paper we characterize the 0 - 1 -sublattices of an arbitrary bounded lattice within its standard topological context. To do so, {{the concept of a}} closed relation of a formal context [16] is generalized to the concept of a topological relation of a topological context. This is then used to describe finite subdirect products of bounded lattices. Finally, the idea of a subdirect product construc...|$|R
