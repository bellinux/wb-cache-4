5|$|The Bristol Area Resignalling Scheme in the 1970s saw <b>the</b> <b>Down</b> Relief line, {{the most}} {{southern}} {{of the four}} running lines, converted to a siding linking Malago Vale carriage sidings to the east with the West Depot carriage sidings to the west. At the same time, Parson Street Junction was reworked, requiring trains to first cross from <b>the</b> <b>Down</b> Main line to the Up Main line before {{they were able to}} access the Portishead Branch. <b>The</b> <b>Down</b> Relief line was removed altogether when West Depot closed sometime after the opening of a new depot at St Philips Marsh to service High Speed Trains.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, <b>the</b> <b>down</b> {{became the}} site of a major road protest against the {{completion}} of a section of the M3 motorway from London to the south coast of England. There had been plans since the 1970s to replace an earlier 1930s-built bypass of Winchester, which became regularly congested due to design features that had become out of date. This became problematic {{due to the lack of}} available land between Winchester College and St. Catherine's Hill. After several public inquiries, particularly with problems using the water meadows near the college, a route was chosen that took the motorway over <b>the</b> <b>down,</b> ultimately in a cutting. Although protesting against the M3 had been ongoing since the early 1970s, the protest-action on top of <b>the</b> <b>down,</b> described in 1994 as the most controversial British motorway project ever to start construction, attracted a wider group of classes of people than had previously been the case, and included physical violence from onsite security officers.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} 20th century dairy was a {{significant}} industry for Queensland. The 1930s saw the peaking of the dairy industry on <b>the</b> <b>Downs</b> with 6,500 farms and over 200,000 milking cows. <b>The</b> <b>Downs</b> Co-operative Dairy Association expanded, constructed or purchased at least 10 butter and cheese factories across <b>the</b> Darling <b>Downs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Downs</b> Co-operative Dairy Association Limited Factory in Toowoomba remain in operation today.|$|R

5|$|Another set of officials, {{the chain}} crew, are {{responsible}} for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people – {{two members of the}} chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold <b>the</b> <b>down</b> marker. <b>The</b> <b>down</b> marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.|$|E

Local folklore claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; the gutter in Holyrood Street, though, still flows into the River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within <b>the</b> <b>down</b> eventually drain into the Bristol Channel and the English Channel.|$|E

5|$|In 1675, John Ogilby {{noted that}} the main {{coaching}} route from London to Southampton ran {{over the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>down,</b> going directly from Alresford to Twyford, avoiding Winchester. This remained the main coaching route until about 1800, when an alternative route via Winchester (now mostly the A31 and former A33) was formed. During this time, and up to the 19th century, the area was sometimes known as Morestead Down after the nearby village of Morestead.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 2009 a $2.5billion deal {{to privatize}} the airport via a 99-year lease fell through when the {{consortium}} could not put together financing. The City {{is to keep}} $125million in <b>the</b> <b>down</b> payment. The consortium operating {{under the name of}} Midway Investment and Development Company LLC consisted of Vancouver Airport Services, Citi Infrastructure Investors, and Boston's John Hancock Life Insurance. It was awarded the contract in October 2008 by the City Council, which voted 49–0 to approve it. The consortium would have operated the airport and collected airport parking, concession, and passenger facility charges. However, Chicago would have continued to provide fire and police services. Chicago privatized the Chicago Skyway in 2007. In 2010 a new slogan emerged calling the airport The busiest square mile in the world.|$|E

Silver won <b>the</b> <b>Down</b> Beat critics' new star award for piano players in 1954, and {{appeared at the}} first Newport Jazz Festival, substituting for John Lewis in the Modern Jazz Quartet. Silver's early 1950s recordings demonstrate that Powell was a major pianistic influence, but this had waned {{by the middle of}} the decade.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Down</b> Relief {{line between}} Bristol Temple Meads and Parson Street {{is to be}} {{partially}} reinstated {{as part of the}} MetroWest scheme in order to ease congestion. According to the Great Western Route Utilisation Strategy, in the December 2007 timetable period, the line through Parson Street was running at over 75% capacity in the morning peak between 8 and 9am. It was predicted that by 2019, trains working the line would be completely full during peak hours. While the three tracks could cope with traffic generated by the reopening of the Portishead Line, campaigners note it would leave little room for growth. Parson Street Junction will also be upgraded during the works.|$|E

5|$|The arcade {{release of}} Cross Generation of Heroes has a control scheme {{consisting}} of a joystick and four buttons. Wii versions of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have five control options: the Classic Controller, Nintendo GameCube controller, third-party arcade sticks, and two simplified control schemes—intended for inexperienced players—for the Wii Remote. Players use controller inputs to perform attacks; the most basic attacks are executed by pressing one of three attack buttons: light, medium, or strong. Players may augment basic attacks with joystick or control pad directional inputs; for example, a standard strong attack can become a sweep when <b>the</b> <b>down</b> input is added. Basic attacks can be strung together to perform combos.|$|E

5|$|The final {{gradient}} from Camden Town to Euston {{involved a}} crossing over the Regent's Canal {{that required a}} gradient of over 1 in 68.
