5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Claimant</b> was now bankrupt. In 1870 his {{new legal}} {{advisers}} launched a novel fundraising scheme: Tichborne Bonds, {{an issue of}} 1,000 debentures of £100 face value, the holders {{of which would be}} repaid with interest when <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> obtained his inheritance. About £40,000 was raised, though the bonds quickly traded at a considerable discount and were soon being exchanged for derisory sums. The scheme allowed <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> to continue to meet his living and legal expenses for a while. After a delay while the Franco-Prussian War and its aftermath prevented key witnesses from leaving Paris, the civil case that <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> hoped would confirm his identity finally came to court in May 1871.|$|E
5|$|The first {{witnesses}} for <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> included former {{officers and}} men from Roger Tichborne's regiment, {{all of whom}} declared their belief that he was genuine. Among servants and former servants of the Tichborne family called by Ballantine was John Moore, Roger's valet in South America. He testified that <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> had remembered many small details of their months together, including clothing worn {{and the name of}} a pet dog the pair had adopted. Roger's cousin Anthony Biddulph explained that he had accepted <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> only after spending much time in his company.|$|E
5|$|After {{depositing}} {{his family}} in a London hotel, <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> called at Lady Tichborne's address and was told she was in Paris. He then went to Wapping in East London, where he enquired after a local family named Orton. Finding that they had left the area, he identified himself to a neighbour {{as a friend of}} Arthur Orton, who, he said, was now one of the wealthiest men in Australia. The significance of the Wapping visit would become apparent only later. On 29 December <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> visited Alresford and stayed at the Swan Hotel, where the landlord detected a resemblance to the Tichbornes. <b>The</b> <b>Claimant</b> confided that he was the missing Sir Roger but asked that this be kept secret. He also sought information concerning the Tichborne family.|$|E

50|$|It {{was wrong}} to deny <b>the</b> <b>claimants</b> any remedy at all. Therefore, the {{appropriate}} test of causation is whether the employers had materially increased the risk of harm to <b>the</b> <b>claimants.</b>|$|R
5|$|Back in London, <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> {{employed}} a solicitor, John Holmes, {{who agreed to}} go with him to Paris to meet Lady Tichborne. This meeting took place on 11 January at the Hôtel de Lille. As soon as she saw his face, Lady Tichborne accepted him. At Holmes's behest she lodged with the British Embassy a signed declaration formally testifying that <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> was her son. She was unmoved when Father Châtillon, Roger's childhood tutor, declared <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> an impostor, and she allowed Holmes to inform The Times in London that she had recognised Roger. She settled an income of £1,000 a year on him, and accompanied him to England to declare her support before the more sceptical members of the Tichborne family.|$|E
5|$|Defences to tracing are possible, {{particularly}} if returning the property would harm an innocent defendant, where <b>the</b> <b>claimant</b> has made false {{representations that the}} defendant relied on to his detriment, or where the property has been transferred to an innocent third party without anything given to the defendant in return that <b>the</b> <b>claimant</b> could recover in lieu.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lady Tichborne's {{insistence that}} <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> was her son, {{the rest of}} the Tichbornes and their related {{families}} were almost unanimous in declaring him a fraud. They recognised Alfred Tichborne's infant son, Henry Alfred, as the 12th baronet. Lady Doughty, Sir Edward's widow, had initially accepted the evidence from Australia but changed her mind soon after the Claimant's arrival in England. Lady Tichborne's brother Henry Seymour denounced <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> as false when he found that the latter neither spoke nor understood French (Roger's first language as a child) and lacked any trace of a French accent. <b>The</b> <b>Claimant</b> was unable to identify several family members and complained about attempts to catch him out by presenting him with impostors. Vincent Gosford, a former Tichborne Park steward, was unimpressed by <b>the</b> <b>Claimant,</b> who, when asked to name the contents of a sealed package that Roger left with Gosford before his departure in 1853, said he could not remember. The family believed that <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> had acquired from Bogle and other sources information that enabled him to demonstrate some knowledge of the family's affairs, including, for example, the locations of certain pictures in Tichborne Park. Apart from Lady Tichborne, a distant cousin, Anthony John Wright Biddulph, was the only relation who accepted <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> as genuine; however, as long as Lady Tichborne was alive and maintaining her support, the Claimant's position remained strong.|$|E
50|$|A {{trade union}} {{official}} told an employer his members would not work alongside <b>the</b> <b>claimants.</b> <b>The</b> employer was pressured {{to get rid of}} <b>the</b> <b>claimants.</b> For <b>the</b> loss of work, <b>the</b> <b>claimants</b> sued <b>the</b> {{trade union official}}. An important fact is that all the workers in the case were only hired day by day. Therefore, the trade union official had never threatened a breach of contract because the contracts began afresh with a new day's work.|$|R

5000|$|The defendant, Dr Hughes, had {{granted a}} call option {{with respect to}} his {{property}} at 571 High Road, Wembley to <b>the</b> <b>claimants,</b> Holwell Securities Ltd, given <b>the</b> <b>claimants</b> <b>the</b> irrevocable right to purchase the property during the option period for the specified sum. It contained a clause stipulating {{that there must be}} notice (here, receipt of the offer) in writing within six months in order to exercise <b>the</b> option. <b>The</b> <b>claimants</b> sent a letter purporting to exercise the option. It was lost in the mail and was never received by the defendant. [...] The defendant then refused to complete upon the purchase and <b>the</b> <b>claimants</b> sought specific performance.|$|R

5|$|Arthur Orton, a butcher's son born on 20 March 1834 in Wapping, {{had gone}} to sea as a boy and had been in Chile in the early 1850s. Sometime in 1852 he arrived in Hobart, Tasmania, in the {{transport}} ship Middleton and later moved to mainland Australia. His employment by Foster at Gippsland terminated around 1857 with a dispute over wages. Thereafter he disappears; {{if he was not}} Castro, there is no further direct evidence of Orton's existence, although strenuous efforts were made to find him. <b>The</b> <b>Claimant</b> hinted that some of his activities with Orton were of a criminal nature and that to confound the authorities they had sometimes exchanged names. Most of Orton's family failed to recognise <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> as their long-lost kinsman, although it was later revealed that he had paid them money. However, a former sweetheart of Orton's, Mary Ann Loder, did identify <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> as Orton.|$|E
50|$|The Defendants did not {{promise to}} sell the stock {{to the highest bidder}} for cash. <b>The</b> <b>Claimants</b> sent a tender to the Defendants which, {{following}} the submission of all tenders, was the highest tender.

5000|$|CDE & FGH v Mirror Group Newspapers and LMN 2010 EWHC 3308 is an English privacy law case. The {{case was}} a misuse of private {{information}} claim in which two claimants sought an interim injunction preventing the two defendants from publishing private information about them. The case is unusual in that not only are <b>the</b> <b>claimants</b> granted anonymity but also defendants and non-parties. <b>The</b> first <b>claimant</b> [...] "CDE" [...] is described as someone who often appears on television. <b>The</b> second <b>claimant</b> [...] "FGH" [...] is the wife of <b>the</b> first <b>claimant.</b> <b>The</b> second defendant [...] "LMN" [...] {{is described as a}} single mother on disability benefits who wished to sell a story relating to <b>the</b> <b>claimants</b> to <b>The</b> Sunday Mirror newspaper.|$|R
5|$|The jury retired {{at noon on}} Saturday 28 February, and {{returned}} to the court within 30 minutes. Their verdict declared that <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> was not Roger Tichborne, that he had not seduced Katherine Doughty, and that he was indeed Arthur Orton. He was thus convicted of perjury. The jury added a condemnation of Kenealy's conduct during the trial. After the judges refused his request to address the court, <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> was sentenced to two consecutive terms of seven years' imprisonment. Kenealy's behaviour ended his legal career; he was expelled from the Oxford circuit mess and from Gray's Inn, so that he could no longer practise. On 2 December 1874 the Lord Chancellor revoked Kenealy's patent as a Queen's Counsel.|$|E
5|$|Tracing {{is divided}} into two forms, common law tracing and {{equitable}} tracing. Common law tracing relies on <b>the</b> <b>claimant</b> having legal ownership of the property, and will fail if the property has been mixed with other property, the legal title has been transferred to the defendant, or the legal title has been transferred by the defendant to any further recipient of the property. Equitable tracing, on the other hand, relies on <b>the</b> <b>claimant</b> having an equitable interest in the property, and can succeed where the property has been mixed with other property.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Kenealy instigated {{a popular}} radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy {{was elected to}} Parliament in 1875 as a radical {{independent}} but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> was released in 1884, {{and he had no}} dealings with it. In 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty {{for the rest of his}} life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's view that <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> was Orton, some analysts believe that an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.|$|E

5|$|Altogether, Hawkins called 215 witnesses, {{including}} {{numbers from}} France, Melipilla, Australia and Wapping, who testified either that <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> was not Roger Tichborne {{or that he}} was Arthur Orton. A handwriting expert swore that the Claimant's writing resembled Orton's but not Roger Tichborne's. The entire story of rescue by the Osprey was, Hawkins asserted, a fraud. A ship of that name had arrived in Melbourne in July 1854 but did not correspond to the Claimant's description. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> had provided the wrong name for Ospreys captain, and the names he gave for two of Ospreys crew were found to belong {{to members of the}} crew of the Middleton, the ship which had landed Orton at Hobart. No mention of a rescue had been found in Ospreys log or in the Melbourne harbourmaster's records. Giving evidence on the contents of the sealed packet, Gosford revealed that it contained information regarding the disposition of certain properties, but nothing relating to Katherine Doughty's seduction or pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} to battery {{was given in}} Wilkinson v Downton, where emotional distress was considered a possible battery despite no physical force being used. The defendant told <b>the</b> <b>claimant</b> (as a practical joke) {{that her husband had}} been seriously injured. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>claimant</b> suffered a nervous disorder and was thought to be suicidal for a time. It was held that such an action will be valid under battery where it is calculated to cause physical damage and does so. The principle was extended by Khorasandjian v Bush, in 1993, where there was a risk that the defendant's actions would cause physical or psychiatric damage. The tort set down in Wilkinson is normally considered a separate tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when <b>the</b> <b>claimant</b> could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd <b>the</b> <b>claimant</b> sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the United States Civil War, <b>the</b> <b>claimants</b> were {{subjects}} of the Queen of Great Britain, but had been residents within the United States prior and during the war. In December, 1861, <b>the</b> <b>claimants</b> began to manufacture saltpeter, an ingredient of gunpowder, in Santa Cave, a cave 7 miles (11.25km) southwest of Scottsboro, Alabama. During the war, the saltpeter was sold to the Confederate States of America military.In 1864, the Union Army in a campaign through Alabama, seized sixty-five bales of cotton, valued at $43,232, stored on <b>the</b> <b>claimant’s</b> plantation. On December 25, 1868, after the surrender of confederate government, President Andrew Johnson issued Proclamation 179 which unconditionally and without reservation pardoned and provided amnesty to all who had supported the Confederate government.After <b>the</b> pardon, <b>the</b> <b>claimants</b> attempted {{to recover from the}} US government the proceeds of the sixty-five bales of cotton.|$|R
5000|$|Central R. Co. of N. J. v.

5|$|Imprisonment is {{considered}} any restraint on {{the freedom of}} movement, for however short a time. In Austin and another v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, seven hours was considered a sufficient {{period of time to}} constitute false imprisonment (although the claim was ultimately rejected due to the circumstances of a potentially hostile crowd of demonstrators). The requirement is complete restraint; in Bird v Jones, the defendant fenced off part of a footpath for use as a viewing point for a boat race. <b>The</b> <b>claimant,</b> accustomed to walking across it, climbed into the enclosure; the defendants refused to let him pass. They were found not liable for false imprisonment, as another way across existed. There is on the other hand no requirement that <b>the</b> <b>claimant</b> actually attempt to leave, as in Grainger v Hill, or even that he knows he is being prevented from leaving, as in Meering v Graham-White Aviation Co Ltd.|$|E
5|$|Lady Tichborne died on 12 March 1868, thus depriving <b>the</b> <b>Claimant</b> of his {{principal}} advocate and his {{main source of}} income. He outraged the family by insisting on taking the position of chief mourner at her funeral mass. His lost income was rapidly replaced by a fund, set up by supporters, that provided a house near Alresford and an income of £1,400 (£145,278 in 2016) a year.|$|E
5|$|The UK case of R. (Ghai) v. Newcastle City Council (2009) is {{therefore}} interesting {{for purposes of}} comparison. <b>The</b> <b>claimant,</b> an orthodox Hindu, applied to his local authority for land to be dedicated for traditional open air funeral pyres. The local authority refused the request, relying on subsidiary legislation that made it an offence to burn human remains other than in a crematorium. <b>The</b> <b>claimant</b> then applied for judicial review, submitting that the decision infringed his right to manifest his religion or belief which was protected by Article 9(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The High Court found that the statutory interference with the claimant's right was justified as {{it was necessary for}} the protection of public morals and of the rights and freedoms of others. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment on grounds unrelated to Article 9, holding that open air pyres were permissible on a proper construction of the legislation.|$|E
