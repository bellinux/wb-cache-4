5|$|The cheetah {{is often}} {{confused}} with the leopard and the cougar and can be distinguished by its small round spots {{in contrast to the}} leopard's rosettes and the cougar's plain coat; in addition, the leopard lacks <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> streaks of the cheetah. The cougar possesses neither <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> streaks nor the spotted coat pattern of the cheetah. The serval has a form very {{similar to that of the}} cheetah but is significantly smaller. Moreover, it has a shorter tail and spots that fuse to form stripes on the back.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tear</b> streaks are a {{means of}} visual communication. <b>The</b> <b>tear</b> streaks {{combined}} with the black lips and the contrasting white fur give the face a striking appearance and form clear expressions when viewed from a close range. The ears and the face are obscure from a distance, {{and so are the}} expressions. On the other hand, the tail is quite conspicuous and is probably used by mothers to direct juveniles to follow them.|$|E
5|$|Thuan {{started an}} inquiry into the usage of {{chemical}} weapons on the protestors. The investigation exonerated the Diệm regime {{of the most serious}} allegations of using poison or mustard gas. Before the president was deposed in November, the inquiry's report declared that only tear gas was used, and that the liquid components of the grenades were poured onto the protestors after they had failed to vaporize as they were designed to. A further commission chaired by General Trần Văn Đôn prior to February 1964 concluded that <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> gas was left behind by French colonial forces in the 1950s. <b>The</b> <b>tear</b> gas used came in glass containers {{in the form of a}} liquid that was transformed into gaseous vapor upon activation by acid. The injuries were attributed to the acid failing to activate the liquid into gaseous form. United States Army chemists in Maryland confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> gas had come from canisters dating back to French World War I stocks. During World War I, France had used tear gas containing a mixture of chloroacetone and ethyl bromoacetate against German troops at Ypres on the Western Front, which was known to strongly irritate mucous membranes.|$|E

5|$|Connor {{appears in}} the Family Reunion arc of Angel & Faith. Willow, on a quest to restore magic to herself and the world asks Angel and Faith to travel from London to LA with her so she can use the {{residual}} magic in Buffy's scythe and Connor's connection to Quor'toth to reopen <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> in reality at the Hyperion Hotel {{to get to a}} dimension that has magic. Angel & Faith agree to this in order to gain the piece of Giles's soul in the scythe, but will only help reopen <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> and go to Quor'toth if Connor agrees to it. Connor is living a normal life as a college student studying social work with a girlfriend. Though initially disappointed Angel ignored his attempts to contact his father, Connor is glad to have Angel in his life and realizes that his normal life is precious, but he still wants Angel {{to be a part of}} it. Angel is genuinely proud of the man his son has become. Connor agrees that magic needs to be returned to the world as the most vulnerable in society are already starting to lose hope without it.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} (VAD) is a flap-like tear of {{the inner}} lining of the vertebral artery, which {{is located in the}} neck and supplies blood to the brain. After <b>the</b> <b>tear,</b> blood enters the arterial wall and forms a blood clot, thickening the artery wall and often impeding blood flow. The symptoms of vertebral artery dissection include head and neck pain and intermittent or permanent stroke symptoms such as difficulty speaking, impaired coordination and visual loss. It is usually diagnosed with a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan.|$|E
5|$|Rushing {{through the}} University, Jack {{narrowly}} rescues Will from the falling debris. Will warns Jack he cannot simply repair the fracture then and there, {{as it would}} erase key future events and risk a time paradox. Passing a frozen Beth during a stutter, Jack reaches to unfreeze her, but hesitates and leaves. Reaching the Bradbury Pool, Jack and Will travel forward in time, only to find Paul and Monarch waiting for them. Paul is intent on either retrieving the CFR or destroying it. Jack fights and kills him. Hooking the CFR into his time machine, Will asks Jack to jumpstart it with chronon energy. The CFR activates and blasts the area with chronons, fixing <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> and vaporizing Paul. As Will examines the CFR, burnt out from the blast, Jack has a vision of his future self traveling {{to the end of}} time, and begins exhibiting symptoms of chronon syndrome.|$|E

5|$|The most {{determined}} {{resistance to}} the Diệm regime occurred outside the Diệu Đế Pagoda. As troops attempted to stretch a barbed wire barricade across a bridge leading to the pagoda, the crowd tore it down with their bare hands. The protesters fought the heavily armed military personnel with rocks, sticks and their bare fists, throwing back <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> gas grenades that were fired at them. After a five-hour battle, the military finally won control of the bridge by driving armored cars through the angry crowd at sunrise. The defense of the bridge and Diệu Đế left an estimated 30 dead and 200 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of <b>the</b> <b>tear.</b> Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|During the May 21, 2001 {{episode of}} Raw Is War, he {{suffered}} a legitimate and career-threatening injury. In the night's main event, he and Austin were defending the WWF Tag Team Championship against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. At one point, Jericho had Austin trapped in the Walls of Jericho and Triple H ran in to break it up, but just as he did, {{he suffered a}} tear in his left quadriceps muscle, causing it to come completely off the bone. Despite his inability to place any weight on his leg, Triple H was able to complete the match. He even allowed Jericho {{to put him in}} the Walls of Jericho, a move that places considerable stress on the quadriceps. <b>The</b> <b>tear</b> required an operation, which was performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews. This injury brought an abrupt end to the McMahon-Helmsley Era, as the rigorous rehabilitation process kept Triple H out of action for over eight months, completely missing The Invasion storyline.|$|E

5|$|On February 17, Harris {{was named}} to a 23-player roster for the 2012 Algarve Cup. While in Portugal, Harris played in a closed-door {{training}} match against China on February 25, splitting halves with Nicole Barnhart. Harris was not named to the roster of 21 players that suited up for the games in the tournament. Harris traveled with the national team in early April to compete at the Women's Kirin Challenge Cup in Japan. Following the tournament, she trained with the national team in Florida from April 18 to 30. During the training camp, Harris injured her left shoulder, sustaining a small tear in her labrum. She still went on to train with the national team in New Jersey from May 10 to 25. However, in early June, she decided to undergo surgery to repair <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> {{in order to prevent}} further damage. The surgery kept her off the pitch for the rest of 2012.|$|E
5|$|While TBI may {{be managed}} without surgery, {{surgical}} repair of <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> is considered {{standard in the}} treatment of most TBI. It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation; if mediastinitis (inflammation of the tissues in the mid-chest) occurs; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly; or if air leak or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement. Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway, tears with loss of tissue, and a need for positive pressure ventilation. Damaged tissue around a rupture (e.g. torn or scarred tissue) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired. Debridement of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50%. Repair of extensive tears can include sewing a flap of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs (the pericardium and pleura, respectively) over the sutures to protect them. When lung tissue is destroyed as a result of TBI complications, pneumonectomy or lobectomy (removal of a lung or of one lobe, respectively) may be required. Pneumonectomy is avoided whenever possible due to the high rate of death associated with the procedure. Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma, as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed. When airway stenosis results after delayed diagnosis, surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis: the stenotic section is removed and the cut airway is repaired.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tears</b> of Christ in the Medieval Exegesis - According to the New Testament, Jesus wept {{three times}} during His lifetime, yet only once does <b>the</b> {{shedding}} of <b>tears</b> express His suffering. This paper purposes {{to examine the}} exegesis relating to these three occurrences in Christ's terrestrial life by exploring a corpus of texts reduced to their most important commentaries, which were widely diffused from patristic times to the thirteenth century. Two questions arise : {{what is the relationship}} between the suffering and <b>the</b> <b>tears</b> of Christ, and what significance did <b>the</b> <b>tears</b> of Christ hold for the man of the Middle Ages, who aspired to imitate Him ? Despite the growing systematization of exegetic methods, the interpretation of the shedding of <b>the</b> <b>tears</b> of Christ has changed little with time. <b>The</b> <b>tears</b> were considered by the commentators as a sign of Christ's humanity as well as an expression of His virtues. As a metaphor of suffering, <b>the</b> <b>tears</b> of Christ also add to the effectiveness of <b>the</b> Passion. <b>The</b> <b>tears</b> and <b>the</b> blood of Christ have reciprocal roles, thus offering man the possibility of sparing suffering by shedding <b>tears.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tears</b> appear as a remedy to suffering, rather than as the expression of it.

25|$|Sometimes the {{appearance}} of floaters has to be attributed to dark specks in <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film of the eye. Technically, these are not floaters, but they do look the same {{from the viewpoint of}} the patient. Persons with blepharitis or a dysfunctional meibomian gland are especially prone to this cause, but ocular allergies can also cause the problem. To differentiate between material in the vitreous humour of the eye and debris in <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film, one can look at the effect of blinking: debris in <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film will move quickly with a blink, while floaters are largely unresponsive to it. Tear film debris is diagnosed by eliminating the possibility of true floaters and macular degeneration.|$|E

40|$|Tearing {{resistance}} {{is an important}} parameter for evalu-ating the reliability of textile structures, {{especially in the case}} of protective materials. In order to better under-stand the individual contribution of the different mecha-nisms involved in <b>the</b> <b>tearing</b> process, a study of the relation between the fabric and yarn properties charac-terizing these mechanisms and <b>the</b> <b>tearing</b> energy has been carried out. For that purpose, polyester fabrics with two types of weave patterns and various values of filling yarn density and linear density were character-ized in terms of tongue tear energy, yarn and fabric modulus, breaking force and elongation at break, yarn slippage, and yarn jamming. Data for all tested fabrics relied on a unique master curve when <b>the</b> <b>tearing</b> energy was expressed as a function of the transverse yarn slippage force. This demonstrates the strong con-tribution of transverse yarn slippage to <b>the</b> <b>tearing</b> pro-cess, a mechanism which has generally been over-looked in previous works on <b>tearing.</b> Relationships between <b>the</b> <b>tearing</b> energy and <b>the</b> other properties characteristics of the mechanisms involved in tearing of woven textiles were also observed. These results build the path toward the development of models for <b>the</b> <b>tearing</b> energy of textile structures. POLYM. COMPOS. ...|$|R
