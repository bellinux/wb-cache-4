5000|$|The <b>tetraoxygen</b> {{molecule}} (O4), {{also called}} oxozone, was first predicted in 1924 by Gilbert N. Lewis, who proposed {{it as an}} explanation for the failure of liquid oxygen to obey Curie's law. Today it seems Lewis was off, but not by much: computer simulations indicate that although there are no stable O4 molecules in liquid oxygen, O2 molecules do tend to associate in pairs with antiparallel spins, forming transient O4 units. In 1999, researchers thought that solid oxygen existed in its ε-phase (at pressures above 10 GPa) as O4. However, in 2006, it was shown by X-ray crystallography that this stable phase known as ε oxygen or red oxygen is in fact [...] [...] Nevertheless, <b>tetraoxygen</b> has been detected as a short-lived chemical species in mass spectrometry experiments.|$|E

5000|$|Oxygen's {{most common}} allotrope is {{diatomic}} oxygen, or O2, a reactive paramagnetic molecule that is ubiquitous to aerobic organisms {{and has a}} blue color in its liquid state. Another allotrope is O3, or ozone, which is three oxygen atoms bonded together in a bent formation. There is also an allotrope called <b>tetraoxygen,</b> or O4, and six allotropes of solid oxygen including [...] "red oxygen", which has the formula O8.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tetraoxygen</b> {{had been}} {{suspected}} to exist {{since the early}} 1900s, when it was known as oxozone. It was identified in 2001 by a team, led by F.

50|$|The {{chemical}} formulas of the oxides of {{the chemical}} elements in their highest oxidation state are predictable and are derived {{from the number of}} valence electrons for that element. Even the chemical formula of O4, <b>tetraoxygen,</b> is predictable as a group 16 element. One exception is copper, for which the highest oxidation state oxide is copper(II) oxide and not copper(I) oxide. Another exception is fluoride, which does not exist as one might expect—as F2O7—but as OF2.|$|E
50|$|In {{atmospheric}} chemistry, differential {{optical absorption}} spectroscopy (DOAS) {{is used to}} measure concentrations of trace gases. When combined with basic optical spectrometers such as prisms or diffraction gratings and automated, ground-based observation platforms, {{what we have is a}} cheap and powerful means for the measurement of such trace gas species as ozone and nitrogen dioxide. Typical setups allow for detection limits corresponding to optical depths of 0.0001 along lightpaths of up to typically 15 km and thus allow for the detection also of weak absorbers, such as water vapour, Nitrous acid, Formaldehyde, <b>Tetraoxygen,</b> Iodine oxide, Bromine oxide and Chlorine oxide.|$|E

50|$|From 2004 to 2007 Katsnelson {{worked with}} many Russian and Dutch {{physicists}} on the nitrogen dioxide {{and discovered that}} by combining it with <b>tetraoxygen</b> it creates only weak doping which {{is also known as}} density of states in a grapheme. He also discovered that density of states is ideal for chemical sensoring and explained its single molecule detection. On September 23, 2007 he along with Annalisa Fasolino have proven that chemical bonding in carbon is caused by setting ripples' thermal fluctuations to 80 angstrom. In 2010 Katsnelson worked with physicists from India such as Rashid Jalil, Rahul R. Nair, and nanotechnologist Fredrik Schedin of University of Manchester and have discovered that fluorine atoms are attached to the carbon of the graphene therefore creating a new version called fluorographene that can be stable in the air with a temperature of 400 C. In 2012 he and his colleagues have used prototype device which contained graphene heterojunctions which was combined with either thin boron nitride or molybdenum disulfide which was used as a vertical transport barrier. During the experiment, the room temperature was set from ≈50 and ≈10,000 and they prove that using such prototypes is beneficial for high-frequency operations and large-scale integrations.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFixed-node {{diffusion}} quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) calculations {{are performed}} {{to obtain the}} most accurate dissociation barrier and heat of formation with respect to dissociation into molecular oxygen for the chemically bound <b>tetraoxygen</b> molecule. Multireference trial wave functions were used and built from truncated CASSCF(16, 12) through a weight-consistent scheme allowing to control the fixed-node error. Results are compared with the previous ab initio benchmark Complete Active Space SCF Averaged Coupled Pair Functional/aug-cc-pVQZ (CASSCF-ACPF/AVQZ) results. The FN-DMC barriers to dissociation and heat of formation obtained are 11. 6 +/- 1. 6 kcal/mol and 98. 5 +/- 1. 9 kcal/mol, respectively. These thermochemical energies should be taken as the theoretical references when discussing the relevance of <b>tetraoxygen</b> {{in a variety of}} experiments and atmospheric chemical processes...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{adsorption}} model for molecular oxygen on reduced TiO 2 (110), based on extensive first principles density functional calculations. For the first time, our calculations predict formation of <b>tetraoxygen</b> (O 4) anchored at the vacancy site, {{which in turn}} allows adsorption of three O 2 molecules per vacancy in saturation coverage. We present the structure, bonding, and energetics of adsorbed oxygen species by changing the number of adsorbed oxygen molecules per vacancy. We also find that thermally activated O 2 desorption may take place via two channels that require overcoming barriers of 0. 41 and 1. 25 eV, respectively. In addition, our study provides strong theoretical evidence for the change in O 2 reactivity with O 2 coverage. Our findings associated with <b>tetraoxygen</b> complexes are consistent with existing experimental results. No Full Tex...|$|E
