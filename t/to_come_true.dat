25|$|Dahl {{was given}} {{charge of the}} Norwegian forces that were {{transferred}} {{to assist in the}} Liberation of Finnmark from November 1944. Once there, he assumed control of the front from the Soviets, commanding the Free Norwegian Forces that had followed him from Britain, locally raised militias, and recently arrived police troops from Sweden. At the time of the German capitulation in Norway on 8 May 1945 Dahl had under his Finnmark command around 3,000 soldiers. Although involved in very little fighting, the force under Dahl's command was heavily involved in helping the civilian population of Finnmark and served as a symbol of Norwegian sovereignty in the area. Dahl on his part was concerned that the Russian forces which had been stationed in Eastern Finnmark since the October 1944 Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation might not leave after war's end. These concerns turned out not <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>true</b> as all the Soviet forces left Norwegian territory by 25 September 1945.|$|E

2500|$|Savile was conscripted {{to work in}} {{the coal}} mines as a Bevin Boy during the Second World War, {{reportedly}} sustaining spinal injuries, aged 14. He began a career playing records in, and later managing, dance halls, and was said to have been the first disc jockey to use twin turntables to keep music in constant play. His media career started as a disc jockey at Radio Luxembourg in 1958 and on Tyne Tees Television in 1960, and he developed a reputation for eccentricity and flamboyance. At the BBC, he presented the first edition of Top of the Pops in 1964 and broadcast on Radio 1 from 1968. From 1975 until 1994, he presented Jim'll Fix It, a popular television programme in which he arranged for the wishes of viewers, mainly children, <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>true.</b> During his lifetime, he was noted for fund-raising and supporting charities and hospitals, in particular Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire.

2500|$|On 26 December 2008, the PLAN {{dispatched}} a task group {{consisting of the}} guided missile destroyer Haikou (flagship), the guided missile destroyer Wuhan, and the supply ship Weishanhu to the Gulf of Aden to participate in anti-piracy operations {{off the coast of}} Somalia. [...] A team of 16 Chinese Special Forces members from its Marine Corps armed with attack helicopters were on board. Since then, China has maintained a three-ship flotilla of two warships and one supply ship in the Gulf of Aden by assigning ships to the Gulf of Aden on a three monthly basis. Other recent PLAN incidents include the 2001 Hainan Island incident, a major submarine accident in 2003, and naval incidents involving the U.S. MSC-operated ocean surveillance ships [...] and [...] during 2009. At the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the PLAN, 52 to 56 vessels were shown in manoeuvres off Qingdao in April 2009 including previously unseen nuclear submarines.

2500|$|Disagreement {{persists}} {{over who}} originated {{the metaphor of}} a [...] "stab in the back" [...] as an explanation for losing the First World War. [...] What emerges clearly from Thaer's observations is {{that the idea of}} off-loading responsibility for military defeat away from the military leadership originated in the Supreme Army Command. [...] Even though Hindenburg and Ludendorff tried to shift the blame for the threatened defeat [...] - and therefore the failure of their own predications <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>true</b> - during the later years of the war, away from the army, there was not at this point any talk of a planned or treacherous conspiracy. [...] But there was talk of the forces having been let down by shortcomings on the homefront, whereby inadequate soldiers and insufficient war resources had been supplied by the civilain authorities. [...] Thaer quotes Ludendorff on 1 October 1918: [...] "Right now we have no chancellor. [...] Whoever gets appointed, there are {{things that need to be}} done. [...] But I have asked His Majesty to bring into government those whom we have to thank that we have come to the present position. [...] We will now see these gentlemen taking over the ministries. [...] They must now conclude the peace that must be concluded. [...] Let them now take the gruel that they have been delivering to us!" [...] This argument can really only be interpreted as a form of retreat-ideology, and in that sense the first phase in the development of the [...] Dolchstoß legend. [...] It served to obscure the failures of the military leadership, and from there of certain specific individuals.|$|E
2500|$|A Celtic {{belief is}} that at the full moon any silver coins on one's person should be jingled or turned over to prevent bad luck, also the silver coins would {{increase}} as the moon grew in size. A wish to a new moon could also be made, but not as seen through glass, jingling coins at the same time. American silver [...] "Mercury" [...] dimes, especially with a leap year date, are especially lucky. Gamblers' charms are often these dimes, Mercury being the Roman god who ruled the crossroads, games of chance, etc. Although these dimes actually figure the head of Liberty, people commonly mistake it for Mercury. A silver dime worn at the throat will supposedly turn black if someone tries to poison your food or drink. American [...] "Indian Head" [...] cents are worn as amulets to ward off evil or negative spirits. In Spain a bride places a silver coin from her father in one shoe and a gold coin from her mother in the other. This will ensure that she will never want for anything. Silver coins were placed in Christmas puddings and birthday cakes to bring good luck and wealth. A variation on this custom was that in some families each member added a coin to the pudding bowl, making a wish as they did so. If their coin turned up in their bowl it's said their wish was sure <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>true.</b> In Greece, a coin is added to vasilopita, a bread baked in honor of the feast day of St. Basil the Great. At midnight {{the sign of the cross}} is etched with a knife across the cake, to bless the house and bring good luck for the new year. A piece is sliced for each member of the family and any visitors present at the time, and the person who gets the slice with the coin will receive good luck, and often a gift.|$|E
