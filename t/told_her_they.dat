Wintour reportedly warned major fashion designers who {{had been invited to}} make cameo appearances as themselves in the film that they would be banished from the magazine's pages if they did so. Vogue and other major women's and fashion magazines have avoided reviewing or even mentioning the book in their pages. Wintour's spokespeople deny the claim, but costume designer Patricia Field says many designers <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>they</b> did not want to risk Wintour's wrath.|$|E
25|$|Native {{legend of}} the Lil'wat {{subgroup}} of the St'at'imc tells of a girl named Chinook-Wind, who married Glacier, and moved to his country, {{which was in the}} area of today's Birkenhead River. She pined for her warm sea-home in the southwest, and sent a message to her people. They came to her in a vision in the form of snowflakes, and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>they</b> were coming to get her. They came in great number and quarrelled with Glacier over her, but they overwhelmed him and she went home with them in the end.|$|E
25|$|A {{short time}} later, detectives from the RHD {{who had been}} {{selected}} for their lack of personal connection to Lazarus called her one morning from the lockup at Parker Center, the department's headquarters. Bratton had ordered that location be used since Lazarus would have to surrender her gun in order to enter it, limiting the possibility she might resist violently when she was arrested (immediately following the interview, as was the plan) or {{realized that she was}} the prime suspect. The detectives, Greg Stearns and Dan Jaramillo, <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>they</b> had someone in custody who wanted to talk about an art theft.|$|E

25|$|With this {{activity}} ongoing, another Wings West aircraft, a Metroliner similar to SkyWest 5569, called the tower reporting {{they were ready}} for takeoff. The same local controller queried this aircraft about their position, and they <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>they</b> were holding on a taxiway short of 24L. The flight progress strip for this flight {{had not yet been}} given to the local controller by the clearance delivery controller (another distraction), and the local controller mistakenly thought this Metroliner was SkyWest 5569 and thus the runway was clear of aircraft. The first officer of the USAir flight recalled hearing this conversation, but did not remember anyone being cleared to hold on the runway.|$|E
25|$|Mandy, Whitworth's step-mother, {{reported}} the Police knocking {{on her door}} to inform her they had found Daniel's body. She says she was led to believe Daniel had overdosed on drugs, despite no investigation having taken place. Police didn't treat the death as suspicious, despite bruising found under Daniel's arms, {{which led to a}} coroner reporting that third-party involvement could not be ruled out. The Police took the fake suicide note left by Port with Daniel's body at face-value. They sent a small fragment of the letter to Mandy and Daniel's father, Adam, asking them to verify if it was Daniel's penmanship. They looked at the writing on the note and compared it with Daniel's writing from Birthday cards and other mementos. They reported back to the Police saying they were unsure if it was Daniel's writing, as they didn't often see his handwriting and they couldn't say for certain. Mandy reported that Dagenham Police had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>they</b> had experts who can analyse the writing and determine whether it is Daniel's or not, and Mandy assumed this is what the Police would do. It is later shown at trial that Dagenham Police documented that Mandy and Adam had confirmed the handwriting was Daniel's, despite them telling the Police they were unsure. It came to light that handwriting professionals had not investigated the note, but that untrained Police Officers had 'taken a look' at the note themselves. Mandy maintains that if specialists had looked further into this note, they could have found Port earlier.|$|E

Starting in the 1980s, he travelled with his all-female Amazonian Guard, who were allegedly sworn to a life of celibacy. After Gaddafi's death, the Libyan psychologist Seham Sergewa—part of a team investigating sexual offences during the civil war—stated that five of the guards <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>they</b> had been raped by Gaddafi and senior officials. After Gaddafi's death, the French journalist Annick Cojean published a book alleging that Gaddafi had had sexual relations with women, some in their early teenage years, who had been specially selected for him. One of those Cojean interviewed, a woman named Soraya, claimed that Gaddafi kept her imprisoned in a basement for six years, where he repeatedly raped her, urinated on her, and forced her to watch pornography, drink alcohol, and snort cocaine.|$|E

500|$|While {{writing and}} {{recording}} for her debut album, Stefani cited her major influences as Club Nouveau, Lisa Lisa, Prince, New Order, The Cure and early Madonna and advised the producers and writers {{that she wanted}} a similar sound for the album. According to MTV's Jennifer Vineyard, musician and songwriter Linda Perry [...] "put Gwen in a headlock" [...] during a party after the Grammys and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>they</b> could make beautiful music together"; however, Stefani felt scared and insecure about working with Perry. While recording at Perry's house, Stefani was initially insecure about her writing process and [...] "would go into another room to try to write some lyrics, {{and when she came}} back, Perry would already have the whole song nailed." [...] After a writing session where [...] "What You Waiting For?" [...] was created, Stefani became less insecure and felt more comfortable when making songs. After working with other musicians, Stefani and Perry worked together on [...] "The Real Thing". On October 3, 2005, Interscope Records released the song as a promotional single exclusively in the Philippines. The label released a CD single, which featured the album version and a remix by Wendy & Lisa of the song.|$|E
500|$|The Monach Isles, {{also known}} as Heisker, lie [...] west of North Uist in the Outer Hebrides, an {{archipelago}} itself lying off the western coast of Scotland.

At {{the time they were}} owned by Sir Alexander MacDonald of Sleat, and Lady Grange was housed with his tacksman, another Alexander MacDonald, and his wife. When she complained about her condition, she was told by her host that he had no orders to provide her with either clothes, or food other than the normal fare {{he and his wife were}} used to. She lived in isolation for two years, not even being told the name of the island where she was living, and it took her some time to find out who her landlord was. She was there until June 1734, when John and Norman MacLeod from North Uist arrived to move her on. They <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>they</b> were taking her to Orkney, but instead set sail for the Atlantic outliers of St Kilda.|$|E
500|$|While {{working for}} the U.S. Steel Hour, a {{colleague}} left {{to work for the}} educational television station WGBH-TV in Boston; her reaction was life-changing: [...] "What?! [...] There is educational television?!" [...] She later stated, [...] "I knew that I was born to be in educational television; it was St. Paul on the highway". [...] In 1961, she began to track the progress of a court case in which a New York City nonprofit group was attempting to acquire Newark, New Jersey-based independent station WNTA-TV (channel 13), which would become the precursor of PBS station WNET, the first public television station in the New York area. [...] When channel 13 became non-commercial two years later as WNDT, Joan Ganz applied for a position as the station's publicist, but the general manager <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>they</b> needed producers. [...] "I can produce", she told him, even though she had no experience in producing television shows. [...] She later stated, [...] "I've never been qualified for any job I've been hired for". [...] According to television historian Cary O'Dell, WNDT hired her because of the ties she had made through her political activities and associations with Partisan Review. [...] Joan Ganz later said during an interview with the Archive of American Television that the transition to becoming a documentary producer was not difficult for her because she was well-read and aware of the issues of the day, adding, [...] "I felt like I'd died and gone to heaven, dealing with foreign policy and domestic policy and civil rights, which became the great passion in those years for me".|$|E

500|$|Spears's {{relationship}} {{of three years}} with pop singer Justin Timberlake ended in 2002 after months of speculation. In November 2002, Timberlake released the song [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors {{that she had been}} unfaithful to him. [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] is often credited as being the song that propelled the album into the charts. In September 2001, Annet Artani accepted to become a backing vocalist for Spears's 2001–2002 Dream Within a Dream Tour. Her interactions with Spears during most of the tour were limited to small conversations at the gym and vocal warm ups. Artani had begun a relationship with the show's musical director during 2002; however, it was not working out well {{by the end of the}} tour. Before the last date in Mexico City, Spears called her and asked about the relationship. Artani <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>they</b> were going to break up, to which Spears responded, [...] "Don't worry about it, you're going to hang out with me". Following the end of the tour, Spears and Artani began to forge a friendship. Spears invited Artani to her house in Los Angeles, California. According to Artani, their relationship grew out of their shared romantic experiences at the time. She explained, [...] "Basically, we commiserated because she, at that time, had broken up with Justin [...] Maybe like nine months before, but of course it was really fresh in the media. I was just breaking up with this guy, so we kind of like—I think we kind of needed each other." [...] Artani stayed at Spears's house for a few weeks, in which they started writing songs at the piano. Shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Artani added, [...] "It was me and her, her stylist and Felicia, and we had this humongous house to ourselves, and they had a piano there as well".|$|E

Tsarnaev [...] "vaguely discussed" [...] jihad during a 2011 phone call with his mother that was taped by the FSB, and intelligence officials also discovered text messages in which his mother discussed how he was ready to die for Islam.

She says Ellens producers <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>they</b> cannot have her on [...] "trashing celebrities", but she appeared as a guest on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on September 11, 2007.

This incident got Griffin fired from hosting duties on E!'s red-carpet award show coverage.
