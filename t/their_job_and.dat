25|$|In prison, {{his life}} was spared {{at the insistence of}} Roman Karmen, the Soviet war {{reporter}} who directed all the main sequences illustrating the battle, from the Viet Minh raising the Red flag over General de Castries's bunker staged {{a few weeks after the}} siege, to the French Union POWs column marching from Dien Bien Phu to the re-education camp (a crane was used for the shooting), that are featured in Вьетнам ("Vietnam", 1955). During this time, Karmen had some friendly meetings with Schoendoerffer; they spoke about <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> <b>and</b> he revealed to the French prisoner that he had found his reels and had watched them. Karmen kept the reels though, so as a result the only footage covering the battle is from the Viet Minh's perspective. Karmen's own work has been watched all around the world and has even been used in the western media. As an example, Peter Batty's 1980 The Battle for Den Bien Phu documentary is largely based on the footage from Vietnam.|$|E

Lack of fit in either of these domains can cause problems, and the greater the gap or misfit (either subjective or objective) between the person and their environment, the greater the strain as demands exceed abilities, and need exceeds supply. These strains can relate to health related issues, lower productivity, and other work problems. Defense mechanisms, such as denial, reappraisal of needs, and coping, also operate in the model, to try and reduce subjective misfit" ...|$|E

The exact location of M42 is a closely guarded secret and does not appear on maps, though it has been shown on the History Channel program Cities of the Underworld and a National Geographic special. Two of the original rotary converters were not removed in the late 20th century when solid-state ones took over <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> <b>and</b> they remain as a historical record. During World War II, this facility was closely guarded because its sabotage would have impaired troop movement on the Eastern Seaboard.

Abwehr (a German espionage service) sent two spies to sabotage it; they were arrested by the FBI before they could strike.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} various {{theoretical}} explanations for this mediation relationship {{addressed in the}} literature. [...] Primarily, {{it is suggested that}} the relationship between core self-evaluations, job characteristics, and, thus, job satisfaction can be explained by two possible mediation models. [...] The first model, known as the action mediation model, suggests that individuals' respective levels of core self-evaluations influence the actions they take to obtain work with the proper job characteristics. [...] According to this model, those with high core-self evaluations {{will be more likely to}} seek out job environments that allow them to make positive conclusions about their work. [...] In other words, those who have positive appraisals of themselves (i.e. high core self-evaluations) will be more likely to search for and obtain jobs that have the necessary job characteristics and will consequently have high job satisfaction. [...] The action mediation model also explains that an individual high in core self-evaluations may take more action to alter the characteristics in a job he or she has already obtained. [...] For example, high core self-evaluation individuals may be more likely to seek feedback than low core self-evaluation individuals and, thus, will perceive higher levels of feedback at <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> higher job satisfaction.|$|E
2500|$|Where a lock is tidal (i.e. {{one side}} of the lock has water whose level varies with the tide) or where a canal meets a river whose level may vary, the water on the tidal or river side (the [...] "downstream" [...] side) may rise above the water on the normal [...] "upper" [...] side. The [...] "upstream" [...] {{pointing}} doors will then fail to do <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> <b>and</b> will simply drift open. To prevent water flowing the wrong way through the lock, there will need to be at least one set of gates pointing in the [...] "wrong" [...] direction. If it is desirable that boats can use the lock in these circumstances, then {{there needs to be a}} full set of gates pointing towards the tidal or river side. The usual method is to have gates pointing in opposite directions at both ends of the chamber (alternatively, the [...] "paired stop lock" [...] arrangement of two separate sequential locks pointing in opposite directions would work here – but would require an extra chamber). If navigation is not required (or impossible) at one [...] "extreme" [...] (e.g. allow navigation above mid-tide, but just prevent the canal emptying at low tide) then it is only necessary to have one set of bi-directional gates.|$|E
