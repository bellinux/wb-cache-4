5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} to leap {{out of the water}} and spin three or four times about its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>product</b> of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out of the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E
5|$|The {{carcinogenity}} of chromate dust {{has been}} known for a long time, and in 1890 the first publication described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company. Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the genotoxicity of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the DNA. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>product</b> of the chromium(III) reduction.|$|E

5|$|Although the Dreamcast {{version of}} Half-Life was cancelled, Blue Shift persevered. Prior to the {{cancellation}} of the Dreamcast version, Sierra announced on March 29, 2001, that Blue Shift would be released for PC as well. The game would be released as a standalone expansion pack, a product that {{does not require the}} original Half-Life to run. The new models developed for the Dreamcast version of Half-Life would also be included in the PC version as the Half-Life High Definition pack. In addition, Gearbox announced that the High Definition pack would not be exclusive for Blue Shift, but could be applied to both Half-Life and Opposing Force as well. At the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2001, Gearbox announced that development of Blue Shift had been completed, and exhibited a playable version of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>product.</b> The game was released on June 12, 2001.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes can {{be either}} {{activated}} or inhibited by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors {{for one of the}} first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a negative feedback mechanism, because the amount of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>product</b> produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according {{to the demands of the}} cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the rings}} of Uranus {{appear to be}} young, they must be {{continuously}} renewed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies. The estimates show that the lifetime against collisional disruption of a moon with the size like that of Puck is a few billion years. The lifetime of a smaller satellite is much shorter. Therefore, all current inner moons and rings can be products of disruption of several Puck-sized satellites during the last four and half billion years. Every such disruption would have started a collisional cascade that quickly ground almost all large bodies into much smaller particles, including dust. Eventually the majority of mass was lost, and particles survived only in positions that were stabilized by mutual resonances and shepherding. <b>The</b> <b>end</b> <b>product</b> of such a disruptive evolution would be a system of narrow rings. However, a few moonlets must still be embedded within the rings at present. The maximum size of such moonlets is probably around 10km.|$|E

5|$|The vicegerency {{brought the}} pace of reforms {{under the control of}} the king. A balance was instituted between the conservatives and the reformers and this was seen in the Ten Articles, the first attempt at {{defining}} the beliefs of the Henrician Church. The articles had a two-part structure. The first five articles showed the influence of the reformers by recognising only three of the former seven sacraments: baptism, eucharist, and penance. The last five articles concerned the roles of images, saints, rites and ceremonies, and purgatory, and they reflected the views of the traditionalists. Two early drafts of the document have been preserved and show different teams of theologians at work. The competition between the conservatives and reformers is revealed in rival editorial corrections made by Cranmer and Cuthbert Tunstall, the bishop of Durham. <b>The</b> <b>end</b> <b>product</b> had something that pleased and annoyed both sides of the debate. By 11 July, Cranmer, Cromwell, and the Convocation, the general assembly of the clergy, had subscribed to the Ten Articles.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the mysteries developed after Isis's Hellenized cult reached Greece itself, later in the third century BCE. Much of the early evidence of Isis worship in Greece comes from aretalogies, poems in praise of the goddess. The wording of aretalogies from Maroneia and Andros, both from the first century BCE, closely links Isis with mystery rites. Petra Pakkanen says that these aretalogies prove the mysteries of Isis existed by that time, but Jan Bremmer argues that they only connect Isis with the Eleusinian Mysteries, not with distinctive rites of her own. Stronger evidence for mysteries of Isis {{is found in the}} first century CE, and they certainly existed in the second. Temples to Isis in Greece may have developed their mysteries in response to the widespread belief that the Greek mystery cults had originated with Isis and Osiris in Egypt. They could have adapted elements of Eleusinian rites, and perhaps Dionysian mysteries as well, to reflect Egyptian mythology. <b>The</b> <b>end</b> <b>product</b> would have seemed to the Greeks like an authentic Egyptian precursor to Greek mysteries. Many Greco-Roman sources claim that Isis herself devised these rites.|$|E
5|$|Several {{media outlets}} {{attempted}} {{to place the}} work within a particular genre. MTV compared the song's style to the group Devo and new wave music. El País described the piece as an electropop song {{that contributed to the}} viral spread of the Christian Bale rant after its release on the Internet. Dose described it as an electro jam session which made adept use of sampling from the audio of Bale's rhetoric. The Los Angeles Times called the piece a lively pop music tribute to the actor. USA Today called the song fun dance music and creatively motivated. The Toronto Sun praised its original lyrics and use of audio from the incident, and described the piece as a fusion of electro-pop styles and a good song for dancing. New Musical Express recommended the piece, and described it as electro-rock which astutely sampled Bale throughout the song. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch described the piece as a form of new wave music which used the most spasmodic segments of the incident, and commented that <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>product</b> was comedic.

Application of 5 microliters of the same incubation mixture onto filter paper without subsequent electrophoretic separation also resulted in development of fluorescence after brief heating at 120 degrees C for 5 min. This spot test differentiates penicillinase activity from cephalosporinase activity and distinguishes between beta-lactamase and acylase activities, since <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>products</b> of acylase [the common side chain, D(-) -alpha-aminophenylacetic acid, and the intact beta-lactam nuclei, 6 -aminopenicillanic acid and 7 -aminodeacetoxycephalosporanic acid] are not fluorescent.
