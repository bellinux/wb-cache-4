5|$|Before Becket {{returned}} to England, on 1 December 1170, he excommunicated Roger, {{as well as}} Gilbert Foliot the Bishop of Lincoln and Josceline de Bohon the Bishop of Salisbury. After Becket landed in England the three excommunicates went to Becket and asked for absolution, but while Becket was willing to absolve Gilbert and Josceline, he insisted that only the pope could absolve an archbishop. Roger persuaded <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>that</b> they should stick together, and all three went to King Henry in Normandy, to secure the king's permission for their appeals to Rome.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January 1919 the Paris Peace Conference began. The conference {{aimed to}} {{establish}} peace between the war's belligerents {{and to establish}} the post-war world. The Treaty of Versailles resulting from the conference dealt solely with Germany. This treaty, along with <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>that</b> were signed during the conference, each took their name from the suburb of Paris where the signings took place. While 70 delegates from 26 nations participated in the Paris negotiations, representatives from Germany were barred from attending, nominally over fears that a German delegation would attempt to play one country off against the other and unfairly influence the proceedings.|$|E

50|$|First {{compare the}} hand types.

5|$|The United States Navy's {{greatest}} defeat until World War II caused {{panic in}} Washington. As Lincoln's Cabinet met {{to discuss the}} disaster, the frightened Secretary of War Edwin Stanton told <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>that</b> the Virginia might attack East coast cities, and even shell the White House before the meeting ended. Welles assured his colleagues that they were safe as the ship could not traverse the Potomac River. He added that the Union also had an ironclad, {{and that it was}} heading to meet the Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Burke and Hare's next {{victim was}} a {{familiar}} figure {{in the streets of}} Edinburgh, James Wilson, an 18-year-old man with a limp caused by deformed feet. He was mentally disabled and, according to Alanna Knight in her history of the murders, was inoffensive; he was known locally as Daft Jamie. Wilson lived on the streets and supported himself by begging. In November Hare lured Wilson to his lodgings with the promise of whisky, and sent his wife to fetch Burke. The two murderers led Wilson into a bedroom, the door of which Margaret Hare locked before pushing the key back under the door. As Wilson did not like whisky—he preferred snuff—he was not as drunk as most of the duo's victims; he was also strong, and fought back against the two attackers, but was overpowered and killed in the normal way. His body was stripped and his few possessions stolen: Burke kept a snuff box and Hare a snuff spoon. When the body was examined the following day by Knox and his students, several of them recognised it to be Wilson, but Knox denied it could be anyone the students knew. When word started circulating that Wilson was missing, Knox dissected the body ahead of <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>that</b> were being held in storage; the head and feet were removed before the main dissection.|$|E

5|$|Eliza Farnham's 1856 {{account of}} the Donner Party was based largely on an {{interview}} with Margaret Breen. Her version details the ordeals of the Graves and Breen families after James Reed and the second relief left them in the snow pit. According to Farnham, seven-year-old Mary Donner suggested to <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>that</b> they should eat Isaac Donner, Franklin Graves, Jr., and Elizabeth Graves, because the Donners had already begun eating the others at Alder Creek, including Mary's father Jacob. Margaret Breen insisted {{that she and her}} family did not cannibalize the dead, but Kristin Johnson, Ethan Rarick, and Joseph Kingwhose account is sympathetic to the Breen familydo not consider it credible that the Breens, who had been without food for nine days, {{would have been able to}} survive without eating human flesh. King suggests Farnham included this into her account independently of Margaret Breen.|$|E
5|$|In Novi, Virginia, a {{group of}} ex-convicts, led by Dr. Lisa Holland (Katy Boyer), meet and discuss atoning for their sins. Terry Pruit (Don Swayze) tells <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>that,</b> since he has {{discovered}} the group, he has made amends for his past. However, another member, Ed (Cyril O'Reilly), tells him that humans are unable to change {{and that they are}} both destined for hell. Ed's friend, Victor Potts (David Figlioli), tells Holland that he's been having nightmares involving people being skinned alive. That night, he has a vision of Ed skinned. Several hours later, Victor is murdered. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) asks John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to examine Potts' body. Reyes explains that, because Potts had a premonition of his death, the case is an X-File. Meanwhile, at a butchery, Terry and Ed get into an argument. Terry later has a vision—similar to Victor's—in which Ed is skinned alive. That night, he is attacked and brutally flayed.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, Susan, Russell, wrangler Carter Blake, marine {{biologist}} Janice Higgins, and engineer Tom Scoggins witness the shark smash Jim's stretcher against the laboratory's main window, drowning him and flooding the facility. With few options left, the group {{goes to the}} facility's wet entry, where they plan to take a submersible to escape. Upon being confronted, Susan confesses to <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>that</b> she and Jim genetically engineered the sharks to increase their brain size, as they were not large enough to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein complex; this has the side effect of making them smarter and deadly. When the group reaches the wet entry, they discover that the submersible has been damaged. While delivering a monologue emphasizing the need for group unity, Russell is dragged into the submersible pool by the shark and killed.|$|E

5|$|Ten years later, J. D. Redding and {{his teenage}} {{daughter}} Tory rent the O'Grady farmhouse for the summer. Contract workers Nathan Murphy, his 12-year-old brother Alex, and their dimwitted friend Ozzie Jones help re-paint the farmhouse. While {{looking around the}} basement, Ozzie hears the leprechaun's cry for help and mistakes him for a little child. He brushes the old four-leaf clover off the crate, freeing the leprechaun. After failing to convince <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>that</b> he met a leprechaun, Ozzie spots a rainbow and chases it, believing he will find a pot of gold at the end. Alex accompanies him for fear Ozzie might hurt himself. A bag of one hundred gold pieces magically appears before Ozzie. After Ozzie tests the gold and accidentally swallows a piece, they stash it in an old well and plot to keep it for themselves, hoping to fix Ozzie's brain.|$|E
5|$|The next night, the ghouls {{leave the}} belfry and float into town {{accompanied}} by their straitjacketed, deformed minions. They {{knock on the}} door of a student. When he opens it, aroused from sleeping, they hold him down and carve out his heart while he tries in vain to scream. At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies to explain to <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>that</b> The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.|$|E
5|$|The team is {{inserted}} into the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, where they make a trek through the mountains. Here, they begin to encounter communications problems, which will {{play a critical role}} in the following events. Upon arriving at their designated location, the SEALs are accidentally discovered by an elderly shepherd and two teenage goat herders. Knowing that if they release them, the herders will likely alert Taliban to their presence, the team is split about whether to kill the herders or not. After a brief debate, Luttrell convinces <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>that</b> they will incite backlash if they kill the three herders. The team decides to release them and abort the mission, but before they can escape, they are discovered by Taliban forces. Although they manage to kill several Taliban soldiers, they find themselves heavily outnumbered and at a significant tactical disadvantage. Each of the men suffers serious injuries during the firefight and, in an attempt to flee from the insurgents, they jump off the edge of a precipitous ridge and into a large ravine.|$|E
