5|$|Arianna refuses <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone,</b> however, so Layton and Luke {{continue}} {{to question the}} townspeople while Emmy goes to the Scotland Yard for information regarding Evan Barde's death. With the aid of Inspectors Chelmey and Grosky, she uncovers the records for the case before heading back to Misthallery to reunite with Layton and Luke. Inspector Grosky returns with her, hoping that his own influence will help convince the town's Chief of Police, Chief Jakes, to provide further information on the case. Regardless, Chief Jakes remains adamantly opposed to the investigation of Barde's death, and demands that Layton and company leave the town within 24 hours. Despite Jakes' threats, they visit Arianna {{to explain to her}} {{what has happened to the}} town and to her father. Arianna opens up to them, and proceeds to guide them to the nearby lake before playing the Specter's Flute, which causes a prehistoric aquatic creature named Loosha to rise from the lake.|$|E
5|$|The Jaradan demand their {{greeting}} {{earlier than}} the agreed time and are insulted at having <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> other than the Captain. The crew try to communicate with Picard in the holodeck but find it impossible; the Jaradan signal has affected the holodeck's functions, preventing the doors from opening or allowing communication with the crew inside. Lt. Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) attempt to repair the holodeck systems, while inside the holodeck, the group returns to Dixon's office. Mr. Leech (Harvey Jason) appears having waited for Picard, demanding he turn over an object he believes Jessica gave him. When Picard fails to understand, Leech shoots Dr. Whalen with a gun, and the crew discovers that the safety protocols have been disabled as Whalen is severely wounded. As Dr. Crusher cares for his wound, Picard and Data discover the holodeck is malfunctioning and {{they are unable to}} exit the program. Mr. Leech is joined by Redblock and continues to demand the object. Lt. McNary arrives and becomes involved in the standoff. Picard tries to explain the nature of the holodeck, but Redblock refuses to believe him.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the sudden}} {{death of his}} grandfather, a grief-stricken Healy shut himself away, refusing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>anyone.</b> Emerging a week later, and with a clear vision of where he now wanted Travis and their music to go, Healy {{dispensed}} with the band's management and publicity agent. Having been repeatedly knocked back by the British record industry, the band couldn't afford to stay around the country for another few years and so decided to move to New York, feeling that the U.S. might be more suited to their style of music. However, before leaving Healy told the band that they should send the demo to Charlie Pinder of Sony Music Publishing, who they had known for a few years and regularly sent songs to, saying: [...] "If he's not into it, then we'll go." [...] Pinder was immediately impressed by the song [...] "All I Want to Do is Rock", which he felt was a dramatic change for the band: [...] "It was harder, more exciting, sexy; all things that they never really were. They turned a corner." [...] After performing a secret gig for Pinder and his boss at Sony, Blair McDonald, they were signed to Sony Music Publishing. The immediate impact of what was a very secret deal was that the line-up was changed—keyboard player Geoff Martyn was removed, and the bassist, Geoff's brother Chris, was replaced with Healy's best friend Dougie Payne—and the band was moved to London, where they were given a rehearsal room and a house.|$|E

40|$|Human Fertility 17 (3) : 165 - 9 This article {{describes}} the experiences of twelve Irish couples who had successful IVF treatment in Ireland. Irish Medical guidelines specify that IVF may only be used when no other treatment {{is likely to be}} effective. This article is based on data drawn from a longitudinal research study by Cotter (2009) which tells the stories of 34 couples who sought fertility treatment. Initially, the women assumed that they would become pregnant when they stopped using contraception. As a couple, it was the ‘right time’ for them to have a child - they were ready, socially and financially. For several months they were patient, hoping it would happen naturally. With envy and some despair they watched as their friends had babies. Infertility came as a shock to most of them. They were reluctant <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it <b>to</b> <b>anyone,</b> and over time their anxieties were accompanied by feelings of regret, stigma and social exclusion. They finally sought medical treatment. The latter involved a series of diagnostic treatments, which eventually culminated in IVF which offered them a final chance of having a ‘child of their own’. While IVF can be clinically assessed in terms of cycle success rates, their stories showed treatment as a series of discoveries, as an extensive range of diagnostic tests and procedures helped to reveal to them where their problems might lie. They described their treatments as a series of sequential ‘hurdles’ that they had to overcome, which further strengthened their resolve to try IVF. Much more knowledgeable at that stage, they embraced IVF as a final challenge with single minded dedication while drawing on all their psychological and biological resources to promote a successful outcome. Of the 34 couples {{who took part in the}} study, twelve got pregnant. Unfortunately, two children died shortly after birth but eighteen babies survived (see Table I). The findings suggest that health policy should raise awareness of infertility, and advise women to become aware of it just as in the past, when health policy addressed contraception. Increased public knowledge would reduce the stigma attached to the inability to have a baby. In the Irish case, infertility diagnosis should be reviewed with a view to giving eligible couples earlier access to IVF. ...|$|R
