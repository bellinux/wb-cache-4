5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the {{behaviour}} of Newton's parakeet, but it is probable that it was similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> members of its genus. Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island ate the nuts of the bois d'olive tree (Cassine orientalis). Tafforet also stated that the parrots ate the seeds of the bois de buis shrub (Fernelia buxifolia), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Newton's parakeet may have fed on leaves as the related echo parakeet does. The fact that it survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, version 2.1 of the EyeTV {{software}} was introduced {{with a new}} user-interface, an integrated TV guide from TitanTV and compatibility with Apple remotes. The interface was similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> Apple products. An article in Macworld praised the update and especially the new editing features, but said it had some quirks, such as a difficult-to-find Edit button. Some of the iHome software, which plays video content from a computer onto a television, was released in 2006 as a universal binary.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} hostility of Bede has {{obscured}} Penda's importance as ruler who wielded an imperium similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> prominent 7th century 'overkings'. Penda's hegemony included lesser rulers of both Anglo-Saxon and British origins, non-Christian and Christian alike. The relationships between Penda, as hegemon, and his subordinate rulers would {{have been based on}} personal as well as political ties, and they would often have been reinforced by dynastic marriages. It has been asserted that Penda's court would have been cosmopolitan, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual and tolerant. Though a pagan himself, there is evidence that the contemporary Mercian elite contained significant Christian and British elements. Penda must have been intimate with many Britons and may have been bilingual himself.|$|E

5|$|Oxyhalides and oxysulfides of {{protactinium}} are known. PaOBr3 has a monoclinic structure {{composed of}} double-chain units where protactinium has coordination 7 and is arranged into pentagonal bipyramids. The chains are interconnected through oxygen and bromine atoms, and each oxygen atom is related to three protactinium atoms. PaOS is a light-yellow non-volatile solid with a cubic crystal lattice isostructural <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> actinide oxysulfides. It is obtained by reacting protactinium(V) chloride {{with a mixture of}} hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide at 900°C.|$|E

It also introduced a standard way of declaring constructors and destructors, similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> object-oriented languages such as C++, {{and a standard}} exception handling model. Furthermore, PHP 5 added interfaces and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects {{to interact with the}} runtime system. Objects implementing ArrayAccess can be used with array syntax and objects implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate can be used with the foreach language construct. There is no virtual table feature in the engine, so static variables are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.|$|E
5|$|Polyadenylate polymerases {{are not as}} ancient.

Its catalytic domain is homologous <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> polymerases. It is presumed that the horizontal transfer of bacterial CCA-adding enzyme to eukaryotes allowed the archaeal-like CCA-adding enzyme to switch function to a poly(A) polymerase. Some lineages, like archaea and cyanobacteria, never evolved a polyadenylate polymerase.|$|E

5|$|Skeletal {{elements}} of the upper jaw {{appear to have been}} rhynchokinetic (movable in relation to each other), which must have affected its feeding behaviour. In extant birds, such as frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons, kinetic premaxillae help with consuming large food items. The beak also appears {{to have been able to}} withstand high force loads, which indicates a diet of hard food. In 2016, the first 3D endocast was made from the brain of the dodo; examination found that though the brain was similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> pigeons in most respects, the dodo had a comparatively large olfactory bulb. This gave the dodo a good sense of smell, which may have aided in locating fruit and small prey.|$|E
5|$|Spinosaurus {{has long}} been {{depicted}} in popular books about dinosaurs, although only recently has there been enough information about spinosaurids for an accurate depiction. After an influential 1955 skeletal reconstruction by Lapparent and Lavocat based on a 1936 diagram by Stromer, it has been treated as a generalized upright theropod, with a skull similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> large theropods and a sail on its back, even having four-fingered hands.|$|E
5|$|The Boletus pinophilus is edible, {{and may be}} used fresh, preserved, {{dried and}} cooked {{in a manner similar}} <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> edible boletes.

The taste and smell is pleasant. People of La Malinche have likened the flavour to pork and pork crackling. It is easily misidentified as the porcini Boletus edulis, due to the similar habitat and appearance.|$|E
30|$|The {{effects of}} this Friendship Paradox may extend beyond popularity. If popular {{individuals}} tend to be happier, their elevated happiness will become more prevalent as well. This may in turn lead to a Happiness Paradox, where most individuals are less happy than their friends on average (see Figure  1). In fact, the latter may contribute more directly to the negative psycho-social effects of social networking since it affects how individuals assess their own Subjective Well-being, i.e. general happiness or life satisfaction [13, 14], relative <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> [15, 16].|$|R

5|$|The Combine are {{frequently}} shown as harsh rulers over {{the citizens of}} Earth, suppressing dissent with brutality, policing using violence and using invasive surgery to transform humans into either soldiers or slaves. Throughout the games, the player primarily battles with transformed humans as well as synthetic and mechanical enemies that {{are the product of}} Combine technology. The atmosphere generated by the dystopian Combine state has been praised by reviewers, although the artificial intelligence of the transhuman Combine characters was thought to be inferior <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> characters in Half-Life 2. In addition to their role within the Half-Life series, the Combine have been adapted for machinima productions and one Combine character type has been made into plush toys by Valve.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of Nigersaurus are grouped within the subfamily Nigersaurinae {{of the family}} Rebbachisauridae, {{which is part of}} the sauropod superfamily Diplodocoidea. Nigersaurus was probably a browser, and fed with its head close to the ground. The region of its brain that detected smell was underdeveloped, although its brain size was comparable <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> dinosaurs. There has been debate on whether its head was habitually held downwards, or horizontally like other sauropods. It lived in a riparian habitat, and its diet probably consisted of soft plants, such as ferns, horsetails, and angiosperms. It is one of the most common fossil vertebrates found in the area, and shared its habitat with other dinosaurian megaherbivores, as well as large theropods and crocodylomorphs.|$|E
5|$|The {{external}} {{anatomy of}} the soft parts of this species is similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> strombid snails. The animal has an elongate snout, thin eyestalks with well-developed eyes and sensory tentacles, and a narrow, strong foot with a sickle-shaped operculum. A molecular analysis conducted in 2006 based on DNA sequences of histone and mitochondrial genes demonstrated that Laevistrombus canarium, Doxander vittatus and Labiostrombus epidromis are closely related species. The dog conch exhibits behaviours common among Strombidae, including burrowing and a characteristic leaping form of locomotion. The former behaviour, however, involves movement sequences unique to this species.|$|E

40|$|Protein {{breakdown}} of 5 to 7 % per hr {{was found in}} nitrogen-starved cells of an unclassified prototrophic thermophilic bacillus; a similar protein-breakdown rate (6. 5 % per hr) was found in resting cells of Escherichia coli. In the thermophile, the rate of protein breakdown was markedly influenced by the temperature; it was maximal between 45 and 55 C, and it decreased considerably at 35 and 75 C, temperatures which are only slightly below or above the minimal and maximal growth temperatures. Growing cultures of the thermophile showed little, if any, protein breakdown, a finding similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> with E. coli...|$|R
25|$|Males may {{quite easily}} {{underestimate}} {{the size of}} their own penis relative <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> because <b>of</b> the foreshortening obtained from looking down, due to repeated observation of atypical penises in pornography, or because of the accumulation of fat {{at the base of the}} penis. A survey by sexologists showed that many men who believed that their penis was of inadequate size had average-sized penises. Another study found sex education of standard penile measurements to be helpful and relieving for patients concerned about small penis size, most of whom had incorrect beliefs of what is considered medically normal. The perception of having a large penis is linked to higher self-esteem.|$|R
5|$|The {{queen conch}} is herbivorous {{and lives in}} {{seagrass}} beds, although its exact habitat varies by development stage. The adult animal has a very large, solid and heavy shell, with knob-like spines on the shoulder, a flared thick, outer lip and a characteristic pink-coloured aperture (opening). The flared lip is absent in younger specimens. The external anatomy of the soft parts of L.gigas is similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> snails in its family; it has a long snout, two eyestalks with well-developed eyes, additional sensory tentacles, a strong foot and a corneous, sickle-shaped operculum.|$|E

Compared to Townsend's pocket gopher, which is distributed across a much larger area, but less diverse habitat, it is more genetically heterogeneous. Although there is considerable differentiation between separate populations of camas pocket gophers, their genetic variability {{does not affect the}} mammal's appearance. Study of the effects of genetic change over time revealed a pattern affected by a cataclysmic event across the species' entire geographic area about 13,000 years ago. Such an event would cause a population bottleneck, leading to scattered, isolated populations.|$|E
