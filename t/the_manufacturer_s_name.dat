The characteristic values (emission values) determined by manufacturers in laboratory conditions may deviate from the exposure values measured at source at the workplace. Equally, deviations may arise {{as a result of the}} delay in the changeover of test methods from the single axis of measurement to the total vibration value for the three axes of measurement conforming to ISO 20643. To prevent faulty estimates, <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> <b>s</b> information has to be corrected by a tool-related factor in accordance with CEN/TR 15350.

For this purpose, cobra probe was used in two experiments that were done in the Fluid Mechanics building at NTNU. First experiment was done for the fully developed pipe flow to test out cobra probe and estimate the errors. Measuring instruments cobra probe and pitot probe were used in this experiment. The obtained results for the mean flow velocity were compared. Also, results of turbulence intensity and Reynolds stress from the previous studies were used as a reference in cobra s probe performance analyses. This experiment was used as an initial test for better comprehension of a cobra probe s performance in complex flows with increased free stream turbulence levels. The main goal was to test out cobra probe for such flows, so that the second experiment took place in the recirculating wind tunnel with a grid placed at the entrance of its test section. The measurements were done simultaneously by cobra probe and LDV that were set 12 diameters downstream the wind turbine model.

40|$|Electronic systems {{designed}} for use in space exploration systems {{are expected to be}} exposed to harsh temperatures. For example, operation at cryogenic temperatures is anticipated in space missions such as polar craters of the moon (- 223 C), James Webb Space Telescope (- 236 C), Mars (- 140 C), Europa (- 223 C), Titan (- 178 C), and other deep space probes away from the sun. Similarly, rovers and landers on the lunar surface, and deep space probes intended for the exploration of Venus are expected to encounter high temperature extremes. Electronics capable of operation under extreme temperatures would not only meet the requirements of future spacebased systems, but would also contribute to enhancing efficiency and improving reliability of these systems through the elimination of the thermal control elements that present electronics need for proper operation under the harsh environment of space. In this work, the performance of a micropower, high accuracy voltage reference was evaluated over a wide temperature range. The Analog Devices ADR 3430 chip uses a patented voltage reference architecture to achieve high accuracy, low temperature coefficient, and low noise in a CMOS process [1]. The device combines two voltages of opposite temperature coefficients to create an output voltage that is almost independent of ambient temperature. It is rated for the industrial temperature range of - 40 C to + 125 C, and is ideal for use in low power precision data acquisition systems and in battery-powered devices.

In addition, they contribute to reducing system size and weight, simplifying its design, and reducing development cost through the elimination of otherwise required thermal control elements for proper ambient operation. A large DC voltage gain (100 dB) operational amplifier with a maximum junction temperature of 150 C was recently introduced by STMicroelectronics [1].

40|$|Electronics {{capable of}} {{operation}} under extreme temperatures are required {{in many of}} NASA space exploration missions. Aerospace and military applications, {{as well as some}} terrestrial industries constitute environments where electronic systems are anticipated to be exposed to extreme temperatures and wide-range thermal swings. Electronics that are able to withstand and operate efficiently in such harsh environments would simplify, if not eliminate, traditional thermal control elements and their associated structures for proper ambient operation. As a result, overall system mass would be reduced, design would be simplified, and reliability would be improved. Electronic parts that are built utilizing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology are known to offer better radiation-tolerance compared to their conventional silicon counterparts, provide faster switching, and consume less power. They also exhibit reduced leakage current and, thus, they are often tailored for high temperature operation. These attributes make SOI-based devices suitable for use in harsh environments where extreme temperatures and wide thermal swings are anticipated. A new operational amplifier, based on silicon-on-insulator technology and geared for high temperature well-logging applications, was recently introduced by Honeywell Corporation. This HTOP- 01 dual precision operational amplifier is a low power device, operates on a single supply, and has an internal oscillator and an external clocking option [1].

40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a microinfiltração da {{interface}} pilar/implante de implantes hexágono externo (HE) com diferentes torques. Para isso, foram utilizados nove implantes HE torque externo, pilar cônico e seu respectivo parafuso, selecionados aleatoriamente e divididos em três grupos. Utilizados em duas fases do experimento. Uma suspenção bacteriana de Escherichia coli à densidade padrão de 0, 5 McFarland foi preparada e inoculada nas partes internas dos implantes sendo esses acompanhados a cada 24 horas durante 14 dias. Ao final deste período, a viabilidade bacteriana foi verificada por teste microbiológico. Na primeira fase do experimento os grupos foram divididos em V 0, 5 : composto por implantes inoculados com volume de 0, 5 &# 956;L; V 1, 0 : implantes inoculados com 1, 0 &# 956;L e V 1, 5 : implantes inoculados com 1, 5 &# 956;L. Tendo seus pilares apertados com torque recomendado pelo fabricante. Na segunda fase, o experimento foi repetido três vezes para verificação de reprodutibilidade. Os conjuntos foram divididos em grupos com diferentes torques: T 10 : pilares apertados com torque de 10 Ncm; T 20 : apertados com 20 Ncm e T 32 : apertados com 32 Ncm. Na primeira fase V 1, 0 e V 1, 5 apresentaram todas as amostras com turbidez dos tubos de controle de extravazamento nas primeiras 24 horas. Na segunda fase três amostras apresentaram resultados positivos para microinfiltração, sendo duas do T 10 e uma do T 20 durante período 14 dias. Após este período todas as amostras apresentaram viabilidade da suspensão inoculada. Dentro das limitações deste estudo, pode-se concluir que o torque influenciou na microinfiltração bacteriológica de implantes HE e que a padronização da metodologia apresentou minimização de falhas relacionadas ao operador. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the microleakage of abutment/implant interface (A/I) in external hexagon implants (HE) with different torques values. Nine HE implants extern torque with conical abutments and screws were randomly selected and divided into three groups: V 0. 5, V 1. 0 and V 1. 5 and used in two experimental steps. A Escherichia coli bacterial suspension (BS) was prepared to the density of 0, 5 McFarland standard and inoculated in the inner parts of the implants. The clarity of the broth was observed each 24 hours during 14 days, and after this period, the bacterial viability was checked by a microbiological test. In the first step, implants were inoculated as follows: V 0. 5 - with 0. 5 &# 956;L of BS; V 1. 0 - with 1. 0 &# 956;L of BS; and V 1. 5 - with 1. 5 &# 956;L of BS. Then the abutments were wrench following <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> <b>s</b> recommended torque values. In the second step, the experiment design was repeated three times for checking the reproducibility and the assemblies were divided into three groups with different torques values: T 10 - abutments wrench with 10 Ncm; T 20 - wrench with 20 Ncm and T 32 - wrench with 32 Ncm. The results showed that in the first step all the samples of V 1. 0 and V 1. 5 groups presented cloudy broth on the control tubes in the first 24 hours. In the second step, three samples presented positive results for bacterial leakage during the period of 14 days, which two were from the T 10 group and one from the T 20 group. After this period all the samples presented viability for the bacterial test. Within the limitations of this study, it was concluded that the torque value influenced the HE implants bacterial microleakage and that the standardization of the test methodology offered lower operator variables...|$|R
