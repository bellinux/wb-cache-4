5|$|After Fielding {{returned}} {{to working with}} the Royal Theatre, Drury Lane, he wrote The Lottery, which first ran on 1 January 1732 alongside Addison's Cato. The play was successful and was performed 15 times during January. He altered the play in February, and the revised form ran for 14 more nights during that season and was put on each year until 1740 and occasionally thereafter until 1783. The story deals with Chloe's desire to play the lottery and pokes fun at the London lottery system and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>support</b> it.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the pay-per-view, Punk {{cashed in}} his Money in the Bank {{contract}} to defeat Jeff Hardy for the World Heavyweight Championship. Punk retained his title in a Triple Threat match against both Edge and Hardy eight days later on the June 15 episode of Raw. At The Bash, Punk lost to Hardy by disqualification after kicking the referee; in the storyline Punk injured his eye and said that he could not see the referee. Because titles do not change hands on a disqualification, Punk retained the championship. Hardy called Punk's eye injury into question, believing it to be feigned. Punk turned heel, claiming to be the moral superior of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>support</b> Hardy due to his drug-free lifestyle. At Night of Champions, Punk lost the championship to Hardy. Their feud continued through SummerSlam, where Punk regained the title in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match; afterward, Punk was attacked by The Undertaker. On the August 28 episode of SmackDown, Punk concluded his program with Hardy and achieved his booked goal of excising him from WWE, defeating Hardy in a steel cage match wherein the loser agreed to leave the company.|$|E

25|$|The ACNA has {{attempted}} to incorporate {{the full spectrum of}} conservative Anglicanism within Canada and the United States. As a result, it accommodates Anglo-Catholic, charismatic, and evangelical theological orientations. It also includes those who oppose and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>support</b> women's ordination. Women can serve as clergy members in some dioceses, while other dioceses maintain an exclusively male clergy. Women are ineligible to serve as bishops. The ACNA defines Christian marriage exclusively as a lifelong union {{between a man and a}} woman and consequently condemns homosexual relationships, as well as extra-marital relations, that are non-celibate as sinful. The church holds a pro-life position on abortion and euthanasia.|$|E
25|$|Another {{prominent}} {{response is}} called universal composition (UC). UC says that {{so long as}} the Xs do not spatially overlap, the Xs can compose a complex object. Universal compositionalists are also considered <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>support</b> unrestricted composition. More formally: Necessarily, for any non-overlapping Xs, there is a Y such that Y is composed of the Xs. For example, someone's left thumb, the top half of another person's right shoe, and a quark in the center of their galaxy can compose a complex object according to universal composition. Likewise, this theory also has some issues, most of them dealing with our experiences that these randomly chosen parts make up a complex whole and there are far too many objects posited in our ontology.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{census data}} show that goal has not been reached as {{successfully}} as hoped. After almost 30 years of enforcement of the Charter of the French Language, approximately 49% of allophone immigrants – including those who arrived before the Charter's adoption in 1977 – had assimilated to English, down from 71% in 1971, but still considerably more than anglophones' overall share of the province's population. This leads some Quebecers, particularly <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>support</b> the continued role of French as the province's common public language, to question whether the policy is being implemented successfully. The phenomenon {{is linked to the}} linguistic environments which cohabit Montreal – Quebec's largest city, Canada's second-largest metropolitan area, and home to a number of communities, neighbourhoods, and even municipalities in which English is the de facto common language. The anglophone minority's capacity to assimilate allophones and even francophones has therefore compensated to a large extent for the outmigration of anglophones to other provinces and even to the United States.|$|E

500|$|Martín de Álzaga {{organized}} a mutiny on January 1, 1809, and Moreno joined it. Álzaga aspired to replace Viceroy Santiago de Liniers {{with a government}} Junta, after learning of the capture of the Spanish King Ferdinand VII during the Peninsular War {{and the creation of}} the Junta of Seville. If it prevailed, Mariano Moreno would {{have been part of the}} new Junta. The mutiny was defeated by the swift reaction of Cornelio Saavedra, in command of the Regiment of Patricians, who dispersed the crowd and persuaded Liniers not to abdicate. It is disputed by historians whenever the mutiny had similar or opposite goals to those of the May Revolution that would take place a year later. The historians who support the latter perspective try to make attempts to excuse or justify Moreno's involvement; <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>support</b> the former consider instead that Moreno was a revolutionary a year before most other Argentines.
