5|$|During Ceolnoth's archbishopric, monastic life {{declined}} under <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> the Viking attacks, {{and there}} was a noticeable decline in the quality of the books and other works produced by the scriptoriums. A number of monasteries died out under <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> the raids by the invaders, who wintered over in Kent in 851 and 855. He held councils in 839 and 845, the second at London. During his later years in office, he was assisted by four clerics, who appear to have been or acted as archdeacons, one of the earliest appearances of this office in England. Ceolnoth is also known to have corresponded with Pope Leo IV.|$|E
5|$|Abra {{arrived back}} in Holby {{towards the end}} of series 8, {{immediately}} becoming embroiled in an illegal porcine kidney transplantation on renal patient Pete Golding. When Ric discovered what he had done, the deception strained their friendship, and Abra came close to losing his job. Eventually, Ric decided <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> covering up their misdoing was too great to bear, and after making up with Abra, departed once more for Africa on sabbatical.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{asteroid}} bodies, {{the asteroid belt}} also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the Poynting–Robertson effect, <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of {{blindness}} is Canine glaucoma. This {{is an increase in}} <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> the fluid in the eye which, if left untreated, can cause visual impairment and eventual loss of sight. The condition can be inherited (Primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and treatment may include surgery to remove the cataract.|$|E
5|$|Contaminated {{breathing}} gas {{at depth}} can be fatal. Concentrations which are acceptable {{at the surface}} ambient pressure will be increased by <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> depth and may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits. Common contaminants are: carbon monoxide - a by-product of combustion, carbon dioxide - a product of metabolism, and oil and lubricants from the compressor.|$|E
5|$|Erica Hahn, M.D. is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) medical drama television series Grey's Anatomy, portrayed by actress Brooke Smith.

Prior to assuming the role, Smith observed heart surgery being performed, and admitted to finding stressful <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> continually portraying a medical professional realistically.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, Kennedy's 12-year-old son Edward Kennedy, Jr., was {{diagnosed}} with bone cancer; his leg was amputated and he underwent a long, difficult, experimental two-year drug treatment. The case brought international attention both among doctors and in the general media, as did the young Kennedy's return to the ski slopes half a year later. Son Patrick was suffering from severe asthma attacks. <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> the situation mounted on Joan Kennedy, who several times entered facilities for alcoholism and emotional strain and was arrested for drunk driving after a traffic accident.|$|E
5|$|In February 1937, Agnew entered Johns Hopkins University as a {{chemistry}} major. After {{the first few}} months he found <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> the academic work increasingly stressful, and was distracted by the family's continuing financial problems and worries about the international situation, in which war seemed likely. In 1939 he decided that his future lay in law rather than chemistry, left Johns Hopkins and began night classes at the University of Baltimore School of Law. To support himself, he took a day job as an insurance clerk with the Maryland Casualty Company.|$|E
5|$|In ambient {{pressure}} diving, the diver is directly exposed to <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> the surrounding water. The {{ambient pressure}} diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique {{reduces the risk}} of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E

5|$|Neptune's bow shock, {{where the}} {{magnetosphere}} begins {{to slow the}} solar wind, occurs {{at a distance of}} 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The magnetopause, where <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind, lies at a distance of 23–26.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and likely much farther.|$|E

5|$|The Austrian and French armies {{met again}} at Schliengen on 24 October. Moreau had arrayed his force in a semi-circle on the heights, {{offering}} him a tactically superior position. Charles threw his army against both flanks; the French left flank fought stubbornly, but gave way under <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> Condé's emigre corps; the right flank withstood a day-long battering by Latour and Nauendorf, but eventually had to withdraw.

5|$|The Courtyard Cafe and The Fountain {{located within}} the Library also became an institution, well-patronised by library users, office workers and the local arts {{community}} from The Substation. As such, many fond memories were created for those who visited the compounds of the Library. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> urban redevelopment in the city was building up, resulting in demolishing of old city fabric that would threaten the Library building's fate and its sentimental memories in the ensuing years.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} formulae for {{the energy}} and momentum of electromagnetic radiation can be re-expressed in terms of photon events. For example, <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> electromagnetic radiation on an object derives from the transfer of photon momentum per unit time and unit area to that object, since pressure is force per unit area and force is the change in momentum per unit time.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>of</b> the {{separation}} and constant press attention {{began to take}} its toll of Carey. Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's previous output. The breaking point came after a heated argument during a long recording session, over the album's musical direction. Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions. However, Carey denied the allegations, stating she had only slept with her husband.|$|E
