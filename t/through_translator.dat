5|$|Three {{days after}} Japan's formal {{surrender}} in Tokyo Bay, Hashimoto {{was promoted to}} his final rank of commander. On 20 November, he was given command of the destroyer Yukikaze, among the few Imperial Navy ships to survive the war, and assigned to repatriation duties, returning troops to Japan from overseas. Before Hashimoto could begin his new duties, however, he was summoned by the United States military to be a {{witness for the prosecution}} in the court-martial against Indianapolis commander Captain Charles B. McVay III, who was on trial on charges of negligence leading to the ship's sinking. On 9 December 1945 he was transported from Tokyo to Oakland, California aboard an aircraft of the Naval Air Transport Service. Hashimoto was assured he would be treated as a naval officer instead of a prisoner of war or war criminal, but he remained under guard during his time in the United States and was not allowed to leave his hotel, as his appearance had been front page news that day in the New York Times and in other newspapers. The next day he arrived in Washington, D.C. where hearings were taking place. For the duration of his time in the United States, he spoke <b>through</b> <b>translator</b> Francis Earl Eastlake from the Office of Naval Intelligence.|$|E

5000|$|Ubese is a {{language}} heard in Return of the Jedi during {{a scene where}} a disguised Princess Leia bargains with Jabba the Hutt <b>through</b> <b>translator</b> C-3PO. Leia repeats the same Ubese phrase three times, translated differently in subtitles and by C-3PO each time. David J. Peterson, linguist and creator of constructed languages, cited his attempt as a young fan to reconcile this apparent impossibility {{as an example of}} how even casual fans may notice errors in fictional constructed languages. He characterized Ubese as a [...] "sketch" [...] of {{a language}} rather than a fully developed language and categorized it as a [...] "fake language" [...] intended to [...] "give the impression of a real language in some context without actually being a real language". Ultimately, he criticized Ubese as [...] "poorly constructed and not worthy of serious consideration".|$|E

5000|$|During a Twitch livestream of {{the game}} for the release {{of the game}}, Inafune, <b>through</b> <b>translator</b> Ben Judd stated [...] "You know, I want to word this in a way to explain {{some of the issues that}} come with trying to make a game of this size on {{multiple}} platforms." [...] adding [...] "I'm kind of loath to say this because it's going to sound like an excuse and I don't want to make any excuses. I own all the problems that came with this game and if you want to hurl insults at me, it's totally my fault. I'm the key creator. I will own that responsibility." [...] Ben Judd added his own thoughts, saying [...] "In this case, it was do the base game and do all the ports all at the same time. And it ended up being a huge amount of work, more than they actually estimated. Definitely, when they looked at the project, they were wrong about a lot of things. They underestimated how much work, time and money was going to be necessary. All of those things create a huge amount of pressure." [...] Later he said “But, again, we can hope that if things go well, there'll be sequels. Because I'll tell you what, I'm not getting my 2D side-scrolling fill. And at the end of the day, even if it's not perfect, it's better than nothing. At least, that's my opinion.” ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Colorectal {{cancer is}} the second most common cancer in Norway, with the {{incidence}} rate increasing for both men and women. Patients with colorectal cancer commonly experience metastases in the liver. In Norway, about 30 % of patients will have liver metastases at the time of diagnosis, and another 20 % will develop metastases during the course of their treatment. Because interventions aimed at curing or managing this disease may {{have a negative impact on}} patient health, measuring patient outcomes in the form of health-related quality-of-life is important to assess the relative benefits of these interventions to patients. Disease specific health-related quality-of-life measures have been found to be more sensitive to the health states of patients, however the disease specific measure used for assessing health-related quality-of-life in colorectal cancer patients with liver metastases has previously not been available in the Norwegian language. OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study seeks to explore the methods used in the translation and psychometric assessment of health-related quality-of-life instruments and preliminarily assess the quality of the Norwegian EORTC-QLQ-LMC 21 in terms of validity, reliability, responsiveness and equivalence with the English version. METHOD: This study is divided into two parts: (1) the qualitative translation process; and (2) the qualitative psychometric assessment of the resulting translated instrument. The EORTC-QLQ-LMC 21 was first translated from English into Norwegian according to the recommendations of the instrument's governing body. The process was documented and the quality of the translation qualitatively assessed <b>through</b> <b>translator</b> feedback, content validity exploration, and patient feedback and acceptance. The validity, reliability, responsiveness, and equivalence of the translated questionnaire were then quantitatively assessed using Pearson's Product Movement of Correlation, Cronbach's alpha, and floor and ceiling effects. RESULTS: The EORTC-QLQ-LMC 21 had good patient acceptance and performed fair to good on tests of validity, reliability, responsiveness and equivalence. The psychometric performance of the abdominal pain scale was poor due to one particular item, but there is nonetheless preliminary evidence for an acceptable level of quality and ability to meaningfully measure the health-related quality-of-life of this patient group...|$|E
