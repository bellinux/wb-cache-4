5|$|Curves {{that have}} self-crossings may reach {{singularities}} before contracting to a point. For instance, if a lemniscate (any smooth immersed curve {{with a single}} crossing, resembling a figure 8 or infinity symbol) has unequal areas in its two lobes, then eventually the smaller lobe will collapse to a point. However, if the two lobes have equal areas, then <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> equal throughout {{the evolution of the}} curve, and the isoperimetric ratio will diverge as the curve collapses to a singularity.|$|E
5|$|Despite Kabuto {{claiming}} that the technique is flawless, it does have several flaws, including that the reanimated can choose to leave their vessels to willingly drift back to the afterlife. Those who are paralyzed, sealed, or subjected to certain genjutsu, such as Komo Amatsukami: Koto, cannot take further action to free themselves until the technique is canceled. Also, the reanimated can sever their link to the jutsu so <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> among the living even after the jutsu is canceled, as shown by Madara Uchiha. Furthermore, if such a ninja who lost a body part while alive is brought back to true life with the Rinnegan's Samsara of Heavenly Life Jutsu, the living equivalent of that ninja's body part is absent.|$|E

5|$|Insoluble ionic {{compounds}} can be {{precipitated by}} mixing two solutions, {{one with the}} cation and one with the anion in it. Because all solutions are electrically neutral, the two solutions mixed must also contain counterions of the opposite charges. To ensure that these do not contaminate the precipitated ionic compound, {{it is important to}} ensure they do not also precipitate. If the two solutions have hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions as the counterions, they will react with one another in what is called an acid–base reaction or a neutralization reaction to form water. Alternately the counterions can be chosen to ensure that even when combined into a single solution <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> soluble as spectator ions.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{fighting}} demons, {{the protagonist}} can negotiate {{with them in}} a variety of ways: demons can be bribed, scared away, or recruited depending on responses given during conversation. After they are recruited, different demons can be fused together to create new demons. The new demon inherits skills from its parents, and some demons can only be obtained through fusion. The game includes 300 recruitable demons, all of which take inspiration from various world mythologies including Welsh, Egyptian, Norse, and Christian. Two main alignments govern the way demons must be approached: one that represents light, neutral and dark alignments; and one representing law, neutral and chaos alignments. The choices made in the story also effect how demons respond to player commands, and whether <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> loyal. As with earlier titles, a Moon Phase divided into eight segments dictates how demons will behave. When the Moon is full, demons will refuse to talk. Fused demons can be shared between players using thirty-two character passwords generated when a new demon is fused. These passwords can be traded between different players.|$|E

25|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) uses antigen-coated microtitre plates for the {{detection}} of ANAs. Each well of a microtitre plate is coated with either a single antigen or multiple antigens to detect specific antibodies or to screen for ANAs, respectively.

If antibodies that bind to antigen are present then <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> after washing. A secondary anti-human antibody conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase. The enzyme reaction will produce a change in colour of the solution that is proportional to the amount of antibody bound to the antigen.

A clinician must be familiar with the differences in order to evaluate the outcomes of the various assays.|$|E
