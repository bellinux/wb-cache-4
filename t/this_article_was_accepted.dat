Of main interest is its spectrum, which is distinctly different when the underlying Fréchet space Λ_ 0 (α) is nuclear as for the case when it is not. Actually, the nuclearity of Λ_ 0 (α) is characterized via certain properties of the spectrum of C. Moreover, C is always power bounded, uniformly mean ergodic and, whenever Λ_ 0 (α) is nuclear, also has the property that the range (I-C) ^m(Λ_ 0 (α)) is closed in Λ_ 0 (α), for each m∈N.

Ethnographic research involves {{the creation and}} ongoing renegotiations of relationships between researchers and informants. Prolonged engagement contributes to the complexity as relationships deepen and shift over time and participants accumulate a substantial reservoir of shared experiences. Reflections about the relationships we have co-constructed with informants in several research projects have contributed to our identification of several critical aspects of building and maintaining researcher–informant relationships in cross-cultural research. Aspects of relationship work specifically related to conducting ethnography with children, within the communities in which researchers live, and within the practice of occupational therapy are discussed...|$|E

In response to the continuously advancing concrete technology, a new prediction model for creep and shrinkage is presented. This model, named B 4, builds on the theoretically justified model B 3, which is a RILEM recommendation from 1996. Improvements to the model allow for enhanced multi-decade prediction, distinguish between the drying and autogenous shrinkage, and introduce new equations and parameters to capture the effects of various admixtures and aggregate types. The development and justification of the model is described in three companion articles which follow. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
