40|$|In multi - mode {{questionnaire}} design, usually some {{consideration is}} given to mode - specific measurement error. Despite this consideration, however, these measurement effects can be unexpectedly large. For this reason, {{there is a strong}} incentive to better predict mea surement effects. This may be done by constructing profiles of a questionnaire, in which relevant item characteristics are summarized. For all items of a survey, <b>these</b> <b>item</b> characteristics need to be coded and combined. In this paper, we evaluated a list o f item characteristics that literature has reported as relevant to mode - specific measurement error. Most importantly, we evaluated the reliability of the coding of such characteristics. Our results showed that intercoder reliability can be low for the most relevant characteristics. This may be explained by the difficulty of defining the item characteristics and the inherent subjectivity with which <b>these</b> <b>item</b> characteristics are coded. Finally, some sug gestions a re made for coping with low intercoder reliabi lity...|$|R

5|$|Although Amanda gains {{access to}} a revolver, a shotgun, a bolt gun, and a {{flamethrower}} {{over the course of}} the game, Alien: Isolation emphasizes evasion over direct combat by providing the player with limited ammunition. Fortunately, the player can also craft several items by collecting schematics and different kind of materials throughout the game. Items range from EMP mines to noisemakers, molotov cocktails and pipe bombs, among others. <b>These</b> <b>items</b> help the player deal with enemies and the alien. For example, the noisemaker can be used to attract enemies in one particular direction. The alien is afraid of fire, so using the flamethrower or a molotov cocktail will force it to retreat into the station's ventilation system. The player has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Nevertheless, the player can restore lost health using medkits, which can be crafted with materials in Amanda's inventory.|$|E

In 2002 and 2006, BK revamped its value menu by adding and removing several products such as chili and the Rodeo Cheeseburger.

5|$|At {{the end of}} each song, {{a result}} screen is {{displayed}} to player, and his or her performance is rated with a letter grade, a numerical score, and a percentage that represents his or her accuracy. The player is awarded a number of fans and in-game money for his or her performance. The number of fans determine the idols' ranking, and as the player's idols increase in ranking, more items become available for purchase. <b>These</b> <b>items</b> can then be used to customize the game's appearance or adjust gameplay elements, such as straightening the Melody Lines' shapes or causing the player to gain fans quicker.
