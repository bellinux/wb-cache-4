5|$|Rainfall reached 1inch (25mm) in {{portions}} of western Connecticut and Massachusetts. Strong surf from Isabel caused {{a man to}} drown after losing his footing along the beach near Narragansett, Rhode Island, and being swept out to sea. Officials in Connecticut contacted a water company in Watertown and a grocer in Cheshire for donations to assist the residents affected in North Carolina. A few days after Isabel moved ashore, the officials sent a tractor <b>trailer</b> <b>truck</b> with 2,000gallons (7570l) of water and 25,000pounds (11,340kg) of ice to North Carolina. In Vermont, the strong pressure gradient produced a peak wind gust of 55mph (89km/h) in Pleasant Valley, causing sporadic downed trees and power lines throughout the state. In Richmond, trees fell on and damaged threetrucks, and in Salisbury a falling tree damaged a car. Damage in the state totaled about $100,000 (2003USD, $117,000 in 2008USD). Rainfall reached 1inch (25mm) in various portions of New Hampshire and Maine.|$|E
500|$|In 1932, Hensley and {{his family}} moved to Pineville, Kentucky, after a {{religious}} layman, who had seen Hensley handle snakes in Chattanooga, entreated him to come to the area. He returned to ministry and built the Pineville Church of God. Hensley established the church himself and characterized it as a [...] "free Pentecostal" [...] church. He continued to move frequently, a practice which Thomas Burton of East Tennessee State University attributes to [...] "wanderlust". In July 1935, Irene gave birth to a child in Pennington Gap, Virginia, and a month later, they were living in St. Charles, Virginia, while Hensley performed snake-handling services in the area. He successfully drew crowds to his preaching. In Norton, Virginia, 500 people attended an event, although that service was thrown into disarray after a boy in the audience killed one of the snakes. In 1936, Hensley built a house {{on the back of a}} <b>trailer</b> <b>truck</b> and drove to Florida to hold revival services. By March 1936, he had reached Tampa, Florida, where he drew over 100 people to a snake-handling service. He traveled to Bartow, Florida, where over 700 people attended one of his tent meetings. He subsequently ministered in Bloomingdale, Florida, before traveling north to Barrow County, Georgia, in late April. During a service in Barrow, a young agricultural worker was bitten by a snake and became ill. Hensley spoke to reporters and claimed that the man was bitten because he was [...] "not quite ready for the demonstrations of the power". He predicted that the young man would miraculously recover, but the man died. This was the first death by snakebite to occur at one of Hensley's services. He conducted the man's funeral and left the area for fear of prosecution. His conduct was condemned by a local newspaper.|$|E

2500|$|On an April 1 show in 2008, both Dennis and Callahan {{during a}} top ten April fools prank list made mention to a prank done by Opie and Anthony that {{caused them to}} be fired from WAAF, a Boston radio station. [...] The [...] "prank" [...] which they {{referred}} to was done because Opie & Anthony hated radio April fools pranks and felt they are only done by hack radio jocks.

[...] At the time Opie & Anthony had taken over Howard Stern's syndicated terrestrial radio spot (which was heard in basically every major city in the US), and was also broadcasting at the same time on Satellite radio. This insulted Opie & Anthony, which caused them to play the Dennis & Callahan clip on their air. [...] This ended up bringing national attention to the Ryen Russillo voicemail situation and also caused WEEI to take very few callers during all their shows because of the massive volume of Opie & Anthony fans calling in for weeks to let the station know where Opie & Anthony currently worked. Callers would also complain about the comments and disrespect [...] Dennis and Callahan show for a national show and would pester on air talent by swearing or pranking them causing them to dump out of many calls.|$|E

Eventually, the <b>trailer</b> <b>truck</b> crashed through the separator, slashing open the semi-truck's fuel engine. The crash ignited a large fire, causing the driver of the semi-truck to lose all control of the vehicle. The truck crashed down a large hill and eventually landed in flames on the Interstate 95 running through Stonington, Connecticut. The fire was contained, but the entire truck was horribly charred, including the body of the driver. The body was unable to be identified through body or DNA identification, so officials resorted to using dental records. The driver, Robert Allen O'Bleness, was a native of Wichita, Kansas. He was 48 years old at the time of his death.In the Mashantucket concert, Underwood paid tribute to the lost employee by belting out a tearful version of her hit single [...] "Temporary Home", also stating that the song [...] "gives off a whole new meaning from its previous one." ...|$|E
