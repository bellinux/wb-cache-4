5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E

40|$|Object. In a {{randomized}} controlled trial comparing surgery and prolonged conservative treatment for sciatica of 6 - 12 weeks' duration, {{more than one-third}} of patients assigned to conservative treatment underwent surgery. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate whether MRI at baseline could have predicted this delayed surgery. Methods. Independently evaluated qualitative and quantitative MRI findings were compared between <b>those</b> patients <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo surgery during follow-up in the conservative care group. In addition, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess how well MRI parameters discriminated between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo delayed surgery (0. 5 - 0. 7 poor discrimination, ≥ 0. 7 acceptable discrimination). Results. Of 142 patients assigned to receive prolonged conservative care, 55 patients (39 %) received delayed surgery. Of the 55 surgically treated patients, 71 % had definite nerve root compression at baseline compared with 72 % of conservatively treated patients (p = 0. 76). Large disc herniations (size > 50 % of spinal canal) were nearly equally distributed between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo surgery (25 % vs 21 %, p = 0. 65). The size of the dural sac was smaller in the patients who underwent surgery (101. 2 vs 122. 9 mm 2, p = 0. 01). However, the size of the dural sac discriminated poorly between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo delayed surgery (area under ROC curve, 0. 62). Conclusions. In patients who suffered from sciatica of 6 - 12 weeks' duration, MRI at baseline did not distinguish between patients <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo delayed surgery.

5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the disease include not having sex or having few sexual {{partners}} and using condoms. Screening women at risk for chlamydial infection followed by treatment decreases the risk of PID. If the diagnosis is suspected, treatment is typically advised. Treating a woman's sexual partners should also occur. In those with mild or moderate symptoms a single injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone along with two weeks of doxycycline and possibly metronidazole by mouth is recommended. For <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not improve after three days or who have severe disease intravenous antibiotics should be used.|$|E

5|$|Not all gallstones {{implicated in}} {{ascending}} cholangitis actually originate from the gallbladder, but cholecystectomy (surgical {{removal of the}} gallbladder) is generally recommended in {{people who have been}} treated for cholangitis due to gallstone disease.

5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> domestic work.

Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E
