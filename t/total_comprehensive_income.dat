Methodology/methods: First we outline the principal theories of the statement of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income,</b> secondly we concentrate the research to obtain the empirical data. The research is developed in the following steps: selection of the companies surveyed; selection of the documents to be analysed; election of the empirical aspects to be studied.

40|$|Despite analysts' {{demands for}} (and {{standard}} setters' preferences for) a single statement of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income,</b> both the IASB and the FASB {{have not been}} able to achieve this objective. Proponents of a single statement presentation argue that <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> brings discipline to managers and analysts as it requires them to consider all factors affecting owners' wealth. Opponents argue that other <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> items are transitory in nature, including them with core business earnings increases the volatility and reduces the predictive power of earnings. Thus, this thesis examines the volatility, value relevance and predictive power of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> relative to net income. Motivated by the concerns that the volatility of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> leads to the perception of increased risk, this thesis investigates the volatility and risk relevance of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> for a sample of non-financial United States (US) and New Zealand (NZ) firms. The findings show that <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> is more volatile than net income. The findings also show that <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> volatility is associated with market-based measures of risk (volatility of stock returns and beta). However, the incremental volatility of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> (over net income) is not associated with market risk and is not priced. Prior literature documents mixed evidence on the pricing of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income.</b> The mixed results are attributed to the use of as if measures of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income,</b> which introduces measurement error. This thesis uses as reported data from US and NZ firms and shows that <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> is more value relevant compared to net income.

Specifically for unsophisticated users, who rely on financial reports to signal the importance and meaning of financial items, a concern exists that FVI might be overemphasised. This paper investigates this issue and formulates and tests two suggestions, intended to keep unsophisticated users from overemphasising FVI: 1) education about the irrelevance of FVI for valuation; and 2) a two-column matrix that does not display a separate column for <b>total</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income.</b> Participants were provided with the financial reports of two fictitious manufacturing companies, and performed valuation-relevant tasks: income prediction, risk assessment, and management evaluation.

We use two regression models to test value relevance of components of other comprehensive income. We have found some evidence that the share price statistically relates to such component of comprehensive income as the change of the fair value of cash flow hedges.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the materiality and volatility of comprehensive income for non financial firms in a non US environment. As the FASB and IASB are planning to require the reporting of comprehensive income in a single performance statement, it is important to resolve the issues surrounding the materiality and the volatility of comprehensive income. This study investigates the materiality of comprehensive income and its components in relation to <b>total</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> and closing equity for 37 non financial companies listed on the NZX from 2003 to 2008. Moreover, the cumulative impact of comprehensive income on equity over time is investigated. Further the volatility of comprehensive income is compared to the volatility of net income. This study also investigates the impact of the change to NZ IFRS on comprehensive income The results show that other comprehensive income is material in relation to <b>total</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income,</b> but not in relation to closing equity. Moreover, some components of comprehensive income have a cumulative effect over time on closing equity. Comprehensive income is more volatile than net income. However, these findings are due to asset revaluations, which is the most dominant component of other comprehensive income. Though, all components of comprehensive income are significant for some firm year observations. Further, the move to NZ IFRS affects the materiality of some components of other comprehensive income and reduces the volatility of comprehensive income compared to net income. This study provides evidence that other comprehensive income is material for non financial firms in a non US environment. This suggests that it should be displayed clearly in the financial statement in order to be taken into consideration by financial statement users. Further, this study provides evidence that the difference in volatility between comprehensive income and net income in New Zealand can be avoided by choosing the cost method when measuring assets after recognition...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to (a) analyze IFRS {{requirements}} for the recognition and presentation of non-controlling (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements in relation to theoretical concepts of consolidation of financial statements, and (b) assess the share and importance of non-controlling inter-ests in financial performance and the equity of the groups of companies in practice. For the purpose of the article, selected scientific methods have been used, including: descriptive and analytical ones (for analyzing the theoretical concepts and IFRS requirements), critical analysis, especial-ly used for the literature review, and for the assessment of practice: primary empirical research methods, and quantitative methods, including descriptive statistics, nonparametric tests and correlation analysis. The empirical material collected was used to verify several hypotheses related to non-controlling interests of the groups whose parents are registered in Poland and whose securities are traded on a regulated, Polish capital market (Warsaw Stock Exchange). The empirical evidence is that non-controlling interests represent a very small part of group’s equity (taking the mean of about 3. 5 %, but the median below 1 %) and obviously, they are significantly lower than the share of majority interests. Their deviation among the different classes of companies (big, small and banks) is negligible. Slightly higher is the share of minority interests in the group’s net profit and <b>total</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income.</b> However, no significant difference is to be found between the shares of non-controlling interests in the group’s equity, net profit and <b>total</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income.</b> Overall, shares of majority (minority) interests in a group’s income are in line with their shares in the group’s equity. The hypothesis on comparable returns on non-controlling and majority interests (in terms of ROE) cannot be rejected if both net profit and losses are considered. How-ever, if losses are skipped then there is evidence that non-controlling interests are more profitable than majority interests. Analysis of the impact of the number of subsidiaries in groups on non-controlling interests indicates the existence of such an effect only in relation to the equity (rather obvious but weak). No effect is observed for the impact on net profit for the entire sample...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to compare {{the utility of the}} net income (NI) and of the {{comprehensive}} income for the evaluation of financial performance of the company and to verify whether the <b>total</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> (TCI) is more value relevant than the net income especially in times of crisis (IAS 1, par. 5).

The obligation to present total CI in {{consolidated financial statements}} was imposed on listed companies operating in the European Union with the revision in 2007 of the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, starting from 2009. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explain the nature of CI and rules for its presentation in the light of the provisions of IAS 1 and its latest amendments (June 2011), and to analyze the way of presenting and the amounts of <b>total</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> and its components in consolidated financial statements for years 2009 – 2010, published by the largest companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.

40|$|Background: On 1 January 2009 {{amendments}} to IAS 1 concerning {{the presentation of}} <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> came into force. The amendments were one outcome of the IASB’s performance reporting project {{with the purpose of}} enhancing the usefulness of information presented in the income statement. It is now required to present certain items, referred to as other <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income,</b> in a statement of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> which can be either a single statement or two statements where net <b>income</b> and other <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> are presented separately. Research objectives: We examine whether the presentation of other <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> provides useful information. Additionally, we examine whether the one or two statement approach to <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> reporting is more appropriate in providing investors with information. These issues will be examined from the perspective of producers and users of financial statements respectively. Research design: The attitude of producers to <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> reporting is examined by means of an annual report study, a study of comment letters and an interview with one producer whereas the attitude of users is examined by means of a statistical association study. Limitations: The annual report study examines the time period 2008 – 2009 and is restricted to the Swedish market whereas the statistical study examines the time period 2006 – 2010 and focuses on European markets. Throughout the paper, ‘users’ refers to investors. Empirical findings: Our results suggest that producers do not consider other <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> relevant in evaluating firm performance but that users take it into account, although they regard net income as more value relevant. Accordingly, the IASB’s requirements regarding <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> reporting can be considered legitimate in terms of enhancing the usefulness of information available to investors. Our results indicate that other <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> contains useful information for evaluating firm performance, but that net income is much more value relevant. Hence, the two statement approach to <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> reporting may seem appropriate. Further research: Further research could clarify differences in attitudes to other <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> between producers and users. Additionally, it could examine whether the importance of other <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> has increased over time after the {{amendments to}} IAS 1 came into force.

40|$|Research in {{accounting}} {{has thus far}} attempted to provide fair and useful financial performance measures {{for a wide range}} of users.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the quality of <b>total</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> (TCI) relative to net income (NI), prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRS). Using a data set covering 2, 273 firms from 22 countries in Europe, Asia and Australia between 2006 and 2010, we provided evidence that net income always dominates comprehensive income as a valuation metric. The findings indicated that NI is more value relevant than TCI in predicting the future operating cash flows and income. In addition, NI is more persistent and timely, and explains the actual operating cash flows more precise than TCI. Accruals linked to NI have also better quality than those related to TCI. However, we found that TCI is less smoothing and more conservative than NI. These results do not support the claim that income measured on a comprehensive basis is a better measure of firm performance than NI. These results raise the questions about the usefulness of mandating TCI in IAS/IFRS regulation. Our findings, therefore, should be of interest to IASB, as they provide evidence of fewer quality of the TCI. Perhaps it is time for the IASB to reconsider other comprehensive income components and focus on items included in other comprehensive income to improve the quality of the TCI metric.

40|$|Purpose: Identification {{of methods}} for {{presenting}} {{the components of}} other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity in the reporting practices of public companies in Poland and Germany. Methodology: A study of domestic and foreign literature was conducted with analysis of annual reports of public companies. The study followed the method of induction and to analyse the results, the structure similarity index was used. Results: The {{results of the study}} supported conclusions that the companies under study had not  developed a uniform presentation of the components of comprehensive income in their statements of changes in equity. Five options of presenting the components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity were identified. Companies both from the WIG 30 and DAX  indices most frequently presented the statement of changes in equity in option 1, which consisted of presenting the <b>total</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> item in a row and detailed items of equity in columns in which capital gains and losses were recognized. The differentiated forms of presenting the components of comprehensive income made it difficult to compare financial statements. Scope of research: The survey examined the annual reports of the largest Polish and German public companies respectively from the WIG 30 and DAX indices. The components of other comprehensive income presented in the statements of changes in equity were the main subject of the study. Originality: Comparative studies on the presentation of the components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity by public companies in Poland and Germany have not yet been conducted. This was therefore the research gap addressed in this study. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{shift to}} International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) has {{affected}} the financial reporting of almost all countries around the world, including Indonesia. Seriously planned since 2007, IFRS convergence in Indonesia was predicted {{to be completed in}} 2012. The issuance of IFRS-based PSAK effective in January 1, 2011 has required the public companies to restate their financial statements for year 2010 which are provided as comparison balance in financial statements 2011, to comply with the converged PSAK. IFRS with its high-quality is believed to enhance the accounting information quality by minimizing the opportunity for earnings management. Thus, this convergence affects the level of conservatism in presenting the financial position and financial performance of the companies. Total equity is utilized as the proxy for financial position. Total profit (net income based on PSAK before IFRS convergence in 2011 and <b>total</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>income</b> based on IFRS converged PSAK) will be utilized as the proxy for financial performance. Changes in level of conservatism are able to trigger changes in key financial indicators as well. Two key financial indicators chosen in this research are gearing and current ratio. Gearing ratio is used to present the long-term view while current ratio is used to present the short-term view. In order to study the changes on those financial information, this research compares the financial data for year 2010 according to PSAK 2010 with the financial statment 2010 which were restated to comply with PSAK 2011 (presented in financial statments 2011).
