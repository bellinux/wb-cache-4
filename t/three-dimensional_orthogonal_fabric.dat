40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of finding <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orthogonal</b> drawings of maximum degree six graphs from the computational complexity perspective. We introduce a 3 SAT reduction framework {{that can be used}} to prove the NP-hardness of finding <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orthogonal</b> drawings with specific constraints. By using the framework we show that, given a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orthogonal</b> shape of a graph (a description of the sequence of axis-parallel segments of each edge), finding the coordinates for nodes and bends such that the drawing has no intersection is NP-complete. Conversely, we show that if node coordinates are fixed, finding a shape for the edges that is compatible with a non-intersecting drawing is a feasible problem, which becomes NP-complete if a maximum of two bends per edge is allowed. We comment on the impact of these results on the two open problems of determining whether a graph always admits a drawing with at most two bends per edge and of characterizing orthogonal shapes admitting an orthogonal drawing without intersections...|$|R

The repetitive unit cell models for the resin impregnated fiber tows and the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orthogonal</b> woven composites at the fabric microstructure level were established. In the micro/meso-repetitive unit cells model, a nonlinear viscoelastic relationship with switch rule is introduced to characterize the mechanical behavior of the resin for the loading/unloading conditions. The fiber/fiber tows are characterized with linear elastic models. And damage initiation and postdamage constitutive models are also included for matrix/fiber and matrix impregnated fiber tows in the finite element analysis. The fatigue model with the mechanical parameters transferred from micro-scale to meso-scale model is numerically simulated with user-defined material subroutine and incorporated into commercial finite element software ABAQUS/Standard. The calculated results manifest the multiscale fatigue behaviors of <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orthogonal</b> woven com-posites, such as the global stiffness degradation, decrease of peak stress, and even local damage behavior. The fatigue behaviors are also verified with the data in experimental and indicated that the model is an efficient strategy to predict the low-cyclic fatigue behaviors of polymer matrix composites...|$|R
