In the present study the relative CYP 3 A inhibiting potency and MI complex formation of a series of macrolide antibiotics and <b>tiamulin</b> were studied in microsomal fractions of goat and cattle and in a cell-line expressing bovine CYP 3 A. <b>Tiamulin</b> and triacetyloleandomycin (TAO) were found to be effective inhibitors of CYP 450 activity in all systems tested. Erythromycin and tilmicosin were found to be relatively less effective inhibitors of CYP 450 activity in microsomes, and their activity in the bovine CYP 3 A 4 expressing cell line was relatively weak. Tylosin was shown to be a weak inhibitor in microsomes and not in the cell line, whereas spiramycin had no effect at all. MI-complex formation measured by spectral analysis was seen with TAO, <b>tiamulin,</b> erythromycin and tylosin, but not with tilmicosin and spiramycin. Although additional factors play a role in vivo, these results may explain potential drug–drug interactions and differences betwee...|$|E
40|$|Colonisation {{of birds}} by Brachyspira pilosicoli {{can result in}} avian {{intestinal}} spyrochetosis (AIS). AIS is associated with weight loss, decrease egg production and animal death. This disease is an increased burden worldwide and results in important economic losses. <b>Tiamulin</b> TM, an antibiotic of the pleuromutilin family {{is the most common}} and efficient way to treat AIS. However, it is badly used in farm due to absence of indications regarding the dose to be used in chickens. Furthermore, B. pilosicoli is becoming increasingly resistant to treatments. This work focused on the NMR-based metabonomics evaluation of AIS by studying the pathogen, the host and their reaction to <b>Tiamulin</b> TM treatment. Work was divided up as follow: 1. B. pilosicoli metabolism in optimum growth condition and after <b>Tiamulin</b> TM treatment was determined by evaluating metabolic composition of the medium throughout 120 h growth using 1 H-NMR. <b>Tiamulin</b> appeared to be able to reduce B. pilosicoli growth by 1 log at 0. 008 and 0. 016 μg/ml. Highest concentrations inhibited bacterial growth. However, B. pilosicoli was still metabolically active up to the 0. 250 μg/ml dose. These results indicate that bacteria, even if not able to divide due to antibiotic treatment, remain alive explaining re-occurrence of the disease in farms post-antibiotic treatment. 2. Host metabolism was explored using 1 H-NMR techniques. Metabolic composition of twelve matrixes (liver, kidney, spleen, plasma, egg, breast muscle, cortex, ileum, caecum, colon and faeces) were characterised and grouped as a metabolic atlas {{to be used as a}} database for future avian research. 3. An animal trial evaluating the impact of <b>Tiamulin</b> TM treatment on infection and symptoms was conducted. This also allowed determination of the best dose to be used in farmyard applications. Infection was systemic and mainly associated to diarrhoea and decreased growth rate. All antibiotic doses were able to significantly reduce percentage of infected birds and infection spread in the organism while only the two highest doses re-established growth rate and increased egg production (previously unaffected by infection). Results indicate that 125 ppm of <b>tiamulin</b> was sufficient to efficiently treat chickens while avoiding associated economical loss. 4. Metabolic and caecal microbiota composition response to infection and antibiotic treatment were evaluated using tissues and biofluids sampled from the animal trial described in 3. Infection by B. pilosicoli was associated with dysbiosis and modification of energy metabolism characterised by lipolysis to maintain plasma glucose levels. <b>Tiamulin</b> treatment also induced dysbiosis. Even if treatment was able to cancel metabolic response to infection, <b>Tiamulin</b> TM strongly disturbed cholesterol metabolism in a dose dependent manner. Treatment induced a decrease of the HDL/VLDL ratio and made birds age faster than untreated ones. Steroid hormonal disturbance was explored as potential cause of the cholesterol metabolism perturbation. In conclusion, this work contributed significantly to increase B. pilosicoli induced AIS general understanding. It also enlightened metabolic mechanism responsible for symptom development and finally showed that antibiotics may strongly influence metabolism...|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} {{describes}} {{the isolation of}} a multiresistant strain of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae in April 2007 in a Dutch sow herd with recurrent diarrhoea. Examination of faecal samples taken from 7 -month-old breeding gilts with diarrhoea revealed the presence of resistance against <b>tiamulin,</b> lincomycin, tplosin, doxycycline, and tylvalosin (the active substance in Aivlosin (R)) in four of five samples. <b>Tiamulin</b> resistance has not {{been reported in the}} Netherlands before. The repeated use of <b>tiamulin</b> on the affected farm was assumed to be the main cause of the development of resistance to the drug. The farmer was advised to adopt a medication strategy and to implement management practices that would prevent an ongoing cycle of infection on the farm. It is important that the Dutch swine industry appreciates that tiamulin-resistant strains of B. hyodysenteriae may be found on other farms as well. The appropriate and prudent use of antibiotics is essential in order to prevent the development of resistance against the last option left to cure B. hyodysenteriae infections. valnemulin...|$|E
40|$|Avian {{intestinal}} spirochaetosis (AIS) {{caused by}} Brachyspira spp., and notably Brachyspira pilosicoli, {{is common in}} layer flocks and reportedly of increasing incidence in broilers and broiler breeders. Disease manifests as diar- rhoea, increased feed consumption, reduced growth rates and occasional mortality in broilers and these signs are shown in layers also associated with a delayed onset of lay, reduced egg weights, faecal staining of eggshells and non-productive ovaries. Treatment with Denagard® <b>Tiamulin</b> {{has been used to}} protect against B. pilosicoli colonisation, persistence and clinical presentation of AIS in commercial layers, but to date there has been no de- finitive study validating efficacy. Here, we used a poultry model of B. pilosicoli infection of layers to compare the impact of three doses of Denagard® <b>Tiamulin.</b> Four groups of thirty 17 week old commercial pre-lay birds were all challenged with B. pilosicoli strain B 2904 with three oral doses two days apart. All birds were colonised within 2 days after the final oral challenge and mild onset of clinical signs were observed thereafter. A fifth group that was unchallenged and untreated was also included for comparison as healthy birds. Five days after the final oral Brachypira challenge three groups were given Denagard® <b>Tiamulin</b> in drinking water made up following the manufacturer's recommendations with doses verified as 58. 7 ppm, 113 ppm and 225 ppm. Weight gain body condition and the level of diarrhoea of birds infected with B. pilosicoli were improved and shedding of the organism reduced significantly (p = 0. 001) following treatment with Denagard® <b>Tiamulin</b> irrespective of dose given. The level and duration of colonisation of organs of birds infected with B. pilosicoli was also reduced. Confirming previous findings we showed that the ileum, caeca, colon, and both liver and spleen were colonised and here we demonstrated that treatment with Denagard® <b>Tiamulin</b> resulted in significant reduction in the numbers of Brachyspira found in each of these sites and dramatic reduction in faecal shedding (p b 0. 001) to ap- proaching zero as assessed by culture of cloacal swabs. Although the number of eggs produced per bird and the level of eggshell staining appeared unaffected, egg weights of treated birds were greater than those of untreated birds for a period of approximately two weeks following treatment. These data conclusively demonstrate the ef- fectiveness of Denagard® <b>Tiamulin</b> in reducing B. pilosicoli infection in laying hens...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of some antimicrobials containing <b>tiamulin</b> and tilmicosin (as active principles) against Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) infection both in-vitro and in-vivo. For in-vitro investigation, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of <b>tiamulin</b> and tilmicosin against MG organism was done. However, the in-vivo evaluation of <b>tiamulin</b> and tilmicosin against field MG infection was carried out on a commercial broiler chicken farm taken from MG infected farm and proved to have such infection through bacteriological and serological examination at day old. Once the birds suffered from respiratory signs at 22 days of age, this flock was divided into three separate houses. Chickens in house (1) were kept as MG-infected without treatment; chickens in the house (2) were treated with <b>tiamulin</b> in the drinking water (1 gram/ 1. 5 liter) for 3 successive days and the birds in house (3) were also treated with tilmicosin in the drinking water (0. 3 ml/liter) for 3 successive days. Just after appearance of the first clinical signs and mortalities, the clinical signs score was recorded, the birds were weighed and the serum samples were collected for serological examination. The clinical signs and the mortalities in each house were recorded daily {{during and after the}} treatment course till {{the end of the study}} (42 days of age). The body weight of the birds in each house was determined weekly till 6 weeks of age. Twenty birds from each house were sacrificed weekly for recording the air-sac lesion score and for re-isolation of MG. The air-sac lesio...|$|E
