[...] "You wouldn't really {{call it an}} action film," [...] claims Pegg, [...] "because it was pre- the evolution {{of that kind of}} film. And yet it is kind of an action film in a way." [...] "It's very much his [...] kind of urban western", adds Wright, [...] "in the way it is staging Rio Bravo set up in downtown 70s LA... And <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> for a low-budget film particularly, it looks great." [...] In October 2011, artist Tyler Stout premiered his mondo-style poster of Assault. Stout's poster would later serve as the cover on the Region B Blu-ray of Assault.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2007, while {{speaking}} about issuing a draft, McCain said, [...] "One, it's the best military we've ever had, it just isn't big enough. Two, there's {{never been a}} draft that I've ever heard of since World War II that was fair. What we've done is we find rich people find a way out, and lower income people {{are the ones that}} serve. I might consider it, I don't think it's necessary, but I might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve. But it just doesn't happen. And <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that, because you know from here in Brauman, it takes intensive training with the equipment and the technical skills that now our people are required to engage in, that it makes it not conducive to a short term. Now they enlist for 4 years. We used to draft people almost for 2 years or even 18 months so it's much more difficult." ...|$|E

"That {{ought to}} come off all right," [...] {{reflected}} Hadden {{to himself as he}} plunged and floated in the waters of the stream, [...] "but somehow I don't quite trust our friend Maputa. It would have been better if I could have relied upon myself to get rid of Nahoon and his respected uncle--a couple of shots would do it in the water. But then that would be murder and murder is unpleasant; whereas <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> only the delivery to justice of two base deserters, a laudable action in a military country.

After this the sharpest kind of practice will be all that I shall seem to be fit for. It isn't the money. I can retire with enough for your wants and for mine.

5000|$|The band's tenth {{and final}} album, Happiness and All <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Things</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on August 31, 2009, commemorating the band's 15th Anniversary. It featured 12 new studio tracks and three live tracks. Recorded in California, this album includes a track entitled [...] "51 Pieces", which Canada penned with Mickey Braun. The song {{was based on}} an incident where Ohio State police ransacked the band's bus after a stop in Cleveland at the House of Blues. It also featured [...] "Blue Bonnets" [...] which is dedicated to Cody's oldest son Dierks. Happiness and All <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Things</b> <b>was</b> officially dedicated to the late Randall Locke (Willie Nelson's long-time stage manager) who suddenly died on May 6, 2009.

5000|$|Aristotle {{states that}} there are both primary and {{secondary}} substances. In Categories Aristotle argues that primary substances are ontologically based and if the primary substances did not exist then it would <b>be</b> impossible for <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to exist. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> regarded as <b>the</b> secondary substances (also known as accidents).

THIS, this glissade, would be damned scoundrelism. You know that, and I know that, though {{we might be}} put to it to find a reason why. It would be swindling. Drawing the pay of life and then not living. And besides--We're going to live, Ann Veronica! Oh, the things we'll do, the life we'll lead! There'll be trouble in it at times--you and I aren't going to run without friction. But we've got the brains to get over that, and tongues in our heads {{to talk to each}} other. We sha'n't hang up on any misunderstanding. Not us. And we're going to fight that old world down there. That old world that had shoved up that silly old hotel, {{and all the rest of}} it....

6000|$|... "Don't {{you know}} yet," [...] he said, [...] "that an idle and selfish class loves to see {{mischief}} being made, {{even if it}} is made at its own expense? Its own life being all a matter of pose and gesture, it is unable to realize the power and the danger of a real movement and of words that have no sham meaning. It is all fun and sentiment. It is sufficient, for instance, to point out the attitude of the old French aristocracy towards the philosophers whose words were preparing the Great Revolution. Even in England, where you have some common-sense, a demagogue has only to shout loud enough and long enough to find some backing in the very class he is shouting at. You, too, like to see mischief being made. The demagogue carries the amateurs of emotion with him. Amateurism in this, that, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a delightfully easy way of killing time, and feeding one's own vanity--the silly vanity of being abreast with the ideas of the day after to-morrow. Just as good and otherwise harmless people will join you in ecstasies over your collection without having the slightest notion in what its marvellousness really consists." ...|$|E
60|$|See {{the spirit}} that was among the {{primitive}} professors, that knowing and believing how much it concerned them, in the propagating of Christianity, to show forth love to one another, that so all might know them to be Christ's disciples, rather than there should be any complainings among them, they sold all they had. Oh how zealous were these to practise, and, with one shoulder, to do that that was upon their hearts for God! I might further add, how often have we agreed in our judgment? and hath it not been upon our hearts, that this and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> good {{to be done to}} enlighten the dark world, and to repair the breaches of churches, and to raise up those churches that now lie agasping, and among whom the soul of religion is expiring? But what do we more than talk of them? Do not most decline these things when they either call for their purses or their persons to help in this and such like works as these? Let us then, in what we know, unite, that we may put it in practice, remembering that, if we know these things, we shall be happy if we do them.|$|E

Then here, you see, there are two little things stuck into the handle. One is called tweezers, an' is of no earthly use that I know of except to pull the hairs out o' your nose, which no man in his senses ever wants to do; and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> I suppose, for borin' small holes in things--it's almost as useless. This thing on the back is for pickin' stones out of horses' hoofs--but I forgot you never saw horses or hoofs! Well, no matter; it's for pickin' things out of things, when--when you want to pick 'em out! But below this is an {{uncommon}} useful thing--a screw--a thing for drawin' corks out of bottles--there, again, I'm forgettin'. You never saw corks or bottles. Happy people-- as the people who don't drink spirits would call you--and, to say truth, I think they are right. Indeed, I've been one of them myself ever since I came to this region.

6000|$|Well, {{the charge}} is, that our press has but {{little of that}} old world quality, reverence. Let us be candidly {{grateful}} that it is so. With its limited reverence it at least reveres the things which this nation reveres, as a rule, and that is sufficient: what other people revere is fairly and properly matter of light importance to us. Our press does not reverence kings, it does not reverence so called nobilities, it does not reverence established ecclesiastical slaveries, it does not reverence laws which rob a younger son to fatten an elder one, it does not reverence any fraud or sham or infamy, howsoever old or rotten or holy, which sets one citizen above his neighbor by accident of birth: it does not reverence any law or custom, howsoever old or decayed or sacred, which shuts against the best man in the land {{the best place in}} the land and the divine right to prove property and go up and occupy it. In the sense of the poet Goethe--that meek idolater of provincial three carat royalty and nobility--our press is certainly bankrupt in the [...] "thrill of awe"--otherwise reverence; reverence for nickel plate and brummagem. Let us sincerely hope that this fact will remain a fact forever: for to my mind a discriminating irreverence is the creator and protector of human liberty--even as <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> the creator, nurse, and steadfast protector of all forms of human slavery, bodily and mental.|$|E
