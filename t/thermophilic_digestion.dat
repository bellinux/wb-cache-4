40|$|ABSTRACT. Start-up of <b>thermophilic</b> {{anaerobic}} <b>digestion</b> is {{a critical}} process {{due to lack of}} readily available inoculum. This paper reports on the use of turf, which is readily available as an inoculum, for start-up <b>thermophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion.</b> Results show that anaerobic process seeded with turf produced methane at 0. 3 L/L/day after four days of incubation at 55 ˚C. Furthermore, acetate degradation took place and indicates that acetoclastic methanogens were present. Possible origins of thermophilic methanogens present in turf were investigated. Results show evidence of methane production from the incubation with biomass from groundwater. This implies that groundwater used for irrigation {{would be one of the}} thermophilic methanogenic sources present in grass lawn.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} pH value, temperature, adding ratio of waste {{activated}} sludge (WAS) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) on WAS acidification in <b>thermophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> system were investigated by batch experiments.

Compared to the conditions of pH uncontrolled, the VFAs accumulation was retarded at acidic (pH 3. 0 and pH 5. 0), neutral (pH 7. 0) or strong alkaline pH values (pH 11. 0). Optimal temperature of <b>thermophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> on VFAs accumulation was shown to be 60 °C (VFAs content was 148 mg/L), better than lower temperature 50 °C (79 mg/L) or higher temperature 70 °C (75 mg/L).

5000|$|A {{batch system}} is the {{simplest}} form of digestion. Biomass {{is added to the}} reactor {{at the start of the}} process in a batch and is sealed for the duration of the process. Batch reactors suffer from odour issues that can be a severe problem when they are emptied. Typically biogas production will be formed with a normal distribution pattern over time. The operator can use this fact to determine when they believe the process of digestion of the organic matter has completed. As the batch digestion is simple and requires less equipment and lower levels of design work it is typically a cheaper form of digestion. In continuous digestion processes organic matter is constantly added (continuous complete mixed)or added in stages to the reactor (continuous plug flow; first in - first out). Here the end products are constantly or periodically removed, resulting in constant production of biogas. A single or multiple digesters in sequence may be used. Examples of this form of anaerobic digestion include continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs), low anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB), Expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) and Internal circulation reactors (IC).TemperatureThere are two conventional operational temperature levels for anaerobic digesters, which are determined by the species of methanogens in the digesters:• Mesophilic which takes place optimally around 30-38 °C or at ambient temperatures between 20-45 °C where mesophiles are the primary microorganisms present.• Thermophilic which takes place around 49-57 °C at elevated temperatures up to 70 °C where thermophiles are the primary microorganisms present. There are a greater number of species of mesophiles than thermophiles [...] These bacteria are also more tolerant to changes in environmental conditions than thermophiles. Mesophilic systems are therefore considered to be more stable than thermophilicdigestion systems.As mentioned above, <b>thermophilic</b> <b>digestion</b> systems are considered to be less stable, the energy input is higher, and more energy is removed from the organic matter. However, the increased temperatures facilitate faster reaction rates and hence faster gas yields. Operation at higher temperatures facilitates greater sterilization of the end digestate. In countries where legislation, such as the Animal By-Products Regulations in the European Union, requires end products to meet certain levels of reduction in the amount of bacteria in the output material, this may be a benefit.Certain processes shred the waste finely and use a short high temperature and pressure pre-treatment (pasteurization / hygienisation) stage that significantly enhances the gas output of the following standard mesophilic stage. The hygienisation process is also applied in order to reduce the pathogenic micro-organisms in the feedstock. Hygienisation / pasteurization may be achieved by using a Landia BioChop hygienisation unit or similar method of combined heat treatment and solids maceration.A drawback of operating at thermophilic temperatures is that more heat energy input is required to achieve the correct operational temperatures. This increase in energy may not be outweighed by the increase in the outputs of biogas from the systems. It is therefore important to consider an energy balance for these systems. There are three principal products of anaerobic digestion: biogas, digestate and water.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} effect of a low temperature pre-treatment (70 °C) on the efficiency of <b>thermophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> of primary and secondary waste sludge. Firstly, effect of sludge pre-treatment time (9, 24, 48 and 72 h) was evaluated by the increase in volatile dissolved solids (VDSs), volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and biogas production in thermophilic batch tests. Secondly, semi-continuous process performance was studied in a lab-scale reactor (5 L) working at 55 °C and 10 days solid retention time. The 70 °C pre-treatment showed an initial solubilization effect (increasing VDS by almost 10 times after 9 h), followed by a progressive generation of VFA (from 0 to nearly 5 g L⁻¹ after 72 h). Biogas production increased up to 30 % both in batch tests and in semi-continuous experiments.

40|$|In this study, a short {{pre-aeration}} {{step was}} investigated as pre-treatment for <b>thermophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> {{of the organic}} fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). It was found that pre-aeration of 48 h generated enough biological heat to increase the temperature of bulk OFMSW to 60 °C. This was sufficient self-heating of the bulk OFMSW for the start-up of <b>thermophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> {{without the need for}} an external heat source. Pre-aeration also reduced excess easily degradable organic compounds in OFMSW, which were the common cause of acidification during the start-up of the batch system. Careful consideration however must be taken to avoid over aeration as this consumes substrate, which would otherwise be available to methanogens to produce biogas. To accelerate methane production and volatile solids destruction, the anaerobic digestion in this study was operated as a wet process with the anaerobic liquid recycled through the OFMSW. Appropriate anaerobic liquid inoculum was found to be particularly beneficial. It provided high buffer capacity as well as suitable microbial inoculum. As a result, acidification during start-up was kept to a minimum. With volatile fatty acids (VFAs-acetate in particular) and H 2 accumulation typical of hydrolysis and fermentation of the easily degradable substrates during start-up, inoculum with high numbers of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was critical to not only maximise CH 4 production but also reduce H 2 partial pressure in the system to allow VFAs degradation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore how fast the {{thermophilic}} anaerobic microbial community could be established during the one-step startup of <b>thermophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> from a mesophilic digester. Stable <b>thermophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> was achieved within 20 days from a mesophilic digester treating sewage sludge by adopting the one-step startup strategy. The succession of archaeal and bacterial populations over a period of 60 days after the temperature increment was followed by using 454 -pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR. After the increase of temperature, thermophilic methanogenic community was established within 11 days, which was characterized by the fast colonization of Methanosarcina thermophila and two hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanothermobacter spp. and Methanoculleus spp.). At the same time, the bacterial community was dominated by Fervidobacterium, whose relative abundance rapidly increased from 0 to 28. 52 % in 18 days, followed by other potential thermophilic genera, such as Clostridium, Coprothemobacter, Anaerobaculum and EM 3.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Master thesis is to study two {{different}} ways of start-up in anaerobic digesters under thermophilic conditions. As awareness for energy supply is growing, municipal waste water treatment uses a common treatment to stabilize sewage sludge which is called, anaerobic digestion (AD). Anaerobic digestion can transform the organic matter to combustible biogas which contains 60 - 70 % methane. Biogas is usually {{referred to as a}} mixture of carbon dioxide (C 02) and methane gas (CH 4). The most common way to anaerobically treat sewage sludge at wastewater treatment plants in Sweden is on mesophilic conditions (30 - 40 ℃). Only 12 plants in the country treat sewage sludge in thermophilic conditions 50 - 60 ℃. Mesophilic digestion is considered as a more stable process but requires a longer hydraulic retention time to reach digestibility compared to <b>thermophilic</b> <b>digestion.</b> The higher temperature also enables a pathogenic destruction capacity which means that <b>thermophilic</b> <b>digestion</b> {{can be used as a}} sanitation method for sewage sludge...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{mesophilic}} {{anaerobic digestion}} {{for treatment of}} organic wastes is a growing biotechnology for sustainable energy supply. Ammonia inhibition {{is a major problem}} in anaerobic digestion mainly when digestion of nitrogen-rich substrates such as livestock wastes and manure occurs. This paper provides a summary of research conducted on ammonia inhibition of the anaerobic process. An experiment with mesophilic digestions of swine manure was conducted in single unit reactors, which were controlled under different ammonia concentrations by addition of NH 4 Cl in different amounts. From the experimental results, it was shown that NH 4 Cl could be an effective chemical agent for removing foam and scum in the digester. Methane production was decreased with the increasing NH 4 Cl addition until a collapse was observed between 11. 2 g NH 4 +-N/l and 13. 2 g NH 4 +-N/l. Contrary to the findings in <b>thermophilic</b> <b>digestion,</b> a dysfunction of acidogenesis was also observed since both gas and methane production was delayed with increasing NH 4 Cl addition. These findings suggest different ammonia inhibition principles in mesophilic and <b>thermophilic</b> <b>digestion.</b> It was further indicated that methanogenesis could produce a high percentage of methane although gas production was inhibited...|$|E

We therefore isolated coliphages from municipal wastewater sludge and from biosolid samples after <b>thermophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> to evaluate the susceptibility of specific groups to thermal inactivation. Similar numbers of F+ DNA and F+ RNA coliphages were found in untreated sludge, {{but the majority of}} isolates in digested biosolids were group I F+ RNA phages. Separate experiments on individual isolates at 53 °C confirmed the apparent heat resistance of group I F+ RNA coliphages as well as the susceptibility of group III F+ RNA coliphages. Although few F+ DNA coliphages were recovered from the treated biosolid samples, thermal inactivation experiments indicated heat resistance similar to that of group I F+ RNA phages. Hence, F+ DNA coliphage reductions during <b>thermophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> are probably related to mechanisms other than thermal inactivation.

Most of these compounds were found in thermophilic digester except propionic acid. The absence of propionic acid during <b>thermophilic</b> <b>digestion</b> of peel was supported by the following evidence: a) Microbial activity tests indicated the similarity of microbial populations in mesophilic and thermophilic digesters in their ability to utilize the different substrates as sole carbon source. Exceptionally, propionic acid utilizing bacteria was found only in mesophilic digester. b) In the presence of methanogenesis inhibitor using 2. 5 mM chloroform, 32 mM phenol, and 20 mM bromoethanesulfonate, acetic and propionic acids were accumulated in mesophilic digester. Only acetic acid was detected in thermophilic digester. c) By shifting operating temperature from 55 oC to 37 "C, the biochemical pathway changed in which propionic acid was one of the intermediates. No propionic acid was found during temperature shift from 37 oC to 55 oC. The results suggested that B-oxidation of butyric acid to acetic acid occurred in both mesophilic and <b>thermophilic</b> <b>digestion.</b> In addition, degradation of propionic acid was another route for acetic acid production at mesophilic temperature.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{reliable}} method is described which allows determination of virus inactivation rates during sludge treatment processes in situ. Bacteriophage f 2 was adsorbed onto an electropositive membrane filter {{which was then}} sandwiched between two polycarbonate membranes with pores smaller than the virus diameter. The resulting sandwich was fixed in an open filter holder, and several such devices were connected before being exposed in sludge-digesting tanks. The device described prevented uncontrolled virus escape, but allowed direct contact of the various inactivating or stabilizing substances present in the environment tested with the virus adsorbed to the carrier membrane. After exposure to an environment, the surviving fraction of virus was eluted from the inner filter and determined by plaque counting. By using polycarbonate membranes without pores for sandwiching, the influence of temperature alone on virus inactivation could be measured. Thermophilic fermentation at 60 degrees C and at 65 kPa pressure led to a bacteriophage f 2 titer reduction of 3. 5 log 10 units per h, whereas during <b>thermophilic</b> <b>digestion</b> at 54. 5 degrees C titers decreased 1. 2 log 10 units per h.

The k' values measured were 0. 314 log 10 unit/day for rotavirus, 0. 475 log 10 unit/day for coxsackievirus B 5, and 0. 944 log 10 unit/day for parvovirus. However, anaerobic <b>thermophilic</b> <b>digestion</b> at 54 to 56 degrees C led to rapid inactivation of rotavirus (k' greater than 8. 5 log 10 units/h) and of coxsackievirus B 5 (k' greater than 0. 93 log 10 unit/min). Similarly, aerobic thermophilic fermentation at 60 to 61 degrees C rapidly inactivated rotavirus (k' = 0. 75 log 10 unit/min) and coxsackievirus B 5 (k' greater than 1. 67 log 10 units/min). Infectivity of parvovirus, however, was only reduced by 0. 213 log 10 unit/h during anaerobic <b>thermophilic</b> <b>digestion</b> and by 0. 353 log 10 unit/h during aerobic thermophilic fermentation. Furthermore, pasteurization at 70 degrees C for 30 min inactivated the parvovirus by 0. 72 log 10 unit/ 30 min. In all experiments the contribution of temperature to the total inactivation was determined separately and {{was found to be}} predominant at process temperatures above 54 degrees C. In conclusion, the most favorable treatment to render sludge hygienically safe from the virological point of view would be a thermal treatment (60 degrees C) to inactivate thermolabile viruses, followed by an anaerobic mesophilic digestion to eliminate thermostable viruses that are more sensitive to chemical and microbial inactivations...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} treatment {{process for}} screened cow manure waste, {{particularly for the}} degradation of natural steroid hormones, was developed. The first step in this process was a draw-and-fill process for <b>thermophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion.</b> After fourfold dilution with tap water, continuous feeding was performed for the aerobic treatment of the effluent from the anaerobic treatment. Batchwise ozone oxidation was then carried out for the degradation of the natural steroid hor-mones that remained in the effluent from the aerobic treatment. A yeast two-hybrid assay was performed to evaluate hormonal degradation. Significant reductions in the concentrations of tota...|$|R
5|$|Biogas, or {{landfill}} gas, is a biofuel produced {{through the}} intermediary stage of anaerobic digestion consisting mainly of 45–90% biologically produced methane and carbon dioxide. In early 2007 a <b>thermophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> facility was commissioned in Stornoway in the Western Isles. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Renewable Energy Association are also {{leading the way}} towards {{the establishment of a}} digestate standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land. Anaerobic digestion and mechanical biological treatment facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, <b>thermophilic</b> {{anaerobic}} <b>digestion</b> of wheat straw stillage was investigated. Methane potential of stillage was determined in batch experiments at two different substrate concentrations. Results showed that higher methane yields of 324 Â ml/g-(volatile solids) VSadded were obtained at stillage concentrations of 12. 8 Â g-VS/L than at 25. 6 Â g-VS/l. Continuous anaerobic digestion of stillage {{was performed in}} an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor at 55 Â Â°C with 2 Â days hydraulic retention time. Results showed that both substrate concentration and organic loading rate (OLR) influenced process performance and methane yields. Maximum methane yield of 155 Â ml CH 4 /g-COD was obtained at stillage mixtures with water of 25 % (v/v) in the feed and at an OLR of 17. 1 Â g-COD/(l. d). Soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) removal at this OLR was 76 % (w/w). Increase in OLR to 41. 2 Â g-COD/(l. d) and/or stillage concentration in the feed to 33 - 50 % (v/v) resulted in low methane yields or complete process failure. The results showed that <b>thermophilic</b> anaerobic <b>digestion</b> of wheat straw stillage alone for methane production is feasible in UASB reactor at an OLR of 17. 1 Â g-COD/(l. d) and at substrate concentration of 25 % in the feed. The produced methane could improve the process energy and economics of a bioethanol plant and also enable to utilize the stillage in a sustainable manner.
