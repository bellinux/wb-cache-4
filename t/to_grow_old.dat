5|$|A {{recurring}} theme in these myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to maintain maat {{against the forces of}} disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>old</b> during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, the primordial chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos.|$|E

500|$|Iðunn is {{introduced}} in the Prose Edda in section 26 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning. Here, Iðunn is described as Bragi's wife and keeper of an eski (a wooden box made of ash wood and often used for carrying personal possessions) within which she keeps apples. The apples are bitten into by the gods when they begin <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>old</b> and they then become young again, which is described as occurring up until Ragnarök. Gangleri (described as King Gylfi in disguise) states {{that it seems to}} him that the gods depend greatly upon Iðunn's good faith and care. With a laugh, High responds that misfortune once came close, that he could tell Gangleri about it, but first he must hear the names of more of the Æsir, and he continues providing information about gods.|$|E
500|$|The Prose Edda relates that Loki {{was once}} {{forced by the}} jötunn Þjazi to lure Iðunn out of Asgard and into a wood, {{promising}} her interesting apples. Þjazi, {{in the form of}} an eagle, snatches Iðunn from the wood and takes her to his home. Iðunn's absence causes the gods <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>old</b> and grey, and they realize that Loki is responsible for her disappearance. Loki promises to return her and, in the form of a falcon, finds her alone at Þjazi's home. [...] He turns her into a nut and takes her back to Asgard. After Þjazi finds that Iðunn is gone, he turns into an eagle and furiously chases after Loki. The gods build a pyre in Asgard and, after a sudden stop by Loki, Þjazi's feathers catch fire, he falls, and the gods kill him.|$|E
500|$|Elgar having died in 1934, the {{authorities}} turned to Walton {{to compose a}} march in the Elgarian tradition for the coronation of George VI in 1937. His Crown Imperial was an immediate success with the public, but disappointed those of Walton's admirers who {{thought of him as}} an avant garde composer. Among Walton's other works from this decade are more film scores, including the first of his incidental music for Shakespeare adaptations, As You Like It (1936); a short ballet for a West End revue (1936); and a choral piece, In Honour of the City of London (1937). His most important work of the 1930s, alongside the symphony, was the Violin Concerto (1939), commissioned by Jascha Heifetz. The concerto, Walton later revealed, expressed his love for Alice Wimborne. Its strong romantic style caused some critics to label it retrogressive, and Walton said in a newspaper interview, [...] "Today's white hope is tomorrow's black sheep. These days it is very sad for a composer <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>old</b> ... I seriously advise all sensitive composers to die at the age of 37. I know: I've gone through the first halcyon period and am just about ripe for my critical damnation." ...|$|E

500|$|Lazarus is {{a coming}} of age story for a young woman named Forever Carlyle who is {{questioning}} her identity. Its major themes are the meaning of [...] "family" [...] and nature versus nurture. It {{is set in a}} bleak future where the world has been divided into sixteen large land areas, each led by one family. Each family rules their region in a feudal system that divides people into three tiers: [...] "family", [...] "serfs" [...] (skilled labors), and [...] "waste". The families have formed alliances to protect themselves from other families, and each family has a chosen warrior known as a [...] "Lazarus" [...] who represents them in combat. Forever is the Lazarus for the Carlyle family. She obeys the family patriarch, Malcolm Carlyle, and has four siblings: Steven, Beth, and twins Jonah and Johanna. The original source of the Carlyle's fortune and power is from their various developments in genetic technology. Among other advancements, their modified seeds provide food for most of the world. The Carlyles have also altered their own genetics, which has allowed all of them <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>old</b> without suffering the consequences of age.|$|E

2500|$|Owing to the neocortical {{component}} of human functioning, when human beings lose a primary relationship, they grasp its potential repercussions (i.e. {{they may feel}} uncertain about the future or fear being unable {{to climb out of}} an abyss), thus encumbering an additional layer of separation stress. [...] To abandon is [...] "to withdraw one's support or help from, especially in spite of duty, allegiance, or responsibility; desert: abandon a friend in trouble." [...] When the loss is due to the object’s voluntary withdrawal, a common response is to feel unworthy of love. [...] This indicates the tendency for people to blame the rejection on themselves. [...] "Am I unworthy of love, destined <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>old</b> and die all alone, bereft of human connection or caring?" [...] Questioning one’s desirability as a mate and fearing eternal isolation are among the additional anxieties incurred in abandonment scenarios. The concurrence of self devaluation and primal fear distinguish abandonment grief from most other types of bereavement.|$|E

2500|$|Beauvoir {{describes}} a woman's clothes, her girl friends and her relationships with men. She writes that [...] "marriage, by frustrating women's erotic satisfaction, denies them {{the freedom and}} individuality of their feelings, drives them to adultery". Beauvoir describes prostitutes and their relationships with pimps and with other women, as well as hetaeras. In contrast to prostitutes, hetaeras can gain recognition as an individual and if successful can aim higher and be publicly distinguished. Beauvoir writes that women's path to menopause might arouse woman's homosexual feelings (which Beauvoir thinks are latent in most women). When she agrees <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>old</b> she becomes elderly with half of her adult life left to live. Woman might choose to live through her children (often her son) or her grandchildren but she faces [...] "solitude, regret, and ennui". To pass her time she might engage in useless [...] "women's handiwork", watercolors, music or reading, or she might join charitable organizations. While a few rare women are committed to a cause and have an end in mind, Beauvoir concludes that [...] "the highest form of freedom a woman-parasite can have is stoic defiance or skeptical irony".|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Brel {{decided to}} record one final album. Despite his recent {{years away from}} the continent, his legend lived on in Europe and his records still sold {{millions}} of copies each year. In August, Brel returned to Paris and moved into a small hotel. He had quit smoking and, despite his poor health, was enthusiastic about working again with his faithful collaborators François Rauber and Gérard Jouannest. In September and October, Brel recorded 12 of the 17 new songs he had written in the Marquesas. The result was his final album, Les Marquises, which included [...] "Jaures", [...] "Vieillir" [...] (<b>To</b> <b>grow</b> <b>old),</b> [...] "Le Bon Dieu" [...] (The good Lord), [...] "Orly", [...] "Voir un Ami pleurer" [...] (To see a friend cry), [...] "Jojo", and [...] "Les Marquises". The new album was released on 17 November and was received as an historic national event in France. At Brel's request, Barclay did not run a huge promotional campaign for the album, and still, {{by word of mouth}} alone, over a million fans placed advance orders. The day the album was released, Jacques and Maddly returned to their home in the Marquesas Islands.|$|E
