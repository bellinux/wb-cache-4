5|$|David Moffat {{became the}} Rio Grande's {{president}} in 1885 and persuaded the company's other executives <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Aspen connection. To overcome the Midland's lead, {{they built a}} narrow-gauge line {{on the north side}} of the Roaring Fork, today the route of the Rio Grande Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. Working through the winter, the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into Aspen five months later.|$|E
5|$|The fourteenth {{stage was}} memorable for its extreme weather, most notably {{on the final}} climb of the Gavia Pass. Overnight, {{a large amount of}} snow had {{accumulated}} on the Gavia, but the roads were cleared in time for the riders. Despite the cold and adverse weather forecast, the patron, Vincenzo Torriani, decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> stage. As snow fell on the riders climbing the muddy roads of the Gavia, Hampsten attacked {{at the base of the}} mountain but was chased by Erik Breukink, who eventually caught up and passed the American with seven kilometers to go. Although Breukink won the stage, Hampsten made the bigger story by becoming the first American to don the maglia rosa in the history of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{took place}} between the leader of Cardiff Council, Russell Goodway, and the Secretary of State for Wales, Ron Davies, Member of Parliament (MP). The two {{disagreed}} on the valuation of the site, Davies offered what {{was believed to be}} the market price of GB£3.5M, Goodway demanded £14M for the relocation of Council staff. In October 1997, both the Welsh Office and Cardiff Council agreed to the District Valuer providing an independent assessment of the market value of Cardiff City Hall and the cost of staff relocating to an equivalent standard of accommodation. The District Valuer advised that the open market value of Cardiff City Hall was £3.5M. There was not enough information available for the District Valuer to make a decision. A bid of £2.5M was made by the Welsh Office on 14 November 1997, which was rejected on 21 November 1997. A final offer of £3.5M was made on 24 November and this too was rejected by Cardiff County Council. Davies later announced his decision not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cardiff City Hall site for the National Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from donors, {{instead of being}} placed on static display {{it was decided to}} use the locomotive for charter trains out of York, {{as well as on the}} Scarborugh Spa Express, (York to Scarborough), although problems with its condition soon became apparent. Having failed on the delivery trip to Railfest, arriving on tow, after considerable remedial work it then proceeded to fail numerous times in the following months, with the museum's engineering staff kept constantly busy effecting running repairs, but failed to spot critical faults that would delay the subsequent overhauls and restoration. From September 2004 until May 2005 it was put into the workshops for a heavy intermediate repair, the intention being to improve reliability and allow operation until its heavy general repair (overhaul) and restoration. The intermediate repair failed to improve reliability, and so the decision was taken <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> overhaul and restoration.|$|E
5|$|While {{financial}} backing was issued by NATO's Mutual Weapons Development Program to support {{development of the}} Pegasus engine, the British government were not forthcoming with funding. While HSA chose <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> P.1127 as a private venture, the Air Staff disagreed heavily over what requirements should be set out for a future RAF VTOL aircraft; some officers, such as the Chief of the Air Staff Sir Thomas Pike, advocated simplicity while others, such as the RAF operational requirements division, sought various performance demands of such an aircraft, particularly the capacity for supersonic flight. HSA was also interested in the prospects and feasibility of a more sophisticated development of the P.1127, knowing that a supersonic-capable VTOL aircraft would likely be more attractive to customers, there being a general perception {{at the time that}} supersonic aircraft held significantly more value their subsonic counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{administration}} of Harry Truman had become convinced that the Guatemalan government had been penetrated by communists, it relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the communist influence, {{at least until the}} end of its term. The United States had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block weapons purchases by Guatemala from other countries. In 1952 Truman became sufficiently convinced of the threat posed by Árbenz to start planning a covert overthrow, titled Operation PBFORTUNE. The plan had originally been suggested by the US supported dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García, who said that if he were given weapons, he could overthrow the Guatemalan government. Truman gave the CIA permission <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plan, without informing the state department. The CIA placed a shipment of weapons on a vessel owned by the United Fruit Company, and the operation was paid for by Rafael Trujillo and Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the right-wing anti-communist dictators of the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, respectively. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan.|$|E
5|$|Bad {{weather in}} Turin created doubt {{about whether the}} match could be completed. However, the referee decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> match. Liverpool were without striker Kenny Dalglish who was suspended. Liverpool {{struggled}} to gain {{a foothold in the}} match {{in the first half and}} were behind when Juventus scored in the 40th minute. A mishit pass by Massimo Briaschi found Zbigniew Boniek whose subsequent shot from the edge of the Liverpool penalty area beat goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar to give Juventus a 1–0 lead. Liverpool had a chance to equalise before the end of the first half, but midfielder John Wark put his shot wide of the Juventus goal. Liverpool started the second half without defender Mark Lawrenson who had injured himself during the first half, he was replaced by Gary Gillespie. Liverpool tried to level the match in the second half, but their best chances came from midfielder Ronnie Whelan whose shots from distance did not result in any goals. Juventus extended their lead late in the second half when Boniek scored again. A cross from Briaschi found Boniek, whose shot beat Grobbelaar to extend Juventus' lead to 2–0. Five minutes later, Juventus nearly extended their lead again. However, striker Paolo Rossi's shot was saved by Grobbelaar. Juventus held onto their lead to win the match 2–0 and win the Super Cup.|$|E

5|$|To predict if the {{production}} of mendelevium would be possible, the team made use of a rough calculation. The number of atoms that would be produced would be approximately equal to {{the product of the}} number of atoms of target material, the target's cross section, the ion beam intensity, and the time of bombardment; this last factor was related to the half-life of the product when bombarding for a time on the order of its half-life. This gave one atom per experiment. Thus under optimum conditions, the preparation of only one atom of element 101 per experiment could be expected. This calculation demonstrated that it was feasible <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> experiment. The target material, einsteinium-253, could be produced readily from irradiating plutonium: one year of irradiation would give a billion atoms, and its three-week half-life meant that the element 101 experiments could be conducted in one week after the produced einsteinium was separated and purified to make the target. However, it was necessary to upgrade the cyclotron to obtain the needed intensity of 1014 alpha particles per second; Seaborg applied for the necessary funds.|$|E
