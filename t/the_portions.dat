5|$|After {{recording}} sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr {{would be}} chauffeured {{back to their}} houses in the 'stockbroker belt' of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. The Bag O'Nails nightclub {{was one of their}} favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would always take out a torch from his pocket (in the dimly lit club) to inspect <b>the</b> <b>portions</b> on each of their plates. This was to make sure that <b>the</b> <b>portions</b> were exactly as they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. While Harrison, McCartney and Starr passed their driving tests, Lennon didn't pass his driving test until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a notoriously bad driver by poorly navigating roads and failing to notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.|$|E

40|$|An {{increase}} in <b>the</b> <b>portion</b> size {{leads to an}} {{increase in}} energy intake, a phenomenon which is also referred to as <b>the</b> <b>portion</b> size effect. <b>The</b> increase in <b>portion</b> sizes in recent years is regarded as an important contributor to the increase in the prevalence of obesity. Hence, the aim of this thesis is to better understand why <b>the</b> <b>portion</b> size effect occurs {{and what can be done}} to prevent it. We found that one of the reasons why people rely on <b>the</b> <b>portion</b> size when determining how much to eat, is because it is an indicator of what others will find an appropriate consumption quantity. To prevent <b>the</b> <b>portion</b> size effect, we explored whether it would be effective to remind diet-concerned people of their dieting goal. Such a reminder motivates diet-concerned people to control consumption, which makes it less likely that they will use <b>the</b> <b>portion</b> size as an indicator of how much they can eat. We indeed found that this reminder prevented <b>the</b> <b>portion</b> size effect. Finally, we showed that provision of a pictorial serving size recommendation can also weaken <b>the</b> <b>portion</b> size effect. A serving size recommendation provides people with an alternative reference point to rely on when determining their consumption amount, and hence they don’t need to rely on <b>the</b> <b>portion</b> size. We conclude that with sufficient help, people will be able to rely less on environmental cues, such as <b>the</b> <b>portion</b> size, when making consumption decisions...|$|R
