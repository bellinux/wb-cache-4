5|$|A 1937 {{survey by}} the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a {{rectangular}} font made of gritstone, of unknown date, and a memorial to a Sion Evan and his son Evan Jones, who died in 1790 and 1822 respectively. A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 recorded a chalice and paten made of Britannia metal (a pewter alloy), and an electro-plated set of communion vessels. It noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> silver communion service had been stolen.|$|E
50|$|What {{is thought}} of as supernatural depends on the time period, but {{generally}} it is considered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>the</b> time period, the more phenomena were considered supernatural.|$|R
2500|$|Fretheim {{observed}} an {{ambiguity in}} the language of [...] The brother who would be stronger was not necessarily the brother who would be served. Fretheim wrote that [...] predicted either <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> (Esau) would be the weaker of the two and would serve the younger (Jacob), or, more likely, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> would be <b>the</b> stronger and would serve the younger.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the team}} name of Eastern Michigan University {{changed from the}} Hurons to the Eagles in 1991, the change {{remained}} controversial as some students and alumni sought to restore it. In 2012, the university president brought back the Hurons logo, which was placed inside flap a of the band uniforms, along with another historic logo, with the stated intent of recognizing the past. However, {{the return of the}} Hurons logo has prompted protests from Native Americans at the university and in the local community, who state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> mascot promotes stereotypes and hostility.|$|E
5|$|During 1983–1984, the {{painting}} was exhibited at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm, and after this exhibit an art dealer offered to donate or sell {{the painting}} to Nationalmuseum. The board rejected the offer with the statement <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Norse motif was more appropriate for the Museum of National Antiquities, {{which at the time}} still shared the same building as Nationalmuseum. When the Museum of National Antiquities had been moved to a building of its own, the painting should be moved there too.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Hitler decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Reich Chancellery was not {{big enough}} to house the {{ministries}} of the Third Reich. He assigned his favorite architect Albert Speer to build the new Chancellery. After the massive renovations were completed in early 1939 per Hitler's insistence, the globe {{was moved to the}} Führer's new office located {{at the heart of the}} new Chancellery, where it remained until the Soviets occupied the building in April 1945.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, {{while still}} in the hospital, Kesselring {{accepted}} the honorary presidency of three veterans' organisations. The first was the Luftwaffenring, consisting of Luftwaffe veterans. The Verband deutsches Afrikakorps, the veterans' association of the Afrika Korps, soon followed. More controversial was {{the presidency of the}} right-wing veterans' association, the Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten. Leadership of this organisation tarnished his reputation. He attempted to reform the organisation, proposing that the new German flag be flown instead of the old Imperial Flag; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Stahlhelm greeting Front heil! be abolished; and that members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany be allowed to join. The response was very unenthusiastic.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, {{the board}} of {{trustees}} of the Cummer Museum of Art & Gardens announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Woman's Club of Jacksonville, which was to become a center for programming for the museum, would have to be demolished because of an infestation of Formosan subterranean termites, costing the museum its $7 million investment into the building. It had been previously listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Martin oversaw {{post-production}} on The Beatles Anthology (which {{was originally}} entitled The Long and Winding Road) in 1994 and 1995, working again with Geoff Emerick. Martin {{decided to use}} an old 8-track analogue deck – which EMI learned an engineer still had – to mix the songs for the project, instead of a modern digital deck. He explained this by saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> deck created a completely different sound, which a new deck could not accurately reproduce. He also said he found the whole project a strange experience (and McCartney agreed), as they {{had to listen to}} themselves chatting in the studio, 25–30 years previously.|$|E
25|$|Plans for a {{new airport}} began in 1940, as {{evidence}} mounted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> Shushan Airport (New Orleans Lakefront Airport) was too small.|$|R

5|$|The {{bridge was}} narrow and {{structurally}} unsound, leading {{the authorities to}} rename it Chelsea Bridge to avoid the Royal Family's association with a potential collapse. In 1926 it was proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> bridge be rebuilt or replaced, due to the increased volume of users from population growth, {{and the introduction of}} the automobile. It was demolished during 1934–1937, and replaced by the current structure, which opened in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} set up {{a second}} committee in 1968 who suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> eastwest runway be closed and the airport's area reduced, allowing for development {{to the east of}} the airport. They suggested that this is replaced by a new runway in the sea, adjacent to the beach. The runway was closed, and a high density upper-middle income neighborhood was built to the east of the airport, although the new runway was never constructed due to the high cost involved.|$|E
5|$|The old man kills Dr. Yonechi (Hiro Kanagawa), a Japanese researcher, by {{pricking}} {{him with}} a metallic stylus, introducing an unknown chemical into his body. The agents approach Nichols' girlfriend and colleague, Lisa Ianelli (Susan Lee Hoffman), who recognizes the chemical compound as a rapid freezing agent that Jason had been engineering for years. However, she claims that the compound {{has not yet been}} invented and that if Yonechi was injected with the chemical, he may not be dead. With Lisa's help, Scully and a team of medical personnel successfully resuscitate Yonechi, only for his body temperature to rapidly increase until he bursts into flames. Police receive a tip <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> man is living at a nearby hotel. Inside the old man's room, the agents discover a faded color photograph picturing Jason, Yonechi and Lisa toasting champagne glasses in the cryology lab. Mulder realizes from the picture <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> man is a time traveller who is attempting to alter that future, and that he is none other than Jason Nichols.|$|E
60|$|Weston {{shook his}} head resolutely, though he felt the same temptation. It was in one sense curious <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> man should defer to him.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} {{surrounded}} by a small churchyard, the first mentions of which come from 1871. However, some of <b>the</b> tombstones are <b>older</b> than <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> one from year 1660.|$|R
50|$|On 14 April 2011, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> resident of Iitate, a 102-year-old, committed suicide rather than to leave following the announcement of his village's evacuation.|$|R
5|$|The plebeians {{had finally}} {{achieved}} political equality with the patricians. However, {{the plight of}} the average plebeian had not changed. A small number of plebeian families achieved the same standing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> aristocratic patrician families had always had, but the new plebeian aristocrats became as uninterested in {{the plight of the}} average plebeian as the old patrician aristocrats had always been. The plebeians rebelled by leaving Rome and refusing to return until they had more rights. The patricians then noticed how much they needed the plebeians and accepted their terms. The plebeians then returned to Rome and continued their work.|$|E
5|$|When the General Assembly met in May 1838 at Philadelphia, the New School commissioners {{attempted}} to be seated but {{were forced to}} leave and convene their own General Assembly elsewhere in the city. The Old School and New School factions had finally split into two separate churches that were about equal in size. Both churches, however, {{claimed to be the}} Presbyterian Church in the USA. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> School body was the legal successor of the undivided PCUSA.|$|E
5|$|Writing for GameSpot, {{reviewer}} Joe Fielder {{highlighted the}} graphics {{for their new}} lighting effects and varied textures, saying that they improve the gameplay experience because they {{make it easier for}} players to identify ledges and jump-off points. Douglass Perry of IGN remarked that the upgraded engine made the game look better than its predecessors, but overall considered Tomb Raider III to be outdated, especially when compared to newer engines that were released at the time. Edge felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> controls did not suit the more complex environments and criticised the game's lack of narrative and cinematic presentation.|$|E

5|$|At the old lady's house, Gary {{has been}} fed a lot. The old lady puts out fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but then he turns around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E
5|$|From 27 May to 4 July, Wettin {{was back}} in the North Sea, patrolling the mouths of the Jade, Ems, and Elbe rivers. During this period, the naval high command {{realized}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Wittelsbach-class ships would be useless in action against the Royal Navy, but could be effectively used against the much weaker Russian forces in the Baltic. As a result, the ships were transferred back to the Baltic in July, and they departed Kiel on the 7th, bound for Danzig. On 10 July, the ships proceeded further east to Neufahrwassar, along with the VIII Torpedo-boat Flotilla. The IV Squadron ships sortied on 12 July to make a demonstration, returning to Danzig on 21 July without encountering Russian forces.|$|E

During this period, the naval high command {{realized}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Wittelsbach-class ships would be useless in action against the Royal Navy, but could be effectively used against the much weaker Russian forces in the Baltic. As a result, the battleships were transferred back to the Baltic in July, and they departed Kiel on the 7th, bound for Danzig. On 10 July, the ships proceeded further east to Neufahrwassar, along with the vessels of the VIII Torpedo-boat Flotilla; after arriving, Wittelsbach ran aground and Schmidt transferred his flag to Braunschweig. She was able to free herself and was not damaged in the incident, and the following day Schmidt returned to the ship. The IV Squadron ships sortied on 12 July to make a demonstration, returning to Danzig on 21 July without encountering Russian forces.|$|E
