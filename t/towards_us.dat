5|$|Meanwhile, at the UN, {{although}} the UN members and US were initially divided {{on how to}} respond to Chinese intervention in Korea, the Chinese rejection of UN ceasefire soon rallied the UN members <b>towards</b> <b>US.</b> Immediately afterward, a UN resolution that condemned China as an aggressor was passed on February 1. In the opinion of historian Bevin Alexander, the Chinese rejection of UN ceasefire had damaged the international prestige it had built from its earlier military successes, and this later made it difficult for China to either join the UN or to deny US support for Taiwan. The Korean War, which ultimately ended at the 38th parallel, would drag on for another two bloody years due to the Chinese demand for all UN forces to be withdrawn from the Korean Peninsula.|$|E

Route 143 and Loop 101 intersect the Red Mountain Freeway at various points in the city prior to the road entering the northern reaches of Mesa, where it had temporarily ended at Power Road. The final segment of the Red Mountain Freeway from Power Road to University Drive opened on July 21, 2008. The freeway then continues due southward <b>towards</b> <b>US</b> 60, until it bisects it at the SuperRedTan Interchange, beyond which Loop 202 becomes the Santan Freeway.|$|E
5|$|The year of 1967 started {{badly for}} the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF). During {{the early years}} of the war, the rules of {{engagement}} prevented U.S. fighter-bombers from hitting North Vietnamese air bases, and that allowed North Vietnamese fighter pilots to attack American bomber formations as they were approaching their targets, thereby forcing U.S. pilots to jettison their bomb loads before they even reached their target. Then, instead of dueling with U.S. strike aircraft, North Vietnamese pilots would normally retreat to the safety of their bases. To preempt further attacks on U.S. bomber formations by the North Vietnamese Air Force, the United States Air Force became interested in luring North Vietnamese MiG fighters up against a decoy target, and shoot them down in the air using missile-armed fighter aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force had become more aggressive <b>towards</b> <b>U.S.</b> strike formations, and it indicated to U.S. commanders that it was the right time to launch a decoy operation.|$|E

5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was also}} adopted {{as a method}} of execution by Guatemala in 1996, China in 1997, the Philippines in 1999, Thailand in 2003, Taiwan in 2005, and Vietnam in 2013. The Philippines abolished the method in 2006, though a bill to reinstate it passed through the House of Representatives and as of July 2017 is still awaiting debate in the Senate. While it is still legal, no executions have been carried out in Guatemala since 2000, and in Thailand since 2009. The United States and China are the two biggest users of this method of execution. The U.S. had executed 1,283 people via lethal injection as of April 2017. The number of people executed annually in China is thought to surpass all other countries combined, though the actual number is a state secret, and the percentage of people killed via lethal injection and the other method of execution used there, firing squad, is also unclear. This alphabetical list features notable cases up to September 2017, and only those where lethal injection can be reliably sourced to be the method of execution. The criterion for notability is an article on the individual in the English Wikipedia, which inevitably causes a bias <b>towards</b> <b>U.S.</b> executions, as notable individuals in other countries such as Thailand and Vietnam may only have articles in their own language. A complete list of all executions in the United States can be found here.|$|E

25|$|The {{different}} types of radio-loud active galaxies are linked by unified models. The key observation {{that led to the}} adoption of unified models for powerful radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars was that all quasars appear to be beamed <b>towards</b> <b>us,</b> showing superluminal motion in the cores and bright jets {{on the side of the}} source nearest to us (the Laing-Garrington effect:). If this is the case, there must be a population of objects not beamed <b>towards</b> <b>us,</b> and, since we know the lobes are not affected by beaming, they would appear as radio galaxies, provided that the quasar nucleus is obscured when the source is seen side-on. It is now accepted that at least some powerful radio galaxies have 'hidden' quasars, though it is not clear whether all such radio galaxies would be quasars if viewed from the right angle. In a similar way, low-power radio galaxies are a plausible parent population for BL Lac objects.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes, {{the only}} {{evidence}} of a binary star comes from the Doppler effect on its emitted light.

25|$|Another example where visual {{appearance}} {{is at odds}} with measurement comes from the observation of apparent superluminal motion in various radio galaxies, BL Lac objects, quasars, and other astronomical objects that eject relativistic-speed jets of matter at narrow angles with respect to the viewer. An optical illusion results giving the appearance of faster than light travel. In Fig.1‑14, galaxy M87 streams out a high-speed jet of subatomic particles almost directly <b>towards</b> <b>us,</b> but Penrose–Terrell rotation causes the jet to appear to be moving laterally in the same manner that the appearance of the cube in Fig.1‑13 has been stretched out.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between God's absolute Unity and Divine manifestations, may {{be compared to}} a man in a room - there is the man himself, and his presence and relationship to others in the room. In Hebrew, this is known as the Shekhinah. It is also the concept of God's Name - it is His relationship and presence in the world <b>towards</b> <b>us.</b> The Wisdom (literally written as Field of Apples) in kabbalistic terms refers to the Shekhinah, the Divine Presence. The Unknowable One (literally written as the Miniature Presence) refers to events on earth when events can be understood as natural happenings instead of God's act, although it is actually the act of God. This is known as perceiving the Shekhinah through a blurry, cloudy lens. This means to say, although we see God's Presence (not God Himself) through natural occurrences, it is only through a blurry lens; as opposed to miracles, in which we clearly see and recognize God's presence in the world. The Holy Ancient One refers to God Himself, Who is imperceivable. (see Minchas Yaakov and anonymous commentary in the Siddur Beis Yaakov on the Sabbath hymn of Askinu Seudasa, composed by the Arizal based on this lofty concept of the Zohar).|$|E
25|$|Between the South Carolina {{line and}} the US74 bypass, US1 is a two-lane road but sees a {{considerable}} amount of truck and tourist traffic of people cutting through from the US74/US220 and I-73/I-74 corridor attempting to reach points south and east. US1 goes through downtown Rockingham, with a bypass in the future plans. North of the NC 177 junction, it becomes four lanes or greater, becoming a super-street with limited access and then becoming a limited access freeway. US1 becomes a major artery for the state as it moves north of Rockingham. After Richmond County, it goes into Moore County with two expressway bypasses in Southern Pines, Vass and Cameron. US1 continues with the Jefferson Davis Highway label through Lee County and Sanford, and on to Cary and Raleigh. US1 runs concurrently with US64 through most of Cary, where the freeway recently underwent a major renovation and improvements that added lanes in both directions. North of Raleigh, US1 (known as Capital Boulevard in northern Wake County) crosses Interstate 540 and then again becomes a four-lane divided arterial to Interstate 85 near Henderson. The North Carolina Department of Transportation has begun a corridor study for this section of US1. Moreover, NCDOT is planning to finish four-laning US1 in Richmond County past NC 177 with a Rockingham bypass to the east. There are no plans from SCDOT to widen US1 from the state line. From Henderson into Virginia, US1 runs parallel with I-85 as a two-lane local road until the state line, where Virginia hosts a continuous third center lane for alternate passing <b>towards</b> <b>US</b> Highway 58 before South Hill.|$|E
