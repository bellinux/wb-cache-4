25|$|Critics, {{such as the}} American Council of the Blind, {{note that}} U.S. bills are {{relatively}} hard to tell apart: they use very similar designs, they are printed in the same colors (until the 2003 banknotes, in which a faint secondary color was added), {{and they are all}} the same size. The American Council of the Blind has argued that American paper currency design should use increasing sizes according to value and/or raised or indented features to make the currency more usable by the vision-impaired, since the denominations cannot currently be distinguished from one another non-visually. Use of Braille codes on currency is not considered a desirable solution because (1) these markings would only be useful to people who know how to read Braille, and (2) one Braille symbol can become confused with another if even one bump is rubbed off. Though some blind individuals say that they have no problems keeping track of their currency because they fold their bills in different ways or keep them in different places in <b>their</b> <b>wallets,</b> they nevertheless must rely on sighted people or currency-reading machines to determine the value of each bill before filing it away using the system of their choice. This means that no matter how organized they are, blind people still have to trust sighted people or machines each time they receive US banknotes.|$|E

The inspection teams in the province uncovered widespread collusion between those who hold political power and the [...] "coal bosses" [...] that stack <b>their</b> <b>wallets</b> in exchange for favourable treatment in approving development projects.

2500|$|As a {{practical}} matter, passwords must be both reasonable and functional {{for the end}} user as well as strong enough for the intended purpose. Passwords that are too difficult to remember may be forgotten and so {{are more likely to}} be written on paper, which some consider a security risk. In contrast, others argue that forcing users to remember passwords without assistance can only accommodate weak passwords, and thus poses a greater security risk. According to Bruce Schneier, most people are good at securing <b>their</b> <b>wallets</b> or purses, which is a [...] "great place" [...] to store a written password.|$|E

50|$|People are {{influenced}} in their consumption decisions by the mental account {{that comes to}} mind when deciding whether to consume their resources. Spending a fixed amount of a resource, such as 5 minutes of one's time or $5 of one's money is more psychologically painful when that expenditure is drawn from a smaller rather than a larger mental account. People consider expenditures of money like a cup of coffee or slice of pizza, for example, to be more painful when paying with them from the cash in <b>their</b> <b>wallet</b> than when paying for them out of their checking account. This influences their propensity to purchase goods and services. In a study by Morewedge, Holtzman, and Epley (2007), shoppers buying lunch at a local market primed to think of the money in their bank accounts and investments spend 36% more than did shoppers primed to think of the cash in <b>their</b> <b>wallet.</b>|$|R

60|$|For {{several days}} after this they plodded {{steadily}} onward, sometimes over the mountains or across the grassy plains, where migrating reindeer supplied them with abundant venison; at other times among lakelets and streams, whose excellent fish and innumerable wildfowl provided them with variety for the table and music for the ear. Now and then they saw the great moose-deer, which rivals the horse in size, and once Hendrick shot one, {{at a time when}} they chanced to have consumed their last caribou steak, and happened to enter a great forest without anything for supper in <b>their</b> <b>wallets.</b> For, occasionally, circumstances may render men supperless even when surrounded by plenty.|$|E

60|$|If our hero's {{mind had}} been more at ease, it is {{probable}} that he would have enjoyed his surroundings greatly, for, although lost on the wide Pampas, they had not begun yet to suffer physically from that misfortune. <b>Their</b> <b>wallets</b> were still supplied with food sufficient for at least three full meals, the weather was serene, and the situation, viewed in one aspect, was exceedingly romantic. From the top of the rising ground where the fire was burning and the steaks of mare's flesh roasting, the complete circle of the horizon could be seen, and the yellow-brown grass of the Pampas, at that time about a foot high, rolled with a motion that strangely resembled the waves of the liquid ocean itself.|$|E
5000|$|A {{transponder}} {{system is}} a system which is always armed until a device, usually a small RFID transponder, enters the vehicle's transmitter radius.

40|$|The {{original}} EMV {{protocol was}} designed to operate {{in a situation where}} the card holder removes their card from <b>their</b> <b>wallet</b> and insert the card into a Point of Sale (POS) terminal. The protocol operates predominantly in plaintext which was not a problem because the attackers needed to tamper with the POS {{to gain access to the}} information on the card. The introduction of contactless EMV cards exposes the mainly plaintext EMV protocol to a wireless interface. This allows attackers to use an off-the-shelf NFC reader to access the card without the cardholders knowledge and potentially whilst the card is still in <b>their</b> <b>wallet.</b> Research has demonstrated that contactless EMV cards are vulnerable to various attacks carried out using off-the- shelf equipment which is both cheap and easy to obtain. The proposed solution addresses these issues by having the card request that any NFC reader, attempting to initiate communication, must authenticate itself as a genuine bank issued POS. The POS does this using a Bank issued private key to sign a nonce provided by the card...|$|R

Then a messenger was despatched with a letter to the prior of Bramber, telling him of Wulf's safe return, and begging him to excuse his coming over to see him, as he had ridden nigh a hundred and fifty miles in three days, and was forced to set out again at daybreak the next morning. As Wulf had hoped, the letter was answered by the prior in person, and to him Wulf related that evening the incidents of their stay in Normandy.|$|E

Their midday meal consisted of bread and fruit, costing but the smallest coin, and eaten by the wayside {{in the shade of a}} clump of trees. They heard many tales on their way down of the bands of robbers who infested the road, but having taken the precaution of having the doubloons for which they had exchanged Geoffrey's English gold sewn up in their boots, they had no fear of encountering these gentry, having nothing to lose save <b>their</b> <b>wallets</b> and the few dollars they had kept out for the expenses of their journey.
