5000|$|According to {{an article}} by the Professional Football Researchers Association, Jackson played for the Boston Bulldogs in 1929. However, he was listed as a player on the field named [...] "Arnie Shockley". Jackson, a {{teammate}} of Arnie Shockley's from Southwestern Oklahoma State University, used Archie's invitation <b>to</b> <b>try</b> out <b>for</b> Boston. According to Jackson, he was disappointed when he didn't receive an invitation <b>to</b> <b>try</b> out <b>for</b> any professional team after playing college football. However, Arnie Shockley did receive an invitation <b>to</b> <b>try</b> out <b>for</b> the Bulldogs. Shockley decided not to go, and Jackson saw {{this as an opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>try</b> out <b>for</b> a pro team.

5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>for</b> those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right. George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command much support at the convention. John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur’s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>for</b> the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman’s older brother, to accept it if it came to him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.|$|E

He successfully did so, giving himself $1,410,000 and the record for the time being.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 race {{contained}} a rare spectacle where {{an early morning}} breakaway group held on until the finish: 27 kilometres into the race a group of unknown riders broke away and the pack did nothing to chase them down throughout the race.

In January 1943, however, Rear Admiral Robert English, Commander, Submarines, U.S. Pacific Fleet, was killed in a plane crash. Christie hoped to get the position but the job went to Rear Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, commander of submarine operations in Fremantle, and the Bureau of Personnel selected Christie to take over Lockwood's old command. Christie lobbied Vice Admiral Arthur 'Chips' Carpender, Douglas MacArthur's Commander Allied Naval Forces, to allow him to replace Fife as commander of the larger submarine force at Brisbane. Carpender refused, and Christie went on to Fremantle. Nevertheless, Christie continued <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>for</b> some time to take the Brisbane force under his control.|$|E

Brady arranged for Hayward {{to be sent to}} the Naval Academy Preparatory School in Norfolk, Virginia, to study for the entrance exams. During World War I, some one-hundred presidential appointments to Annapolis had been set aside for enlisted sailors, but few had applied, and fewer still had passed the entrance exams. Of the 119 sailors who sat the exams in 1926, only 19 passed, one of whom was Hayward. He entered Annapolis in August 1926, and was commissioned as an ensign on graduation in June 1930, ranking 51st in his class of 406.|$|E
5|$|Returning to California, Solis became Director of the California Student Opportunity and Access Program in 1982, to help {{disadvantaged}} youth gain necessary {{preparation for}} college.

Friends urged her <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>for</b> elective office, and so in 1985, she ran for the Board of Trustees of the Rio Hondo Community College District. She campaigned hard and overtook an incumbent and one other better established candidate to become the top placer. She was reelected in 1989. During her time on the board, she worked towards improved vocational job training at the college and sought {{to increase the number}} of tenured faculty positions held by minorities and women.

5|$|The 2007 season brought Zersenay his {{greatest}} medal haul, as he succeeded on grass, track and road.

The hot conditions in Mombasa forced a number of runners out of the race, but Zersenay maintained his pace to finish over twenty seconds ahead of the next runner. At the Cáceres Half Marathon, he stated his intention <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>for</b> the world record and, although he won the race, poor pacing left him some distance from a record time. He returned to the Great Manchester Run and again improved his best, recording 27:24, but this was not enough to beat Micah Kogo who won in a UK all-comers record time. He competed at the Prefontaine Classic for the first time, and set a two miles best of 8:19.34, although he was some distance behind winner Craig Mottram.|$|E
