40|$|In {{this work}} we review our {{results on the}} preparation, {{characterization}} and testing of copper/ceria structured catalysts for CO abatement in H 2 -rich streams by preferential oxidation. Copper/ceria wash-coated monoliths were prepared by a modified dip coating procedure. The effect of the substrate properties (cell density and wall thermal conductivity) on the catalytic performances {{and the effect of}} the slurry preparation on the wash-coat adhesion were investigated. The role of the temperature profile on the performances was also studied and the dependence of thermal profile on the cell density and the wall thermal conductivity was shown. Monoliths with both high cell density and high thermal conductivity of the substrate represent the best option, providing a very good thermal management of the process due to the reduction of hot spots over the catalyst surface. On the other hand, wash-coat adhesion is significantly improved by the presence of nanometric ceria in the slurry used <b>to</b> <b>dip-coat</b> the monoliths, due to the partial penetration of the wash-coat into the substrate macropores. Moreover, due to the modifications of the specific surface area and the pore size distribution upon addition of nanometric ceria to the slurry, copper dispersion and, then, CO selectivity were enhanced as well...|$|E
40|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{influence}} of Si in osteoblast cell proliferation, a series of sol–gel derived silicon based coating was prepared by controlling the process parameters and varying the different Si-alkoxide precursors molar rate {{in order to obtain}} materials able to release Si compounds. For this purpose, methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMOS) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were hydrolysed together and the sol obtained was used <b>to</b> <b>dip-coat</b> the different substrates. The silicon release ability of the coatings was tested finding that it was dependent on the TEOS precursor content, reaching a Si amount value around ninefolds higher for coatings with TEOS than for the pure MTMOS material. To test the effect of this released Si, the in vitro performance of developed coatings was tested with human adipose mesenchymal stem cells finding a significantly higher proliferation and mineralization on the coating with the higher TEOS content. For in vivo evaluation of the biocompatibility, coated implants were placed in the tibia of the rabbit and a histological analysis was performed. The evaluation of parameters such as the bone marrow state, the presence of giant cells and the fibrous capsule proved the biocompatibility of the developed coatings. Furthermore, coated implants seemed to produce a qualitatively higher osteoblastic activity and a higher number of bone spicules than the control (uncoated commercial SLA titanium dental implant).

40|$|Anti-reflective {{coatings}} {{are applied}} to substrates to increase the transmittance {{of light in the}} visible range of wavelength 400 – 800 nm through the substrate by changing the refractive index at the surface and directing more light through the substrate rather than being reflected away. This project investigated the possibility of applying a coating made from silica nanoparticles through an inkjet printer as opposed <b>to</b> <b>dip-coating</b> and spin-coating methods that are already used. Applying the coating from a printer will enable the ability to print directly onto items with various shapes like a phone screen and eye glasses and reduce glare on the screen or lens. A uniform coating onto glass and silicon wafer substrates was achievable. Experiments showed that print coating of solid and hollow silica films could increase the transmittance of light by 3 % or more. The silica coating had moderate mechanical resistance that is a point for further improvement. The process of print coating the silica nanoparticles had a tendency to clog ink cartridges but cautious care eventually showed that this complication was avoidable.

The PDMS gutter layer is mainly used for preventing the pore penetration of PEBA 1657 solution and the PDMS protective layer for sealing the defects of PEBA 1657 selective layer. The prepared multilayer PEI/PDMS/PEBA 1657 /PDMS composite membranes display high permeance and high selectivity for CO 2 separation. For the nonpolar gases He, H- 2, O- 2 and N- 2, the gas permeance decreases with the increasing molecule size. But for the polar gases CO 2, H 2 S and SO 2, their permeance is {{higher than that of}} nonpolar gases. Due to CO 2 induced plasticization effect, the pressure dependence of CO 2 permeance is expressed empirically by an exponential equation. And the temperature dependence of gas permeance is correlated with different Arrhenius equation below and above the melting of PEO segments. Compared with N- 2, H- 2 and CH 4, CO 2 has lower value of the apparent activation energy of permeation (E-p) because of its higher inherent condensability and the special interaction with polymer chain. Due to CO 2 induced plasticization effect, the diffusion activation energy (E-d) of CO 2 decreases with the increase of CO 2 pressure, resulting in the decrease of E-p. As for CO 2 /N- 2 gas mixture, the pressure ratio strongly influences the CO 2 concentration in the permeate side, and a high pressure ratio is always desirable to obtain high CO 2 concentration for flue gas.

40|$|The {{formation}} of thick, robust, mesoporous titania films {{is of particular}} interest and the focus of this thesis has been the study and comparison of the surfactant templated {{formation of}} such materials by three methods. film structure has been studied using TEM and small angle X-ray and neutron scattering while formation was studied using Brewster angle microscopy and X-ray and neutron reflectometry. Repetitive <b>dip-coating</b> was used <b>to</b> produce films for development into dye sensitized solar cells allowing development of cells of reasonable efficiency when four depositions were used. This research showed that repetitive deposition does not necessarily lead to a linear increase in film thickness, as subsequent depositions may be thinner making the future application of this method for solar cells problematic. In contrast <b>to</b> <b>dip-coating,</b> a fluorinated surfactant was used in a largely alcohol solvent to produce mesostructured films at the air-solution interface. Film formation occurred by a surface driven mechanism via addition of individual precursors and micelles producing a lamellar structure in-situ. After removal from the interface a cubic phase developed after drying of the film. Although films are not stable to calcination the calcined material remains porous. The surfactant templated formation of ZnO films at the air-solution interface was also studied. The di-block copolymer PEPEG 2250 was also used to template titania films at the air-solution interface from alcoholic solvent. Film formation occurred via a bulk driven mechanism. Although these films were found to be disordered at the interface and not stable to calcinations they were unusually robust and self supporting after removal from the interface.

Coating sols are synthesized from SiO 2 and TiO 2 nanoparticles with photopolymerizable surface ligands. A 5 -layer stack consisting of 2 SiO 2 and 3 TiO 2 layers was deposited on float glass by angle-dependent dip-coating (ADDC) with a fixed angle of 4 ° to the vertical and subsequent UV-curing. Finally, the whole stack was densified at 450 °C without cracking or discolouring. UV-vis-NIR transmittance and reflectance spectra show a steep increase of reflectance at 750 nm. In the range between 800 nm and 1200 nm, the reflectance is > 80 %. The visible transmittance is about 72 % due to single reflexion peaks.

In this work, composite catalytic membranes for pervaporation-assisted esterification processes are prepared.

40|$|The double-gyroid {{phase of}} {{nanoporous}} silica films {{has been shown}} to possess facile mass-transport properties and may be used as a mold to fabricate a variety of highly ordered inverse double-gyroid metal and semiconductor films. This phase exists only over a very small region of the binary phase diagram for most surfactants, and it has been very difficult to synthesize metal oxide films with this structure by evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA). Here, we show the interplay of the key parameters needed to synthesize these structures reproducibly and show that the interfacial curvature may be systematically controlled. Grazing angle of incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) is used to determine the structure and orientation of nanostructured silica films formed by EISA from dilute silica/(poly(ethylene oxide) -b-poly(propylene oxide) -b-alkyl) surfactant solutions. Four different highly ordered film structures are observed by changing only the concentration of the surfactant, the relative humidity during dip-coating, and the aging time of the solution prior to coating. The highly ordered films progress from rhombohedral (R (3) over barm) to 2 D rectangular (c 2 m) to double-gyroid (distorted Ia (3) over bard) to lamellar systematically as interfacial curvature decreases. Under all experimental conditions investigated, increasing the aging time of the coating solution was found to decrease the interfacial curvature. In particular, this parameter was critical to being able to synthesize highly ordered, pure-phase double-gyroid films. The key role of the aging time is shown via processing diagrams that map out the interplay between the aging time, composition, and relative humidity. Si- 29 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and solution-phase small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) of the aged coating solutions presented in part I of this series are then used to interpret the effects of aging prior <b>to</b> <b>dip-coating.</b> Specifically, it was found that a predictive model based on volume fractions and the silica cluster stoichiometry obtained from Si- 29 NMR qualitatively explains the trends observed with composition and aging. However, apart from the effects of relative humidity, a quantitative comparison of the predicted phase with the experimental processing diagram suggests that less-condensed silica clusters are more effective at swelling the EO blocks at early aging times. This enhanced swelling decreases with aging time and results in lower-curvature nanostructures such as the double-gyroid. The decrease in swelling is attributed to the decreased thermodynamic driving force for the more-condensed silica clusters to mix with the EO block of the surfactant...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} several sol-gel {{strategies}} to prepare supported inorganic membranes {{by a process}} that combines the features of slip-casting and <b>dip-coating.</b> <b>To</b> be viable the deposited membranes must exhibit both high flux and high selectivity. For porous membranes these requirements are met by extremely thin, defect-free porous films exhibiting a narrow size distribution of very small pores. This paper considers the use of polymeric silica and hybrid-organosilyl precursor sols {{in the context of}} the underlying physics and chemistry of the membrane deposition process. Since the average membrane pore size is ultimately established by the collapse of the gel network upon drying, it is necessary to promote polymer interpenetration and collapse during membrane deposition in order to achieve the very small pore sizes necessary for molecular sieving. For polymeric sols, this is accomplished using rather weakly branched polymers characterized by fractal dimension D < 1. 5 under deposition conditions in which the silica condensation rate is minimized. By analogy to organic polymer sols and gels, we believe that the breadth of the pore size distribution can be influenced by the occurrence of micro-phase separation during membrane deposition. Minimization of the condensation rate not only fosters polymer collapse but should inhibit phase separation, leading to a narrower pore size distribution. The formation of microporosity through collapse of the gel network requires that small pores are achieved at the expense of membrane porosity. Incorporation of organic template ligands within a dense silica matrix followed by their removal allows us to independently control pore size and pore volume through the size and volume fraction of the organic template. Such strategies can be used to create microporous films with large volume fraction porosities...|$|R

In the case of gas separation both dense and porous materials {{have been developed for}} different application where hydrogen production {{is one of the most}} important niches of development. Hydrogen is being one of the most important vectors to develop alternative clean power generation sources. Nowadays, a lot of processes require the fabrication of pure hydrogen for efficiency and better performance. Different materials have been reported as gas separation membranes but still numerous problems related to stability, cost and fabrication must be overcome. The actual goal is to achieve materials that report good separation properties in new type of configuration facing industrial applications. Carbon molecular sieve membranes (CMSM) achieve high separation factors and permeance values than polymeric membranes. During the last 30 years they have gained importance due to their excellent performance as gas separation membranes. However, most research work has been focused on flat or hollow fiber configurations and minor attention has been done to supported CMSM. The main reason is due the difficulties associated to fabricate a defect free membrane using a highly reproducible fabrication method that allow to obtain a carbon layer after one polymer precursor coating step. In tubular configuration, these hybrid membranes are suitable for scaling up towards industrial applications, being more competitive than commercial unsupported hollow fiber membranes and films, especially under high pressure and temperature. The main objective of this work was to explore alternative fabrication methods for the fabrication of supported CMSM. In order to achieve this objective polyimide was coated over inorganic supports using two different approaches. The two methods reported in this thesis were spinning-coating and dip-coating. The idea of spinning¬coating was adapted from fabrication of supported carbon planar film. In this work it was developed the same idea coating TiO 2 tubular supports under rotation with polyimide (Matrimid®). The thickness of the carbon membranes was controlled adjusting the viscosity of the polymeric solution, and after an exhaustive solvent i elimination it was possible to obtain a defect free carbon membrane. The influence of methanol washing, pyrolysis temperature (550 - 700 ºC), and presence of the support allowed to extracting conclusions about the characteristics of the carbon material. Single gas permeance of H 2, CO, CO 2, N 2, CH 4 were obtained and ideal selectivity computed from this measurements indicated the presence of pinholes on the carbon membrane. However, the characterization of this carbon obtained after 550 º and 700 º C by adsorption-desorption analysis allowed to confirm the microporosity of the carbon layer. As an important contribution of this work the influence of the support as pore modifier of the carbon structure is presented after analysis of supported and unsupported samples. Different characterization techniques are presented and integrated in this work to analyze the microporous character of the carbon layer (immersion calorimetry, AFM) and to evaluate the mesoporous characteristics of the asymmetric membrane (liquid-liquid displacement porosimetry). An additional coating procedure with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was performed to decrease the influence of pinholes which caused a permeance decrease but increase on ideal selectivity values over Knudsen theoretical index. As a second fabrication technique, the modification of Al 2 O 3 inorganic support allowed to achieve microporosity in the support that allowed the fabrication of CMSM by dip¬coating procedure. Similarly <b>to</b> the <b>dip-coating</b> method, viscosity and polymer concentration were optimized in order to achieve high ideal separation factors for hydrogen pairs. For the type of membranes obtained by this method single gas permeance of H 2, He, CO 2, O 2, N 2, CH 4, Propane, n-butane, 1 -butene, SF 6 was performed. Influence of pyrolysis temperature, aging, non-solvent immersion, and support were also studied as pore modifier of the carbon membrane. However, for these membranes the characterization was focused on the effect on permeance and selectivity more than in the characterization of the material. The findings described in this PhD thesis open new perspectives for alternative fabrication techniques of CMSM. This work reports not only the permeance and selective properties of CMSM as the traditional approaches rule. Moreover, brings how each fabrication variable could affect the final properties of the membrane. Integration of structure and properties are presented as an alternative strategy to design new pore architecture on CMSM...|$|R
40|$|Integration of {{conjugated}} luminescent polymers into three-dimensional silicon microstructures for cell culturing and diagnostics Although {{in nature}} cells reside in environments with three-dimensional features, {{most of what}} is known about cell proliferation-differentiation-death has been derived from cultures on flat surfaces, such as Petri dishes or glass slides. Investigating and monitoring cell cultures into a three-dimensional matrix has been demonstrated to highlight major effects on cell behaviour, from adhesion and differentiation to apoptosis, that are not similarly evident from cell cultures on flat substrates. The recent progress in cell culture and microfabrication technologies has suggested the development of a novel generation of label-free cell-based sensors for drug discovery, clinical diagnostics, and detection of toxic agents. Such a new-generation of cell-based biosensors exploits living cells in three-dimensional microstructures as bioreceptors and allows cell morpho-functional changes and/or detachment, induced by exposure to environmental perturbations, to be monitored by a suitable transduction (i. e. optical, electrical) method, possibly in a non-invasive and label-free manner. A number of label-free biosensors exploiting different electrical and optical transduction mechanisms has been reported so far. The main objective of this thesis is the development of a three-dimensional silicon microstructure for 3 D cell cultures and diagnostics. The microstructure consists of a microstructured silicon substrate featuring a two-dimensional array of square holes (size of about 40 micron x 40 micron and depth of about 50 micron) with spatial periods of 70 microns. Anchor structures characterized by a two-dimensional periodicity are integrated between adjacent holes. A photoluminescent and/or electroluminescent conducting polymer film is deposited at the bottom of each hole, so that, upon suitable excitation, the light emitted by the polymer can be used for investigating the biological material. In fact, from the spectral analysis of the light transmitted at each hole through the biological material, {{it might be possible to}} identify cells featuring special characteristics, such as tumour cells that have a higher volume and refractive index with respect to healthy cells. The proposed microstructure has been fabricated by silicon electrochemical micromachining (ECM) technology in a single etching step. ECM advanced features, such as dynamic control of the etching anisotropy (from 1 to 0) as the electrochemical etching progresses, allow the silicon dissolution to be switched in real-time from the anisotropic to the isotropic regime and enable advanced silicon microstructuring to be achieved through the use of high-aspect-ratio functional and sacrificial structures, the former being functional to the microsystem operation and the latter being sacrificed for accurate microsystem fabrication. We investigated several deposition techniques, ranging from spin-coating <b>to</b> drop-casting and <b>dip-coating.</b> The deposition of the luminescent polymer film on the bottom of the culturing wells is not trivial owing to the very high aspect ratio of these wells. The polymer film coverage has been investigated via Fluorescence Microscopy and the best results have been reached depositing the polymer by dip-coating. The device performances have been investigated via optical excitation with a laser emitting within the absorption band of the polymer and collecting, then, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The present work has been focused on the microstructure realization and on the polymer film integration in such structure, but long-term developments could regard the microstructure performance improvement. It is to be highlighted that, even if this is a feasibility study, the results are encouraging for further investigations. By properly designing the anchor structure, in fact, such structure could act as a two-dimensional photonic crystal. If the photonic crystal structure band-gap falls in the wavelength range of polymer photoluminescence/electroluminescence emission, a confinement of the light emitted by the polymer film in the out-of-plane (perpendicular to the substrate surface) direction is expected. The resulting reduction of optical losses in the in-plane directions (parallel to the substrate surface) and the increased coupling efficiency with cells living in the holes could improve the microstructure performance...|$|R
