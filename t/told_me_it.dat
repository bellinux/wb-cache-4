One resident told the Birmingham Mail, [...] "They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was about living as a community and how we all got along. But the actual programme doesn't show any of that.

[...] Responding to allegations the residents were duped, Nick Mirsky said that Love Productions had spent much time consulting the residents before filming began, and that process continued afterwards: [...] "Key contributors have been offered viewings of the programmes during the editing period and were {{given the opportunity to}} comment on them. Both Love and Channel 4 listened to any concerns raised, and in some cases made changes to the programme to accommodate them."

Program director Patti Marshall of Q102 said [...] "It's ok to put in on an album, have fun with it, but we're publicly owned, you know? [...] It's not about us. It's about the mom in the minivan with her 8-year-old." [...] WFLZ's Tommy Chuck said his station produced their own edit of the song that replaced [...] "seek" [...] with [...] "see", with the station's disc jockeys referring to it as [...] "If U See Amy".|$|E
