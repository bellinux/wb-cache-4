5|$|Around 877, Æthelred {{wrote to}} Pope John VIII to {{complain}} about King Alfred's conduct towards Canterbury. The exact nature of the dispute is not clear, but the reply from the pope to the archbishop still exists. The pope told the archbishop that Canterbury had papal support and that the pope had written to the king urging the king to respect {{the rights of the}} archbishop. The writer Justin Pollard sees this letter as evidence of papal support for <b>the</b> <b>deposition</b> of Alfred, which Pollard alleges occurred at Christmas 878 and that <b>the</b> <b>deposition</b> was supported by Æthelred. Other historians, however, do not agree that there was a deposition of the king supported by the archbishop at this time.|$|E

40|$|The {{destruction}} and spoliation of Hailes Abbey after the dissolution {{was not an}} uncommon occurrence across England and Wales during the reformation. What is unusual about Hailes Abbey is that documents exist in which first person <b>depositions</b> describe <b>the</b> spoliation and destruction occurring after the monks and inhabitants had left. These documents {{form the basis of}} this thesis in which they are used {{to take a closer look}} at the architectural fabric of Hailes Abbey just before and just after the closure of the abbey. This thesis has three parts. First, it takes a look at the monastic landscape at Hailes and what <b>the</b> <b>depositions</b> reveal about <b>the</b> layout and outbuildings within the precinct. Second, it discusses what <b>the</b> <b>depositions</b> reveal about <b>the</b> claustral buildings and the inner precinct. Finally, it attempts to lookc at local reuse of Hailes Abbey fabric based on <b>the</b> <b>depositions</b> and <b>the</b> location of the ndividuals named or implicated in <b>the</b> <b>depositions.</b> <b>The</b> research reveals the unique layout and the trend towards personal and individual privacy for the monks just before the dissolution...|$|R
30|$|The Maxwell {{resistance}} Rb and {{the capacity}} Cb describe the slowest process during <b>the</b> Co <b>deposition.</b> It {{could be related to}} <b>the</b> indirect Co <b>deposition</b> via Co(OH) 2 as experimentally observed by Santos et al. [18]. This process takes place in parallel to <b>the</b> direct Co <b>deposition</b> process. Therefore, Rb is assigned to the charge transfer resistance of <b>the</b> Co <b>deposition</b> process via Co(OH) 2. The constant gain in Rb indicates that <b>the</b> Co <b>deposition</b> via this process becomes more and more unfavorable compared to <b>the</b> direct Co <b>deposition</b> process represented by Ra. After around 10.5  min, the charge transfer resistances of Ra and Rb exhibit the same value. This allows splitting <b>the</b> entire Co <b>deposition</b> process into two sections. In section I, Rb is lower than Ra. This means that <b>the</b> Co <b>deposition</b> occurs primarily via the indirect mechanism (via Co(OH) 2). In section II, the situation is vice versa. <b>The</b> Co <b>deposition</b> occurs primarily via the direct mechanism. The share of <b>the</b> direct Co <b>deposition</b> out of <b>the</b> overall process is determined by 1 [*]−[*]Ra / (Ra[*]+[*]Rb). Consequently, the share of <b>the</b> Co <b>deposition</b> via Co(OH) 2 is given by 1 [*]−[*]Rb / (Ra[*]+[*]Rb). The absence of strong oscillations in Rb also indicates that this process appears to be independent from the ending of the diffusion limitation of boric acid.|$|R
40|$|The 1641 {{rebellion}} {{is unique}} in early modern European violence and armed struggles because of the vast collection of over 8, 000 eyewitness accounts known as <b>the</b> 1641 <b>depositions.</b> My dissertation seeks to utilize <b>the</b> <b>depositions</b> to uncover <b>the</b> religious worldviews of early modern Irish men and women. Through close readings of <b>the</b> <b>depositions,</b> as well as polemical literature which cited <b>the</b> <b>depositions</b> as source material, the following chapters analyze how survivors and polemicists alike invoked religious language to despicted confessional differences and the workings of divine providence in seventeenth-century Ireland. In particular, this dissertation focuses on two related themes: how refugees described the conflicts and violence they had experienced and how eyewitness accounts were co-opted and edited by later authors to serve as propaganda. <b>The</b> <b>depositions</b> clearly portray deponents 2 ̆ 7 understandings of differences in religious identity and their familiarity with providential explanations of the crises to which they had f victim. While much subsequent polemical literature presented the conflict in strictly confessionalized terms, a comparative analysis of contemporary propaganda alongside <b>the</b> <b>depositions</b> shows that strategic editing of source materials betrayed the deponents 2 ̆ 7 nuanced depictions of religious identity and their providential interpretations of {{the progress of the}} violence of the 1640 s. Broadening the context of the rebellion to include similar providentialist propaganda from the Thirty Years War, this dissertation shows the extent to which providential imagery in eyewitness accounts and war propaganda polarized religious identities in print. In making this point, my research contributes to broader interests in the over-simplification of religious language and imagery to define in-groups and out-groups in wartime rhetoric...|$|R
