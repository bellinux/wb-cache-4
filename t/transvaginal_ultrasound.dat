5|$|<b>Transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> {{to examine}} the endometrial {{thickness}} in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E

5000|$|As of March 2012, 20 {{states require}} {{that a person}} seeking an {{abortion}} have an ultrasound before being allowed to have the procedure. Mandatory <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> have been particularly controversial. In Texas, for instance, even if previous ultrasounds had indicated severe congenital defects, a woman seeking an abortion was required under a 2012 law to have another ultrasound done, [...] "administered by her abortion doctor, and {{had to listen to}} a state-mandated description of the fetus she was about to abort", though state-issued guidelines later did away with that ultrasound if the fetus had an [...] "irreversible medical condition".|$|R
5000|$|Diagnosis can be {{made using}} {{ultrasound}} or laparoscopy testing. The condition can also be diagnosed with a venogram, CT scan, or an MRI. Ultrasound is the diagnostic tool most commonly used. Recent research from a leading pelvic venous unit has suggested that <b>Transvaginal</b> Duplex <b>Ultrasound</b> scanning is the [...] "Gold Standard" [...] test for pelvic venous reflux. The same research group {{has shown that the}} size of the veins - as shown by venography and also used as the diagnostic criteria in CT and MRI - is not relevant and only <b>Transvaginal</b> Duplex <b>Ultrasound</b> shows the venous reflux that causes the problem.|$|R

25|$|Diagnosis {{of ovarian}} cancer starts with a {{physical}} examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery. The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.|$|E
40|$|Endometriosis in the {{adolescent}} has, in recent years, been discovered to be a challenging problem in gynaecology. Although the pain may start {{at a young}} age, even {{before the onset of}} menstruation, the diagnosis by laparoscopy is almost always postponed for several years, by which time destructive lesions have affected the tubo-ovarian structures and severely compromised fecundability. Several factors may play a role, but one important reason for this disease progression {{is likely to be the}} delay in diagnosis. Therefore, <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> and <b>transvaginal</b> access with a less invasive needle endoscopy are recommended for exploration of the pelvis, diagnosis of endometriosis and treatment at an early stage before severe lesions develop. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Currently, all PGD embryos are {{obtained}} by assisted reproductive technology, although {{the use of}} natural cycles and in vivo fertilization followed by uterine lavage was attempted {{in the past and}} is now largely abandoned. In order to obtain a large group of oocytes, the patients undergo controlled ovarian stimulation (COH). COH is carried out either in an agonist protocol, using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues for pituitary desensitisation, combined with human menopausal gonadotrophins (hMG) or recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), or an antagonist protocol using recombinant FSH combined with a GnRH antagonist according to clinical assessment of the patient’s profile (age, body mass index (BMI), endocrine parameters). hCG is administered when at least three follicles of more than 17mm mean diameter are seen at <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> scan. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval is scheduled 36 hours after hCG administration. Luteal phase supplementation consists of daily intravaginal administration of 600µg of natural micronized progesterone.|$|E
25|$|Screening by {{hysteroscopy}} {{to obtain}} cell samples obtained for histological examination is being developed. This {{is similar to}} the current pap smear that is used to detect cervical cancer. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening is testing a screening technique that combines CA-125 blood tests with <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> Other studies suggest that this screening procedure may be effective. However, it's not yet clear if this approach could actually help to save lives—the full results of the trial will be published in 2015. One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery. The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population. Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.|$|E
25|$|Oocytes can be {{collected}} from most mammalian species. Conventional oocyte collection is when ovaries {{are removed from}} a donor animal; this is done posthumously in slaughter facilities. The ovaries are kept warm as they are brought back to a laboratory for oocyte collection. Keeping the ovaries warm helps increase the success rate of fertilization. Once collected the oocytes are assessed and categorized into small, medium, and large, and then matured for 20–23 hours. This simple, inexpensive technique can lead to about 24 oocytes collected from a bovine. Conventional oocyte collection is especially useful for females who unexpectedly die or who are incapable of being bred due to injury. A second option for oocyte collection is to utilize the <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> guided oocyte collection method otherwise known as TUGA. Collection technique varies slightly by species, but the general methods for collection are the same; a needle is inserted into each ovarian follicle and pulled out via vacuum. The major benefit of using this method {{is the ability to}} expand the lifetime reproductive productivity, or the number of productive days an animal is in her estrous cycle. Pregnant cows and mares continue to develop new follicles until the middle of pregnancy. Thus, TUGA can be used to substantially increase the fitness of an individual because the female then has the potential produce more than one offspring per gestation.|$|E

30|$|The {{diagnosis}} of these rare tumors can be problematic, {{especially in the}} case of a nonpalpable ovarian tumor. A careful study of the patient’s history can eliminate medications as a cause of virilization and hirsutism. Our patient did not take any medicines. Development of defeminization followed by virilization can be a helpful sign for diagnosis. Preoperative evaluation for women with virilization includes a bimanual examination, serum testosterone, DHEA-S, and computerized tomography (CT) of the adrenals and ovaries [5]. Although a CT can identify an adrenal mass as small as 1.5  cm, transabdominal and <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> are very useful in evaluating ovarian tumor size and morphology [6]. Therefore, a gray-scale transvaginal sonography combined with color Doppler studies can make the {{diagnosis of}} small steroid cell tumors easier, and at times, better than more costly imaging modalities [7]. In this study, we followed this suggestion and demonstrated the “characteristic” ultrasonogram of this small tumor that was very useful in the preoperative assessment.|$|R
30|$|Vaginal {{ultrasound}} is {{not only}} used for assessment of organs and structures within the female pelvis, but also for evaluation of postvoid residual urine volume and bladder wall thickness. Pelvic varicose veins can also be identified directly via <b>transvaginal</b> Doppler <b>ultrasound.</b> Pelvic varicose veins {{is defined as the}} presence of dilated (diameter ≥ 7  mm), tortuous vessels with reflux (presence of bidirectional flow during Valsalva’s maneuver).|$|R
2500|$|In {{the case}} of blood loss, pain, or both, <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> is performed. [...] If a viable intrauterine {{pregnancy}} is not found with ultrasound, blood tests (serial βHCG tests) can be performed to rule out ectopic pregnancy, which is a life-threatening situation.|$|E
2500|$|Where no intrauterine {{pregnancy}} is seen on ultrasound, measuring β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels may {{aid in the}} diagnosis. The rationale is that a low β-hCG level may indicate that the {{pregnancy is}} intrauterine but yet {{too small to be}} visible on ultrasonography. While some physicians consider that the threshold where an intrauterine pregnancy should be visible on <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> is around 1500 IU/ml of β-hCG, a review in the JAMA Rational Clinical Examination Series showed that there is no single threshold for the β-human chorionic gonadotropin that confirms an ectopic pregnancy. [...] Instead, the best test in a pregnant woman is a high resolution <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> The presence of an adnexal mass {{in the absence of an}} intrauterine pregnancy on transvaginal sonography increases the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy 100-fold (LR+ 111). [...] When there are no adnexal abnormalities on transvaginal sonography, the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy decreases (LR- 0.12). An empty uterus with levels higher than 1500 IU/ml may be evidence of an ectopic pregnancy, but may also be consistent with an intrauterine pregnancy which is simply too small to be seen on ultrasound. If the diagnosis is uncertain, it may be necessary to wait a few days and repeat the blood work. This can be done by measuring the β-hCG level approximately 48 hours later and repeating the ultrasound. The serum hCG ratios and logistic regression models appear to be better than absolute single serum hCG level. If the β-hCG falls on repeat examination, this strongly suggests a spontaneous abortion or rupture. The fall in serum hCG over 48 hours may be measured as the hCG ratio, which is calculated as: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{method for}} {{quantifying}} risk {{of ovarian cancer}} is the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA), observes levels over time and [...] determines if they are increasing rapidly enough to warrant <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> The Risk of Ovarian Malignancy algorithm uses CA-125 levels and HE4 levels to calculate the risk of ovarian cancer; {{it may be more}} effective than RMI. The IOTA models can be used to estimate the probability that an adnexal tumor is malignant. They include LR2 risk model, The Simple Rules risk (SRrisk) calculation and Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the Adnexa (ADNEX) model {{that can be used to}} assess risk of malignancy in an adnexal mass, based on its characteristics and risk factors. The QCancer (Ovary) algorithm is used to predict likelihood of ovarian cancer from risk factors.|$|E
50|$|According to RadiologyInfo, {{ultrasounds}} {{are useful}} in the detection of pelvic abnormalities and can involve techniques known as abdominal (transabdominal) <b>ultrasound,</b> vaginal (<b>transvaginal</b> or endovaginal) <b>ultrasound</b> in women, and also rectal (transrectal) ultrasound in men.|$|R

50|$|In 2000, Prof Mark Whiteley {{made the}} {{association}} between some leg varicose veins and pelvic venous reflux (PVR).

Along with Alice Whiteley, his daughter and {{also one of the}} Whiteley Clinic Summer Research Fellows in 2012, they identified that untreated pelvic vein reflux was a common cause of recurrent varicose veins.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of ultrasound, this {{diagnosis}} was most often made after a stillbirth or neonatal death in which the mother had ruptured her membranes, had some bleeding, and delivered an exsanguinated baby. In these cases, examination of the placenta and membranes after delivery would show evidence of a velamentous cord insertion with rupture of the vessels. However, with almost universal use of ultrasound in the developed world, many cases are now detected during pregnancy, giving the opportunity to deliver the baby before this catastrophic rupture of the membranes occurs. [...] Vasa previa is diagnosed with ultrasound when echolucent linear or tubular structures are found overlying the cervix or {{in close proximity to}} it. <b>Transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasound</b> is the preferred modality. Color, power and pulsed wave Doppler should be used to confirm that the structures are fetal vessels. The vessels will demonstrate a fetal arterial or venous waveform.|$|E
