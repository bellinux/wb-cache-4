500|$|... "Barge of the Dead" [...] was {{the first}} episode to provide a {{detailed}} account of Gre'thor, which was previously referenced only in Star Trek: The Next Generation. The title was developed from [...] "the Klingon belief that the dead travel to Gre'thor on a barge steered by a ferryman". Religious studies scholars Ross Kraemer, William Cassidy, and Susan L Schwartz interpreted the representation of Gre'thor and Klingon spirituality as borrowing from Norse and Greek mythology, specifically the crossing of the rainbow bridge Bifröst or the river Styx. Exploring the influence of the Greek story of Odysseus (Latin: Ulysses) on Star Trek: Voyager, the Classical philologist Otta Wenskus points to Siren-like creatures who call out with the voices of those loved by those on the barge. Though the motif of a barge and ferryman is not present in Homer's portrayal of the underworld in the Odyssey, it was subsequently popularized by its use in Virgil's Aeneid and Dante's Inferno. <b>The</b> <b>pediatrician</b> Victor Grech, in a paper on Klingon culture, interpreted Torres' belief in the Klingon mythological figure Fek'lhr, who tortures the souls of the dishonored, as being in line with Catholic views of Satan.|$|E

Sociodemographic and professional data and data regarding habitual physical activity and pediatricians’ knowledge and instructions for young people regarding physical activity were collected using a questionnaire. Absolute and relative frequencies and means and standard deviations were calculated. ResultsMost pediatricians were females, had graduated from medical school more than 15 years ago, and had residency in pediatrics. More than 70 % of the participants reported to include physical activity guidance in their prescriptions. On the other hand, approximately two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>pediatricians</b> incorrectly reported that children should not work out and less than 15 % answered the question about physical activity barriers correctly. With respect to the two questions about physical activity to tackle obesity, incorrect answers were marked by more than 50 % of <b>the</b> <b>pediatricians.</b> Most participants incorrectly reported that 30 min should be the minimum daily time of physical activity in young people.

An article in the American Medical Association's Journal of Ethics argues that if a pediatrician learns that parents of a 12-year-old patient seek conversion therapy, <b>the</b> <b>pediatrician</b> can advise against [...] "the ineffective and potentially harmful intervention" [...] while being culturally sensitive of their religious objections to homosexuality. The authors argue that the doctor's medical ethics means they should place {{the interests of the}} patient above the cultural sensitivities of the parents, and confidentially counsel the patient about resources for LGBT youth facing bullying, and advise the parents about resources for parents of LGBT children. In 2014, major therapy professional bodies in the United Kingdom issued a joint consensus statement opposing conversion therapy.

40|$|Aim: To {{look through}} the {{knowledge}} and attitudes of <b>the</b> <b>pediatricians</b> in our country, about the human papillomavirus vaccine, licenced recently in Turkey and the vaccination. Materials and Methods: The survey was sent to 1417 pediatricians between September and December 2007. Statistical analysis were performed by using SPSS 11. 5 software. Results: The survey response rate was 30. 9 % and male/ female ratio was found as 240 / 198. 92. 9 % of <b>the</b> <b>pediatricians</b> knew that HPV infection {{was the most important}} risk factor for cervical cancer. 76. 9 % of participants thought that HPV vaccine was effective in preventing cervical cancer. 91. 1 % of <b>the</b> <b>pediatricians</b> recommended vaccination. <b>The</b> vaccination was suggested particularly for the girls aged between 10 and 12 years (p= 0. 001). The rate of recommending vaccination for boys was lower than that of girls for all age groups. The concern of 76. 9 % of <b>the</b> <b>pediatricians,</b> not recommending vaccination, was the vaccination cost, while 46. 2 % of them have concernes considering the worries of parents about the probability for the vaccination to cause risky sexual behaviours. In multivariate analysis, it was determined that the participants’ characteristics and the correct response rates do not have any effects on recommending HPV vaccine. Conclusions: This is the first national survey about the knowledge and attitudes of <b>the</b> <b>pediatricians,</b> in Turkey, regarding HPV vaccine. This vaccine was especially recommended for girls. Although the rate of recommending vaccination is high, pediatricians have some concerns related to the cost of vaccination and parents’ negative thoughts about the vaccination.
