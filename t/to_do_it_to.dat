500|$|When {{he began}} work on the score for A New Beginning, Manfredini created a theme just for the {{character}} of Tommy Jarvis. The idea was {{to suggest that there}} was [...] "madness afoot", which he believed helped to [...] "'point the finger' at various characters [...] to suggest that things were not as you might expect". For Jason Lives, Tom McLoughlin instructed Manfredini to create a score that would not alert the audience about what was happening or about to happen, [...] "but instead allow the audience <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> themselves". McLoughlin took this idea from John Carpenter's 1978 film Halloween, which would always follow any shock in the film with Carpenter's [...] "Eeeeeeee!" [...] sound. McLoughlin wanted something more subtle, with a [...] "Gothic" [...] resonance.|$|E
500|$|On {{creating}} the character, Fazekas said the writers [...] "wanted {{to be really}} specific about who the woman is that Jarvis is just madly in love with" [...] in order to highlight the strong, platonic relationship Jarvis has with Carter. Fazekas added, [...] "It makes sense in that, Jarvis likes Peggy Carter, so of course the woman he's in love with {{would not be a}} quiet, prim and proper lady ... We also wanted to be very clear that Peggy and Ana really like each other, and that there's no jealousy from Ana. Ana and Jarvis are so comfortable in their relationship, they're not going to be jealous of other people coming in and out of their lives." [...] On some of the differences between Ana and Edwin, Verbeek said, [...] "The first scene we had I walk in and I smack him on his ass, which is a sort of sexual, playful, fun thing they have. That's not something he would do, that's something she does, and he loves it." [...] D'Arcy later revealed that Verbeek had improvised this on their first day on set, after having [...] " [...] flown in", calling it [...] "brilliantly courageous ... <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> an actor you don’t know" [...] and [...] "so perfectly what they were hoping that Ana would be like." ...|$|E

40|$|In vitro {{susceptibility}} {{testing of}} Fusarium {{is becoming increasingly}} important because of frequency and diversity of infections and because resistance profiles are species-specific. Reference methods for antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) are those of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility (EUCAST), but breakpoints (BPs) {{have not yet been}} established. One of the problems is that phylogenetic distances between Fusarium species are much smaller than between species of, e. g., Candida. Epidemiological cutoff values (ECVs) for some Fusarium species have been determined in order to differentiate wild-type from non-wild-type isolates. In clinical routine, commercially available assays such as Etest, Sensititre or others provide essential agreement with reference methods. Our objective is to summarize antifungal susceptibility testing of Fusarium genus in the clinical laboratory: how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> when <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and how <b>to</b> interpret <b>it...</b>|$|R
