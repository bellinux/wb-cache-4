60|$|He {{took it as}} a compliment. His {{enthusiasm for}} nature was but the drivelling {{sensibility}} of the drunkard. Nor had Mackintosh any sympathy for his chief's feelings towards the natives. He loved them because they were in his power, as a selfish man loves his dog, and his mentality was on a level with theirs. Their humour was obscene and he was never at a loss for the lewd remark. He understood them and they understood him. He was proud of his influence over them. He looked upon them as his children and he mixed himself in all their affairs. But he was very jealous of his authority; if he ruled them with a rod of iron, brooking no contradiction, he would not suffer any of the white men on the island to take advantage of them. He watched the missionaries suspiciously and, if they did anything of which he disapproved, was able to make life so unendurable to them that if he could not get them removed they were glad to go of their own accord. His power over the natives was so great that on his word they would refuse labour and food to their pastor. On the other hand he showed the <b>traders</b> <b>no</b> favour. He took care that they should not cheat the natives; he saw that they got a fair reward for their work and their copra and that the traders made no extravagant profit on the wares they sold them. He was merciless to a bargain that he thought unfair. Sometimes the traders would complain at Apia that they did not get fair opportunities. They suffered for it. Walker then hesitated at no calumny, at no outrageous lie, to get even with them, and they found that if they wanted not only to live at peace, but to exist at all, they had to accept the situation on his own terms. More than once the store of a trader obnoxious to him had been burned down, and there was only the appositeness of the event to show that the administrator had instigated it. Once a Swedish half-caste, ruined by the burning, had gone to him and roundly accused him of arson. Walker laughed in his face.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the dynamics of inflation and their effect on production, using the example of the Polish reconstruction process after World War I. In 1918, Poland had to be re-established as a state after 123 years of foreign rule as well as reconstructed due to severe destruction experienced during the war. Nevertheless, the reconstruction process was extremely rapid, and the thesis argues that it was inflation which provided the means to build up the state. Inflation redistributed wealth within the society and imposed a high savings quota on the economy. The printing press inflation carried the economy through to hyperinflation. The positive effects of the process already explain in part why inflation could last so long and why the economy went all the way through to hyperinflation. The thesis then argues that stabilisation was a political problem and was only achieved once the inflationary process ceased to create winners and losers. The positive business climate began to deteriorate when <b>traders</b> <b>no</b> longer used past inflation as an indicator for price setting, but instead used changes in the exchange rate. However, inflation reappeared shortly after fiscal reform, due to the inevitable credit requirements of Polish industry. Inflation had eroded savings and distorted the economy: this was the major short-coming of this peculiar way of mobilising the country's resources. Consequently, a credit inflation emerged still in 1924 as industry tried to adjust to market requirements in the post-inflationary crisis. Stabilisation was only finally achieved when the economy moved out of recession in 1926. Lastly, the thesis sheds new light on the generalisation about the European inflationary experiences of the 1920 s. It introduces a distinction between exogenously and endogenously imposed inflation, which suggests a more specific definition of the transition into hyperinflation {{as well as of the}} exact requirements for stabilisation. It also reduces these exceptional economic occurrences to reparations, on the one hand, and reconstruction, on the other...|$|E
40|$|O tema de pesquisa da dissertação proposta é a análise da relação entre o retorno anormal e o volume anormal de negociações das ações que compõe o índice Ibovespa. Como questões se investigam qual a relação dinâmica e contemporânea entre o retorno anormal e volume anormal e entre a volatilidade do retorno anormal e o volume anormal, e qual a relação dinâmica e contemporânea entre o retorno da ação e volume negociado e entre a volatilidade do retorno e o volume negociado. Como método de pesquisa desenvolveu-se pesquisas bibliográficas e estudo das séries temporais das ações que compunham o índice Ibovespa em 30 de Maio de 2008, tratadas com o uso de regressões múltiplas defasadas, com o modelo GJR-GARCH e com a análise de causalidade de Granger. Como resultados o trabalho não permite afirmações conclusivas com relação a significância das relações visto que em algumas ações a relação existe de forma significativa e em outras não, porém mostra que o volume pode ser utilizado como prognóstico do movimento dos preços para algumas ações em {{particular}} em operações de <b>traders</b> <b>no</b> uso de análise técnica.
