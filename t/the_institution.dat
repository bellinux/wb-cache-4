40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this study}} is the need to save the Nigerian public tertiary institutions from going into extinction from under-funding. Funding of <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> is currently on the basis of ownership. There is currently conflict of citizens’ right to education at whatever level at reduced cost or no cost at all and government’s inability to meet the cost of education. Government end up giving what it thinks it can afford and not what <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> need to operate effectively. On the other hand <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> are not given the free hand to determine what the beneficiaries of their services should pay. This study recommends that <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> should be seen as separate entities from government and therefore be allowed to determine the price for their services. Citizens’ right should be met through educational subsidies from all levels of government. The balance fees should be picked by the beneficiaries of the services of <b>the</b> <b>institutions.</b> This is <b>the</b> surest way to the survival of tertiary <b>institutions</b> in <b>the</b> Nigerian environment...|$|R
