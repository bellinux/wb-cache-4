25|$|Hype aside, Private Parts made news {{because it}} was able <b>to</b> <b>engross</b> even the most {{conservative}} of audiences with its bittersweet (and unexpectedly moving) story about 3 transsexuals trying to find their place in life.

Not to mention Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo donning even bigger bouffants and bosoms in To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything (1995).|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the fifth}} chapter of the Bala Kanda Book of the Adhyatma Ramayana (embedded in the Brahmanda Purana, c. 14th century) is {{dedicated}} to the Ahalya episode. Like most other versions of the story, Ahalya is turned into stone and advised <b>to</b> <b>engross</b> herself in meditation of Rama, [...] "the Supreme Lord". When Rama touches the stone with his foot on Vishvamitra's advice, Ahalya rises as a beautiful maiden and sings a long panegyric dedicated to Rama. She describes his iconographic form and exalts him as an avatar of Vishnu and source of the universe to whom many divinities pay their respects. After worshipping him, she returns to Gautama. At the end of the narrative, Ahalya's hymn is prescribed as an ideal benediction for a devotee to gain Rama's favour. The Awadhi Ramacharitamanasa (16th century) drops the narrative of Indra's visit to Ahalya. In this epic, Vishvamitra tells Rama that the cursed Ahalya has assumed the form of a rock and is patiently awaiting the dust from Rama's feet. Ahalya tells Rama that Gautama was right to pronounce the curse, and she deems it as the greatest favour, for as a result, she feasted her eyes on Rama, who liberated her from her worldly existence. As in the Adhyatma Ramayana, Ahalya lauds Rama as the great Lord served by other divinities, asks for the boon of eternal engrossment in his devotion and afterwards leaves for her husband's abode. The narrative ends with praise for Rama's compassion. Tulsidas alludes to this episode numerous times in the Ramacharitamanasa while highlighting the significance of Rama's benevolence. Commenting on this narrative in the Ramacharitamanasa, Rambhadracharya says that Rama destroyed three things: the sin of Ahalya by his sight, the curse by the dust of his feet and the affliction by the touch of his feet, evidenced by the use of the Tribhangi (meaning [...] "destroyer of the three") metre in the verses which form Ahalya's panegyric.|$|E

5000|$|Several reviewers {{have noted}} the {{positive}} and uplifting themes of the lyrics, such as The Observers Phil Mongredien and Jon Clark of Drowned in Sound whose review stated that [...] "the negativity often present in Eels records is less noticeable here; in fact the record contains many optimistic, if particularly frank and defiant, testimonials." [...] Michael Gallucci of The A.V. Club writes that the lyrics express E's relief after Eels' concept album trilogy. Writing for NME, Kevin E. G. Perry contrasts the optimism of the lyrics with E's personal tragedies, concluding that [...] "part of the triumph of this record is just how upbeat he sounds while talking about everything from love and loss to mortality itself." [...] Pastes Ryan Reed considers the positivity [...] "awkwardly forced" [...] leading to an album of [...] "lifeless non-revelations married <b>to</b> <b>engrossing</b> tunes".|$|R
2500|$|Another measure, {{directed}} {{directly at}} the Dutch trade system outside the direct Franco-Dutch relations, was the founding {{of a number of}} chartered trading companies that were intended to compete with the Dutch VOC and WIC, but also make inroads on the Dutch Baltic trade, like the already mentioned West India Company and the French East India Company, both formed in 1664, and given monopolies in France. These caused the Dutch some anxiety, but proved eventually not very successful. The same applied to the Compagnie du Nord that Colbert set up in 1669 to compete with the Dutch in Scandinavia. This was supposed <b>to</b> <b>engross</b> the Dutch salt trade with especially Norway, and replace it with French salt. Unfortunately, the French salt with a high magnesium content proved unfit for preserving herring (as the Dutch could have told Colbert, because they had tried to sell it to the Norwegians themselves, when the Iberian salt trade was closed to them). France therefore had to subsidise these exports, and also the otherwise uncompetitive French shipping rates. Despite government pressure the Bordeaux wine merchants [...] were unwilling to shift their exports away from Dutch carriers, or do without Dutch prefinancing of their operations. The unprofitability of its operations, combined with Dutch dumping policies in the trade of Baltic naval stores, forced the winding up of the company in 1675.|$|E
2500|$|Of course, the English {{were not}} the only [...] "victims." [...] The French, Scandinavian, and North-German merchants were also hit hard by the sudden {{resurgence}} of the Dutch in world markets. But the English were especially hit hard. This caused tremendous resentment, also because the English were not inclined to seek the fault with themselves, but suspected the Dutch of conspiring <b>to</b> <b>engross</b> world trade with means that could not be other than foul. However, this may be, the Commonwealth felt they could not take this Dutch [...] "insolence" [...] lying down. Unfortunately, unlike the Scandinavians and the Hanseatics, they were in a military position to do something about it. The Commonwealth government first tried peaceful means, like a haughty attempt to renew the English protectorate from Elizabethan and Jacobean days (based on the Treaty of Nonsuch) over the Republic, but this was politely rejected. Then Parliament passed the Navigation Act, which was intended to break the hold of the Dutch entrepot by prohibiting its re-exports to English markets, and also reserving the carrying trade to and from England to English bottoms. Of course, these blatantly protectionist measures most of all hurt the English economy and that of the English colonies. After all, the Dutch did not hold a pistol to the heads of their customers, but had achieved their ascendancy by offering better deals. English importers and consumers were now deprived of these benefits.|$|E

30|$|Pearlman (2009) {{wrote that}} the pulse of movies is central <b>to</b> <b>engrossing</b> viewers. It is worth remembering that pulse is not a metronomic beat. The three most {{important}} pulses for human beings {{are those of the}} heart, the lungs, and the feet. We know that healthy heart beats (Goldberger et al., 2002), healthy respiration (Hoop, Burton, & Kazemi, 1996), and healthy gait (Hausdorff, 2007) all have a fractal pulse. In contrast, evenly spaced heartbeats and breaths are symptoms of disease and evenness of gait is a prediction for an upcoming fall. Health has been described as coordination of multiple systems and subsystems working at different time scales. The flexible and adaptive interactions of these systems are the very basis of health, and the form of their interaction is a balance of competitive and cooperative processes (Van Orden, 2007). So, a first idea is that this seems like an appropriate metaphor for the teamwork needed in creating a movie – cooperation and competition among filmmakers, working together but trying to do their best as they see fit, manipulating the dimensions that they see fit.|$|R
