40|$|Development of an {{asymmetric}} {{axial piston}} pump for displacement-controlled system Jiahai Huang 1, 2, Hu Zhao 1, Long Quan 1, 2 and Xiaogang Zhang 1 Pump-controlled systems can eliminate throttling losses {{and improve the}} work efficiency of mobile hydraulic system. But one difficult problem for that is the differential volumetric flow <b>through</b> a single <b>rod</b> <b>cylinder</b> which is widely used in mobile hydraulic system. Several solutions have been presented {{to deal with it}} so far, but there still has not been a cost-effective solution to it. In recent years, an asymmetric pump-controlled asymmetric cylinder strategy has been presented to deal with this problem. In order to achieve this goal, an asymmetric axial piston pump with three ports was developed in this research. The flow rate ratio of the three ports of asymmetric axial piston pump was designed as 1 ::(1), in which was the area ratio of a single <b>rod</b> <b>cylinder.</b> An important task in the development of asymmetric axial piston pump was the design of the valve plate. There were three intake/discharge slots (slots A, B, and T) in the valve plate. The pumping dynamics of a fixed displacement asymmetric axial piston pump were investigated using software package ITI-SimulationX and the performances of its prototype were tested. Simulation and experimental results show that with careful design, a V-shaped cross-section groove at the leading side of slot T can effectively improve the performance of asymmetric axial piston pump, and delivery pressure performance of port B is better than that of port T. Therefore, port T should be linked with low-pressure sources such as accumulator, and port B can be connected to high pressure sources. This work lays a theoretical foundation for a new exploration to pump-controlled system...|$|R

40|$|The {{variable}} displacement pump control system has greater energy-saving advantages and application prospects than the valve control system. However, the {{variable displacement}} pump control of differential cylinder is not concurrent with the existing technologies. The asymmetric pump-controlled cylinder is, therefore, used to balance the unequal volume flow <b>through</b> a single <b>rod</b> <b>cylinder</b> in closed-circuit system. This {{is considered to be}} an effective method. Nevertheless, the asymmetric axial piston pump (AAPP) is a constant displacement pump. In this study, variable-displacement asymmetric axial piston pump (VAPP) is investigated according to the same principle used in investigating AAPP. This study, therefore, aims at investigating the characteristics of VAPP. The variable-displacement output of VAPP is implemented by controlling the swash plate angle with angle feedback control circuit, which is composed of a servo proportional valve and an angular displacement sensor. The angular displacement sensor is connected to the swash plate. The simulation model of VAPP, which is set up through the ITI-SimulationX simulation platform, is used to predict VAPP’s characteristics. The purpose of implementing the experiment is to verify the theoretical results. Both the simulation and the experiment results demonstrated that the swash plate angle is controlled by a variable mechanism; when the swash plate angle increases, the flow of Port B and Port T increases while the response speed of Port B and Port T also accelerates. When the swash plate angle is constant, the flow of Port B and Port T increases along with the increase of pump speed, although the pressure-response speed of Port B is faster than that of Port T. Consequently, the flow pulsation of Port B and Port T tends to decrease gradually along with the increase of pump speed. When the pressure loaded on Port B equals to that of Port T, the flow ripple cycle of Port B is longer than that of Port T, whereas the peak flow of Port B is higher than that of Port T. Since the flow ripple of Port T is bigger than that of Port B, Port T should be connected to the low pressure sides or the oil tank so that it does not affect VAPP’s performance. Further, to avoid the backflow of VAPP from Port T to Port B, Port T cannot be loaded alone, and the loading pressure of Port T also cannot exceed that of Port B...|$|R

50|$|This {{extremely}} simple pump {{was made}} of cast iron, and had no pistons, <b>rods,</b> <b>cylinders,</b> cranks, or flywheels. It operated by the direct action of steam on water. The mechanism consisted of two chambers. As the steam condensed in one chamber, it acted as a suction pump, while in the other chamber, steam was introduced under pressure and so it acted as a force pump. At {{the end of every}} stroke, a ball valve consisting of a small brass ball moved slightly, causing the two chambers to swap functions from suction-pump to force-pump and vice versa. The result was that the water was first suction pumped and then force pumped.|$|R

50|$|An {{application}} for telescopic cylinders commonly seen {{is that of}} the dump body on a dump truck used in a construction site. In order to empty the load of gravel completely, the dump body must be raised to an angle of about 60 degrees. To accomplish this long travel with a conventional hydraulic cylinder is very difficult considering that the collapsed length of a single stage <b>rod</b> <b>cylinder</b> is approximately 110% of its output stroke. It would be very challenging for the design engineer to fit the single stage cylinder into the chassis of the dump truck with the dump body in the horizontal rest position. This task is easily accomplished, however, using a telescopic style multi-stage cylinder.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} a {{hydraulic}} cylinder is the total of the stroke, {{the thickness of the}} piston, the thickness of bottom and head and the length of the connections. Often this length does not fit in the machine. In that case the piston rod is also used as a piston barrel and a second piston rod is used. These kinds of cylinders are called telescopic cylinders. If we call a normal <b>rod</b> <b>cylinder</b> single stage, telescopic cylinders are multi-stage units of two, three, four, five or more stages. In general telescopic cylinders are much more expensive than normal cylinders. Most telescopic cylinders are single acting (push). Double acting telescopic cylinders must be specially designed and manufactured.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the mechanism of the formation and the convection of vortices shedding from the cylinder with an upstream rod. The aerodynamic characteristics of the <b>rod</b> and <b>cylinder</b> are modelled in two dimensions by using Fluent® with laminar flow. It is found that the mean drag and the lift fluctuation of the cylinder can be reduced by the upstream rod, especially in the cavity flow mode with the rod diameters d / D = 0. 3 and 0. 5 (here d and D are the diameters of the <b>rod</b> and the <b>cylinder,</b> respectively). With <b>rod</b> diameters d / D = 0. 3 and 0. 5, the simulation indicates that there are two flow modes of the flow field around the <b>rod</b> and <b>cylinder,</b> which appear with the variation of the center-to-center spacing ratio L / D: the cavity flow mode and the wake impinge mode. There is a pair of standing vortices between the <b>rod</b> and the <b>cylinder</b> in the cavity mode, which results in the pressure decrease on the windward side of the cylinder. It is found that the characteristics of the flow significantly depend on the spacing ratio L / D. Instantaneous flow fields, force fluctuation, force spectrum and so on are presented to identify the flow modes and to understand the underlying mechanism of the cylinder drag reduction. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
