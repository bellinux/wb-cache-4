5|$|At {{the time}} of Henson's death, doctor David Gelmont first {{announced}} that he died from Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterial infection <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> bacterial pneumonia. However, on May 29, Gelmont later confirmed that Henson's {{cause of death was}} organ failure resulting from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (caused by Streptococcus pyogenes). S. pyogenes is the bacterial species <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> strep throat, scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever. It can also cause other infections.|$|E
5|$|August 28, 1995– Tropical Depression Jerry {{degenerates into}} a remnant low over Georgia, {{dropping}} heavy rainfall <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> localized serious flooding.

5|$|After {{being exposed}} to gamma {{radiation}} <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> him to transform into the monstrous Hulk, scientist Bruce Banner goes on the run and isolates himself from his love, Betty Ross.

5|$|Another test {{known as}} a phototest is the most useful in {{identifying}} solar urticaria. In this test, one centimeter segments of skin are subject to varying amounts of UVA and UVB radiation {{in order to determine}} the specific dosage of the certain form of radiation <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> the urticaria to form. When testing for its less intense form (fixed solar urticaria), phototesting should be conducted only in the areas where the hives have appeared to avoid the possibility of getting false-negative results.|$|E
50|$|An {{inadequate}} {{amount of}} a nutrient is a deficiency. Deficiencies can {{be due to}} a number of causes including inadequacy in nutrient intake called dietary deficiency, or conditions that interfere with the utilization of a nutrient within an organism. Some of the conditions that can interfere with nutrient utilization include problems with nutrient absorption, substances <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> a greater than normal need for a nutrient, conditions <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> nutrient destruction, and conditions <b>that</b> <b>cause</b> greater nutrient excretion.|$|R

5|$|Davis had {{poor health}} {{for most of}} his life, {{including}} repeated bouts of malaria, battle wounds from fighting in the Mexican–American War and a chronic eye infection that made bright light painful. He also had trigeminal neuralgia, a nerve disorder <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> severe pain in the face; it has been called one of the most painful known ailments.|$|E
5|$|Guiteau {{was indicted}} on October 14, 1881, {{for the murder}} of the President. In a chaotic trial in which Guiteau often {{interrupted}} and argued, and in which his counsel used the insanity defense, the jury found him guilty on January 5, 1882, and he was sentenced to death by hanging. Guiteau might have had neurosyphilis, a disease <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> physiological mental impairment. He was executed on June 30, 1882.|$|E

5|$|LTP has {{received}} much attention {{among those who}} study Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> marked cognitive decline and dementia. Much of this deterioration occurs in association with degenerative changes in the hippocampus and other medial temporal lobe structures. Because of the hippocampus' well established role in LTP, {{some have suggested that}} the cognitive decline seen in individuals with AD may result from impaired LTP.|$|E
5|$|October 13, 1893– A major {{hurricane}} moves ashore {{near the}} South Carolina/North Carolina border, producing record high tides in Wilmington <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> heavy coastal damage; {{damage to the}} Wilmington waterfront totals $150,000 (1893USD, $3.4million 2007USD). A total of 22lives are lost in the state due to the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Other {{conditions}} that are closely linked to cerebellar degeneration include the idiopathic progressive neurological disorders multiple system atrophy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome type I, and the autoimmune disorder paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, in which tumors elsewhere in the body elicit an autoimmune response <b>that</b> <b>causes</b> neuronal loss in the cerebellum. Cerebellar atrophy can result from an acute deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) as seen in beriberi and in Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, or from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E

5|$|Outer space {{represents}} a challenging environment for human exploration {{because of the}} dual hazards of vacuum and radiation.

In addition to these health and environmental issues, the economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into space is very high.|$|E
5|$|Pauline Bonaparte is {{represented}} as immature, expecting an ideal life of fantasy in the Caribbean, while engaging in affairs with young officers.

5|$|Pseudomembranous colitis is a {{potentially}} lethal condition {{commonly associated with}} clindamycin, but which occurs with other antibiotics, as well.
