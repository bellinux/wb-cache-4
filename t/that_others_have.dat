When individuals understand <b>that</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> goals, intentions, and attentional states, {{they are able to}} enter into and direct another's attention. Joint attention promotes and maintains dyadic exchanges and learning about the nature of social partners. The ability to engage in joint attention is crucial for language development.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all <b>that</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E

25|$|In bidding, Beasley adopted many of Culbertson's ideas, but was displeased {{with the}} strong twos and their {{negative}} response of two no trumps.

The general consensus among modern Kenji scholars is that he became estranged from the group and rejected their nationalist agenda, but a few scholars such as Akira Ueda, Gerald Iguchi and Jon Holt argue otherwise. The Kokuchūkai's official website continues to claim him as a member, also claiming that the influence of Nichirenism (the group's religio-political philosophy) {{can be seen in}} Kenji's later works such as Ame ni mo Makezu, while acknowledging <b>that</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> expressed the view that Kenji became estranged from the group after returning to Hanamaki.|$|E

2500|$|Theory of mind (often {{abbreviated}} ToM) is {{the ability}} to attribute mental states—beliefs, intents, desires, pretending, knowledge, etc.—to oneself and others and to understand <b>that</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> beliefs, desires, intentions, and perspectives that are different from one's own.

2500|$|Theory of mind is {{a theory}} insofar as the mind {{is the only thing}} being {{directly}} observed. The presumption <b>that</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> a mind is termed a theory of mind because each human can only intuit the existence of their own mind through introspection, and no one has direct access to the mind of another. It is typically assumed <b>that</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> minds analogous to one's own, and this assumption is based on the reciprocal, social interaction, as observed in joint attention, the functional use of language, and the understanding of others' emotions and actions. Having theory of mind allows one to attribute thoughts, desires, and intentions to others, to predict or explain their actions, and to posit their intentions. As originally defined, it enables one to understand that mental states can be the cause of—and thus be used to explain and predict—the behavior of others. Being able to attribute mental states to others and understanding them as causes of behavior implies, in part, that one must be able to conceive of the mind as a [...] "generator of representations". If a person does not have a complete theory of mind it may be a sign of cognitive or developmental impairment.|$|E

[...] Some nonbelievers may have hidden from themselves what seems to them to be possible evidence of the divine, but the view of the hiddenness argument is <b>that</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> tried hard to believe in God. Schellenberg addresses this difference with his distinction between culpable and inculpable nonbelief, with the latter defined as [...] "non-belief that exists through no fault of the non-believer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gandhi {{declared}} his allegiance to Advaita Vedanta, and was another popularizing force for its ideas. According to Nicholas Gier, this to Gandhi meant {{the unity of}} God and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, that atman exists and is same as everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is {{the very nature of}} this atman. Gandhi called himself advaitist many times, including his letters, but he believed <b>that</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> a right to a viewpoint different than his own because they come from a different background and perspective.

2500|$|Group members' social {{sensitivity}} {{was measured}} via the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RME) and correlated [...]26 with c. Hereby, participants {{are asked to}} detect thinking or feeling expressed in other peoples' eyes presented on pictures and assessed in a multiple choice format. The test aims to measure peoples' theory of mind (ToM), also called 'mentalizing' or 'mind reading', which refers {{to the ability to}} attribute mental states, such as beliefs, desires or intents, to other people and in how far people understand <b>that</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> beliefs, desires, intentions or perspectives different from their own ones. RME is a ToM test for adults that shows sufficient test-retest reliability and constantly differentiates control groups from individuals with functional autism or Asperger Syndrome.

ToM can be regarded as an associated subset of skills and abilities within the broader concept of emotional intelligence.|$|E
