25|$|The still-older notes, {{designed}} by Eliel Saarinen, {{were introduced in}} 1922. They also depicted people, but these were generic men and women, and did not represent any specific individuals. The fact that <b>these</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> were depicted nude caused a minor controversy at the time.|$|E
25|$|Roughly {{nine million}} Americans—mostly {{older adults with}} low incomes—are {{eligible}} for both Medicare and Medicaid. <b>These</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> tend to have particularly poor health – more than half are being treated for five or more chronic conditions—and high costs. Average annual per-capita spending for “dual-eligibles” is $20,000, compared to $10,900 for the Medicare {{population as a whole}} all enrollees.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, the Australian {{government}} {{conducted a}} review of the conditions for award of the Pacific Star, as set out in Command Paper 6833 of June 1946. As a result, the conditions for award were amended to include any member of the Australian military who was on board the Australian Hospital Ship Centaur when it was torpedoed and sunk on 14 May 1943. The Pacific Star can be awarded to <b>these</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> regardless of whether they had been awarded or were eligible for the 1939–1945 Star, the Australia Service Medal 1939–1945 or any other campaign award.|$|E
50|$|In October 1992, Holmes took 26 FEPOWs and two widows back {{to attend}} a {{memorial}} service at the Iruka (now called Itaya) memorial. <b>These</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> had for 50 years held hatred and bitterness for Japan and its people.

50|$|His {{greatest}} accomplishment, {{he told an}} interviewer, was his Mexican-American Graduate Studies Program at Notre Dame, {{which was}} funded {{by a grant from}} the Ford Foundation in 1971. He served as mentor and trainer of at least fifty-seven students who went through the program from 1971 to 1985, most of them graduating with advanced degrees in law, political science, psychology, history, government, sociology <b>and</b> economics. <b>These</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> are his legacy of scholarship and the pursuit of social justice.|$|R
25|$|After {{some time}} {{the reason for}} the {{presence}} of voluntary police officers had changed. No longer were <b>these</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> called into service only for emergencies. More and more they became part of the regular teams of police officers and started doing all sorts of regular police tasks. As of 1994, along with the first great reform of the Dutch police, police volunteers were fully integrated into the 25 regional police forces. Between 1994 and 2010, new voluntary police officers were no longer equipped with a pistol. Those who started before 1994 were allowed to keep their pistol, as long as they kept up training. Since 2005, all voluntary police officers are equipped with pepper spray. As of today, voluntary police officers are again equipped with a pistol, after having acquired a full police diploma, successfully completed several years of field-experience as an unarmed officer, and completed an additional police safety training. In 2012 the initial training program for new voluntary police officers was changed, reducing the training from three years down to one year. Dutch voluntary police officers hold the same police powers and wear the same uniform as their professional counterparts.|$|E

That year, {{in an interview with}} Stars and Stripes, she explained her [...] "against the war in Iraq but for the troops" [...] position: [...] "I don't have to be for this war to support the troops because <b>these</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> do what they think is right.

500|$|Reagan {{signed the}} Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986. The act made {{it illegal to}} knowingly hire or recruit illegal immigrants, {{required}} employers to attest to their employees' immigration status, and granted amnesty to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the United States before January 1, 1982, and {{had lived in the}} country continuously. Critics argue that the employer sanctions were without teeth and failed to stem illegal immigration. Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished Statue of Liberty, Reagan said, [...] "The legalization provisions in this act will go far {{to improve the lives of}} a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society. Very soon many of <b>these</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> will be able to step into the sunlight and, ultimately, if they choose, they may become Americans." [...] Reagan also said, [...] "The employer sanctions program is the keystone and major element. It will remove the incentive for illegal immigration by eliminating the job opportunities which draw illegal aliens here." ...|$|E

50|$|In Islam, Salafists and Wahhabis {{consider}} {{dancing in}} general to be haram (forbidden).

They are our brothers like so many others. A Christian should not forget this". The words encouraged other clerics like the Capuchin monk Père Marie-Benoît, who saved many Jews in Marseille and later in Rome where he became known among the Jewish community as [...] "father of the Jews". Marie-Rose Gineste transported a pastoral letter from Bishop Théas of Montauban by bicycle to forty parishes, denouncing the uprooting of men and women [...] "treated as wild animals", and the French Resistance smuggled the text to London, where it was broadcast to France by the BBC, reaching tens of thousands of homes.|$|E
