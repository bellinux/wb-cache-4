40|$|The {{reduction}} of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide at a dropping mercury electrode {{in an aqueous}} solution of 1 M KNO 3 + 0. 04 M KOH (pH= 12. 35) has been studied by means of impedance measurements {{as a function of}} frequency and d. c. potential. The reaction appears to be nearly reversible in the dc sense, but quasi-reversible in the ac sense. The impedance data obey the Randles' equivalent circuit with the following apparent values for the kinetic parameters: standard heterogeneous rate constant ksha= 0. 035 cm s− 1 and cathodic transfer coefficient αac= 0. 22. The results are interpreted in terms of a <b>two-step</b> <b>charge</b> transfer mechanism with the step O 2 +eO 2 − being rate-determining...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{comprehensive}} multiscale model describing charge processes of Li−O 2 batteries. On {{the basis of}} a continuum approach, the present model combines mathematical descriptions of mass transport of soluble species (O 2, Li+, LiO 2) and elementary reaction kinetics, which are assumed to be dependent on the morphology of the Li 2 O 2 formed during discharge. The simulated charge curves are in agreement with previously reported experimental studies. The model along with the assumed reaction mechanisms provides physical explanations for the <b>two-step</b> <b>charge</b> profiles. Furthermore, it suggests that these charge profiles depend {{on the size of the}} Li 2 O 2 particles, which are determined by the applied current density during discharge. Therefore, the model underlines the strong link between discharge and charge processes...|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{elements}} {{built from}} organic semiconductors, such as molecular transistors, have significant potential for technical innovations and mass use owing to their flexible mechanical properties, cost-effective processability, and tuneable optical properties. 1 Self-assembled monolayer field-effect transistors (SAMFET) {{are among the}} latest developments of novel microelectronic devices. 2 In SAMFETs, charge carriers laterally pass through a molecular layer (parallel to substrate) and exhibit transistor behavior, which can be modulated by an electrostatic gate. The charge transport properties of the SAMFETs {{are affected by the}} length of the channel. 3,[*] 4 Herein, we present a novel chip-based molecular transistor concept, which is based on charge-transfer processes across a monolayer of molecules perpendicular to the sample surface plane. To this end, redox active molecules are adsorbed to a collector electrode (CE) acting as electron-transfer mediators. A <b>two-step</b> <b>charge</b> transfer between solid interdigitated array electrodes (IDA), charge transfer mediator, and liquid-phase redox probe yields a unidirectional current response. An adsorbate-free generator electrode (GE) can be used to modulate the unidirectional currents, resulting in a transistor-like behavior. The electrochemical transistor-like system exhibits high current outputs at a low-voltage operation, high on/off switching current ratios, and is operated as a 24 -bit code generator...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} match the energy demand of {{electric}} vehicles to {{the capacity of the}} power grid, it is fundamental to understand the occupancy of charging stations and react accordingly. A Markov model of a fast charging station for Lithium-ion batteries, the most prevalent type today, is proposed. Li-Ion batteries present a <b>two-step</b> <b>charging</b> profile, which makes energy management particularly challenging. A wide range of situations is covered by considering three types of scenarios with and without waiting lines. The analytical results obtained from the steady state solution of the Markov model reveal the behavior of multiple variables of interest: availability of the charging station to accept new customers (in terms of space and energy), number of customers, energy consumption, and power utilization. From the results, indicators for assessing the quality of service (QoS) of the charging station are derived. Based on these indicators, customers may decide to wait or head toward another station. The owners of stations, in turn, can predict the impact of investments in space and energy provisioning, when devising capacity planning strategies...|$|R
40|$|Novel phototherapeutic {{methods and}} {{compositions}} are described herein. Nanoparticle-assembled microcapsules {{as a new}} type of delivery vehicle for photosensitive compounds may be synthesized through a <b>two-step</b> assembly process. <b>Charged</b> polymer chains and counterions may be combined with a photosensitive compound to form photosensitive aggregates, and then nanoparticles may be combined with the aggregates to form the microcapsules. The shell may be composed of nanoparticles and/or polymer, and the core interior may contain the photosensitive compound. Formation occurs rapidly (on the order of seconds) and the conditions are very mild (at room temperature, in aqueous solution, and at neutral pH). The microcapsule synthesis is highly suitable as an encapsulation method, particularly for a charged photosensitive molecule like ICG...|$|R
40|$|The multistep {{avalanche}} chamber permits {{an efficient}} detection of VUV photons. In a <b>two-step</b> proportional mode <b>charges</b> higher than 1 pC are obtained from single electrons. By using {{as the final}} localization step a spark chamber viewed by a TV digitizer {{it is easy to}} have imaging of complex patterns. This is applied to Cherenkov ring imaging and (K, pi) separation with 3 sigma up to 320 GeV is envisaged. The properties of various photoionizable vapours have been studied. By combining a scintillation xenon chamber with a photoionization wire chamber, a resolution of 8. 3 % (FWHM) has been obtained for 5. 9 keV X- rays using tetrakis(dimethylamine) -ethylene vapour.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the individual properties of various polyion-coated bubbles {{with a mean}} diameter ranging from 300 to 500 nm. Dark field microscopy allows one to track the individual particles of the submicron bubbles (SBs) encapsulated by the layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of cationic and anionic polyelectrolytes (PEs). Our {{focus is on the}} <b>two-step</b> <b>charge</b> reversals of PE-SB complexes: the first is a reversal from negatively charged bare SBs with no PEs added to positive SBs encapsulated by polycations (monolayer deposition), and the second is overcharging into negatively charged PE-SB complexes due to the subsequent addition of polyanions (double-layer deposition). The details of these phenomena have been clarified through the analysis of a number of trajectories of various PE-SB complexes that experience either Brownian motion or electrophoresis. The contrasted results obtained from the analysis were as follows: an amount in excess of the stoichiometric ratio of the cationic polymers was required for the first charge-reversal, whereas the stoichiometric addition of the polyanions lead to the electrical neutralization of the PE-SB complex particles. The recovery of the stoichiometry in the double-layer deposition paves the way for fabricating multi-layered SBs encapsulated solely with anionic and cationic PEs, which provides a simple protocol to create smart agents for either drug delivery or ultrasound contrast imaging.

40|$|For a {{comprehensive}} {{interpretation of the}} electrochemical processes occurring at a semiconductor/electrolyte interface, an accurate value of the flatband potential versus the reference electrode is needed together with the current/voltage response. The present work is mainly devoted {{to the analysis of}} impedance diagrams recorded with n- and p-type silicon electrodes in the dark, in a pure diluted HF solution under different bias values, the potential range being chosen so as the dc current is maintained at a low value, e. g. less than 5 mu A cm(- 2), and even less than 10 nA cm(- 2) in the case of p-type Si under cathodic polarization. Two series of impedance diagrams were recorded. Firstly, the bias value was settled in the potential range where the depletion layer was generated within the semiconductor substrate. In this condition, the high resistance of the space charge region and the resulting low value of the dc current permitted to obtain well-defined semicircles leading to the derivation of both R and C values equivalent to the depletion layer charge distribution. The method based on the analysis of the voltage dependent R-value was compared to the usual Mott-Schottky plot treatment, and proved to be efficient for the determination of a reliable value of the flatband potential versus the reference electrode. In the second series, the analysis of the impedance diagrams was focused on the range of potentials corresponding to the onset of an accumulation layer within the semiconductor. In the case of p-Si, this condition corresponds to the rapid anodic etching of the silicon substrate. At a particular value of the bias, an important induction loop was observed in addition to the usual capacitive behaviour. A Fourier transform treatment demonstrated that the impedance components were interrelated to the time dependent current response under constant bias potential. Then, simultaneous experiments based on chronoamperometry measurements suggested that the electrochemical processes involved in the reaction of Si substrate with HF solution was correlated to a <b>two-step</b> <b>charge</b> transfer mechanism. This interpretation is valid for both the inductive loop obtained in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the rise of current versus time observed in chronoamperometry...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} archaeal organisms {{generate}} Cys-tRNACys in a <b>two-step</b> pathway, first <b>charging</b> phosphoserine (Sep) onto tRNACys and subsequently converting it to Cys-tRNACys. We have determined, at 3. 2 -Å resolution, {{the structure of}} the Methanococcus maripaludis phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase (SepRS), which catalyzes the first step of this pathway. The structure shows that SepRS is a class II, α 4 synthetase whose quaternary structure arrangement of subunits closely resembles that of the heterotetrameric (αβ) 2 phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS). Homology modeling of a tRNA complex indicates that, in contrast to PheRS, a single monomer in the SepRS tetramer may recognize both the acceptor terminus and anticodon of a tRNA substrate. Using a complex with tungstate as a marker for the position of the phosphate moiety of Sep, we suggest that SepRS and PheRS bind their respective amino acid substrates in dissimilar orientations by using different residues...|$|R
