40|$|The long-time {{behavior}} of the velocity autocorrelation function (VAF), for hard disk and sphere systems, has been extensively explored. Its behavior for systems interacting via a soft repulsive or attractive potential is less well known. We explore {{the conditions under which}} the nonexponential, long-time tail in the velocity autocorrelation function of a <b>tagged</b> <b>atom,</b> in soft-repulsive sphere (Weeks-Chandler-Andersen) and Lennard-Jones atomic fluids, may be readily observed by the molecular dynamics method. The effect of changing the system size, the fluid density, the form of the interatomic force and the mass of the tagged atoms are investigated. We were able to observe this long-time tail only for systems of moderate density. At low density the effect, if it exists, is at longer times than we can currently simulate owing to limitations of system size and at higher densities these tails were not observed possibly due to other effects dominating the {{behavior of}} the VAF and masking this behavior. Under the physical conditions that are simulated here attractive forces have very little effect on the {{behavior of the}} VAF. However, as the mass of the tagged particles is increased the time at which the long-time tail commences is lengthened and its magnitude is significantly increased. This later effect suggests that by increasing the mass of the tagged particles one may be able to study more readily the behavior, nature and physical origin of long-time behavior of the VAF both by computational and by experimental techniques...|$|E
40|$|Every {{liquid in}} {{principle}} can transform {{into a glass}} if it is cooled or compressed fast enough. Glass {{is one of the}} most important artificial materials utilized by man. Numerous applications of glass materials and glass transition phenomenon include obtaining of the optimal wet-skid resistance by using the tread rubber with high glass transition temperature, enhancement of the ballistic penetration resistance of armor coatings obtained by energy dissipation associated with an impact induced transition of the coating to the glassy state, the material selection for acoustic tiles on submarines allowing to undergo the glass transition at the frequency of the active sonar at seawater temperatures thus dampening the sonar, arterial walls restoring, preservation of food, highly soluble pharmaceuticals. So, the study of glassy state tends to be one of the most promising and interesting tasks in chemistry in our days. This fact was my main motivating factor to study the structural and dynamical characteristics of the polymer melt approaching to glass transition from above in group of Prof. Dino Leporini in Pisa University. The particles(in this Thesis the word “particle” signifies the most elementary rigid part of the system under investigation. In general, it can be either molecule for the system containing the rigid molecules, or atom for the case of flexible molecules. As far, as in this Thesis the polymer melt is the system that I am investigating, the word “particle” in context of my research signifies the monomer) spend increasing periods of time, rattling in cages formed by their neighbors while the liquid, consisting of these particles, approaches the glass transition. Finally, the particles are relaxed from their cages - this process is called the structure relaxation. The main aim of this thesis is the investigation of the microscopic dynamics of the particles trapped in these cages and the study of the possible ways to connect this fast dynamics in cage to slow macroscopic dynamics associated with structure relaxation. First direction of research is based on the density-temperature scaling of the one of the most important characteristics of the cage dynamics - the Debye-Waller factor(that is the amplitude of the particle’s rattling in the cage, see the section 1. 2 for the details). The density-temperature scaling has become very popular in the recent years due to the improvement of the technical equipment of the experiments, that allowed to change both density and temperature of the system in simultaneous and prompt way. The density-temperature scaling of the structure relaxation time for single and multi-component liquids having different interaction potentials was introduced and investigated in this thesis from the different points of view, including the pressure-energy correlations and potential energy landscapes with citations of the correspondent sources (see the section 3. 1). Recent research of the Prof. Leporini group has presented the universal scaling between the structure relaxation time and Debye-Waller factor(see the subsection 3. 1. 5). Nevertheless, the research of the density-temperature scaling of the Debye-Waller factor has been missing so far and I tried my best to improve this situation and to show that the density-temperature scaling is valid for the microscopic processes, too. In the terms of the second direction of investigation I studied several functions of cage correlation for the polymer melt. This study should have allowed me to better understand the processes taking place in the cages or “shells” surrounding the tagged particle and to discover the new types of connection between these microscopic processes from one side and the macroscopic processes, like e. g. the structure relaxation, from another side. Results of this study could help to develop the new ways of understanding of the universal scaling between the structure relaxation time and Debye-Waller factor. Furthermore, it is interesting to study the cage correlation functions of the polymer melt because the polymers have been never studied in this way so far. Previous researches of the correlation functions dealt with the binary mixtures, hard spheres and disks, etc. I also have to say that this study is based on introduction of different correlation functions including the self-correlation functions of displacement that have not been studied in context of the liquids state research so far. As to the meaning of the results of the thesis, I may state the following: • the density-temperature scaling of the Debye-Waller factor is evidenced(see the section 3. 1 and the Chapter number 4). The values of the scaling exponent γ are consistent with the predictions from the study of Lennard-Jones liquids. Data of all the polymers in the study, that have different molecular masses and interaction potential, collapse the straight lines of Debye-Waller factor vs TV γ plot, where any straight line is uniquely defined by the molecular mass and parameters of the interaction potential. These lines cross in one “universal” point. • the cage correlation functions, describing the time evolution of the neighbor cage of the given particle(see the subsection 3. 2. 1 and section 5. 1) and following from the immediate physical interpretation, represent the alternative but perfectly equivalent instrument for the description of the structure relaxation, compared to the more rigorous intermediate scattering function. • the analysis of the spatial correlation of displacement(see the subsection 3. 2. 2 and section 5. 2) evidences the link between the well-known static properties of the system and the dynamic properties, represented by the direction and modulus correlation functions of displacement. Origin of this correlation is not perfectly clear and needs further investigation. • analysis of the time correlations of displacement (see the section 5. 3) shows that the directionality of motion rather than the displacement modulus seems to connect the fast microscopic and slow macroscopic dynamics. The direction of the displacement of a particle at the time scales of cage regime determines in general the direction of the particle’s motion even at much longer times. As far, as the outlook of the Thesis is concerned, I have to point out that the further investigation, generalization and improvement of these results could be useful. The results of current Thesis allow to construct only several very narrow and rickety bridges between the fast microscopic and slow macroscopic dynamics. These narrow links should be united with the other existing ones and with those that will be created in future, thus forming the new theories, methods and approaches. Among the possible ways of developing of the results of this Thesis I can point to either the prospect of the study of the influence of TV γ on the behavior of the cage correlation functions, uniting the two main directions of research of this thesis, could be the most promising direction of further study, or to the aforementioned possible research of the reasons of the correlation between the static and dynamic(represented by the direction and modulus correlation functions of displacement) properties of the system. Results and outlook of the Thesis are discussed in the Conclusions in more detailed way. My thesis consists of five chapters. First chapter of my PhD thesis presents the introduction to glass transition phenomenon (section 1. 1); covers the information about the static structure and relaxation in liquids and introduces the functions that describe these processes (section 1. 2); and describes the glass transition in polymers with particular attention to the similarities and differences of the glass transition processes in simple liquids and polymers(section 1. 3), thus explaining why the polymers usually are the good glass-formers. Then, in the second chapter, covering the methods of the computer simulations of polymers, there follow: • the review of numerous methods of molecular dynamics and (a bit) of monte-carlo simulations of the glass-forming polymers(section 2. 1), allowing to better understand the future ways of development of the simulation studies of the polymers and to enrich the arsenal of a modern scientist with new powerful computational methods enabling the simulations to become more quick and effective • separate section (2. 2) describing the numerical methods and MD model (developed by Cristiano De Michele, a former member of the Leporini group) used in the MD simulations runs during the work over the fourth and fifth chapters Third chapter contains the theoretical background for the fourth and fifth chapters. • the theoretical introduction to the popular aspect of density-temperature scaling of the relaxation time in numerous classes of simple liquids and polymers (section 3. 1). Theoretical basis of the scaling and its connection to the inverse power law is discussed in the subsection 3. 1. 1, the numerous ways of approximation of the scaling exponent γ are presented in the subsection 3. 1. 2. The speculations upon the relation between the density-temperature scaling and the pressure-energy correlations in liquids are presented in the subsection 3. 1. 3; the connection of the temperaturedensity scaling to the fragility and potential energy landscapes is discussed in the subsection 3. 1. 4. Section ends with results of Leporini group (subsection 3. 1. 5) obtained just before beginning of my work over the PhD thesis. These results allowed to ascertain the universal scaling between the fast microscopic and the slow macroscopic dynamics and also urged me to explore the possibility of temperature-density scaling not only of the slow macroscopic dynamics reflected in such macroscopic parameter as the relaxation time, but also of the microscopic dynamics closely connected to the Debye-Waller factor. • section 3. 2, consisting of the introduction to the functions regarding the cages surrounding the <b>tagged</b> <b>atom</b> (subsection 3. 2. 1) and the basic theoretical information about the spatial correlation functions (subsection 3. 2. 2) The original results of the research of temperature-density scaling of the Debye-Waller factor are presented into the fourth chapter. The fifth chapter reports an original investigation of the correlation functions of supercooled polymeric melt. The peculiarities of motion of the atoms in the supercooled liquid, especially when it approaches the glass transition, are always of great interest and importance, because the understanding of the laws of this motion could be crucial for prediction of various properties of materials close to their glass transition. The correlation functions give us a rather detailed picture of the motion of the atoms. In the section 5. 1 I explored the correlation functions regarding the cages surrounding the <b>tagged</b> <b>atom.</b> The description of the program, calculating the neighbor list and cage correlation functions (already introduced in subsection 5. 4. 1), follows in subsection 5. 1. 1. The results of the run of this program using the input data from the simulations of our MD model, already described in section 2. 2, are presented in subsection 5. 1. 2. In section 5. 2 there follows the research of the spatial correlation functions. The structure of this subsection is similar to the previous one with the introductory part of the corresponding functions being presented in subsection 3. 2. 2, program description in subsection 5. 2. 1 and the results of the run in subsection 5. 2. 2. In the section 5. 3 I introduced the original self-correlation functions of displacement in subsection 5. 3. 1. The program, calculating these functions, is described in the subsection 5. 3. 2, the results of run - in the subsection 5. 3. 3.

In this dictionary, {{there is only one}} note-specific atom for each note of any instrument, resulting in a sparse space for each instrument.

DL-Leucine-thioethyl esters (LeuSEt), where the L-enantiomer was <b>tagged</b> with deuterium <b>atoms,</b> undergo polycondensation in water or in bicarbonate or imidazole buffer solutions to yield mainly heterochiral (atactic) peptides and diketopiperazine, as analyzed by MALDI-TOF and ESI mass-spectrometry. In variance, when polymerization of DL(d(10)) -Leu, first activated with N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole, then initiated with ethanethiol or with DL(d(3)) -LeuSEt yielded a library of peptides up to 30 detectable residues where those of homochiral sequence (isotactic) are the dominant diastereoisomers. At these conditions, racemic beta-sheets are formed and operate as stereoselective templates {{in the process of}} chain-elongation. Isotopic L:L(d(10)) -Leu co-peptides were obtained in the polymerization of L(d(10)) -Leu with L-LeuSEt.

Isotactic co-peptides containing Leu and Val residues were formed in the polymerization of mixtures of activated DL(d(8)) -Val with DL(d(3)) -LeuSEt in water, implying that the racemic beta-sheets exert regio-enantio-selection but not chemo-selection.

The ToF section was used to <b>tag</b> individual recoil <b>atoms</b> with their energy prior to entering the stopping foil and the exit energy was measured subsequently using a Si p-i-n charged particle detector. The mean energy-loss and average energy of recoils have been determined for many elements with Z 1 = 3 - 26 in a continuous energy range from ~ 0. 2 to ~ 0. 9 MeV per nucleon and from ~ 0. 03 to 0. 1 MeV per nucleon for 79 Au. The stopping power and energy dependence were in good agreement with most literature data. However, considerable discrepancies in the energy dependence were observed with semi-empirical SRIM- 2000 estimates around the stopping power maximum for some of the elements. This technique, which allows direct measurement of Z 1 effects in stopping foils to be performed with high-precision, showed that the dependence of the experimentally determined stopping number (Lexp) with the stopping parameter clustered around a trend line with Z 1 dependent deviations that exceeded the estimated uncertainty.

The final diastereoisomeric distribution of the peptides depends upon the composition of the templates, which is determined by the concentration of the initiator.

40|$|We {{have carried}} out {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{to understand the}} dynamics of a <b>tagged</b> pair of <b>atoms</b> in a strongly non-ideal glass-forming binary Lennard-Jones mixture (commonly known as Kob-Andersen model). The generalized time-dependent pair distribution function is calculated separately for the three pairs (AA, BB and AB). The three pairs are found to behave differently. The relative diffusion constants are found to vary in the order D_R^BB > D_R^AB > D_R^AA, with D_R^BB≃ 2 D_R^AA, showing {{the importance of the}} hopping process (B hops much more than A). We introduce a non-Gaussian parameter (α_ 2 ^P (t)) to monitor the relative motion of a pair of atoms, and evaluate it for all the three pairs, with initial separations chosen to be at the first peak of the corresponding partial radial distribution functions. At intermediate times, significant deviation from the Gaussian behavior of the pair distribution functions is observed, with different degree for the three pairs. A simple mean-field (MF) model, proposed originally by Haan [Phys. Rev. A 20, 2516 (1979) ] for one component liquid, is applied to the case of binary mixture, and compared with the simulation results. While the MF model successfully describe the dynamics of the AA and AB pair, the agreement for the BB pair is less satisfactory. This is attributed to the large scale anharmonic motions of the B particles in a weak effective potential. Dynamics of next nearest neighbor pairs are also investigated.

Accurate co-registration combining these two molecular imaging modalities likely to (1) facilitate in vitro to in vivo correlations through ex vivo fluorescent imaging of pathological samples [8], (2) document the mechanism of uptake of clinically used radiotracers and contrast agents by adding complementary molecular information [8], (3) decipher the changes induced by administration of therapy [9], and (4) validate the in vivo targeting capacity of new molecular probes prior to radioactive labeling for PET or SPECT or <b>tagging</b> with paramagnetic <b>atoms</b> for MRI [8]. Future applications could {{include the use of}} other types of fluorescent probes, in particular, those that are activated only after interaction with the target for the monitoring of a variety of tumor-related molecules [8].

The benefits from the fusion of fDOT and PET in combination with CT are expected to give rise to scanners where the two modalities are integrated within the same apparatus, and there are ongoing efforts for the development of this type of methods [34 – 36]. The combination of these two modalities offers new opportunities for describing tissue physiopathology non-invasively at refined molecular levels and opens experimental molecular imaging to simultaneous detection of multiple molecular targets and activities (‘multiplexing’).|$|R

We describe here a significant extension of this work to the study of bimolecular reactions initiated in a similar manner. Specifically, we have observed the infrared activated CO oxidation reaction (CO (ads) + O (ads) → CO 2 (g)) on isolated platinum oxide cations, Pt n O m +. Small platinum cluster oxides Pt n O m + (n = 3 – 7, m = 2, 4), have been decorated with CO molecules and subjected to multiple photon infrared excitation in the range 400 – 2200 cm − 1 using the Free Electron Laser for Infrared eXperiments (FELIX).
