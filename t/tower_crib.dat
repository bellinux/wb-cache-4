50|$|A tilted <b>tower</b> <b>crib</b> is a box crib {{in which}} pairs of shims {{are used to}} change the {{direction}} of the rising structure, resulting in a curve. Curving a crib must be done in moderation and is only advisable for structures at sharp angles to the ground.|$|E
50|$|Cribbing is {{used when}} moving {{buildings}} in whole, or in part. Cribbing {{is used to}} raise the structure and allow the carrying vehicle to be positioned underneath, {{at which point the}} structure is then lowered onto the vehicle and the <b>cribbing</b> <b>towers</b> are removed. At {{the other end of the}} operation, the process is reversed, and the structure is lowered into its new position.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century, the {{invention}} of radar and other electronic aids to navigation began to render many Great Lakes navigational light <b>towers</b> redundant. The <b>Crib</b> Light was considered by the Coast Guard to be [...] "surplus" [...] property. In 1984, the <b>Crib</b> Light <b>tower</b> was removed from its crib and placed on its current base located on the Gordon Turner Park pier head.|$|R
50|$|A box crib is the simplest, {{most stable}} and most common method of cribbing. It is {{constructed}} by arranging sets (2 or more) of matched blocks {{in a regular}} log-cabin style to form a rising square or rectangular frame. The more blocks on each level, the greater the number of support points and therefore the greater {{the strength of the}} <b>crib</b> <b>tower.</b> In trench rescue training materials three basic types of box cribbing are the 4-point, 9-point and full crib. The four point type has two timbers on each level thus four points of contact. Three timbers on each layer makes nine points of contact. The full crib type has each layer filled with timbers. Each point of contact carries a maximum load depending on the size and species of the timbers.|$|R
2500|$|The brief {{season for}} work on the remote reef in Lake Superior lasted from May to October with many days lost to inclement weather. All of the {{machinery}} used to construct the Spectacle Reef Light {{was moved to the}} depot at Huron Bay on Lake Superior for construction of the crib for the Stannard Rock Light, which began in July 1877. Blocks of stone were cut at Marblehead, Ohio and shipped to the site for construction of the <b>tower.</b> [...] The <b>crib</b> was taken out to Stannard Rock in August 1877, and soundings were made for fitting the crib to the reef. The crib was then returned to Huron Bay and built up to 14 courses; it was returned to Stannard Rock in August 1878 and placed in position on the reef. By October 1878 the crib was filled with concrete and stone from a quarry opened on Huron Island. By June 1879 an iron pier had been built up {{to the surface of the}} water. By mid-1880 the structure was [...] above the water. The tower was completed and the first light was exhibited on July 4, 1882. Work on the tower continued until 1883. It took five years to complete the construction of the Stannard Rock Light at the cost of $305,000, (just $5,000 more than the original estimate) 126 tons of iron, 76 tons of brick, 1,270 tons of tower stone, and 7,276 tons of concrete were used in the lighthouse's construction. [...] The exposed crib of the Stannard Rock Light is rated by the National Park Service as one of top ten engineering feats in the United States.|$|R
