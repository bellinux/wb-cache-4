5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence and produced by Caleb Dewart of DNA Inc. The video deals directly with the lyrics' theme of Stefani's search for inspiration in songwriting. It opens with a lengthy non-musical section in which Stefani arrives in Los Angeles off of No Doubt's Rock Steady Tour. She receives several calls from Interscope label head Jimmy Iovine, who attempts to push her forward with her solo debut project, but she replies that she is tired and uninspired. After a failed studio attempt, Stefani sees a flyer advertising help for writer's block. Upon arrival she is asked {{to fill out a}} suspicious questionnaire, where the camera pans <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> which will be important. She is then told that she will be billed when she is finished. She asks for clarification only to discover that she is already back in the studio by herself. When Stefani picks up an oversized pocket watch from the piano, a rabbit knick-knack that she had previously seen jumps across the room. She throws the watch at the knick-knack, causing her to fall back on her chair and find herself transported to a fantasy world based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass.|$|E

25|$|Within the {{lifetime}} of Bahá'u'lláh, the religion was established in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, then under Russian control. While in Samarkand in 1892 Gulpaygani wrote a book, Fassl-ul-Khitab (Conclusive Proof), in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> of Mirza Haydar-Ali of Tabriz. It was in Samarkand, too, that he debated a Protestant preacher.

25|$|The Court of Appeal {{noted that}} the word shall is a {{mandatory}} verb, and that the key <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> lay with that word rather than the word election in Article 49(1).

This {{would lead to the}} less definitive construction that a vacancy may be filled and, if so, it shall be filled by election.|$|E
25|$|The apologetic historiography in the Acts of the Apostles {{presented}} Christianity as {{a religious}} movement at home within the Roman Empire and no threat to it and was {{a model for the}} first major historian of the Church, Eusebius. Apologetics might also be directed to Christians already within the community explain their beliefs and justify positions. Origen's apologetic Contra Celsum, for instance, provided a defense against the arguments of a critic dead for decades to provide answers to doubting Christians lacking immediate answers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> raised. Apologetic literature was an important medium for the formation of early Christian identity.|$|E
5000|$|Whilst {{relatively}} easy <b>to</b> state, <b>the</b> miracle <b>question</b> requires considerable skill <b>to</b> ask well. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> must be asked slowly with close attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> person's non-verbal communication <b>to</b> ensure that <b>the</b> pace matches <b>the</b> person's ability <b>to</b> follow <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> Initial responses frequently include {{a sense of}} [...] "I don't know."

25|$|In The Art of Courtly Love, Andreas Capellanus, Andrew the chaplain, {{refers to}} the court of Poitiers.

He records some twenty-one cases, the most famous of them being a problem posed to the women about whether true love can exist in marriage.

25|$|On May 21, DPP legislators {{criticized the}} Mainland Affairs Council for {{classifying}} the disadvantages {{of the trade}} accord and releasing only information it considers favorable to the agreement. Responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> former Mainland Affairs Council Minister Wang Yu-chi said that the classified information was {{to be used for}} reference only within the government. Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Cho Shih-chao said that research produced by academics is only used for internal reference for decision making. However, neither official explained why only poll numbers favorable to the government's position have been released to the public, while others were not.|$|E
25|$|Dilthey {{took some}} of his {{inspiration}} from the works of Friedrich Schleiermacher on hermeneutics, which he helped revive. Both figures are linked to German Romanticism. Schleiermacher was strongly influenced by German Romanticism which led him to place more emphasis on human emotion and the imagination. Dilthey, in his turn, {{as the author of}} a vast monograph on Schleiermacher, responds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> raised by Droysen and Ranke about the philosophical legitimation of the human sciences. He argues that 'scientific explanation of nature' (erklären) must be completed with a theory of how the world is given to human beings through symbolically mediated practices. To provide such a theory is the aim of the philosophy of the humanities—a field of study to which Dilthey dedicated his entire academic career.|$|E

25|$|A {{crucial point}} in the {{dialogue}} is when Socrates tells Meno {{that there is no}} such thing as teaching, only recollection of knowledge from past lives, or anamnesis. Socrates claims that he can demonstrate this by showing that one of Meno's servants, a slave boy, knows geometric principles though he is uneducated. Socrates states that he will teach the boy nothing, only ask him questions to assist the process of recollection. Socrates proceeds to ask the slave boy a series of questions about the size and length of lines and squares, using visual diagrams to aid the boy in understanding the questions. The crucial point to this part of the dialogue is that, though the boy has no training, he knows the correct answers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> – he intrinsically knows the Pythagorean proposition.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> {{raised about}} the depth of Escrivá's spirituality and theological thinking, about his purported habits of secretiveness and elitism (although, for the most part, Opus Dei faithful belong to the middle-to-low levels of society, in terms of education, income, and social status), about his alleged bad temper and ambition for social status and worldly luxuries, several other specific aspects of Escrivá's life and work have generated some criticism, particularly regarding his canonization by the Catholic Church. These sources of criticism include his alleged private statements in defense of Adolf Hitler, collaboration by members of Opus Dei with right-wing political causes (especially during General Francisco Franco's dictatorship in Spain), Escrivá's request for the rehabilitation in his favor of an aristocratic title, and allegations that he maintained bad relations with other Catholic officials, of whom he could be very critical in private.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> {{raised by}} {{the large amount of}} funding he took from the health care industry, Baucus declared a moratorium as of July 1, 2009 on taking more special interest money from health care political action committees. Baucus, however, refused to return as part of his moratorium any of the millions of dollars he has received from health care industry interests before July 1, 2009, or to rule out a resumption of taking the same or greater health care industry contributions in the future. His policy on not taking health care industry money reportedly still allowed him to accept money from lobbyists or corporate executives, who, according to The Washington Post, continued to make donations after July 1, 2009. A watchdog group found that in July 2009 Baucus accepted additional money from the health care industry in violation of his own self-defined moratorium terms, reportedly leading Baucus to return those monies.|$|E

25|$|Training was {{extended}} {{from two years}} to four, with the resulting need for more accommodation for cadets. A second cadet establishment was constructed at Osborne on the Isle of Wight {{for the first two}} years, with the last two remaining at Dartmouth. All cadets now received an education in science and technology as it related to life on board a ship as well as navigation and seamanship. Those who went on to be command officers would now have the benefit of improved understanding of their ships while those who became engineers would be better equipped for command. Physical education and sport were to be taught, not only {{for the benefit of the}} cadets but also for the future training of ships' crews which were expected to produce sporting teams on good-will visits in foreign ports. Entrance by examination, which biased the intake to those who could obtain special tuition, was replaced with an interview committee tasked with determining the general knowledge of candidates and their reaction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> as much as their answers. After the four years, cadets were posted to special training ships for final practical experience before being posted to real command positions. The results of the final examination affected the seniority allotted to each cadet and his chance of future early promotion.|$|E
25|$|The boila {{were divided}} into inner and outer boilas and it was among their ranks that the holders of the highest {{military}} and administrative posts were selected. Most likely the outer boilas resided outside the capital, while the inner ones were member of the court under the direct influence of the monarch. The bagains were the second-ranking aristocratic class and {{were divided into}} numerous ranks. The presence of two separate nobility classes is further confirmed in the Responsa Nicolai ad consulta Bulgarorum (Responses of Pope Nicholas I <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Questions</b> of the Bulgarians), where BorisI wrote about primates and mediocres seu minores. Another privileged group were the tarkhans, although from the surviving inscriptions {{it is impossible to}} determine whether they belonged to the boilas or to the bagains, or were a separate class. The original Bulgar titles and many of the institutions from the pagan era were preserved after the Christianisation of Bulgaria until the very fall of the First Empire. The beginning of the 9th century was marked with a process of incorporation of both Slavs and Byzantine Greeks in the ranks of the Bulgarian nobility and privileged classes, which increased the power of the monarch that had been previously curtailed by the leading Bulgar aristocratic families. Since that time certain Slavic titles became more prominent, such as župan, and some of them mingled forming titles like župan tarkhan.|$|E
