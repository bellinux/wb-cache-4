5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the {{cerebral}} cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy {{of the affected}} regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, {{and parts of the}} frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like <b>the</b> <b>locus</b> coeruleus. Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.|$|E

500|$|Vermigli is {{best known}} for <b>the</b> <b>Loci</b> Communes (Latin for [...] "commonplaces"), a {{collection}} of the topical discussions scattered throughout his biblical commentaries. <b>The</b> <b>Loci</b> Communes was compiled by Huguenot minister Robert Masson and first published in 1576, fourteen years after Vermigli's death.

Masson followed the pattern of John Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion to organize it. Fifteen editions of <b>the</b> <b>Loci</b> Communes between 1576 and 1656 spread Vermigli's influence among Reformed Protestants.

5|$|The Red River Trails {{are less}} well known today than many other pioneer trails and trade routes in North America, and do not occupy as large a place in {{folklore}} as the great western trails in the United States and the fur-trading canoe routes of Canada.

40|$|A new {{approach}} towards the assessment and derivation of numerical methods for convection dominated problems is presented, {{based on the}} comparison of the fundamental systems of the continuous and discrete operators. In two or more space dimensions, the dimension of the fundamental system is infinite, and may be identified with a ball. This set {{is referred to as}} <b>the</b> true fundamental <b>locus.</b> <b>The</b> fundamental system for a numerical scheme also forms a locus. As a first application, it is shown that a necessary condition for the uniform convergence of a numerical scheme is that <b>the</b> discrete <b>locus</b> should contain <b>the</b> true <b>locus,</b> and it is then shown it is impossible to satisfy this condition with a finite stencil. This shows that results of Shishkin concerning non-uniform convergence at parabolic boundaries are also generic for outflow boundaries. It is shown that the distance between <b>the</b> <b>loci</b> is related to the accuracy of the schemes provided that <b>the</b> <b>loci</b> are sufficiently close. However, if <b>the</b> <b>loci</b> depart markedly, then the situation is rather more complicated. Under suitable conditions, we develop an explicit numerical lower bound on the attainable relative error in terms of the coefficients in the stencil characterising the scheme and <b>the</b> <b>loci...</b>|$|R

5|$|The total {{complement}} of genes in an organism or cell {{is known as}} its genome, which may be stored on one or more chromosomes. A chromosome consists of a single, very long DNA helix on which thousands of genes are encoded. The region of the chromosome at which a particular gene is located is called its locus.

Other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain, but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA.|$|E
5|$|During the 1850s, Utica {{was known}} to aid more than 650 {{fugitive}} slaves; it {{played a major role}} as a station in the Underground Railroad. The city was on a slave escape route from the Southern Tier to Canada by way of Albany, Syracuse and Rochester. The route, used by Harriet Tubman to travel to Buffalo, guided slaves to pass through Utica on the New York Central Railroad right-of-way en route to Canada. Utica was <b>the</b> <b>locus</b> for Methodist preacher Orange Scott's antislavery sermons during the 1830s and 1840s, and Scott formed an abolitionist group there in 1843. Despite efforts by local abolitionists, pro-slavery riots and mobs, who wanted to protect the cotton mills, forced many abolitionist meetings to other cities.|$|E

As a result, Tunstall withdrew its support for the order leaving only Hanley and Longton to promote the bill in the House of Lords. Neither council was particularly in favour of the financial settlement but felt honour bound to promote the bill, having been the initial instigators of the scheme.
