25|$|The reverse stern, reverse <b>transom</b> <b>stern,</b> sugar-scoop, or retroussé stern {{is a kind}} of <b>transom</b> <b>stern</b> that is raked {{backwards}} (common {{on modern}} yachts, rare on vessels before the 20th century); the vertical <b>transom</b> <b>stern</b> or plumb stern is raked neither forward nor back, but falls directly from the taffrail down to the wing transom. The rocket ship stern is a term for an extremely angled retroussé stern. A double ended ship with a very narrow square counter formed from the bulwarks or upper deck above the head of the rudder is said to have a pink stern or pinky stern. The torpedo stern or torpedo-boat stern describes a kind of stern with a low rounded shape that is nearly flat at the waterline, but which then slopes upward in a conical fashion towards the deck (practical for small high-speed power boats with very shallow drafts).|$|E

500|$|By early 1939 it {{was clear}} that the first two s could not be {{delivered}} before 1943 at the earliest and that further battleship construction would be necessary to match the German and Japanese battleships already under construction. The main constraint on the construction of any new battleships was the limited available capacity and the time required to build large-calibre guns and their gun turrets. Using four existing twin 15-inch mountings offered the possibility of bypassing this bottleneck and allowed the construction of a single fast battleship more quickly than building more Lion-class ships. The turrets were originally built for the battlecruisers [...] and [...] during the First World War, and were removed during the conversions of these ships to aircraft carriers in the 1920s. To save time, the Lion design was modified to accommodate the four turrets, and preliminary design work began in July 1939. The square or <b>transom</b> <b>stern</b> was retained as it was estimated to improve speed at full power by [...] This made Vanguard the only British battleship built with a <b>transom</b> <b>stern</b> as the Lions were never finished.|$|E

500|$|Payne's initial {{intent was}} to make the ship's stern profile with a spoon shape, similar to that on most {{previous}} ocean liners, but the mounting of the propeller pods required a flat transom. The compromise was a Constanzi stern— a combination of the two. The final design was agreed upon, as a Constanzi stern provides the transom required for azimuthal pod propulsors, and provides better seaholding characteristics in a following swell than a standard <b>transom</b> <b>stern.</b> [...] In common with many modern ships, both passenger and cargo, Queen Mary 2 has a bulbous bow to reduce drag and thereby increase speed, range, and fuel efficiency.|$|E

50|$|The Tancook Schooner, {{with its}} counter stern and {{characteristic}} round or 'spoon' bow was a distinctive type of small sailing work boat built primarily on Big Tancook Island, Nova Scotia and the immediate surrounding area on and near Mahone Bay. The design succeeded the earlier double ended Tancook Whaler fishing boats. The Tancook Schooners were usually {{larger than the}} Tancook Whalers and had fixed keels rather than centerboards. The sail plan for the smaller sizes of <b>transom</b> <b>sterned</b> schooners was typically gaff rigged fore and main and one or sometimes two headsails.

2500|$|In naval architecture, {{the term}} [...] "transom" [...] has two meanings.

2500|$|The stern of a {{classical}} sailing ship housed the captain's quarters and became increasingly large and elaborate between the 15th and 18th centuries, {{especially in the}} baroque era, when such wedding-cake-like structures became so heavy that crews sometimes threw the decoration overboard rather than be burdened with its useless weight. [...] But until {{a new form of}} stern appeared in the 19th century, the <b>transom</b> <b>stern</b> was a floating house—and required just as many timbers, walls, windows, and frames.

40|$|ABSTRACTIn the {{proposed}} paper numerical {{calculations are carried}} out using two versions of a three-dimensional, time-domain panel method developed by the group of Prof. P. Sclavounos at MIT, i. e. the linear code SWAN 2, enabling optionally {{the use of the}} instantaneous non-linear Froude-Krylov and hydrostatic forces and the fully non-linear SWAN 4. The analytical results are compared with experimental results for three hull forms with increasing geometrical complexity, the Series 60, a reefer vessel with stern bulb and a modern fast ROPAX hull form with hollow bottom in the stern region. The details of the geometrical modeling of the hull forms are discussed. In addition, since SWAN 4 does not support <b>transom</b> <b>sterns,</b> only the two versions of SWAN 2 were evaluated over experimental results for the parent hull form of the NTUA double-chine, wide-transom, high-speed monohull series. The effect of speed on the numerical predictions was investigated. It is concluded that both versions of SWAN 2 the linear and the one with the non-linear Froude-Krylov and hydrostatic forces provide a more robust tool for prediction of the dynamic response of the vessels than the non-linear SWAN 4 code. In general, their results are close to what was expected on the basis of experience. Furthermore, the use of the option of non-linear Froude-Krylov and hydrostatic forces is beneficial for the accuracy of the predictions. The content of the paper is based on the Diploma thesis of the second author, supervised by the first one and further refined by the third one...|$|R
2500|$|The {{flat surface}} of any <b>transom</b> <b>stern</b> may begin either {{at or above}} the {{waterline}} of the vessel. [...] The geometric line which stretches from the wing transom to the archboard is called the counter; a large vessel may have two such counters, called a lower counter and a second or upper counter. The lower counter stretches from directly above the wing transom to the lower counter rail, and the upper counter from the lower counter rail to the upper counter rail, immediately under the stern's lowest set of windows (which in naval parlance were called [...] "lights").|$|E
2500|$|Sterns on European and American wooden sailing ships {{began with}} two {{principal}} forms: the square or <b>transom</b> <b>stern</b> and the elliptical, fantail, or merchant stern, and {{were developed in}} that order. [...] The hull sections of a sailing ship located before the stern were composed {{of a series of}} U-shaped rib-like frames set in a sloped or [...] "cant" [...] arrangement, with the last frame before the stern being called the fashion timber(s) or fashion piece(s), so called for [...] "fashioning" [...] the after part of the ship. This frame is designed to support the various beams that make up the stern.|$|E
2500|$|In 1817 the British naval {{architect}} Sir Robert Seppings first introduced {{the concept of}} the round or circular stern. The square stern had been an easy target for enemy cannon, and could not support the weight of heavy stern chase guns. But Seppings' design left the rudder head exposed, and was regarded by many as simply ugly—no American warships were designed with such sterns, and the round stern was quickly superseded by the elliptical stern. The United States began building the first elliptical stern warship in 1820, a decade before the British. [...] became the first sailing ship to sport such a stern. Though a great improvement over the <b>transom</b> <b>stern</b> in terms of its vulnerability to attack when under fire, elliptical sterns still had obvious weaknesses which the next major stern development—the iron-hulled cruiser stern—addressed far better and with much different materials.|$|E

5000|$|The 210s (210-foot cutters) {{received}} upgrades and modifications (in {{a program}} named [...] "Midlife Maintenance Availability" [...] or MMA) during the 1986 through 1990 time period. The [...] "A" [...] class cutters had their gas turbines removed, and all 210s had their <b>stern</b> <b>transom</b> exhaust systems {{replaced with a}} traditional stack. While this modification reduced {{the size of the}} flight deck, they were still more than capable of carrying out helicopter operations. Other modifications included enlarging the superstructure area, replacing the main armament, and increasing the fire-fighting capability of the cutters. The modifications cost approximately $20 million per cutter, well above their original cost of about $3.5 million each.|$|R
50|$|Adventure {{was built}} to replace the {{converted}} First World War veteran Princess Margaret, and her design was dictated by a requirement for a large mine capacity and a good cruising range. The mineload was to be carried completely internally, dictating a long, tall hull, and there were four sets of rails running {{the length of the}} hull to chutes at the stern. She was built with a <b>transom,</b> or flat, <b>stern,</b> to improve cruising efficiency, but the dead water caused by such a form meant that mines tended to be sucked back into the hull when they were launched; an obviously dangerous situation for a minelayer. As a result, she was rebuilt with a traditional cruiser, or rounded, stern, increasing the length by 19 ft.|$|R
2500|$|The visual unpopularity of Seppings' {{circular}} stern {{was soon}} rectified by Sir William Symonds. In this revised stern, {{a set of}} straight post timbers (also called [...] "whiskers", [...] "horn timbers", or [...] "fan tail timbers") stretches from the keel diagonally aft and upward. It rests {{on the top of}} the sternpost and runs on either side of the rudder post (thus creating the [...] "helm port" [...] through which the rudder passes) to a point well above the vessel's waterline. Whereas the timbers of the <b>transom</b> <b>stern</b> all heeled on the wing transom, the timbers of the elliptical stern all heel on the whiskers, to which they are affixed at a 45̊ angle (i.e., [...] "canted") when viewed from overhead and decrease in length as they are installed aft until the curvature is complete. [...] The finished stern has a continuous curved edge around the outside and is raked aft. Other names for the elliptical stern include a [...] "counter stern," [...] in reference to its very long counter, and a [...] "cutaway stern." [...] The elliptical stern began use during the age of sail, but remained very popular for both merchant and warships well into the nautical age of steam and through the first eight decades of steamship construction (roughly 1840–1920), despite the fact that the design left the rudder exposed and vulnerable in combat situations.|$|E

50|$|Unlike Gar Wood's {{multi-engined}} monsters, Blue Bird {{was designed}} for a single engine, and the smallest possible craft to carry it. She was 23 feet long, compared to 38 feet for Miss America X. Her estimated top speed on paper was to be 130 mph. It was usual at this time for English hydroplanes to have their engines mounted as far astern as possible (Gar Wood disagreed, and had pointed this out to Segrave). K3 took this {{a step further and}} had a narrow central nacelle that overhung the <b>transom</b> of the <b>stern.</b> This rearward weight distribution encouraged planing, but could lead to some peculiar attitudes when setting off at slow speeds, as the whole boat appeared to be sinking by the stern.|$|R
25|$|Transoms – These timbers extend {{across the}} low {{parts of the}} hull near the rudder, and are secured (notched and/or bolted) to the sternpost. The transom located {{at the base of}} the stern, and the {{uppermost}} of the main transoms, was typically called the wing transom; the principal transom below this and level with the lower deck was called the deck transom; between these two were a series of filling <b>transoms.</b> If the <b>stern</b> had <b>transoms</b> above the wing transom, they would no longer be affixed to the sternpost.

50|$|During {{her second}} rebuild, {{which took place}} during the winter of 1828, Constellation was {{dismantled}} throughout her midsections and her stern section down to the floor. An increase of 17 inches was made to the hull’s maximum molded breath, and added to the 14 inches increase in Constellation hull’s maximum molded beam made in 1813, altered the hull’s maximum molded breadth of beam from 40 feet in 1797 to 42 ft. 7ins., which was the maximum molded breadth upon her departure from Gosport in 1829. Also installed was the newly developed round <b>transom,</b> an elliptic <b>stern</b> and rudder assembly and a new captain’s cabin. The two increases in Constellation’s maximum molded beam resulted in a reduction of her draft from 22 ft. 6ins. 1801 to 20 ft, 6ins. following her rebuild in 1829.|$|R
