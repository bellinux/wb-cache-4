5|$|One of {{the oldest}} pieces of tornado {{folklore}} {{is the idea that}} tornadoes do most of their damage due to the lower atmospheric pressure {{at the center of a}} tornado, which causes the house to explode outward.

5|$|The breed's {{history is}} {{uncertain}} before {{the middle of}} the 19th century. One theory is that it originated in France, stating that the Duc de Noailles {{at the time of the}} French Revolution gave his kennel of prized spaniels to the Duke of Newcastle at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>goes,</b> that the now extinct Alpine Spaniel was bred with Basset Hounds, and the Pyrenean Mountain Dog also known as the Great Pyrenees. A second theory is that it is descended from the old type of Bleinheim Spaniel, which was later to be incorporated into the King Charles breed of Spaniel. Originally these dogs were large gundogs, colored lemon and white whereas the modern breed of them is a much smaller lap/toy breed of dog.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a theory}} that the younger lady is Meritaten, {{daughter}} of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, and wife of Smenkhare, based on {{a study of the}} alleles inherited by Tutankhamun. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>goes</b> that Meritaten married Smenkhare, believed to be her uncle. Thereby making Tutankhamun a maternal grandson of Akhenaten. The theory holds weight as inbreeding makes it harder to distinguish the generations, but there is one problem with this theory. Meritaten must be a mitochondrial descendant of Queen Tiye, or her mother Thuya, as the younger lady's mitochondrial DNA fits with her being Tiye's daughter. Nefertiti's lineage is nowhere specified, and if Meritaten is the younger lady, Nefertiti must be a mitochondrial relation of Thuya.|$|E

25|$|Rodezno’s {{motives are}} unclear; apart from {{partisan}} {{claims that he}} traded Carlist principles for a few Navarrese alcaldias, there are many conflicting interpretations offered. According to one, he feared that internal divisions within the Nationalist camp might lead to defeat in the war. According to another, {{he has never been}} a genuine Carlist and is better described as a conservative monarchist. Some scholars claim that he was a possibilist, who realized that Traditionalism was unable to seize power single-handedly and needed coalition partners; one more clue might have been that perceiving Carlism as rooted in family and regional values, he downplayed the issues of organization and structures. Others underline that he considered the emerging system largely in line with the Carlist vision and did not think it worthwhile to be marginalized for the sake of defending second-rate discrepancies. Finally, there are authors who believe that he realized neither gravity of the moment nor totalitarian nature of the new party; Rodezno – <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>goes</b> – imagined the structure either as a new incarnation of Unión Patriotica or as a loose alliance, both permitting Carlism to maintain its proper identity.|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to the {{currently}} prevailing view, Canals advances a thesis {{that the modern}} Catalan identity was forged as part of traditional Christian response to competitive universalist concepts gaining ground since the late 17th century and usually imported {{from the other side}} of the Pyrenees. Starting with the anti-Borbonic war of 1705-1714 - <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>goes</b> - the Catalan political self was being built; the process gained pace and in fact was most dramatically expressed in a series of 7 counter-revolutionary wars, fought by the Catalans between 1794 and 1876: Guerra Gran, the War of Independence, , , the First Carlist War, Guerra dels Matiners and the Third Carlist War. Within the perspective offered, advances of the bourgeoisie-driven Liberalism gave rise to a new concept of Catalanism, which in fact is de-construction rather than re-construction of a Catalan self. Being a local copy of European nationalisms, it reportedly discards constitutive features of Catalan identity and leads to [...] "Cataluña sin alma y sin vida".|$|E

And to this is added a third proposition, namely, that no rulers have their selfish interest identical with that of the governed, unless it be rendered so by accountability, that is, by dependence on the will of the governed. In other words (and {{as the result of the}} whole), that the desire of retaining or the fear of losing their power, and whatever is thereon consequent, is the sole motive which can be relied on for producing on the part of rulers a course of conduct in accordance with the general interest.|$|E

With the template legislation scheme mandated in the national road transport intergovernmental agreements, legislation was intended to be enacted or made by the Commonwealth for operation in the Australian Capital Territory.

60|$|After a {{while he}} {{went back into the}} hall and took a {{first-class}} return ticket, not for Birmingham, but for the Tenway Junction. It is quite unnecessary to describe the Tenway Junction, as everybody knows it. From this spot, some six or seven miles distant from London, lines diverge east, west, and north, north-east, and north-west, round the metropolis in every direction, and with direct communication with every other line in and out of London. It is a marvellous place, quite unintelligible to the uninitiated, and yet daily used by thousands who only know that when they get there, they are to do what some one tells them. The space occupied by the convergent rails seems to be sufficient for a large farm. And these rails always run one into another with sloping points, and cross passages, and mysterious meandering sidings, till it seems to the thoughtful stranger to be impossible that the best trained engine should know its own line. Here and there and around there is ever a wilderness of waggons, some loaded, some empty, some smoking with close-packed oxen, and others furlongs in length black with coals, which look as though they had been stranded there by chance, and were never destined to get again into the right path of traffic. Not a minute passes without a train going here or there, some rushing by without noticing Tenway in the least, crashing through like flashes of substantial lightning, and others stopping, disgorging and taking up passengers by the hundreds. Men and women,--especially the men, for the women knowing their ignorance are generally willing to trust to the pundits of the place,--look doubtful, uneasy, and bewildered. But they all do get properly placed and unplaced, so that the spectator at last acknowledges that over all this apparent chaos there is presiding a great genius of order. From dusky morn to dark night, and indeed almost throughout the night, the air is loaded with a succession of shrieks. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>goes</b> that each separate shriek,--if there can be any separation where the sound is so nearly continuous,--is a separate notice to separate ears of the coming or going of a separate train. The stranger, as he speculates on these pandemoniac noises, is able to realise the idea that were they discontinued the excitement necessary for the minds of the pundits might be lowered, and that activity might be lessened, and evil results might follow. But he cannot bring himself to credit that theory of individual notices.|$|E

50|$|Moderation {{theory is}} a set of interrelated {{hypotheses}} that explain the process through which political groups eschew radical platforms in favor of more moderate policies and prefer electoral, compromising and non-confrontational strategies over non-electoral, exclusive, and confrontational strategies.

50|$|Rolf Nevanlinna's most {{important}} mathematical achievement is <b>the</b> value distribution <b>theory</b> of meromorphic functions. The roots of <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>go</b> back to <b>the</b> result of Émile Picard in 1879, showing that a non-constant complex-valued function which is analytic {{in the entire}} complex plane assumes all complex values save at most one. In the early 1920s Rolf Nevanlinna, partly in collaboration with his brother Frithiof, extended <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> to cover meromorphic functions, i.e. functions analytic in the plane except for isolated points in which the Laurent series of the function has {{a finite number of}} terms with a negative power of the variable. Nevanlinna's value distribution theory or Nevanlinna theory is crystallised in its two Main Theorems. Qualitatively, the first one states that if a value is assumed less frequently than average, then the function comes close to that value more often than average. The Second Main Theorem, more difficult than the first one, states roughly that there are relatively few values which the function assumes less often than average.|$|R

This set up a doctrinal clash between Kenney, an attack aviator, and Walker, the bomber advocate. The long-standing Air Corps tactic for attacking shipping called for large formations of high-altitude bombers. With sufficient mass, so <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>went,</b> bombers could bracket any ship with walls of bombs, and do so from above the effective range of the ship's anti-aircraft fire. However the theoretical mass required was two orders of magnitude greater than what was available in the Southwest Pacific. A dozen or so bombers was the most that could be put together, owing to the small number of aircraft in the theater and the difficulties of keeping them serviceable. The results were therefore generally ineffective, and operations incurred heavy casualties.|$|R
50|$|In {{medieval and}} early modern medicine, the {{medicinal}} leech (Hirudo medicinalis and its congeners Hirudo verbana, Hirudo troctina, and Hirudo orientalis) {{was used to}} remove blood from a patient as part of a process to balance the humors that, according to Galen, must be kept in balance for the human body to function properly. (The four humors of ancient medical philosophy were blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile.) Any sickness that caused the subject's skin to become red (e.g. fever and inflammation), so <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>went,</b> must have arisen from too much blood in the body. Similarly, any person whose behavior was strident and sanguine was thought to be suffering from an excess of blood.

50|$|Sulla then {{weakened}} the magisterial offices {{by increasing the}} number of magistrates who were elected in any given year, and required that all newly elected Quaestors be given automatic membership in the senate. These two reforms were enacted primarily so as to allow Sulla to increase the size of the senate from 300 to 600 senators. This removed the need for the Censor to draw up a list of senators, since there were always more than enough former magistrates to fill the senate. The Censorship was the most prestigious of all magisterial offices, and by reducing the power of the Censors, this particular reform further helped to reduce the prestige of all magisterial offices. In addition, by {{increasing the number of}} magistrates, the prestige of each magistrate was reduced, and the potential for obstruction within each magisterial college was maximized. This, so <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>went,</b> would further increase the importance of the senate as the principal organ of constitutional government.|$|R
