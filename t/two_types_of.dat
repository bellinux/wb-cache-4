5|$|Historian R. E. Smith {{notes that}} there was a need to raise {{additional}} legions in an emergency to repel specific strategic threats.

However, no distinction in basic pay, discipline or armour is known of between the <b>two</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> legion. The practice of veteran troops signing up again voluntarily into newly raised legions must have meant that no one army conformed exactly to one or other of these theoretical archetypes.|$|E
