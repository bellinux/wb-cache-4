5|$|A {{few minutes}} later {{he was at the}} {{northern}} end of a pedestrian precinct, Royal Exchange Passage (formally called Royal Exchange Buildings), near the junction with <b>Threadneedle</b> Street, where a further police cordon stopped him from proceeding. He turned to walk south along Royal Exchange Passage instead, where, minutes before he arrived, officers had clashed with up to 25 protesters. Riot police from the Met's TSG, accompanied by City of London police dog handlers, had arrived there from the cordon in <b>Threadneedle</b> Street to help their colleagues.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April 2013, a {{commemorative}} {{dinner was}} held by the Felix Fund, a charity for bomb disposal experts and their families, at the Merchant Taylors' Hall on <b>Threadneedle</b> Street, to mark 20 years since the Bishopsgate bombing.|$|E
5|$|Nick Hardwick, {{chair of}} the IPCC, said on 9 April {{that there were no}} CCTV cameras in the area. On 14 April the Evening Standard wrote that it had found at least six CCTV cameras in the area around the assault. After {{photographs}} of the cameras were published, the IPCC reversed its position and said its investigators were looking at footage from cameras in <b>Threadneedle</b> Street near the corner of Royal Exchange Passage.|$|E
5|$|The CLR's {{ability to}} manage its high {{passenger}} numbers was constrained by the service interval that it could achieve between trains. This was {{directly related to the}} time taken to turn around trains at the termini. At the end of a journey, a locomotive had to be disconnected from the leading end of the train and run around to the rear, where it was reconnected before proceeding in the opposite direction; an exercise that took a minimum of 2½minutes. Seeking to shorten this interval, the CLR published a bill in November 1900 for the 1901 parliamentary session. The bill requested permission to construct loops {{at each end of the}} line so that trains could be turned around without disconnecting the locomotive. The loop at the western end was planned to run anti-clockwise under the three sides of Shepherd's Bush Green. For the eastern loop the alternatives were a loop under Liverpool Street station or a larger loop running under <b>Threadneedle</b> Street, Old Broad Street, Liverpool Street, Bishopsgate and returning to <b>Threadneedle</b> Street. The estimated cost of the loops was £800,000 (approximately £ today), most of which was for the eastern loop with its costly wayleaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{fears of}} {{terrorism}} received an extra boost from {{the disruption of}} communications and news as facilities were devoured by the fire. The General Letter Office in <b>Threadneedle</b> Street burned down early on Monday morning, through which post passed for the entire country. The London Gazette just managed to put out its Monday issue before the printer's premises went up in flames. The whole nation depended on these communications, and the void which they left filled up with rumours.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December {{a public}} {{memorial}} service took place for Tucker, Bentley and Choate at St Paul's Cathedral. King George V {{was represented by}} Edward Wallington, his Groom in Waiting; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings. An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading {{for half an hour}} to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along <b>Threadneedle</b> Street. After the service, when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13km) journey to the cemeteries, it was estimated that 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the hearses as they passed.|$|E
5|$|The route {{was then}} to {{continue}} east under Fleet Street to Ludgate Circus for an interchange with the South Eastern and Chatham Railway's (SECR's) Ludgate Hill station, then south under New Bridge Street, and east into Queen Victoria Street where a station was planned {{to connect to}} the District Railway's Mansion House station. The route was then to continue under Queen Victoria Street to reach the CLR's station at Bank, where separate platforms below the existing ones were to be provided. The final section of the route developed on the proposed loop {{from the year before}} with tunnels winding under the City's narrow, twisting streets. The tunnels were to run east, one below the other, beneath Cornhill and Leadenhall Street, north under St Mary Axe and west to Liverpool Street station, then south under Blomfield Street, east under Great Winchester Street, south under Austin Friars and Old Broad Street and west under <b>Threadneedle</b> Street where the tunnels were to connect with the existing sidings back into Bank. Two stations were to be provided on the loop; {{at the south end of}} St Mary Axe and at Liverpool Street station. To accommodate the additional rolling stock needed to operate the longer line, the depot was to be extended northwards. The power station was also to be enlarged to increase the electricity supply. The CLR estimated that its plan would cost £3,781,000 (approximately £ today): £2,110,000 for construction, £873,000 for land and £798,000 for electrical equipment and trains.|$|E
25|$|The Bank's {{headquarters}} {{have been}} in London's main financial district, the City of London, on <b>Threadneedle</b> Street, since 1734. It is sometimes known by the metonym The Old Lady of <b>Threadneedle</b> Street or The Old Lady, a name taken from the legend of Sarah Whitehead, whose ghost is said to haunt the Bank's garden. The busy road junction outside is known as Bank junction.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Harriot {{was buried}} in the church of St Christopher le Stocks in <b>Threadneedle</b> Street, near where he died. The church was {{subsequently}} damaged in the Great Fire of London, and demolished in 1781 to enable expansion of the Bank of England.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 16th century, London {{increasingly}} {{became a major}} centre for banking, international trade and commerce. The Royal Exchange was founded in 1565 by Sir Thomas Gresham as a centre of commerce for London's merchants, and gained Royal patronage in 1571. Although no longer used for its original purpose, its location {{at the corner of}} Cornhill and <b>Threadneedle</b> Street continues to be the geographical centre of the City's core of banking and financial services, with the Bank of England moving to its present site in 1734, opposite the Royal Exchange on <b>Threadneedle</b> Street. Immediately to the south of Cornhill, Lombard Street was the location from 1691 of Lloyd's Coffee House, which became the world-leading insurance market. London's insurance sector continues to be based in the area, particularly in Lime Street.|$|E
25|$|In 1615 or 1616, Harriot {{wrote to}} an unknown friend with medical expertise, {{describing}} {{what would have}} been the reason for the eruption of a cancerous ulcer on his lip. This progressed until 1621, when he was living with a friend named Thomas Buckner on <b>Threadneedle</b> Street, where he died. Sources cited below are among several that describe his condition as a cancer of the nose. In either case, Harriot apparently died from skin cancer.|$|E
25|$|Paternoster Square is {{an urban}} development, {{owned by the}} Mitsubishi Estate Co., next to St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London. The area, which {{takes its name from}} Paternoster Row, once centre of the London {{publishing}} trade, was devastated by aerial bombardment in The Blitz during World War II. It is now the location of the London Stock Exchange which relocated there from <b>Threadneedle</b> Street in 2004. It is also the location of investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Nomura Securities Co., and of fund manager Fidelity Investments. The square itself, i.e. the plaza, is privately owned public space.|$|E
25|$|On 20 July 1990 a bomb {{planted by}} the IRA {{exploded}} in the men's toilets behind the visitors' gallery. The area had already been evacuated and nobody was injured. About 30 minutes before the blast at 8:49a.m., a man {{who said he was}} a member of the IRA told Reuters that a bomb had been placed at the exchange and was about to explode. Police officials said that if there had been no warning, the human toll would have been very high. The explosion ripped a hole in the 23-story building on <b>Threadneedle</b> Street and sent a shower of glass and concrete onto the street. The long term trend towards electronic trading had been reducing the Exchange's status as a visitor attraction and, although the gallery reopened, it was closed permanently in 1992.|$|E
500|$|Police {{officers}} followed Tomlinson as {{he walked}} [...] along the street. He headed towards <b>Threadneedle</b> Street, but again ran into police cordons and doubled back on himself towards Cornhill. According to a CPS report, he was bitten on the leg by a police dog at 7:15 pm, when a dog handler tried to move {{him out of the}} way, but he appeared not to react to it.|$|E
500|$|Tunnelling was {{completed}} {{by the end of}} 1898, and, because a planned concrete lining to the cast iron tunnel rings was not installed, the internal diameter of the tunnels was generally [...] For Bank station, the CLR negotiated permission with the City Corporation to construct its ticket hall beneath a steel framework under the roadway and pavements at the junction of <b>Threadneedle</b> Street and Cornhill. This involved diverting pipework and cables into ducts beneath the subways linking the ticket hall to the street. Delays on this work were so costly that they nearly bankrupted the company. A further extension of time to 1900 was obtained through the Central London Railway Act, 1899.|$|E
500|$|MacGregor quickly {{moved his}} family back to London, where the furore {{following}} the Poyais survivors' return had died down. In {{the midst of a}} serious economic downturn, some investors had subscribed to the £300,000 Poyais loan issued by Thomas Jenkins & Company—apparently believing the assertion of the Cazique's publicists that the previous loans had defaulted only because of embezzlement by one of his agents. MacGregor was arrested soon after his arrival back in Britain, and held at Tothill Fields Bridewell in Westminster for about a week before being released without charge. He initiated a new, less ornate version of the Poyais scheme, describing himself simply as the [...] "Cacique of the Republic of Poyais". The new Poyaisian office at 23 <b>Threadneedle</b> Street made none of the claims to diplomatic status the old Poyaisian legation at Dowgate Hill had done.|$|E
500|$|The bomb {{exploded}} at 10:27am, causing extensive {{damage to buildings}} along a significant stretch of Bishopsgate. The blast raised a mushroom cloud {{that could be seen}} across much of London and gouged a 15-foot wide crater in the street. Buildings up to 500 metres away were damaged, with 1,500,000 sq ft (140,000 m²) of office space being affected and over 500 tonnes of glass broken. The NatWest Tower — at the time the City's tallest skyscraper – was amongst the structures badly damaged, with many windows {{on the east side of}} the tower destroyed; the Daily Mail said [...] "black gaps punched its fifty-two floors like a mouth full of bad teeth". Damage extended as far north as Liverpool Street station and south beyond <b>Threadneedle</b> Street. St Ethelburga's church, seven metres away from the bomb, collapsed as a result of the explosion. The cost of repair was estimated at the time at £1 billion. Civilian casualties were low as it was a Saturday morning and the City was typically occupied by only a small number of residents, office workers, security guards, builders, and maintenance staff. Forty-four people were injured by the bomb and News of the World photographer Ed Henty was killed after ignoring police warnings and rushing to the scene. The truck-bomb produced the explosive power of 1,200kg of TNT.|$|E
2500|$|The Bank {{moved to}} its current {{location}} in <b>Threadneedle</b> Street in 1734, and thereafter slowly acquired neighbouring land to create the edifice seen today. Sir Herbert Baker's rebuilding of the Bank, demolishing most of Sir John Soane's earlier building, was described by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner as [...] "the greatest architectural crime, in the City of London, of the twentieth century".|$|E
2500|$|In December 2005, the London Stock Exchange {{rejected}} a £1.6billion takeover offer from Macquarie Bank. The London Stock Exchange described the offer as [...] "derisory", a sentiment echoed by shareholders in the Exchange. Shortly after Macquarie withdrew its offer, the LSE received an unsolicited approach from NASDAQ valuing {{the company at}} £2.4billion. This too it rejected. NASDAQ later pulled its bid, and {{less than two weeks}} later on 11 April 2006, struck a deal with LSE's largest shareholder, Ameriprise Financial's <b>Threadneedle</b> Asset Management unit, to acquire all of that firm's stake, consisting of 35.4million shares, at £11.75 per share. NASDAQ also purchased 2.69million additional shares, resulting in a total stake of 15%. While the seller of those shares was undisclosed, it occurred simultaneously with a sale by Scottish Widows of 2.69million shares. The move was seen as an effort to force LSE to the negotiating table, as well as to limit the Exchange's strategic flexibility.|$|E
2500|$|St. Anthony's {{was erected}} in {{the thirteenth century}} (some time before 1254), in the heart of London on <b>Threadneedle</b> Street, atop the less than ideal site of a Jewish synagogue. [...] The chapel of St. Anthony's was built in 1310 without {{permission}} of the bishop of London. To prevents its degradation, the hospital petitioned for a chapel on the bishops terms. Unlike St. Giles, there was insufficient land at St. Anthony's, London, for recreation or food production. As a result, herbs or 'erbys' and vegetables had to be bought on a daily basis for consumption by the entire community. Accounts of foreign expenses at St. Anthony's also show the purchase of various spices, often with intrinsic medicinal qualities that could alter the level of heat and moisture within the body. Some of the spices bought include, saffron, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, lavender, pepper and mustard. Interestingly, the amount spent on herbs, produce, and spices were far surpassed by the amount spent on fish and meat. According to quarterly expenditure reports, fifty-eight percent of the quarterly budget was spent on meat, thirty-four percent on fish, three percent on pottage, two percent on dairy, one percent herbs and one percent on eggs. The unusually detailed records of diet and expenditures at St. Anthony's have revealed that the diet of the clerical establishment ('the hall') and the diets of the almsmen, patients and children ('the hospital') were quite different and class-based. During a typical week, [...] "the entire community shared dishes of pottage, veal, mutton and eggs; the hall alone consumed pork, ribs of roast beef, duck, fresh salmon and eels; and the hospital was supplied with mutton, plaice and haddock." [...] It is clear that the hall, or more wealthy, enjoyed extravagant meals of meat and fish, while the hospital, the patients and the poor, were fed simpler and cheaper food.|$|E

60|$|I {{replied that}} he I sought was not an attorney, but a man of business.

60|$|From then till about five, when I {{generally}} had {{a cup of}} tea and a chop, {{he regularly}} disappeared. Where he went and what he did between those hours nobody ever knew. Gadbut swore that twice he had met him coming out of a stockbroker's office in <b>Threadneedle</b> Street, and, improbable though the statement at first appeared, some colour of credibility began to attach to it when we reflected upon the dog's inordinate passion for acquiring and hoarding coppers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Messrs. Newcome, in <b>Threadneedle</b> Street, {{are good}} enough to keep my money for me when I have any, and I am happy to say they have some of mine in hand now.

Why don't we give the squire's land to the squire's tenants, instead of dragging in the county council?" ...|$|E
60|$|His Lordship went to {{the table}} and began to write, leaving me to the Chronicle, the pages of which I did not see. Then came Mr. Dix, and such a change I had never beheld in mortal man. In place of the would-be squire I had {{encountered}} in <b>Threadneedle</b> Street, here was an unctuous person of business in sober gray; but he still wore the hypocritical smirk with no joy in it. His bow was now all respectful obedience. Comyn acknowledged it with a curt nod.|$|E
60|$|As, to my Lord Gaunt's dismay, and the chuckling {{delight of}} his natural enemy and father, the Lady Gaunt had no children--the Lord George Gaunt was desired {{to return from}} Vienna, where he was engaged in waltzing and diplomacy, and to {{contract}} a matrimonial alliance with the Honourable Joan, only daughter of John Johnes, First Baron Helvellyn, {{and head of the}} firm of Jones, Brown, and Robinson, of <b>Threadneedle</b> Street, Bankers; from which union sprang several sons and daughters, whose doings do not appertain to this story.|$|E

Into the oldest and cleanest-looking house of business in the square, he led the way. The only inscription on the door-post was 'Cheeryble, Brothers;' but from a hasty glance at the directions of some packages which were lying about, Nicholas supposed that the brothers Cheeryble were German merchants.|$|E

60|$|They {{passed down}} <b>Threadneedle</b> Street, a {{wilderness}} with boards nailed {{up in front}} of the great bank windows. A little further on there was the usual crowd of people, but they were all hanging about, uncertain what to do. There was no Stock Exchange business being transacted, simply because there were no buyers. At the Mansion House they found a few 'buses running, and managed to board one which was going westwards. It set them down in New Oxford Street, not far from Russell Square. Here there were denser crowds than ever. The entrance to the square itself was almost blocked.|$|E
