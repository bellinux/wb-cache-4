5|$|Beginning in February 2008, US forces began {{returning}} {{political and}} military control of Anbar Province to Iraqis. On 14 February, 1st Battalion 7th Marines withdrew from Hīt. Two days later, American and Iraqi forces conducted a joint heliborne operation meant {{to show off the}} Iraqi security forces. More significantly, in late March, both Iraqi Army divisions in Anbar Province, the 1st and 7th Divisions, were sent south to participate in the Battle of Basra. Their participation helped win the battle for the government forces and showcased the major improvements to the Iraqi Army. On 26 March 2008, B Squadron of the British SAS as part of Task Force Knight were called upon to hit a terrorist bomb makers house in the early hours, after <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him out and receiving no response they stormed the house, they received a hail of fire and four men were wounded and a terrorist from another building joined in the firefight. With Helicopter support, they pressed on and the SAS chased their targets into another house who used civilians as hostages who were then accidentally killed beside the terrorists, One SAS operator was killed.|$|E
5|$|Later, Michael tells Rex he {{must stay}} with his Aunt Carol, as Michael {{is working on}} a case with a {{dangerous}} suspect. His partner, Bird, goes to his house, after <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him to make sure he is alright, but then looks in the garage and finds Michael's work on his accident and Detective Hawkins. Bird goes to Dr. Judith Evans, who reluctantly advises Bird to check on Michael. Michael goes to Ed Hawkins' house, shoots Hawkins in the leg, and asks him for evidence. Hawkins says heroin was taken from various evidence lockers and sent out for sale through Westfield Distribution, and further evidence is on his laptop. Hawkins tries to overpower Michael, forcing him to kill Hawkins, right before Bird enters the house. Michael takes Bird's gun and handcuffs him. Bird suggests that to get into Hawkins' laptop, they use a hacker they both worked with previously, right before he knocks out Michael, who wakes up in the red reality.|$|E

At that time, Rosario said later, she believed Hedgepeth was asleep in her room, and left the apartment's door unlocked.|$|E

25|$|Dorothy was {{to pick up}} {{her sister}} Louise after seeing Snider and never showed, which was very unlike her. Around 11 pm, Snider's private {{investigator}} called Cushner on his private line, saying that he had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Snider for several hours, but Snider was not answering. Although there were many guests in the residence, Snider's bedroom door was closed and they assumed Snider's privacy was essential. Cushner broke into Snider's room and discovered the nude bodies of Snider and Stratten, both having been shot with a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun, which Snider had recently acquired. Police determined that Snider murdered Stratten, who was 20, then abused and raped her corpse, before turning the shotgun on himself. Dorothy's body was found connected to an odd, homemade sexual contraption and both bodies were covered with ants.|$|E
25|$|When {{they return}} to the mainland, the Ghostbusters find that Ilyssa was {{captured}} and the Containment Unit shut down once again, releasing the ghosts, and suspect that Peck is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> forth a Supreme Destructor. A massive mausoleum appears in Central Park and the team fights {{their way into the}} central structure. Inside, they find both Ilyssa and Peck chained to walls and discover that Ivo Shandor has possessed Mayor Mulligan, using Peck as a scapegoat to avoid detection. Shandor reveals that he wishes to take Gozer's place as a god, the latter having failed him twice. The Ghostbusters are able to exorcise Shandor from the Mayor before he can sacrifice Ilyssa as part of a ritual, but are pulled into the Ghost World where they are forced to fight Shandor in his Destructor form, a Satanic being called the Architect. They manage to defeat Shandor by crossing their Proton Streams, and return to the real world, where they rescue Ilyssa, Peck, and the Mayor before the mausoleum collapses.|$|E
25|$|On August 30, a new fire {{broke out}} {{on the island of}} Kornat, part of the Kornati National park. A team of 23 firemen was sent on an Mi-8 {{helicopter}} on what they thought would be just a routine mission. Upon arrival, they split into two teams, one with 6 firemen and the other with 17. The latter split up one more time when three firemen lost their communication gear and again when the fourth one went checking for the signal, while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> his superiors. The remaining 13 were stranded between two hills with no water whatsoever, since the large water canister landed 500 meters away from them. While searching for it, they got encircled by a wall of fire. Although the burning grass was only 10cm tall, the firemen didn't have the necessary equipment and had nowhere to run. In only a minute, six of them were killed instantly, while the other seven remained lying on the ground, badly burned, waiting for help more than two hours. After the rescue, they were sent to the hospital in Zadar and then transferred to hospitals in Zagreb and Split. Six of them died in hospital because of serious burns covering large areas of their bodies. The fire itself had nowhere to spread, and was soon naturally extinguished, bringing up many questions about the necessity of the intervention. Allegedly, the firemen were killed by an unexploded CBU-87 dumped over Kornat island by NATO planes returning from the Kosovo war in 1999.|$|E

Later that night, Jim, who was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), ends up talking to Pam on the phone {{for the first time since}} the two kissed. The two have a lengthy {{conversation}} and begin to reconnect. [...] Jim misinterprets Pam's parting phrase to Ryan as being directed at him, and the two end their conversation, much to their sadness.

500|$|With Deangelo Vickers {{still in}} a coma, Dunder Mifflin–Sabre Scranton is left with Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) as interim {{regional}} manager.

Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) takes it upon herself to protect the office and their clients from Creed's haphazard and potentially catastrophic managerial style (he keeps <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> major clients and tell them the office is about to go out of business) by distracting him with activities and posing as various clients when Creed has Jordan Garfield (Cody Horn) contact them.|$|E
500|$|Talking further about Scritti Politti, a British post-punk band, Minogue reminisced {{about her}} {{collaboration}} with the band's frontman Green Gartside, who provides vocals on the track [...] "Someday", saying, [...] "To this day I haven't met him! I {{left a message on}} his answering machine, saying, [...] "Hi, it's Kylie! I just wanted to say thanks so much! You sound brilliant!" [...] "After Dark" [...] was co-written by Dennis, who had previously co-written [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] for Minogue. Torrini, who co-wrote [...] "Slow", revealed how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It was like I had just accidentally walked into the line of fire with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number.

500|$|... "Slow" [...] {{was written}} by Kylie Minogue, Dan Carey, and Emilíana Torrini, and {{produced}} by Carey, Torrini, and Sunnyroads. In 2009, Torrini explained how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It was like I had just accidentally walked into {{the line of fire}} with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened". Musically, the song is an eighties-inspired synthpop track. It utilises a very simple and [...] "minimalist" [...] style of production and was described as an [...] "electro-pop/disco fusion with percolating crackle-and-pop beats and sugary vocal overdubs" [...] by Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine. Additionally, it contains elements of electroclash and club music. Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue urges a man, whom she meets at a club, to [...] "slow down" [...] and dance with her. According to Minogue, the lyrics of the song are about [...] " [...] how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone". She further said that she [...] "loved the way the song had this push-pull effect; the musical and lyrical combination gives you a sense of that".|$|E
2500|$|Other special {{phone numbers}} {{are used for}} {{high-capacity}} numbers with several telephone circuits, typically a request line to a radio station where dozens or even hundreds of callers may be <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> in at once, such as for a contest.

2500|$|Pro-independence {{politicians}} and organizations, including Catalan President Carles Puigdemont, {{have referred to}} Cuixart and Sànchez as political prisoners.

An article published in El País argued that according to the criteria established by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) Sànchez and Cuixart could not be considered [...] "political prisoners". Amnesty International issued an official statement considering the charge of sedition and the preventive imprisonment as [...] "excessive" [...] and called for their immediate release, but several days later made it clear that does not consider them [...] "political prisoners". Footage spread by a Twitter user showed Cuixart and Sànchez at 11 at night <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> off the protests, contradicting the part where the judicial order imprisoning them says that [...] "they did not use at any time the control they had over the people to call off the demonstration they had summoned".|$|E
2500|$|On February 18, 2004, François Beaudoin won his {{wrongful}} dismissal {{suit against}} the Business Development Bank of Canada. Justice Andre Denis {{ruled in favor of}} Beaudoin's claim that he was fired for political reasons in 1999 for <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> in the loan on the Grand Mere Inn, ruled that Chrétien's former aide Jean Carle and Michel Vennat was guilty of making false criminal and civil charges of wrongdoing against Beaudoin to discredit him for suing the bank, accused Carle of committing perjury during the trial and declared given the [...] "unspeakable injustice" [...] Beaudoin had suffered, told the government not to appeal his ruling because they would be wasting the tax-payers' money if they did. The lingering repercussions of the sponsorship scandal of 2002 reduced the Liberal Party to a minority in the 2004 federal election, may have strengthened the separatist case, and contributed to the government's defeat in the 2006 election. The scandal led to long-running, deep investigations by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, a federal inquiry, the Gomery Commission, chaired by Justice John Gomery (called by Prime Minister Paul Martin in 2005), and several prosecutions and convictions; the legal process continued to late 2011, more than a decade after the scandal began.|$|E
