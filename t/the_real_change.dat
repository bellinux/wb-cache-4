25|$|Consider {{a generic}} example {{in which the}} initial {{transition}} state along a concerted pathway is represented by a black dot on a red diagonal (Figure 1). Changing {{the height of the}} corners can have two effects on the position of the transition state: it can move along the diagonal, reflecting a change in the Gibbs free energy of the reaction (ΔG°), or perpendicular to it, reflecting a change in the energy of competing pathways. Thus, in accordance with the Hammond postulate, the transition state moves along the diagonal towards the corner that is raised in energy (a Hammond effect) and perpendicular to the diagonal towards the corner that is lowered (an anti-Hammond effect). In this example, R is raised in energy and I(2) is lowered in energy. The transition state moves accordingly and the vector sum of both movements gives <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>change</b> in its position.|$|E

For her twentieth birthday, activists at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) adopted a pig called Nora in her name. Cyrus also supports thirty-nine well-known charities including: Make-a-Wish Foundation, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, St.Jude's Children's Research Hospital, To Write Love on Her Arms, NOH8 Campaign, Love Is Louder Than the Pressure to Be Perfect and The Jed Foundation among others. In 2013, Cyrus was named the fourteenth most charitable celebrity of the year by Do Something.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{differences and}} the dynamics in {{prices on the}} second-hand market for family houses in large (Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö), medium-sized, small and industrial cities and sparsely populated areas are analysed in this paper. The basic house price data set used in the analysis consists of constant quality monthly price indices. The sample starts in January 1981 and ends in July 1997. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> price <b>changes</b> in house prices for all seven regions display {{a high degree of}} autocorrelation, and the correlograms reveal a mean reverting pattern. The Granger causality test indicates that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> price <b>changes</b> for <b>the</b> Stockholm area 'Granger cause' the price changes in the other areas. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>real</b> price <b>change</b> in <b>the</b> Stockholm area has a ripple effect on the six other areas. Both bivariate and multivariate Granger tests indicate information content in a number of macroeconomic variables versus <b>the</b> <b>real</b> price <b>changes</b> for <b>the</b> Stockholm area and the entire country. A simple VAR model was estimated with the price changes for family houses in the Stockholm area, a proxy for consumption growth and the change in the rate in the unemployment rate as endogenous variables and a number of exogenous macro variables. Experiments with impulse response functions show that a shock in the change in the rate of unemployment has a strong effect on real house prices and consumption.
