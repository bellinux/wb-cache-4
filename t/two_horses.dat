5|$|In 1965 The Children's Museum of Indianapolis, then {{located in}} a {{building}} at 30th and Meridian Streets, acquired <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> from the carousel. Mildred Compton, the museum director, had seen the carousel in Broad Ripple Park before 1952, and hoped to secure the surviving animals, but the park district was initially unwilling to part with more than two, as the district was using five or six animals in the annual Christmas displays at Monument Circle. During {{the first half of}} 1966, the <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> were refinished by a museum volunteer. Both were stripped of old paint, one was repainted, and the other was refinished with lemon oil to feature the carvings on the animal. Compton obtained real horse tails from an Indianapolis slaughterhouse to replace the lost originals. By September 1966 the <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> were ready for display in the museum's front entrance.|$|E

5|$|Then they disinterred the {{chieftain}} {{and gave}} him new clothes. In his grave, he received intoxicating drinks, fruits, and a stringed instrument. The chieftain was put into his bed with all his weapons and grave offerings around him. Then they had <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> run themselves sweaty, cut them to pieces, and threw the meat into the ship. Finally, they sacrificed a hen and a cock.|$|E

5|$|A Private act, {{passed in}} September 1881, allowed the {{construction}} of more private horse tramways and additional acts were passed authorising more line construction and services by more companies. Most of the companies operated double-decker tram, although some were single level cabs with many built by John Stephenson Co, Duncan & Fraser of Adelaide, and from 1897 by the A at Kensington. The trams ran at an average speed of , usually <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> pulling each tram {{from a pool of}} four to ten.|$|E
5|$|Easy Jet (1967–1992) was an American Quarter Horse foaled, or born, in 1967, {{and was one}} of only <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> to {{have been}} a member of the American Quarter Horse Association (or AQHA) Hall of Fame as well as being an {{offspring}} of members. Easy Jet won the 1969 All American Futurity, the highest race for Quarter Horse racehorses, and was named World Champion Quarter Race Horse in the same year. He earned the highest speed rating awarded at the time—AAAT. After winning 27 of his 38races in two years of racing, he retired from the race track and became a breeding stallion.|$|E
5|$|On Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, {{units of}} the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army seized several {{prominent}} buildings and streets in central Dublin, including the General Post Office (GPO) in Sackville Street, one of the buildings nearest the Pillar. They set up headquarters at the GPO where they declared an Irish Republic under a provisional government. One of the first recorded actions of the Easter Rising occurred near the Pillar when lancers from the nearby Marlborough Street barracks, sent to investigate the disturbance, were fired on from the GPO. They withdrew in confusion, leaving four soldiers and <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> dead.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Churchill Downs on Derby Day, May 5, 2012, Shackleford raced in the $400,000 Grade 2 Churchill Downs Stakes {{at seven}} furlongs on the dirt. In that race, he beat the favorite, American Champion Sprint Horse Amazombie, by a length. The <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> {{separated}} {{themselves from the}} rest of the field by five lengths with Shackleford on the inside. Just inside the sixteenth pole, he edged away and beat Amazombie under jockey Mike Smith by a length. Gantry was another five and a half lengths back in the third. The time was 1:21 on a fast track.|$|E

5|$|They {{arrived in}} California on October 11. Part of the King's stay {{was at the}} Spreckels summer home in Aptos, with a {{sightseeing}} trip to Lick Observatory. While he was a guest at the Spreckels home, the sugar baron gave the King <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> and a colt. California friends of the King joined him for a farewell dinner at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco on October 22, just prior to his sailing on the steamship Australia back to Honolulu. Among those attending were Spreckels, Governor Perkins, California state senator Paul Neumann, and University of California president Horace Davis.|$|E

5|$|About 10 a.m., one of Desha's neighbors {{encountered}} the riderless gray mare, still rigged with saddle and bridle. Catching the horse, he rode {{it up the}} road, shortly finding Desha's riderless bay (which he recognized), with a saddle but no bridle. He noticed blood on the neck and withers of Desha's horse. Further along, the neighbor encountered Desha on foot, carrying two saddlebags. Desha {{said that he had}} just accepted the gray mare as payment from a man who owed him money. He did not volunteer how the <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> had escaped his control, but mounted the gray mare and returned home. Later that day, friends at Desha's tannery noticed that he was unusually quiet and repeatedly asked what was wrong. He said that he had been kicked by a horse and severely cut his finger in separate incidents the previous day.|$|E
5|$|Although the feigned flights did {{not break}} the lines, they {{probably}} thinned out the housecarls in the English shield wall. The housecarls were replaced {{with members of the}} fyrd, and the shield wall held. Archers appear to have been used again before and during an assault by the cavalry and infantry led by the duke. Although 12th-century sources state that the archers were ordered to shoot at a high angle to shoot over the front of the shield wall, there is no trace of such an action in the more contemporary accounts. It is not known how many assaults were launched against the English lines, but some sources record various actions by both Normans and Englishmen that took place during the afternoon's fighting. The Carmen claims that Duke William had <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> killed under him during the fighting, but William of Poitiers's account states that it was three.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Light and Galileo {{did meet}} at Ascot in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, {{for which the}} Aidan O'Brien-trained three-year-old was sent off the 1/2 {{favourite}} ahead of Fantastic Light at 7/2. The race {{was the subject of}} considerable advance publicity, and was portrayed as a clash between the two most powerful forces in European racing; Godolphin, represented by Fantastic Light, and Ballydoyle/Coolmore represented by Galileo. As in the Prince of Wales's Stakes, Dettori settled Fantastic Light in the early stages before moving him out to challenge in the straight. Galileo had already taken the lead but Fantastic Light moved up and went level a furlong out. The <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> raced side-by-side for several strides, but Galileo then pulled ahead to win by two lengths.|$|E

5|$|Goss darted inside, but Hays {{slipped and}} fell {{before he could}} enter the blockhouse. As he fell, three musket balls lodged {{themselves}} into the wall {{where he had been}} standing moments before. While the attackers reloaded, Hays slipped inside and for about an hour an exchange of heavy gunfire erupted between the parties before the attackers withdrew. A fourth man, Upton, was out hunting nearby; when he was discovered by the attackers he was chased throughout the afternoon. Upton escaped the attackers injury-free. In fact, no person was killed or injured during the Plum River raid. The small raiding party escaped with three horses, but <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> were badly wounded by gunfire, and the other shot dead by the settlement's defenders.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of the Monongahela, the French {{and their}} Indian allies ambushed Braddock's reduced {{forces and the}} general was mortally wounded. After {{suffering}} devastating casualties, the British panicked and retreated in disarray. Washington rode {{back and forth across}} the battlefield, rallying the remnants of the British and Virginian forces into an organized retreat. In the process, he demonstrated bravery and stamina, despite his lingering illness. He had <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> shot from underneath him, while his hat and coat were pierced by several bullets. Two-thirds of the British force of 976 men were killed or wounded in the battle. Washington's conduct in the battle redeemed his reputation among many who had criticized his command in the Battle of Fort Necessity.|$|E
5|$|Irataba {{assisted}} Captain Lorenzo Sitgreaves {{during his}} 1851 {{exploration of the}} Colorado. On March 19, 1851, a family of Mormon settlers, the Oatmans, who were traveling by wagon train {{in what is now}} Arizona, were attacked by a band of Western Yavapai, probably the Tolkepaya. They captured two survivors of the attack: the 14-year-old Olive Oatman and her 7-year-old sister, Mary Ann. After a year with the Yavapai, the girls were sold to the Mohave, and adopted into the Oach clan where they lived with the family of a Mohave man called Tokwatha (Musk Melon) a friend of Irataba. Olive remained with the Mohave until February 22, 1856, when Tokwatha, having been warned that having a white girl among them might be seen as an offense by whites, brought her to Fort Yuma carpenter Henry Grinnell, releasing her in return for <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> and some blankets and beads. Irataba may have learned about Anglo-Americans and their society from Oatman, and knowing her may have contributed to his generally favourable disposition towards Whites.|$|E

5|$|Longtime Quarter Horse breeder and racehorse owner Walter Merrick of Sayre, Oklahoma, bred Easy Jet {{from two}} future AQHA Hall of Fame members, Jet Deck and Thoroughbred mare Lena's Bar in 1967. His dam, or mother, Lena's Bar, had {{produced}} {{a small number}} of other offspring, but Easy Jet was her last; she died shortly after he was weaned, or removed from his mother's milk. Both of his parents were descended from Three Bars, who was the sire of Lena's Bar and the grandsire of Jet Deck's dam. Easy Jet is one of only <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> in the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame to have both parents in the Hall of Fame; his two grandsires, Moon Deck and Three Bars, are also in the Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Nellie Kehoe was {{discharged}} from Lansing's St. Lawrence Hospital on May 16, {{and her husband}} murdered her some time between her release and the bombings two days later. He put her body in a wheelbarrow located {{in the rear of}} the farm's chicken coop, where it was found in a heavily charred condition after the farm explosions and fire. Piled around the cart were silverware and a metal cash box. Ashes of several bank notes could be seen through a slit in the cash box. Kehoe had placed and wired homemade pyrotol firebombs in the house and all the buildings of the farm. The burned remains of his <b>two</b> <b>horses</b> were found tied in their enclosures with their legs wired together to prevent their rescue during the fire.|$|E
