40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to discuss the {{challenges}} and potentials for transforming recreational forests in Peninsular Malaysia as viable ecotourism destination. <b>The</b> <b>selected</b> <b>research</b> and <b>articles</b> of recreational forest were accumulated in determining the lack and weakness of the forest. In fact, recreational forests have the potential to be developed and marketed as ecotourism destinations since our forests are endowed with diverse flora and fauna, as well as other natural destinations. Some of the recreational forests really famous but some are seems to have no visitors. Several challenges are also noted in this paper which needs to be addressed before the potential can be translated into a real tourism product. This include the lack of competence pool of personnel to carryout tasks necessary to receive visitors, lack of maintenance of current facilities, lack of structured programming of ecotourism activities and the non-existence of a concerted efforts in properly developed the recreational forests as a ecotourism destinations. Once such issues are addressed, recreational forests can help to diversify and adding a unique dimension into our ecotourism and outdoor recreation sector...|$|R

The scientific evidence of the trajectories and the magnitude of stress dissipation can help in the diagnosis of the masticatory alterations and the planning of oral rehabilitation in the different areas of Dentistry. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a tool that may reproduce complex structures with irregular geometries of natural and artificial tissues of the human body because it uses mathematical functions that enable the understanding of the craniofacial biomechanics. The aim {{of this study was to}} review the literature on the advantages and limitations of FEA in the skull biomechanics and Dentistry study. The keywords of <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> original <b>research</b> <b>articles</b> were: Finite element analysis, biomechanics, skull, Dentistry, teeth, and implant. The literature review was performed in the databases, PUBMED, MEDLINE and SCOPUS. <b>The</b> <b>selected</b> books and articles were between the years 1928 and 2010. The FEA is an assessment tool whose application in different areas of the Dentistry has gradually increased over the past 10 years, but its application in the analysis of the skull biomechanics is scarce. The main advantages of the FEA are the realistic mode of approach and the possibility of results being based on analysis of only one model. On the other hand, the main limitation of the FEA studies is the lack of anatomical details in the modeling phase of the craniofacial structures and the lack of information about the material properties...|$|R

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study was designed}} to ascertain the perceptions of students, parents, music teachers, school administrators, and school board members regarding a correlation between music participation and academic success. While all the interviewees were from different schools, they represented one school district. Each interview was audio-recorded for the perceptions of the six research synopses I provided the interviewees to read. The problem I investigated was to determine if research findings affect the attitude of individuals who are closely associated with school music. Do music teachers, school administrators, school board members, and music students and their parents believe these studies? The purpose of my dissertation was to ascertain what fourteen individuals believed in regarding the research studies presented to them. What they believed and comprehended from reading six research synopsis reports pertaining to a relationship between music participation and academic achievement. The research studies were chosen by me because of the relationship between music education and academic success. I explored the understanding and meaning that individuals associated with school music education assigned to these <b>selected</b> <b>research</b> findings in music education. In order to achieve the purpose of this study, a qualitative descriptive design was employed to examine the understanding and beliefs of selected individuals involved with school music education concerning <b>selected</b> <b>research</b> on music participation and academic success. Specific questions I investigated were: 1) To what extent do participants believe and understand <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> <b>research</b> supporting a connection between music and academic achievement? 2) What is the nature of understanding <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> <b>research</b> supporting a connection between music and academic achievement for participants? 3) What meanings do participants assign to <b>selected</b> <b>research</b> supporting a connection between music and academic achievement? 4) For participants, is there a connection between their musical biographies and perception and interpretation of <b>selected</b> <b>research</b> supporting a connection between music and academic achievement? 5) To what extent do these <b>selected</b> <b>research</b> findings influence participants? All interviewees reflected on the functionality of music participation to further academic success. In addition, interviewees mentioned missing variables of the findings of the researchers. While many of the interviewees did not believe music participation to be the contributing factor for academic success, they did believe parental involvement was a key factor for student’s academic success...|$|R
