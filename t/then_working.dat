5|$|Quatermass was {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} BBC production, but after they lost faith in the project, due to spiralling costs, production was halted. The scripts were taken by Euston Films and Kneale, <b>then</b> <b>working</b> for Independent Television, was commissioned to rewrite the scripts into two versions: a four-part television serial and The Quatermass Conclusion, a 100-minute film, intended for international theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|After a long siege, Andi Guru and Tiku's former {{lieutenant}} Tandi Bunna'– both by <b>then</b> <b>working</b> for the Dutch– approached Tiku on 26 October {{and offered}} a cease fire. Although initially unwilling, Tiku was reportedly convinced by civilians who reminded him that his mother– {{who had died in}} the siege– needed to be buried. After three days of peaceful intermingling, on the night of 30 October the Dutch forces took over the fortress, appropriated all weapons, and captured Tiku. He and his soldiers were forced to go to Tondon.|$|E

5|$|By mid 1954 {{the author}} Ian Fleming had {{published}} two novels—Casino Royale (1953) and Live and Let Die (1954)—and had a third, Moonraker, being edited {{and prepared for}} production. That year he read a story in The Sunday Times about diamond smuggling from Sierra Leone. He considered this story as the possible basis for a new novel and, through an old school friend, he engineered a meeting with Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-head of MI5, <b>then</b> <b>working</b> in a security capacity for the diamond-trading company De Beers. The material Fleming gathered was used in both Diamonds Are Forever and The Diamond Smugglers, a non-fiction book published in 1957.|$|E
5|$|During 1935, {{he began}} {{work for the}} National Resources Planning Board, which was <b>then</b> <b>working</b> on a large {{consumer}} budget survey. Ideas from this project later {{became a part of}} his Theory of the Consumption Function. Friedman began employment with the National Bureau of Economic Research during autumn 1937 to assist Simon Kuznets in his work on professional income. This work resulted in their jointly authored publication Incomes from Independent Professional Practice, which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income, a major component of the Permanent Income Hypothesis that Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s. The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices.|$|E
5|$|During this {{stint in}} Florida, LeDuc made a scripted turn from face to heel. Garvin claimed that LeDuc was aligned with heel manager Sonny King, but LeDuc denied the claim. Garvin then showed video footage {{to prove that}} LeDuc had secret {{dealings}} with King. LeDuc responded by attacking Garvin {{in front of the}} crowd, solidifying a heel turn for LeDuc. In a storyline several months later, LeDuc and King Curtis Iaukea attacked Buddy Rogers, a veteran <b>then</b> <b>working</b> as a face. The injuries Rogers received were said to be so severe that he was forced to retire, although, in reality, Rogers had simply moved to another wrestling promotion.|$|E

He {{attended}} Petersham Boys' School, becoming a prefect in 1932 and vice captain the following year. As well as playing sport, he was a keen aircraft modeller and built crystal radio sets. Having attained his intermediate certificate, Hughes entered Fort Street High School in February 1934. He left after eight months to take up employment at Saunders' Jewellers in George Street, Sydney, and enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 20January 1936. Hughes had also applied to, and been accepted by, the Royal Australian Navy, but chose the RAAF.|$|E
5|$|In December 1997, Rajinikanth {{announced}} his next project, {{which would have}} K. S. Ravikumar as director. The title of the film was announced as Padayappa in September 1998. Though principal photography for the film was supposed to start in April 1998, the FEFSI strike delayed the project. After the strike ended, Ravikumar still had to complete the film he was <b>then</b> <b>working</b> on, Natpukkaga (1998), before he could begin Padayappa. After completing Natpukkaga in June 1998, Padayappa was further delayed when Ravikumar agreed to quickly remake Natpukkaga in Telugu as Sneham Kosam (1999).|$|E
5|$|Lee and Yang's {{research}} into existing experimental results convinced them that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions {{and for the}} strong interaction. For this reason, scientists had expected that {{it would also be}} true for the weak interaction, but it had not been tested, and Lee and Yang's theoretical studies showed that it might not hold true for the weak interaction. Lee and Yang worked out a pencil-and-paper design of an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Lee then turned to Wu for her expertise in choosing and <b>then</b> <b>working</b> out the hardware manufacture, set-up, and laboratory procedures for carrying out this experiment.|$|E

5|$|My Iron Lung, an EP {{and single}} {{released}} late in 1994, was Radiohead's reaction, marking a transition towards the greater depth they aimed for on their second album. It {{was their first}} time working with their future producer Nigel Godrich, <b>then</b> <b>working</b> under Leckie as an audio engineer. It was also Radiohead's first collaboration with artist Stanley Donwood, who has produced all of their artwork since. Promoted through alternative radio stations, My Iron Lungs sales were better than expected, and suggested {{for the first time}} that the band had found a loyal fanbase and were not one-hit wonders.|$|E
5|$|Plagis {{set up and}} ran {{a bottle}} store bearing his name in Salisbury, and was {{involved}} in several businesses during the next three decades, serving as a director on company boards, including Central African Airways from 1963 to 1968. He joined the Rhodesian Front on its formation in 1962, and was its candidate in Salisbury City in that year's general election, losing to the United Federal Party's John Roger Nicholson by 631 votes to 501. According to a report published by the Zimbabwe African National Union in 1969, Plagis was by <b>then</b> <b>working</b> {{in the office of}} the Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith (himself a Second World War Spitfire pilot), with responsibility for the premier's written correspondence.|$|E
5|$|The barrow then {{received}} a mention in George Payne's Collectanea Cantiana, published in 1893. Payne noted a folk tradition {{that there were}} stone avenues connecting Coldrum to the Addington Long Barrow, although asserted that {{he was unable to}} discover any evidence for the existence of this feature. The earliest published photographs of the monument appeared in 1908, produced by George Clinch. In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, <b>then</b> <b>working</b> as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Addington Long Barow alongside the other Medway Megaliths.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Rutgers, Friedman was offered two {{scholarships}} to do graduate work—one in mathematics at Brown University {{and the other}} in economics at the University of Chicago. Friedman chose the latter, thus earning a Master of Arts degree in 1933. He was strongly influenced by Jacob Viner, Frank Knight, and Henry Simons. It was at Chicago that Friedman met his future wife, economist Rose Director. During the 1933–1934 academic year he had a fellowship at Columbia University, where he studied statistics with renowned statistician and economist Harold Hotelling. He was back in Chicago for the 1934–1935 academic year, working as a research assistant for Henry Schultz, who was <b>then</b> <b>working</b> on Theory and Measurement of Demand. That year, Friedman formed what would prove to be lifelong friendships with George Stigler and W. Allen Wallis.|$|E
5|$|Author Charles Higham {{claimed that}} Anthony Blunt, an MI5 agent and Soviet spy, acting on {{orders from the}} British royal family, made a {{successful}} secret trip to Schloss Friedrichshof in Germany {{towards the end of}} the war to retrieve sensitive letters between the Duke of Windsor and Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazis. What is certain is that George VI sent the Royal Librarian, Owen Morshead, accompanied by Blunt, <b>then</b> <b>working</b> part-time in the Royal Library as well as for British intelligence, to Friedrichshof in March 1945 to secure papers relating to the German Empress Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria. Looters had stolen part of the castle's archive, including surviving letters between daughter and mother, as well as other valuables, some of which were recovered in Chicago after the war. The papers rescued by Morshead and Blunt, and those returned by the American authorities from Chicago, were deposited in the Royal Archives.|$|E
5|$|The first {{surgical}} {{intervention was}} performed by Norman Dott, who was a pupil of Harvey Cushing <b>then</b> <b>working</b> in Edinburgh. He introduced the wrapping of aneurysms in the 1930s, and was an early pioneer {{in the use of}} angiograms. American neurosurgeon Dr Walter Dandy, working in Baltimore, was the first to introduce clips in 1938. Microsurgery was applied to aneurysm treatment in 1972 in order to further improve outcomes. The 1980s saw the introduction of triple H therapy as a treatment for delayed ischemia due to vasospasm, and trials with nimodipine in an attempt to prevent this complication. In 1983, the Russian neurosurgeon Zubkov and colleagues reported the first use of transluminal balloon angioplasty for vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH. The Italian neurosurgeon Dr. Guido Guglielmi introduced his endovascular coil treatment in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} March 1801, Jean-François left Figeac for Grenoble, {{which he}} reached on the 27th of March, and where Jacques-Joseph lived in a two-room flat on the rue Neuve. Jacques-Joseph was <b>then</b> <b>working</b> as an {{assistant}} in the import-export company Chatel, Champollion and Rif, yet taught his brother to read, and supported his education. His brother also may {{have been part of}} the source of Champollion's interest in Egypt, since as a young man he wanted to join Napoleon's Egyptian expedition, and often regretted not being able to go. Often known as the younger brother of better known Jacques-Joseph, Jean-François was often called Champollion le Jeune (the young). Later when his brother became the more famous of the two, Jacques added the town of his birth as a second surname and hence is often referred to as Champollion-Figeac, in contrast to his brother Champollion. Although studious and largely self-educated, Jacques did not have Jean-François' genius for language; however, he was talented at earning a living, and supported Jean-François for most of his life.|$|E
5|$|Verna Hellman {{was born}} in St. Louis, Missouri. She was the {{daughter}} of Selma (née Schwartz) and Samuel Hellman, who was <b>then</b> <b>working</b> as a journalist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the Saturday Evening Post. Sam Hellman subsequently moved his family to Hollywood, where he became a prolific screenwriter. Verna Hellman graduated from the University of Southern California with a B.A. in journalism. She then held several positions at 20th Century Fox, including being the assistant sound editor on Fritz Lang's 1944 film The Woman in the Window. In 1946, she married the film editor Sam Fields and stopped working. The Fields had two sons; one of them, Richard Fields, became a film editor. In 1954, Sam Fields {{died of a heart attack}} at the age of 38.|$|E
5|$|In {{a lecture}} given in 1884 to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters Dr. Henrik Mohn, {{one of the}} founders of modern meteorology, argued that the finding of the Jeannette relics {{indicated}} the existence of an ocean current flowing from east to west across the entire Arctic Ocean. The Danish governor of Julianehaab, writing of the find, surmised that an expedition frozen into the Siberian sea might, if its ship were to prove strong enough, cross the polar ocean and land in South Greenland. These theories were read with interest by the 23-year-old Fridtjof Nansen, <b>then</b> <b>working</b> as a curator at the Bergen Museum while completing his doctoral studies. Nansen was already captivated by the frozen north; two years earlier he had experienced a four-month voyage on the sealer Viking, which had included three weeks trapped in drifting ice. An expert skier, Nansen was making plans to lead the first crossing of the Greenland icecap, an objective delayed by the demands of his academic studies, but triumphantly achieved in 1888–89. Through these years Nansen remembered the east–west Arctic drift theory and its inherent possibilities for further polar exploration, and shortly after his return from Greenland he was ready to announce his plans.|$|E
