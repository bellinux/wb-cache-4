40|$|An {{understanding}} of incipient pancreatic neoplasia {{is an essential}} foundation for the future development of effective screening tests for pancreatic cancer. Only when we understand early pancreatic neoplasms will {{we be able to}} detect tumors that are curable with surgical resection. Two approaches have helped define incipient pancreatic neoplasia. First, the histologic examination of pancreata has helped identify the most common histologic lesions in pancreatic tissues adjacent <b>to</b> <b>infiltrating</b> carcinomas. The assumption is that some of these lesions represent the precursors <b>to</b> the <b>infiltrating</b> cancers. Second, advances in molecular genetics now make it possible to define the genetic alterations present in small lesions. The demonstration that a suspected precursor lesion and an infiltrating pancreatic carcinoma share the same genetic alterations would help establish that the lesion is indeed a precursor <b>to</b> <b>infiltrating</b> pancreatic carcinoma. A spectrum of intraductal proliferations in the pancreas has been found associated with infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. These lesions, called "duct lesions," have even been identified in pancreata years before patients develop infiltrating carcinoma. Molecular genetic analysis of these lesions has revealed that they frequently harbor many of the same alterations present in infiltrating carcinoma of the pancreas. These alterations include activation of K-ras and inactivation of p 16, p 53 and, rarely BRCA 2. From these morphologic and molecular observations, we can now develop a progression model for the development of infiltrating carcinoma of the pancreas. Infiltrating carcinomas of the pancreas may arise from pancreatic duct lesions, and the progression of duct lesions <b>to</b> <b>infiltrating</b> cancer is associated with the accumulation of generalized and specific genetic alteration...|$|R

5|$|In Punjab, the CID, {{although}} {{aware of}} possible plans for unrest, was not successful in infiltrating the conspiracy for the mutiny until February 1915. A dedicated force was formed, {{headed by the}} Chief of Punjab CID, and including amongst its members Liaqat Hayat Khan (later head of Punjab CID himself). In February that year, the CID was successful in recruiting the services of Kirpal Singh <b>to</b> <b>infiltrate</b> the plan. Singh, who had a Ghadarite cousin serving in the 23rd Cavalry, was able <b>to</b> <b>infiltrate</b> the leadership, being assigned to work in his cousin's regiment. Singh was soon under suspicion of being a spy, but was able {{to pass on the}} information regarding the date and scale of the uprising to British Indian intelligence. As the date for the mutiny approached, a desperate Rash Behari Bose brought forward the mutiny day to the evening of 19 February, which was discovered by Kirpal Singh on the very day. No attempts were made by the Ghadarites to restrain him, and he rushed to inform Liaqat Hayat Khan of the change of plans. Ordered back to his station to signal when the revolutionaries had assembled, Singh was detained by the would-be mutineers, but managed to escape under the cover of answering the call of nature.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between renal interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration and renal tubule cell (TC) proliferation has been examined in (NZB X NZW) F 1 hybrid (B/W) and control mice. TC proliferation {{was measured by}} tritiated thymidine ([3 H]TdR) injection, autoradiographic examination of kidney sections and enumeration of labelled tubule cells. In B/W mice interstitial infiltration began at 5 months and reached a peak at 9 months. Proliferation of TC began at 7 months and also reached a peak at 9 months. Control mice consisting of NZB, CBA/J and C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice showed no increase with age. When the percentages of labelled TC in areas adjacent <b>to</b> interstitial <b>infiltrates</b> and distant from them were compared, the TC adjacent <b>to</b> <b>infiltrates</b> showed an approximately four-fold greater amount of labelling. Ultrathin light and electron microscopic sections demonstrated TC injury in areas in close proximity <b>to</b> <b>infiltrates.</b> These studies suggest that mononuclear cells in the interstitial infiltrate may be injurious to TC, leading to a sequence of injury and subsequent regeneration of these cells. In diseases in which interstitial nephritis is present, such as Sjögren's syndrome, the interstitial <b>infiltrate</b> may contribute <b>to</b> the observed TC dysfunction...|$|R
