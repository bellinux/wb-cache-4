5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> {{income of the}} people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E
5|$|Available {{evidence}} indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> Lad {{was born in}} December 1902 and passed through the hands {{of at least two}} owners before coming to Sunnybank.

5000|$|A {{main reason}} for using <b>real</b> numbers is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>reals</b> contain all limits. More precisely, every {{sequence}} of <b>real</b> numbers having <b>the</b> property <b>that</b> consecutive terms of the sequence become arbitrarily {{close to each other}} necessarily has <b>the</b> property <b>that</b> after some term in the sequence the remaining terms are arbitrarily close to some specific real number. In mathematical terminology, this means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>reals</b> are complete (in the sense of metric spaces or uniform spaces, which is a different sense than the Dedekind completeness of the order in the previous section).

5|$|Espejo {{realized}} that the charges against the clergy were so serious {{that he had to}} focus on destroying Barreto's credibility. Therefore, he implied that Barreto's own conduct was outrageous because of his excesses in collecting taxes and his habit of paying public funds to licentious women. Additionally, he stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> author of the report was José Miguel Vallejo, whom he called an immoral man who despised the clergy. Thus, Espejo claimed the report should not be believed.|$|E

Sylvester was never charged, and police later admitted their mistake after it was revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> culprit had posed as Sylvester by signing cheques in his name.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, {{the network}} {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>The</b> <b>Real</b> Housewives of Atlanta had been renewed for an eight-season, with both NeNe Leakes and Claudia Jordan departing from the show.

In September 2015, Bravo announced that Porsha Williams would be returning as a full-time housewife once again, along with newcomer actress Kim Fields. The network also announced that former housewife Whitfield, together with new cast member Shamea Morton, would join the series in a supporting capacity, with former cast members, Leakes, Hampton, Jordan and McKinney making guest appearances.|$|E

5|$|In early 1934, Hitler {{and other}} Nazi leaders became {{concerned}} that Röhm was planning a coup d'état. Röhm had socialist and populist views, and believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> revolution {{had not yet}} begun. He felt that the SA—now numbering some three million men, far dwarfing the army—should become the sole arms-bearing corps of the state, and that the army should be absorbed into the SA under his leadership. Röhm lobbied Hitler to appoint him Minister of Defence, a position held by conservative General Werner von Blomberg.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{never gave}} up on a return to public service. He ran an {{unsuccessful}} campaign for the U.S. Senate against John J. Crittenden in 1842. He briefly and futilely sought his party's nomination for president in 1844. He also ran as an independent candidate for Governor of Kentucky in 1848, but after talking with the Democratic candidate, Lazarus W. Powell, who had replaced Linn Boyd on the ticket, Johnson decided to drop out and back Powell. Some speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> object of this campaign was to secure another nomination to the vice-presidency, but this hope was denied.|$|E
5|$|Knowing {{that his}} {{reputation}} {{was at stake}} following the much publicised Tora! Tora! Tora! debacle, Kurosawa moved quickly to a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, {{it has been suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> motivation for the other three directors was {{to make it easier for}} Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.|$|E
25|$|A {{main reason}} for using <b>real</b> numbers is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>reals</b> contain all limits. More precisely, a {{sequence}} of real numbers has a limit, which is a real number, if (and only if) its elements eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to to each other.|$|R

5|$|Presently Alcibiades {{sailed to}} Tissaphernes with a {{detachment}} of ships. According to Plutarch, the supposed {{purpose of this}} mission was to stop the Persian fleet from coming {{to the aid of}} the Peloponnesians. Thucydides is in agreement with Plutarch that the Persian fleet was at Aspendus and that Alcibiades told the troops he would bring the fleet to their side or prevent it from coming at all, but Thucydides further speculates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> reason was to flaunt his new position to Tissaphernes and try to gain some real influence over him. According to the historian, Alcibiades had long known that Tissaphernes never meant to bring the fleet at all.|$|E
5|$|Robert Anderson was {{appointed}} {{head of the}} CID on 1 September, but he went on sick leave to Switzerland on the 7th. Superintendent Thomas Arnold, {{who was in charge}} of H (Whitechapel) Division, went on leave on 2 September. Anderson's absence left overall direction of the enquiries confused, and led Chief Commissioner Sir Charles Warren to appoint Chief Inspector Donald Swanson to co-ordinate the investigation from Scotland Yard. A German hairdresser named Charles Ludwig was taken into custody on 18 September on suspicion of the murders, but he was released less than two weeks later when a double murder demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> culprit was still at large.|$|E

Groves, Jr., say words to the effect <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> purpose in making the bomb was to subdue the Soviets. Historians, notably Barton Bernstein, have cast doubt on this story.|$|E
5|$|Stephen found {{fault with}} Symeon {{especially}} for his charismatic approach, and {{his support of}} individual direct experience of God's grace. Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, {{without the need for}} formal ordination—as practiced by his own teacher, Symeon the Studite. Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, while Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience. Symeon's teachings, especially those regarding the direct experience of God's grace, brought accusations of heresy from Stephen. Symeon responded to Stephen's charges by declaring <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> heresy was to teach {{that it is impossible to}} have direct experience of God (Disc. 29.4).|$|E
5|$|The feud between Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels also dated back to {{the fall}} of 1993. Jack Tunney {{announced}} that he was stripping Michaels of the WWF Intercontinental Championship for not defending the title often enough. There have been reports <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> reason for vacating the title was because Michaels refused to drop the belt. Ramon won the title after competing in a battle royal and defeating Rick Martel, the other finalist in the match. In the angle, Michaels refused to acknowledge the title change, however, as he insisted that he was the true Intercontinental Champion. To gain revenge against Ramon for taking the belt, Michaels attacked Ramon and helped Irwin R. Schyster to steal Ramon's gold chains.|$|E
