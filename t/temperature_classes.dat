We adopted a consensus clustering technique that obtains climate regions for precipitation and temperature separately. Both average linkage hierarchical and k-means non-hierarchical clustering methods were used to create weather station clusters. Using the resulting precipitation and temperature clusters as training data, we performed a machine-learning decision tree classification of remotely-sensed data (i. e., MODIS and TRMM) to map five precipitation classes and seven <b>temperature</b> <b>classes</b> for the Carolinas. These data were intersected to produce 17 consensus clusters for the Carolinas, and 16 climate regions when summarized by counties. The resultant climate regions showed rational climate regionalization reflecting controls on Carolina climate including topography, latitude, storm tracks, and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The use of remotely-sensed data effectively helped the delineation between weather station clusters and even detected consensus clusters that were not identified by intersecting weather station clusters grouped using only in-situ data. We compared the regions with the 15 existing National Climatic Data Center climate divisions using within- and between-cluster standard deviations for both in-situ and remotely-sensed data.

40|$|The ocean {{contributes}} to regulating the Earth’s climate through {{its ability to}} transport heat from the equator to the poles. In this study we use long simulations of an ocean model to investigate whether the heat transport is carried primarily by wind-driven gyres {{or whether it is}} dominated by deep circulations associated with abyssal mixing and high latitude convection. The heat transport is computed as a function of <b>temperature</b> <b>classes.</b> In the Pacific and Indian ocean, the bulk of the heat transport is associated with wind-driven gyres confined to the thermocline. In the Atlantic, the thermocline gyres account for only 40 % of the total heat transport. The remaining 60 % is associated with a circulation reaching down to cold waters below the thermocline. Using a series of sensitivity experiments, we show that this deep heat transport is primarily set by the strength and patterns of surface winds and only secondarily by diabatic processes at high latitudes in the North Atlantic. Abyssal mixing below 2000 m has hardly any impact on ocean heat transport. A major implication is that the role of the ocean in regulating Earth’s climate strongly depends on how surface winds change across different climates in both hemispheres at low and high latitudes...|$|E

These N 2 O emissions are often estimated using the default IPCC 2006 emission factor of 1 % {{of the amount of}} N applied for mineral fertilizer, manure and crop residues. However, a large variation in emission factors exists due to differences in environment (e. g. weather and soil conditions), crops (grassland, arable land, crop residues) and management (e. g. type of manure and fertilizer, application rates, time of application). We developed a simple approach to determine N 2 O emission factors that depend on environmental, crop and management factors. The main factors controlling N 2 O emission are nitrate content, oxygen content, available C content, temperature and pH. The starting point of the method was a two-year monitoring study of Velthof et al. (1996), who found an emission factor of exactly 1 % for grassland on a sandy soil fertilized with calcium ammonium nitrate. The conditions of this experiment were set as the reference from which the effects of other environmental conditions and management on the N 2 O emission factor were estimated. Based on literature and expert knowledge we determined for 19 sources of N input, three soil types, two land use types, three precipitation classes, two pH classes and three <b>temperature</b> <b>classes</b> the effect on the default emission factor. The calculated N 2 O emission factors ranged from 0 to 10 %. The approach was applied to a European scale, using the INTEGRATOR model.

In this study, an SST climatology based on Pathfinder Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data {{has been developed}} along with a method to evaluate its usefulness in climate change studies. The method of evaluation {{is based on a}} statistical comparison between the climatology and individual in situ observations from both the 1994 World Ocean Atlas (WOA 94) and the Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (COADS). ^ The SST climatology was created at a resolution of 9. 28 km using both day and night satellite fields generated with the Version 1 Pathfinder algorithm and cloud-masking procedures, plus an erosion filter that provides additional cloud-masking in the vicinity of cloud-edges. Using the statistical comparison method, this satellite climatology is found to generally better limit noise in SST anomalies than traditional in situ climatologies, except in the tropics where the Pathfinder algorithm faces difficulties arising from high levels of water vapor, atmospheric aerosols, and persistent cloudiness. ^ The Pathfinder SST climatology and individual WOA 94 and COADS anomalies are used to characterize global and regional changes in ocean surface temperature since 1942. Anomaly trends are computed using a traditional five-degree latitude-longitude binning technique as well as a new method which uses climatological <b>temperature</b> <b>classes</b> to group the individual anomalies. Linear trends in the data-rich period between 1960 and 1990 calculated separately from these two independent data sets confirm that global SST warmed at a rate of approximately 0. 10 ∘C decade- 1 in that period. The results of this study also verify regional trends such as cooling in the North Atlantic and generally larger warming in the Southern Hemisphere. This study also reveals that trends in the recent, well-sampled period are insensitive to the averaging technique, but that significant differences are found when the trends are extended further back in time into the more data-sparse periods. Regardless of the binning technique or SST data set used, however, all global SST warming trends are found to equal or exceed the results of previous studies. ...|$|E

The result shows that the highest compressive strength was achieved by FASLG- 3 concrete with 30 % slag addition and exhibited a comparable strength to that normal concrete at 28 days. The 30 % slag addition also improve the workability and increase the setting time of FASLG concrete specimens. It can be concluded that the slag inclusion on fly ash will improve the performance of geopolymer concrete at normal temperature...|$|R
5|$|Liquid crystal phases {{can also}} be based on low-melting {{inorganic}} phases like ZnCl2 that have a structure formed of linked tetrahedra and easily form glasses. The addition of long chain soap-like molecules leads {{to a series of}} new phases that show a variety of liquid crystalline behavior both {{as a function of the}} inorganic-organic composition ratio and of <b>temperature.</b> This <b>class</b> of materials has been named metallotropic.|$|R
5000|$|Class 2: These {{refrigerants}} cool by {{temperature change}} or 'sensible heat', {{the quantity of}} heat being the specific heat capacity x the temperature change. They are air, calcium chloride brine, sodium chloride brine, alcohol, and similar nonfreezing solutions. The purpose of Class 2 refrigerants is to receive a reduction of <b>temperature</b> from <b>Class</b> 1 refrigerants and convey this lower temperature to the area to be air-conditioned.|$|R
