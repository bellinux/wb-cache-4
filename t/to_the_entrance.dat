5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, {{the need for}} a {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, due to the proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> of Port Stephens, and the dangers of the local coastline to ships. Another reason was that mariners were mistaking the entrance to Fingal Bay for that of Port Stephens. At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Following the station's closure, the replica No. 33 Squadron Supermarine Spitfire gate {{guardian}} {{was removed}} from the main entrance for restoration work and moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> of the Operations Room (now known as the Battle of Britain Bunker). The area around the bunker was retained as an enclave under the RAF Uxbridge name, under the care of RAF Northolt. An additional guardian, a Hawker Hurricane in the colours of No. 303 (Polish) Squadron, was added to the area in November 2010.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{he invited}} Perrie {{to be his}} date after she fell off her bike while staring at him work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, they sit on a bench next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance,</b> and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst {{everyone}} else has a good time. Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau {{remained}} unused in Gotenhafen {{until the}} end of the war. As the Red Army advanced on the city, the remaining crew took the ship out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> of the harbor and sank the vessel as a blockship on 27 March 1945. In 1947, the Polish government ordered the ship be removed, and initial salvage operations began. The ship was sealed and refloated on 12 September 1951 then completely scrapped, though it is believed that some of her steel was used in the construction of Polish merchant vessels. She was the largest ship raised at the time. Norway offered to return the turret from Trondheim in 1979, though the offer was rejected. The gun turret was instead preserved as a museum in Norway.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, a new Greek Revival {{octagonal}} synagogue {{designed by}} architect P.J. Krouse and modelled after the Temple of Athena Nike was {{built at the}} corner of 11th Street and 24th Avenue. The marble steps leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> of the building were flanked by large Ionic columns. The new synagogue could seat 500 and featured stained glass windows displaying the Ten Commandments, a menorah, the Star of David, and Noah's Ark. A fire damaged the building during its first year of operation, and while it was being repaired, services were held at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. By 1907, the congregation had grown to include 82 members and was led by Rabbi Max Raisin. By 1927, the Jewish community in Meridian had grown to 525 people, partly due to an influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe. The members of Beth Israel sponsored these newcomers, helping them to find jobs and homes and holding night classes to teach them English.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the station were for access to be from Monmouth Road, which runs {{parallel}} to the railway, north of the line. There {{was to be a}} fully accessible footbridge across the line, with both ramp and stairs, as well as a pedestrian crossing across Monmouth Road and a lit 50-space car park on the old goods yard at the eastern end of Monmouth Road. The very end of the goods yard would be maintained for Network Rail access. These plans were changed following an agreement to acquire a property on Station Road. The new plans have the entrance to be on Station Road, at the east end of the site, meaning there would be no need for a footbridge. There would be disabled parking and a pick up/drop off point adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance,</b> although the exact design of this area is still under consideration. Noise mitigation options are to be investigated and there will be improvements to local footpaths. The line is due to reopen in 2020.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Division left Taranto on 13 April for a {{demonstration}} off the Anatolian coast, {{along with the}} battleships of the 3rd Division, which had left from Tobruk. The two squadrons met on 17 April off the island of Stampalia, after which the combined fleet steamed north. The following day, the ships cut submarine telegraph cables between Imbros, Tenedos, Lemnos, Salonica, and the Dardanelles. The ships then steamed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> to the Dardanelles {{in an attempt to}} lure out the Ottoman fleet. When the Ottoman coastal fortifications began to take the Italian ships under fire, the Italians returned fire and inflicted serious damage on them. On 19 April, Roma and most of the fleet returned to Italy, leaving only Pisa, Amalfi, and a flotilla of torpedo boats to cruise off the Ottoman coast.|$|E
5|$|The Merced River and {{its tributaries}} are a popular {{recreational}} area {{in part because of}} Yosemite National Park. There are many activities within the watershed, including boating, fishing, camping and hiking. Whitewater rafting is permitted throughout Merced River Canyon from the downstream half of Yosemite Valley <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> of Lake McClure. The most difficult rapids in this segment rate Class III and Class IV, mostly upstream of El Portal. There is also boating on Lake McClure. Camping throughout the upper Merced watershed is generally only permitted in designated campgrounds. Campgrounds along the Merced River {{and its tributaries}} include ones at Railroad Flat, McCabe Flat, Willow Placer, Merced Lake, Vogelsang Lake, Sunrise Creek, May Lake, Bridalveil Creek, and a ski hut at Ostrander Lake, the source of Bridalveil Creek.|$|E

5|$|The SJTA {{revealed}} {{plans for}} a major road improvement project that would link the Atlantic City International Airport directly to the Atlantic City Expressway, with construction beginning as early as 2013. The plan includes new ramps with two overpasses over the expressway. The road would connect Amelia Earhart Boulevard with an overpass above Airport Circle. Plans also call for building a service road with another overpass that would provide access to Delilah Road. Another project involves the installation of an overpass {{at the end of}} Amelia Earhart Boulevard next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> to the FAA tech center. The proposed roadway would intrude upon a small section of a mobile home park and land owned by Egg Harbor Township.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of the church's interior {{is covered with}} 14th-century frescoes, which are described as “particularly remarkable” in a UNESCO publication.

Other frescoes include that of Jesus Christ painted {{to the right of the}} apse and that of Saint Alexius next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance.</b> The middle reaches of the walls feature images from the Holy Week, with frescoes depicting events from other major holidays above them. The conch of the apse boasts an image of the Mother of God; portraits of various saints and scenes from the Ascension of Jesus and the Annunciation complete the decoration of the apse.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} features architecture {{intended to}} evoke {{a sense of}} calm. It was constructed with a central courtyard {{and a number of}} windows overlooking it, as well as nature-related artwork and architecture. There are also separate hallways for staff and visitors {{in order to make the}} interior appear less crowded. The hospital also features a substantial amount of parking and a shuttle service <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance.</b> Miami Valley Hospital South was constructed with future expansion in mind. Two of the five floors in the patient wing are empty and can be filled adding 24 beds each. A third hallway can be added to the wing which will add 60 beds, and the maternity ward can also be expanded with a second floor to add 12 beds, which means the facility could be expanded to 180 beds.|$|E
