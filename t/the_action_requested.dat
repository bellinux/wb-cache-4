40|$|People {{across the}} world make {{requests}} every day. We constantly rely on others to get by in the small and big practicalities of everyday life, be it getting the salt, moving a sofa, or cooking a meal. It has long been noticed that when we ask others for help we use {{a wide range of}} forms drawing on various resources afforded by our language and body. To get another to pass the salt, for example, we may say ‘Pass the salt’, or ask ‘Can you pass me the salt?’, or simply point to the salt. What do different forms of requesting give us? The short answer is that they allow us to manage different social relations. But what kind of relations? While prior research has mostly emphasised the role of long-term asymmetries like people’s social distance and relative power, this thesis puts at centre stage social relations and dimensions emerging in the moment-by-moment flow of everyday interaction. These include how easy or hard <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>requested</b> is to anticipate for the requestee, whether <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>requested</b> contributes to a joint project or serves an individual one, whether the requestee may be unwilling to do it, and how obvious or equivocal it is that a certain person or another should be involved in the action. The study focuses on requests made in everyday informal interactions among speakers of Italian. It involves over 500 instances of requests sampled from a diverse corpus of video recordings, and draws on methods from conversation analysis, linguistics and multimodal analysis. A qualitative analysis of the data is supported by quantitative measures of the distribution of linguistic and interactional features, and by the use of inferential statistics to test the generalizability of some of the patterns observed. The thesis aims to contribute to our understanding of both language and social interaction by showing that forms of requesting constitute a system, organised by a set of recurrent social-interactional concern...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} how email users' characteristics influence {{their response to}} phishing emails. A user generally goes through three stages of behaviour upon receiving a phishing email: suspicion of {{the legitimacy of the}} email, confirmation of its legitimacy and response by either performing <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>requested</b> in the phishing email or not. Using a mixed method approach combining experiments, surveys and semi-structured interviews, we found that a user's behaviour at each stage varies with their personal characteristics such as personality traits and ability to perceive information in an email beyond its content. We found, for example, that users who are submissive, extraverted or open tend to be less suspicious of phishing emails while users who can identify cues such as inconsistent IP address, can avoid falling victim to phishing emails. Our findings enable us to draw practical implications for educating and potentially reducing the incidence of phishing emails victimisation...|$|E

40|$|When making requests, {{speakers}} need {{to select}} a form {{from a range of}} concurrent alternatives available to them. In Italian conversation and everyday interaction imperatives and Mi X? interrogatives (of the kind “You pass me a pen?”) are commonly employed by speakers to request low-contingency activities that are relevant to a here-and-now purpose or need. Given this common domain of application of the two strategies, the aim of this work is to account for a specific functional distinction between them. A first distributional pattern is observed: while imperatives are overwhelmingly used within joint activities, Mi X? interrogatives are instead usually found where participants haven’t been interactionally involved in the recent past. On a closer inspection, however, the selection appears to be informed by a more locally determined logic. Imperative requests are normally licensed by a mutually accessible and traceable earlier turn or sequence. This prior interactional event entails some form of agreement or convergence by participants on a joint project <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>requested</b> is consistent with or necessary to. Conversely, a MiX? formatting assumes that what is requested be not part of a joint undertaking, but rather something in the requester’s self-interest alone that is unrelated to participants’ prior interaction...|$|E
40|$|Seeing {{an object}} {{activates}} both visual and action codes in the brain. Crucial evidence supporting {{this view is}} the observation of object to response compatibility e V ects: perception of an object can facilitate or interfere with the execution of an action (e. g., grasping) even when the viewer {{has no intention of}} interacting with the object. TRoPICALS is a computational model that proposes some general principles about the brain mechanisms underlying compatibility e V ects, in particular the idea that top-down bias from prefrontal cortex, and whether it con X icts or not with the actions a V orded by an object, {{plays a key role in}} such phenomena. Experiments on compatibility e V ects using a target and a distractor object show the usual posi- tive compatibility e V ect of the target, but also an interesting negative compatibility e V ect of the distractor: responding with a grip compatible with the distractor size produces slower reaction times than the incompatible case. Here, we present an enhanced version of TRoPICALS that repro- duces and explains these new results. This explanation is based on the idea that the prefrontal cortex plays a double role in its top-down guidance of action selection producing: (a) a positive bias in favour of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>requested</b> by the experimental task; (b) a negative bias directed to inhibiting the action evoked by the distractor.

40|$|Seeing {{an object}} {{activates}} {{in the brain}} both visual and action codes. Crucial evidence supporting this view is offered by compatibility effect experiments (Ellis et al. (2007). J Exp Psychol: Hum Percept Perform) : perception of an object can facilitate or interfere with the execution of an action (e. g. grasping) even when the viewer {{has no intention of}} interacting with the object. TRoPICALS (Caligiore et al. (2010). Psychol Rev) is a computational model developed to study compatibility effects. It provides a general hypothesis about the brain mechanisms underlying compatibility effects, suggesting that the top-down bias from prefrontal cortex (PFC), and its agreement or disagreement with the affordances of objects, {{plays a key role in}} such phenomena. Compatibility effects have been investigated in the presence of a distractor object in (Ellis et al. (2007). J Exp Psychol: Hum Percept Perform). The reaction times (RTs) results confirmed compatibility effects found in previous experiments without the distractor. Interestingly, results also showed an unexpected effect of the distractor: responding to a target with a grip compatible with the size of the distractor produced slower RTs in comparison to the incompatible case. Here we present an enhanced version of TRoPICALS that reproduces and explains these new results. This explanation is based on the idea according to which PFC might play a double role in its top-down guidance of action selection producing: (a) a positive bias in favor of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>requested</b> by the experimental task; (b) a negative bias directed to inhibiting the action evoked by the distractor.

40|$|Realizing {{that trade}} {{liberalization}} would require periodic adjustments because {{of problems in}} particular industries, GATT's framers provided that tariff reductions that led to such problems could be renegotiated; in an emergency a country could raise its tariff first and negotiate compensation with the principal exporting countries later. GATT lists many provisions that allow import restrictions, provisions that, over time, have proven quite fungible. Renegotiations were replaced by negotiated quantitative restraints (VERs), which were replaced by antidumping. The problem (troublesome imports) was always the same, but the instruments changed. And none of the instruments made much political or economic sense. They did not help a government isolate those import restrictions for which the benefits to the domestic economy would exceed the costs. And politically, the procedures through which renegotiations, VERs, or antidumping actions are decided provide a public tribune for interests that would benefit from protection but provide no voice for domestic interests thatwould bear the costs of restricted access to imports. The author offers guidelines for a safeguards process that makes more economic and political sense: A) Identify the costs and losers {{as well as the}} benefits and winners. B) Be clear that the action is an exception to the principles underlying the liberalization program. Emphasize that too many such exceptions would constitute abandonment of the liberalization program and its benefits. Included in the investigation process should be an expression of the costs the proposed restriction would impose. C) Don't sanctify the criteria for the action. Procedures should not presume, as antidumping does, that there is some good reason for granting exceptions. Providing a list of good reasons invites protection-seekers to demonstrate that they qualify and places the government in the position of having to demonstrate that they do not. Procedures should stress that the function of the review is to identify the benefits, costs, and domestic winners and losers from <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>requested.</b> Common Carriers Industry,Globalization and Financial Integration,Environmental Economics&Policies,Economic Theory&Research,Rules of Origin,Rules of Origin,TF 054105 -DONOR FUNDED OPERATION ADMINISTRATION FEE INCOME AND EXPENSE ACCOUNT,Globalization and Financial Integration,Economic Theory&Research,Environmental Economics&Policies...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} presents results {{concerning the}} large scale automatic extraction of pragmatic content from Email, {{by a system}} based on a phrase matching approach to Speech Act detection combined with the empirical detection of Speech Act patterns in corpora. The results show that most Speech Acts that occur in such a corpus can be recognized by the approach. This investigation {{is supported by the}} analysis of a corpus consisting of 1000 Emails. We describe experimental work to sort a substantial sample of Emails based on their function, which is to say, whether they contain a statement of fact, a request for the recipient to do something, or ask a question. This could be highly desirable functionality for the overburdened Email user, especially if combined with other, more traditional, measures of content relevance and filters based on desirable and undesirable mail sources. We have attempted to apply an lE engine to the extraction of message content located in the message, in part by the use of speech-act detection criteria, e. g. for {{what it is to be}} a request for action, under the many possible surface forms that can be used to express that in English, so as to locate <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>requested</b> as well as the fact it is a request. The work may have potential practical uses, but here we describe it as the challenge of adapting an IE engine to a somewhat different, task: that of message function detection. The major contributions are: Defining Request Speech Act types. The Request Speech Act is one of the most important functions of an utterance to be recognised, in order to find out the gist of a message. The present work has concentrated on three sub-types of Requests: Requests for Information, Action, and Permission. An algorithm to recognise Speech Acts Patterns found frequently in a domain, together with linguistic rules, make it possible to recognise most of the examples of Requests in the corpus. The results of the evaluation of the system are encouraging and suggest that, in order to avoid long-response time systems, a fast and friendly system is the right approach to implement...|$|E

40|$|A sensor, actuator, and device network (SADN) is {{composed}} of three types of nodes, which are sensor, actuator, and actuation device nodes. Sensor nodes and actuator nodes are interconnected in wireless networks as discussed in wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs). Actuator nodes and device nodes are interconnected in types of networks, i. e. wireless and wired network. Sensor nodes sense an physical event and send sensed values of the event to actuator nodes. An actuator node makes a decision on proper actions on receipt of sensed values and then issue <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>requests</b> to <b>the</b> device nodes. A device node really acts to the physical world. For example, moves a robot arms by performing <b>the</b> <b>action</b> on receipt of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>request.</b> Messages may be lost and nodes may be faulty. Especially, messages are lost due to noise and collision in a wireless network. We propose a fully redundant model for an SADN where each of sensor, actuator, and device functions is replicated in multiple nodes and each of sensor-actuator and actuator-device communication is realized in many-to-many type of communication protocols. Even if some number of nodes are faulty, the other nodes can perform requested tasks. Here, each sensor node sends sensed values to multiple actuator nodes and each actuator node receives sensed values from multiple sensor nodes. While multiple actuator nodes communicate with multiple replica nodes of a device. Even if messages are lost and some number of nodes are faulty, device nodes can surely receive <b>action</b> <b>requests</b> required for sensed values and <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> are performed. In this paper, we discuss a type of semi-passive coordination (SPC) protocol of multiple actuator nodes for multiple sensor nodes.

Existing approaches assume that an appropriately detailed and accurate metric map can be obtained through sensing the environment. Even landmark-based navigation approaches assume unrealistically (except if a GPS system is available) accurate distance and direction information between the robot and the landmarks (see Section 6). In this work we propose a fuzzy set based approach to landmark-based navigation in outdoor environments that assumes only very rough vision estimation of the distances [...] ...|$|R

In the latter case, the requester pays a cost and receives the reward but the provider learns the information. In our framework, learners are modeled as cooperative contextual bandits.
