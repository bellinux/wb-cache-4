25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1315, unusually heavy rain began in much of Europe. Throughout the spring and the summer, it {{continued}} to rain, and the temperature remained cool. Under such conditions, grain could not ripen, leading to widespread crop failures. Grain was brought indoors in urns and pots <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>dry.</b> The straw and hay for the animals could not be cured, {{so there was no}} fodder for the livestock. The price of food began to rise; prices in England doubled between spring and midsummer. Salt, the only way to cure and preserve meat, was difficult to obtain because brine could not be effectively evaporated in wet weather; its price increased from 30 shillings to 40 shillings. In Lorraine, wheat prices grew by 320% making bread unaffordable to peasants. Stores of grain for long-term emergencies were limited to royalty, lords, nobles, wealthy merchants and the Church. Because of the general increased population pressures, even lower-than-average harvests meant some people would go hungry; there was little margin for failure. People began to harvest wild edible roots, plants, grasses, nuts and bark in the forests.|$|E
25|$|As it was {{the first}} game on a new console, the {{development}} team was largely made up of people new to the series, including designers Akira Ohtani and Yuki Sakamoto. The capacity of the Wii U meant that more experimentation with graphics could be done. During the making of the game, the team watched a lot of scary online videos, along with studying lighting and the appearance of being wet. Alongside making a game for dedicated series players, they also added adjustments for new players, partly due to the multimedia developments that were underway. Among these changes were adding helpful gameplay features and creating more conversation cutscenes to make the story easier to understand. The pace of gameplay was also made similar to an action game as opposed to previous entries. In addition, the flashback cutscenes were made to look grainy and low-quality compared to the present-day cutscenes. While they had initially been visually similar to rest of the game, part of the series' appeal was the fear evoked by unseen objects, so they added distortions. The shift onto more powerful hardware also enabled the team to incorporate more graphic scenes, which contributed to it receiving a higher CERO rating than previous titles. A mechanic being tested in the game was the necessity <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>dry,</b> initially inspired by the sweating mechanic from Dead or Alive 5. While this was toned down, dampness being tied to the character's well being remained in the game as both a story and gameplay concept. This aspect was suggested by Ohtani.|$|E

60|$|Soon it {{was raining}} so hard that but little could be seen beyond the {{entrance}} to the cave. The wind moaned and shrieked throughout the cavern, which happened to have several entrances. Once it became so strong that it almost lifted the boys from their feet. The rain drove in at times, and they had to get into a split in the rocks <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>dry.</b>|$|E
60|$|A dense white fog {{rose from}} the river, {{obscuring}} all objects, when the bordermen rolled out of their snug bed of leaves. The air was cool and bracing, faintly fragrant with dying foliage and the damp, dewy luxuriance of the ripened season.

But outside the door he paused, and called the sentry to him again.|$|E

"You are at {{the foot}} of Glenn's," [...] {{returned}} the other, speaking aloud, without fear of consequences, within the roar of the cataract; [...] "and the next thing is to make a steady landing, lest the canoe upset, and you should go down again the hard road we have travelled, faster than you came up; 'tis a hard rift to stem, when the river is a little swelled; and five is an unnatural number <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>dry,</b> in the hurry-skurry, with a little birchen bark and gum.

60|$|She waded {{down the}} road toward an old wood-lot. At first she tried <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>dry,</b> but she gave it up, and there was {{pleasure}} in being defiantly dirty. She tramped straight through puddles; she wallowed in mud. In the wood-lot was long grass which soaked her stockings till her ankles felt itchy. Claire had never expected to be so very intimate with a brush-pile. She became so. As though she were a pioneer {{woman who had been}} toiling here for years, she came to know the brush stick by stick--the long valuable branch that she could never quite get out from under the others; the thorny bough that pricked her hands every time she tried to reach the curious bundle of switches.|$|E

60|$|But {{when the}} Dipsey was again upon {{the surface of}} the ocean, when the light of day was shining {{unobstructed}} upon the bold form of Captain Hubbell as he strode upon the upper deck--being careful not to stand still lest his shoes should freeze fast to the planks beneath him--the party on board were not so-well satisfied as they expected to be. There was a great wind blowing, and the waves were rolling high. Not far away, on their starboard bow, a small iceberg, tossing like a disabled ship, was surging towards them, impelled by a biting blast from the east, and the sea was so high that sometimes the spray swept over the deck of the vessel, making it impossible for Captain Hubbell and the others with him <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>dry.</b>|$|E
60|$|Our tearless condition--our ability <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>dry</b> {{when it was}} raining, so to say--resulted from quite {{different}} causes. Mine just then were {{the eyes of a}} naturalist curiously observing the demeanour of the beings around me. To Mab the whole spectacle was an act, an interlude, or scene in that wonderful endless play which was a perpetual delight to witness and in which she too was taking a part. And to see all her friends, her grown-up playmates, enjoying themselves in this unusual way, marching in a procession to the church, dressed in black, singing hymns with tears in their eyes--why, this was even better than school or Sunday service, romps in the playground or a children's tea. Every time I looked down at my little mate she lifted a rosy face to mine with her sweetest smile and bugloss eyes aglow with ineffable happiness. And now that we are far apart my loveliest memory of her is as she appeared then. I would not spoil that lovely image by going back to look at her again. Three years! It was said of Lewis Carroll that he ceased to care anything about his little Alices when they had come to the age of ten. Seven is my limit: they are perfect then: but in Mab's case the peculiar exquisite charm could hardly have lasted beyond the age of six.|$|E
60|$|Tom and Peter, {{now that}} the army was stationary, had an easier time of it, and {{obtained}} leave to cross the river to see the operations. The troops had again to wade through the bitter cold water, and {{at any other time}} would have grumbled rarely at the discomfort. When they really engage in the work of war, however, the British soldier cares for nothing, and holding up their rifles, pouches and haversacks, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>dry,</b> the men crossed the river laughing and joking. There was but little done all day, for the fire of the enemy was too fast and deadly for men to work under it in daylight. At night the Scudamores left their horses with those of the divisional officers, and accompanied the troops into the trenches, to learn the work which had there to be done. Directly it was dusk twelve hundred men fell to work to construct their batteries. The night was dark, and it was strange to the Scudamores to hear the thud of so many picks and shovels going, to hear now and then a low spoken order, but to see nothing save when the flash of the enemy's guns momentarily lit up the scene. Every half minute or so the shot, shell, and grape came tearing through the air, followed occasionally by a low cry or a deep moan. Exciting as it was for a time, the boys having no duty, found it difficult long to keep awake, and presently dozed off--at first to wake with a start whenever a shell fell close, but presently to sleep soundly until dawn. By that time the batteries, eighteen feet thick, were completed.|$|E
