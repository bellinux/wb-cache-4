40|$|In the {{economic}} analysis of fiscal policies the elasticity of business capital {{with respect to}} changes in its user cost is of central interest. As a major component, the user cost of capital includes a firm’s marginal tax rate, which for some firms can deviate strongly from the statutory tax rate due to the asymmetric treatment of <b>tax</b> <b>losses</b> and profits. In previous studies <b>tax</b> <b>losses</b> and <b>loss</b> <b>carry-over</b> have either been roughly approximated by accounting losses or, most of the time, fully been ignored. Disregarding taxable status of a firm, however, does not only result in a loss in efficiency but also leads to persistent measurement error in the firm-specific marginal tax rate and user cost of capital. This invalidates its lagged values as instrumental variables, {{as they have been}} used in previous research, and does not solve attenuation bias. We use a novel firm-level panel data set including official corporate income tax returns to overcome these problems. Our results show that accounting for <b>tax</b> <b>losses</b> yields a more precise point estimate for the user cost elasticity of investment, increasing in absolute value from- 0. 37 to- 0. 52...|$|R
40|$|We study {{whether the}} {{corporate}} tax system provides incentives for risky firm investment. We first model {{the effects of}} corporate tax rates and <b>tax</b> <b>loss</b> offset rules on firm risk-taking. Testing the theoretical predictions, we find that firm risk-taking is positively related {{to the length of}} <b>tax</b> <b>loss</b> periods. This result occurs because the loss rules shift a portion of investment risk to the government, inducing firms to increase their overall level of risk-taking. Moreover, the corporate tax rate has a positive effect on risk-taking for firms that can expect to use their <b>tax</b> <b>losses,</b> and a negative effect for those that cannot. Thus, the effect of taxes on risky investment decisions varies among firms, and its sign hinges on firm-specific expectations of future <b>tax</b> <b>loss</b> recovery. ...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{understood}} through previous literature that strategies, which buy past winning stocks and sell past losing stocks, can generate significant positive returns. This phenomenon {{is known as}} the momentum effect in the stock market. Furthermore, there is a common accounting practice used by portfolio managers called <b>tax</b> <b>loss</b> harvesting. <b>Tax</b> <b>loss</b> harvesting is the practice of selling a security {{in order to create a}} benefit for tax purposes. This paper attempts to build upon previous literature by explaining why the momentum effect is different at the beginning of the calendar year than in the middle and assessing whether or not <b>tax</b> <b>loss</b> harvesting may play a role. A trading strategy was created which calculates the returns of winning and losing portfolios intra industry groups, around different months of the year, in attempt to explain fluctuations in the momentum effect. Evidence in support of the hypothesis that <b>tax</b> <b>loss</b> harvesting played a role in impacting momentum strategies did not prove to be statistically significant...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} how <b>tax</b> <b>loss</b> offset restrictions affect an investor's evaluation of risky investments under bounded rationality. We analytically identify behavioral tax effects for {{different levels of}} <b>loss</b> offset restrictions, <b>tax</b> rate and prospect theoretical biases (loss aversion, probability weighting and reference dependence) and find <b>tax</b> <b>loss</b> offset restrictions significantly bias investor perception, even more heavily than the <b>tax</b> rate. If <b>loss</b> offset restrictions are rather generous, investors are very loss averse or assign a huge weight to loss probabilities, taxation {{is likely to increase}} the preference value of risky investments (behavioral tax paradox). Surprisingly, the identified significant perception biases of <b>tax</b> <b>loss</b> offset restrictions occur under both high and low tax rates and thus are relatively insensitive to tax rate changes. Finally, we identify huge differences in behavioral tax effects across countries indicating that <b>tax</b> <b>loss</b> offset restrictions crucially determine the perceived tax quality of a country for risky investments.
