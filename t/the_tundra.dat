5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tundra</b> is a sub-Arctic zone with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Precipitation is low. Soil a meter {{below ground}} and deeper is {{permanently}} frozen (permafrost), {{which does not}} allow water to drain easily through the soil, so it collects in shallow pools. Trees and shrubs are stunted since their roots cannot grow into the permafrost. Low shrubs, lichens, mosses, and small herbaceous plants are found instead. The most common mammals on <b>the</b> <b>tundra</b> are the barren-ground caribou, Arctic wolf, Arctic fox, Arctic hare, lemmings, and voles. Occasional sightings of muskoxen have been made near Cape Chidley, Labrador's most northerly point. The polar bear is the dominant carnivore of <b>the</b> <b>tundra,</b> but is an occasional visitor to coastal Newfoundland, especially in the spring. Many birds migrate to Labrador in spring to lay their eggs and raise their young before returning south for the winter, including the common eider, harlequin duck, Common redpoll and American pipit. The Labrador tundra is also permanent home to ptarmigan.|$|E
5|$|Since rain only falls as liquid, in frozen temperatures, rain cannot fall. As a result, {{very cold}} climates see very little {{rainfall}} {{and are often}} known as polar deserts. A common biome {{in this area is}} <b>the</b> <b>tundra</b> which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter. Ice caps see no rain at all, making Antarctica the world's driest continent.|$|E

5|$|In {{continental}} Europe, C. graminis {{is widespread}} from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Sea. It {{may also be}} found in central Asia and China. In Russia it may be found in <b>the</b> <b>tundra</b> zone from the Polar Urals to the Kolyma River, and in the nearby countries of Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. It is listed as vulnerable in Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and in Germany it is rare in one district, endangered in another.|$|E
5|$|The {{peninsula}} {{is covered}} by taiga {{in the south and}} tundra in the north. In <b>the</b> <b>tundra,</b> cold and windy conditions and permafrost limit the growth of the trees, resulting in a landscape dominated by grasses, wildflowers, and shrubs such as dwarf birch and cloudberry. In northern coastal areas, stony and shrub lichens are common. The taiga in the southern areas is composed mostly of pine trees and firs.|$|E

5|$|Mining in Mine 1b was {{terminated}} in 1958, but operation in Mine 5 started the following year. Preliminary work on Mine 4 started in 1954, and from 1960 {{it was used}} as a reserve mine. The Norwegian Air Force started serving Longyearbyen with postal flights in the 1950s. In 1959, a man fell seriously ill, so a landing strip was prepared in Adventdalen. From the same year, Braathens SAFE started serving <b>the</b> <b>tundra</b> airport with irregular winter flights. In 1957, a principal was hired at the primary school and a new church was opened on 24 August 1958. From 1961, the primary school was supplemented by a private middle school. A branch of Tromsø Sparebank opened in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} taiga. It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than <b>the</b> <b>tundra.</b> Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The taiga is dominated by coniferous trees, notably balsam fir and black spruce, though the deciduous white birch, trembling aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, pine marten, short-tailed weasel, and American mink. Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. Willow ptarmigan, common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A set of 196 14 C dates {{was used}} to {{reconstruct}} Late Holocene aeolian activity in the Hudson Bay area along a south-north transect crossing the northern boreal forest, <b>the</b> forest <b>tundra</b> and <b>the</b> shrub <b>tundra</b> zones. <b>The</b> record indicates a minor period of aeolian activity between 4650 and 4050 BP, and three major periods at 3650 - 2750 BP and after 700 BP. In the northern boreal forest, there was little temporal variation in dune activity, except around 1300 - 950 BP where a major peak of activity is recorded. In <b>the</b> forest <b>tundra,</b> two major peaks of activity are recorded between 1650 - 950 BP and after 700 BP. Only minor activity occurred in <b>the</b> shrub <b>tundra</b> during <b>the</b> last 4000 14 C-yr and some aeolian events {{appear to have been}} slightly out-of-phase compared to the two other zones. Most dates were obtained from non-charred material in <b>the</b> shrub <b>tundra</b> where, unlike in the Subarctic, the aeolian activity responded to a triggering process unconnected with fire. The dune record is compared with that of gelifluction activity in snowpatch environments and with a detailed fire chronology derived from radiocarbon-dated conifer charcoal sampled in present-day treeless sites of <b>the</b> forest <b>tundra.</b> Post-fire gelifluction reached a maximum around 1500 - 1100 BP and 750 BP. Fire activity was also at a maximum after 2000 BP in <b>the</b> forest <b>tundra.</b> <b>The</b> similarity of the chronologies suggests that fires occurring during cold periods of the late Holocene were catastrophic, having a significant impact on soil erosion and deforestation...|$|R
5|$|Before {{the last}} ice age the eastern {{coastline}} of the area was located along the eastern foot of the Yorkshire Wolds where remnants of beaches have been discovered. The North Sea ice sheet deposited huge amounts of boulder clay as it retreated and this subsequently formed a wet and swampy area which became the plain of Holderness. Another ice sheet in the Vale of York retreated at the same time leaving thick glacial deposits and two prominent moraines {{to the west of the}} Wolds. These Vale of York deposits also formed wetlands. The Wolds themselves were largely ice-free, well drained, chalk uplands. Gradually <b>the</b> <b>tundra</b> conditions that had existed as the ice retreated gave way to vegetation that could support grazing fauna. Because a lot of water was still locked in the northern ice sheets, sea level was much lower than in the present day and an area of land stretched eastwards to the low countries.|$|E
5|$|In {{planning}} the dam project, engineers anticipated that building the dam would flood nine Alaska Native villages, forcing {{the relocation of}} an estimated 1,500 people. Although some of the affected villagers felt the increased job opportunities would outweigh the forced move, most objected to the potential loss of the region's history. Among the affected villages was Fort Yukon, which is the oldest English-speaking settlement in Alaska. In 1964, several groups of Native dam opponents in the Yukon Flats came together to form an organization called Gwitchya Gwitchin Ginkhye, which lobbied against the project. <b>The</b> <b>Tundra</b> Times, an Alaska newspaper devoted to Native issues, also came out strongly {{in opposition to the}} project, saying that all but one village from the head of the proposed reservoir to the mouth of the Yukon River were against the dam. Don Young, Alaska's representative to the U.S. House of Representatives, was elected to the Alaska Legislature in 1964 from Fort Yukon on a platform of opposition to Rampart Dam.|$|E
5|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (Larus marinus), the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and fly down {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on <b>the</b> <b>tundra</b> in the far north, the Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up.|$|E

5|$|Elements of the 7th Infantry Division {{first saw}} combat in the amphibious assault on Attu Island, the western-most Japanese entrenchment in the Aleutian islands chain. Elements landed on 11 May 1943, spearheaded by the 17th Infantry Regiment. The initial {{landings}} were unopposed, but Japanese forces mounted a counteroffensive the next day, and the 7th Infantry Division fought an intense battle over <b>the</b> <b>tundra</b> against strong Japanese resistance. The division was hampered by its inexperience and poor weather and terrain conditions, but was eventually able to coordinate an effective attack. The {{fight for the}} island culminated in a battle at Chichagof Harbor, when the division destroyed all Japanese resistance on the island on 29 May, after a suicidal Japanese bayonet charge. During its first fight of the war, 600 soldiers of the division were killed, while killing 2,351 Japanese and taking 28 prisoners. After American forces secured the island chain, the 159th Infantry Regiment was ordered {{to stay on the}} island, and the 184th Infantry Regiment took its place as the 7th Division's third infantry regiment. The 184th Infantry remained with the division {{until the end of the}} war. The 159th Infantry Regiment stayed on the island for some time longer until returning to the United States, where it remained until the end of the war.|$|E

25|$|Sakha can {{be divided}} into three great {{vegetation}} belts. About 40% of Sakha lies above the Arctic circle and all of it is covered by permafrost which greatly influences the region's ecology and limits forests in the southern region.
