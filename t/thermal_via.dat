In modern IC design, leakage power is becoming a key design challenge which contributes to thermal issues. Due to technology scaling, the leakage power is rising so quickly that it largely increases the die temperature. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of leakage power on thermal profile in 3 D packings, and then we analyze thermal and leakage aware jloorplanning based on 3 D-STAF[l 7 } platform. Finally, the effects of thermal controls including the thermal-aware jloorplanner and <b>thermal</b> <b>via</b> insertion for thermal management are analyzed in experiment results. The results show that leakage power increases the maximal temperature on the chip greatly about 50 %. Hence, the required <b>thermal</b> <b>via</b> number also increases greatly about 52. 6 %.

40|$|In this study, heat {{removal and}} thermal {{management}} solutions for electronic devices were investigated at board-level. The generated heat at an electronic chip, installed on {{a printed circuit}} board (PCB), can be dissipated either through a heat sink, that is attached directly to the chip, or can be transferred through the PCB to the other side and then be dissipated to the ambient. In any case, thermal interface materials (TIMs) should be used to reduce the thermal contact resistance (TCR) at the solid-solid interface, and also to electrically insulate the live electrical component from the heat sink which is normally exposed to the ambient. Graphite, due to its low cost, lightweight, low thermal expansion coefficient, high temperature tolerance, and high corrosion resistance properties is shown to be a promising candidate {{to be used as a}} TIM. In this study, a new analytical model was developed to predict the thermal conductivity of graphite-based TIMs as a function of pressure applied during the production, and flake mechanical properties. The model was verified with the experimental results obtained from testing multiple graphite-based TIM samples. Transferring the heat to the back of the PCB could potentially provide more surface area for the heat transfer, as normally the backside of PCBs is less populated compared to the front side. However, this comes with its own challenges, due to the low thermal conductivity of the FR 4, the main material used in the PCB composition. <b>Thermal</b> <b>vias,</b> which are copper-plated through holes, are proposed as a solution, since they can provide a thermal bridge for heat.
