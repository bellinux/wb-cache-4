25|$|In most {{developed}} countries, {{the single}} most important form of disability insurance is that provided by the national government for all citizens. For example, the UK's version is part of National Insurance; the U.S.'s version is Social Security (SS)â€”specifically, several parts of SS including Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). These programs provide a floor beneath all other disability insurance. In other words, they are <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> that catches everyone who was otherwise (a) uninsured or (b) underinsured. As such, they are large programs with many beneficiaries. The general theory of the benefit formula is that the benefit is enough to prevent abject poverty.|$|E

500|$|Flower was Thatgamecompany's [...] "first game outside <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> of academia", {{according}} to Santiago. Six to nine people were involved {{at different stages}} of development. Chen returned to work full-time at the company prior to the game's development, and served as the creative director. The game's music was composed by Vincent Diamante, who had worked with Chen and Santiago on Cloud. The game was developed for two years, but the team spent three-fourths of that time in the prototyping stage. After they decided on the game's elements, Flower was produced in only six months. Like Flow, the game was well received when it was released in February 2009, selling in the top ten PlayStation Network titles of the year and garnering several awards. After the release of Flower, Thatgamecompany moved into their own building in Los Angeles.|$|E

Flow was later developed into a PlayStation 3 game by Thatgamecompany in 2007 and a PlayStation Portable game by SuperVillain Studios in 2008. Flower was Thatgamecompany's [...] "first game outside <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> of academia". It was first announced at the Tokyo Game Show on September 24, 2007, and was released on the PlayStation Network on February 12, 2009. Flower was intended primarily to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as [...] "an emotional shelter". Six to nine people were involved at varying stages of development. Chen, who co-founded Thatgamecompany with game producer Kellee Santiago, was the creative director {{in charge of the}} game, while Clark was the lead designer. Chen described the game as [...] "an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature". He decided on the [...] "nature" [...] theme early in the development process, saying that he [...] "had this concept that every PlayStation is like a portal in your living room, it leads you to somewhere else.

500|$|The next game, Flower, was Chen and Thatgamecompany's [...] "first game outside <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> of academia".

The company ranged in size from six to nine people at varying stages of the game's development.

[...] Chen designed the game around the idea that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. To make Flower have the [...] "emotional spectrum" [...] that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a [...] "fun" [...] game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. In 2008, during Flowers development, Chen was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 {{as one of the top}} 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.|$|E
40|$|Does <b>the</b> social <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> improve welfare? Conventional wisdom {{says that}} means-tested social <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> {{programs}} improve welfare {{because they provide}} partial insurance against large negative shocks by guaranteeing a minimum consumption floor, but some economists have argued that they may also discourage labor supply and reduce capital accumulation (e. g. Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995), Moffitt (2002)). Furthermore, recent research sug-gests that the welfare gain from the insurance channel may be small since <b>the</b> social <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> significantly crowds out private insurance decisions (e. g. Brown and Finkelstein (2008)). In this paper, I quantitatively assess the tradeoff between these channels in a dynamic gen-eral equilibrium model with incomplete markets and endogenous health insurance decision. I find that <b>the</b> social <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> generates a significant welfare loss, suggesting that the insur-ance channel {{is dominated by the}} other channels. I then show that <b>the</b> social <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> has a large crowding out effect on private health insurance, and this crowding out is important for obtaining the welfare loss result.

40|$|Background: Adult {{oral health}} has been {{identified}} as a major public health problem by the United States Surgeon General. A substantial number of adults between the ages of 20 and 64 have untreated tooth decay. There are limited treatment options for adults without dental insurance. Low-income adults must turn to free/low cost clinics, or private dentists that accept Medicaid to receive dental care. However, these resources are often limited. When the resources are not available these adults are left to deal with untreated tooth decay which can lead to worsening conditions and other health issues. Methods: Eleven key-informant interviews were conducted with community leaders of Montgomery County interested in <b>the</b> dental <b>safety</b> <b>net.</b> Interviews were conducted either in person or on the phone. Respondents were asked about his or her opinion about <b>the</b> available <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> resources for <b>the</b> community. Results: The consensus among interviewees was that <b>the</b> dental <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> is important to the community as it allows those without dental insurance to receive care. Many respondents believe that Public Health - Dayton and Montgomery County should be stepping in to address this public health issue. Conclusion: <b>The</b> Montgomery County <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> is now operating at maximum capacity, and more funding is needed to increase resources. Though the problem will not be completely eradicated, <b>the</b> local <b>safety</b> <b>net</b> strives to help as many low-income adults as possible...|$|R
