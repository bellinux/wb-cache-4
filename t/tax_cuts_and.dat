5|$|During the Reagan years, Kemp and his {{followers}} ignored budget balancing while promoting <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>and</b> economic growth. These tax cuts have been credited by conservatives for the economic growth from 1983 to 1990, which by 1996 {{had become one of}} the longest expansions in American history. Kemp notes that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's success at stemming inflation and the favorable regulatory environment were also major factors. Detractors note that the expansion was fueled by undesirable sectors like gaming, prisons, medical treatment, and credit card use.|$|E
5|$|For {{his first}} term, Frank {{represented}} a {{district in the}} western and southern suburbs of Boston, anchored by Brookline and his hometown of Newton. However, in 1982, redistricting forced him to run against Republican Margaret Heckler, who represented a district centered on the South Coast, including Fall River and New Bedford. Although the newly configured district retained Frank’s district number—the 4th—it was geographically more Heckler's district. Frank focused on Heckler's initial support for President Ronald Reagan's <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> <b>and</b> won with 60% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|As the Parliament {{buildings}} {{had been}} lent to the Universal Postal Union for its 14th congress, Diefenbaker {{was forced to}} wait until the fall to convene Parliament. However, the Cabinet approved measures that summer, including increased price supports for butter and turkeys, and raises for federal employees. Once the 23rd Canadian Parliament was opened on October 14 by Queen Elizabeth II — the first to be opened by any Canadian monarch — the government rapidly passed legislation, including <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>and</b> increases in old age pensions.

25|$|House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt {{said the}} middle class will not benefit enough from the <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> the wealthy will reap unfairly high benefits. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle argued that the <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> is too large, too generous to the rich and too expensive.|$|R
50|$|Many early proponents {{argued that}} the size of the {{economic}} growth would be significant enough that the increased government revenue from a faster-growing economy would be sufficient to compensate completely for the short-term costs of a <b>tax</b> <b>cut,</b> <b>and</b> that <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> could, in fact, cause overall revenue to increase.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Kemp {{continued}} to be considered along with Reagan as the politician most responsible {{for the implementation of}} supply-side <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>and</b> along with Steve Forbes as the political figure most responsible for their continued place in the marketplace of political ideas. He {{has been described as a}} beacon of economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda. Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right on social issues, but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.|$|E
5|$|Millhouse, now the State Parliamentary Leader of the LM, {{announced}} the LM's {{policy for the}} 1975 state election at the Adelaide Town Hall on 2 July. He outlined the LM's plans for economic rejuvenation: an end to compulsory unionism, budget and <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> <b>and</b> measures to curb rising inflation and cost of living. Social policy included proposals for an early form of multiculturalism and promotion of 'cultural diversity' and bilingualism. Energy policy appealed {{to a new generation}} of environmentalists, and promoted conservation and promotion of solar power. He slammed the proposed City of Monarto as a 'monument to socialist folly'.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Roth, {{he has had}} numerous political allies. At times, he collaborated with Gingrich and Lott on deregulation and tax cuts, collaborated with McCain and Phil Gramm on <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>and</b> spending restraints, legislated with and campaigned for Joseph Lieberman, and fought poverty with James Pinkerton. Pete du Pont was a progressive conservative ally. After retiring from Congress and serving in the Cabinet, Kemp remained close to Gingrich, Lott, Weber, and Mack. Kemp {{was a member of}} the federal committee to promote Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a national holiday. As a progressive voter, he had civil rights leaders such as Benjamin Hooks, Andrew Young and Coretta Scott King and conservative black intellectuals like Glenn C. Loury and Robert L. Woodson as supporters and friends. He boasted of having Democratic friends such as William H. Gray III, Charles B. Rangel and Robert Garcia. Ken Blackwell was a Deputy Secretary under Kemp. During the Reagan presidency, when Kemp was able to effect tax cutting, a leading United States Senate tax-cutting proponent was Democrat Bill Bradley, a former basketball star. Several American football players have followed Kemp to Congress: Steve Largent, J. C. Watts, and Heath Shuler.|$|E

50|$|The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has {{estimated}} that extending the Bush <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> of 2001-2003 beyond their 2010 expiration would increase deficits by $1.8 trillion over the following decade.
