However, such extensions were still limited in that they were region specific and often could not be used in tandem. Special conversion routines had to be used to convert from one character set to another, often resulting in destructive translation when no equivalent character existed in the target set.|$|E
50|$|The VT420 {{consisted}} {{largely of}} a combination of the VT320 with the virtual <b>terminal</b> <b>support</b> of the VT330 and VT340. Those two models had included a system known as TD/SMP which allowed two sessions to be multiplexed over a single serial connection to a compatible terminal server. Alternately the two sessions could be supported by separate serial connections on those models with multiple MMJ ports. Using either method, the VT330/340/420 could either show the two sessions behind each other, using a key sequence to flip back and forth, or split the screen horizontally to display the sessions one above the other, or vertically side-by-side.|$|E
5000|$|A {{copy of the}} 4690 OS is {{maintained}} in each store controller. The 4690 POS terminals (registers) load a copy of 4690 from the store controller into memory when they Initial Program Load (IPL). The 4690 controllers provide <b>terminal</b> <b>support</b> {{in the form of}} terminal loading, price lookup, and transaction logging. Non-volatile memory is utilized to ensure that data is not lost in transit from the terminals to the store controller. Terminals are assigned to a primary store controller, and that controller is typically backed up by another controller. If the primary controller fails, the terminals automatically access the backup controller, providing uninterrupted sales at the POS terminal. If both the primary and backup controllers are unavailable, the terminal can go into a standalone state, or, some of the applications are capable of supporting a [...] "Terminal Offline" [...] (TOF) state wherein terminals run offline using a terminal-based item file and logging stored within their own memory.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} {{of training and}} actual procedures and requirements for OEC meet and exceed those of the first responders-Basic course and the curriculum contains many all of the skills identified in the US Department of Transportation (DOT) 1994 EMT-Basic National Standard Curriculumhttp://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/outreach/traftech/1995/TT105.htm, although training is specific to needs in outdoor scenarios, such as self-reliance and individual skills. This instead of the EMT curriculum focusing on urban environments with immediate access to additional resources such as EMT partners and an ambulance. While the OEC curriculum includes a skill set and fund of knowledge that exceeds those of the Emergency Medical Responder (EMR) program, {{it does not include}} all the knowledge needed for an EMT program since it emphasizes caring for patients in the wilderness, with a focus on snow-sports pathology. Because of this, OEC technicians typically have a similar standards of training compared to EMT-Basic responders, albeit several different focuses of the training: with OEC devoting a larger portion of the curriculum to musculoskeletal injuries, splinting, bandaging, and environmental emergencies and devoting comparatively less time on patients with a medical based issue. OEC technicians are first responders, not definitive medical care, and have the knowledge to care for, transport, and treat patients, but not to diagnose them or provide <b>terminal</b> <b>support</b> or invasive therapies.|$|E
5000|$|Historical note: The 3270 {{approach}} {{differed from}} lower-cost dumb terminals of the period, which were point-to-point and asynchronous. Commercial time-sharing users, an important segment of early CP/CMS and VM sites, relied on such devices {{because they could}} connect via 300- or 1200 bit/s modems over normal voice-grade telephone circuits. Installing a dedicated circuit for a 3270 was often not practical, economical, or timely.The 3270's block-oriented approach was more consistent with IBM's batch- and punched card-oriented view of computing, and was particularly important for IBM mainframes of the day. Unlike contemporary minicomputers, most IBM mainframes were not equipped for character-at-a-time interrupts. Dumb <b>terminal</b> <b>support</b> relied on terminal control units such as the IBM 270x (see IBM 3705) or Memorex 1270. These asynchronous terminal controllers assembled a line of characters, up to a fixed maximum length, until the RETURN key was pressed. Typing too many characters would result in an error, a familiar situation to users of the day. (Most data centers did not include this equipment, except as needed for dial-up access. The 3270 approach was preferred.)Block-oriented terminals like the 3270 made it practical to implement screen-oriented editors on mainframes [...] - [...] as opposed to line-oriented editors, the previous norm. This had been an important advantage of contemporary minicomputers and other character-oriented systems, and its availability via the 3270 was warmly welcomed.A gulf developed between the 3270 world, focused on page-oriented mainframe transaction processing (especially via CICS), and the asynch terminal world, focused on character-oriented minicomputers and dial-up timesharing. Asynchronous terminal vendors gradually improved their products {{with a range of}} smart terminal features, usually accessed via escape sequences. However, these devices rarely competed for 3270 users; IBM maintained its dominance over mainframe data center hardware purchase decisions.Viewed in retrospect, there was a major philosophical divergence between block-oriented and character-oriented computing. Asynchronous terminal controllers and 3270s both provided the mainframe with block-oriented interactions [...] - [...] essentially, they made the terminal input look like a card reader. This approach, preferred by IBM, {{led to the development of}} entirely different user interface paradigms and programming strategies. Character-oriented systems evolved differently. The difference is apparent when comparing the atomic transaction approach of dominant CICS with the interactive, stream-oriented style of UNIX. VM/CMS evolved somewhere between these extremes. CMS has a command-driven, stateful, interactive environment, rather than adopting the CICS approach of a stateless transaction-oriented interface. Yet CMS responds to page- or line-at-a-time interaction, instead of character interrupts.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{function}} of torques exerted by the joints of the lower trunk during maximal velocity sprinting. Eight male track and field athletes volunteered, and sprinted 60 m from a standing start position. The ground reaction force of the support leg was determined using a force platform (1000 Hz), which was placed at the 50 -m mark from the start position. Simultaneously, 3 D coordinates were recorded with a motion analysis system (250 Hz) using 20 cameras (MX-T 20). The joint torques were calculated using inverse dynamics. The contribution of joint torques to the right and left hip joint forces, and the torso joint force, was calculated by a method that simultaneously solves equations of motion for each segment and equations of constraint conditions for adjacent segments connected by a joint. The main results were as follows: (1) During the <b>terminal</b> <b>support</b> phase (80 - 100 % normalized time), the angular velocity of anterior rotation of the pelvis decreased and participants in whom this angular velocity decrease was diminished ran faster (p< 0. 10). (2) During <b>terminal</b> <b>support,</b> the hip joint adduction torque of the support leg and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint rotated the pelvis forward. The moment of the right and left hip joint forces rotated the pelvis backward. (3) During <b>terminal</b> <b>support,</b> the hip joint force of the support leg was generated by its hip joint flexion and adduction torque, the hip joint extension torque of the recovery leg, and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint. In contrast, the hip joint force of the recovery leg was generated by the hip joint flexion and adduction torque of the support leg, and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint. (4) During <b>terminal</b> <b>support,</b> the hip joint flexion torque exerted by the support leg rotated the pelvis backward. The hip joint adduction torque of the support leg and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint rotated the pelvis forward. Previous studies showed that the hip flexion torque drives the leg forward from the hip joint extension position. This present study has clarified that the hip joint adduction torque of the support leg and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint nullify backward rotation of the pelvis due to the hip joint flexion torque exerted by the support leg...|$|E
