The missile changes course and explodes over Panau's oilfields, killing Panay and destroying the island's oil reserves. Rico rejoins Sheldon, Kane and Jade, who are dismayed {{at the loss of}} billions of dollars' worth of oil. Rico explains that oil is not worth dying for; with its oil gone, interest in Panau will be lost, the superpowers will not war and the island's residents will be spared. Sheldon agrees, assuring Rico <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>president</b> friendly to the U.S. will be installed on Panau and the island will be closely monitored; the group raise their glasses, toasting friendship and a job well done.|$|E

His term was to expire on May 16, 2007, but because the Grand National Assembly of Turkey failed to elect <b>a</b> new <b>president,</b> he retained the office pro tempore until August 28, 2007 (the Constitution of Turkey states <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>president's</b> term of office is extended until a successor is elected).|$|R
25|$|To {{allow the}} {{government}} to act quickly {{in case of a}} major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the President is permitted to call extraordinary sessions of one or both Houses of Congress. If the two Houses cannot agree on a date for adjournment, the President may adjourn both Houses to such a time as befits the circumstances. The last time this power was exercised was in 1948, when President Harry S Truman called a special session of Congress. That was the twenty-seventh time in American history <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>president</b> convened such a session.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the Venezuelan government's {{economic}} strength and political legitimacy was declining, with two coup attempts in 1992 and the impeachment for corruption of President Carlos Andrés Pérez. The {{result was a}} turn against the traditional Punto Fijo parties (Democratic Action and COPEI) in the 1993 elections: Rafael Caldera's victory in 1993 {{was the first time}} in Venezuela's democratic history <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>President</b> had been elected without the support of either of the two major parties. It was symptomatic that Caldera's election platform included pardoning those who had participated in the coup attempts, and he did so in 1994. Hugo Chávez, imprisoned for his role in the February 1992 coup attempt, was among those released.|$|E
25|$|Governments and the Cortes {{sit for a}} term {{no longer}} than four years when the {{president}} tenders his resignation to the king and advises the king to dissolve the Cortes, prompting a General Election. It remains within the king's prerogative to dissolve the Cortes if, {{at the conclusion of}} the four years, the president has not asked for its dissolution, according to Title II Article 56. The president may call for earlier elections, but no sooner than a year after the prior General Election. Additionally, if the Government loses the confidence of the Cortes, then it must resign. In the event <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>president</b> dies or becomes incapacitated while in office, then the government as a whole resigns and the process of royal nomination and appointment takes place. The vice president would take over the day-to-day operations in the meantime, even while vice president himself may be nominated by the king.|$|E

25|$|On September 6, President McKinley was {{attending}} the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York {{when he was}} shot by Leon Czolgosz. Roosevelt was vacationing in Vermont, and traveled to Buffalo to visit McKinley in the hospital. It appeared that McKinley would recover, so Roosevelt resumed his vacation in the Adirondacks. When McKinley's condition worsened, Roosevelt began the trip to Buffalo. McKinley died on September 14, and Roosevelt was informed while he was in North Creek; he continued on to Buffalo and was sworn in at the Ansley Wilcox House. As there was no formally designated order of succession for the post in the event <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>president</b> resigned, became incapacitated, or died (the Twenty-fifth Amendment would not be drafted and ratified until the 1960s), Roosevelt served his first term without a vice president. McKinley's supporters were nervous about the new president, and Hanna was particularly bitter that the man he had opposed so vigorously at the convention had succeeded McKinley. Roosevelt assured party leaders that he intended to adhere to McKinley's policies, and he retained McKinley's Cabinet. Nonetheless, Roosevelt sought to position himself as the party's undisputed leader, seeking to bolster the role of the president and position himself for the 1904 election.|$|E

5000|$|Though <b>an</b> {{outgoing}} <b>President</b> of Ireland who {{has been}} re-elected is usually described in the media as [...] "president" [...] before the taking of the Declaration of Office, that is actually incorrect. The Irish Constitution makes it clear <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>president's</b> term of office expires {{on the day before}} the inauguration of their successor. In the interregnum period, the Presidential Commission acts as president, though given that it is usually for less than 11 hours no Presidential Commission has ever been called on to do anything in that period. Technically for that period the outgoing <b>president</b> is <b>a</b> former <b>president</b> and, if re-elected, President-elect.|$|R
50|$|According to one analysis, {{the delayed}} arrival {{of members of}} Congress created a break in {{succession}} of Truman's terms as President. The 20th Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1933, states <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>President's</b> term ends at noon on January 20 after the election. Members of Congress arrived 10 minutes late and took another 10 minutes to take their seats. Vice President Alben W.

500|$|Garfield had not {{actually}} written a speech, and {{was nervous about}} speaking in front of such a large crowd.

[...] Garfield started his speech by emphasizing his overwhelming pride {{for his role in}} the convention. Garfield then listed the qualities <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>president</b> should possess and stressed the importance of party unity. [...] It wasn't until near his conclusion that he mentioned Sherman by name. Many reports of Garfield's speech describe it as enthusiastic, eloquent, and well received. Some accounts indicate that it was so well-received that it caused delegates to begin thinking of Garfield as a contender for the presidential nomination.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} had far-reaching {{effects in}} literary and scientific circles, and marked {{the only time}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>President</b> of the United States weighed in as a [...] "literary and cultural critic—specifically, as an ecocritic." [...] Though blind naturalist and author Clarence Hawkes deemed the literary debate [...] "a veritable tempest in the teapot", after the controversy had died down, he came to believe [...] "if I ever make a bad break in regard to my natural history statements that I was doomed." [...] The author Ralph H. Lutts wrote in his 1990 work The Nature Fakers: Wildlife, Science & Sentiment, the nature fakers controversy [...] "was {{far more than a}} clash over the accuracy of animal stories or the question of whether animals can reason"; rather, the debate signified the changing sensibilities of writers and readers {{at the turn of the}} 20th century.|$|E

[...] In November 1999, Hillary Clinton announced that she would set aside most of her official duties as First Lady in order to take up residency in New York and pursue her campaign. [...] Her move-in took place in January 2000, with the house furnished with many of the couple's possessions from their Arkansas days.

500|$|Smith's {{return to}} the U.S. on July 22, 1983, was celebrated {{by the people of}} Maine with roses, a red carpet, and a {{limousine}} and her popularity continued to grow in her native country. Some critics at the time remained skeptical, believing Smith was unwittingly serving as an instrument of Soviet propaganda. In December 1983, continuing in her role as [...] "America's Youngest Ambassador", she was invited to Japan, where she met with the Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and attended the Children's International Symposium in Kobe. In her speech at the symposium, she suggested that Soviet and American leaders exchange granddaughters for two weeks every year, arguing <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>president</b> [...] "wouldn't want to send a bomb to a country his granddaughter would be visiting". Her trip inspired other exchanges of child goodwill ambassadors, including a visit by the eleven-year-old Soviet child Katya Lycheva to the United States. Later, Smith wrote a book called Journey to the Soviet Union whose cover shows her at Artek, her favorite part of the Soviet trip.|$|E

A compromise brokered in the Senate resulted in the current hybrid group of eight, half appointed by the president and half by the Congress, with six-year terms that do not expire with the inauguration of a new president. [...] Since that time the commission has struggled to remain independent, and its agenda has oscillated between liberal and conservative aims as factions among its members have ebbed and waned.|$|E

The special prosecutor dissuaded them from an indictment of Nixon, arguing <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>President</b> can only be indicted after he leaves office. John Dean, Jeb Stuart Magruder, and other figures had already pleaded guilty. On April 5, 1974, Dwight Chapin, the former Nixon appointments secretary, was convicted of lying to the grand jury.

[...] Obama supports expanding the protections afforded by hate crimes statutes to cover crimes committed against individuals because of sexual orientation or gender identity. Obama also called for full equality for gays during his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013: [...] "Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law — for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well."
