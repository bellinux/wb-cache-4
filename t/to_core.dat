Its {{core curriculum}} is {{a sequence of}} sixteen required courses in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and interdisciplinary studies. Basic-studies courses are generally taken {{during the first two}} years, advanced-studies during the final two years and integrative-studies courses in the final year. In addition <b>to</b> <b>core</b> courses students take electives, which offer basic instruction or in-depth work in particular subjects. Students may also take tutorials, with one or two students per course, tailored to their interests and similar in structure to the Oxford tutorial system.|$|E

5|$|The Lowe Library is the college's library. It {{was formed}} from a bequest from Colonel W.D.Lowe, {{an officer of}} the Durham University Officers' Training Corps. He later became a Classics tutor at the {{university}} and rowing coach for University College, staying until his death in 1921. The library was opened in 1925, extended into the college's wine cellar in 1997, and now contains over 10,000 books. It acts as a support to the central university library, providing access <b>to</b> <b>core</b> textbooks.|$|E

5|$|Czechoslovak {{education}} in the Czech and German language ceased to exist. About 35,000 Czechoslovaks emigrated <b>to</b> <b>core</b> Czechoslovakia (the later Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia) by choice or forcibly. The behaviour of the new Polish authorities was different but similar in nature {{to that of the}} Czechoslovak ones before 1938. Two political factions appeared: socialists (the opposition) and rightists (loyal to the new Polish national authorities). Leftist politicians and sympathizers were discriminated against and often fired from work. The Polish political system was artificially implemented in Zaolzie. The local Poles continued to feel like second-class citizens and a majority of them were dissatisfied with the situation after October 1938. Zaolzie remained a part of Poland for only 11 months until the invasion of Poland started on 1 September 1939.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the bombs}} failed to explode as planned, because the battery had expired due to {{long periods of}} storage. Determined the {{operation}} would remain a secret, the commandos snuck back <b>to</b> <b>Core</b> and retrieved the explosive devices. Not long afterwards, Core and its crew sailed out of Saigon, intact without any damage. Nao, on the other hand, reported the failure of his mission to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters; his superiors did not express disappointment in {{the failure of the}} operation, but instead they encouraged Nao and his men to destroy Card at all costs. Finally on May 1, 1964, Viet Cong reconnaissance teams spotted USNS Card as the ship sailed through Ganh Rai Bay and entered Long Tau River, so they immediately reported the information to the 65th Special Operations Group in Saigon. As usual, Card docked at the commercial port district in the city to unload another shipment of cargo and military helicopters, as well as upload a batch of helicopters scheduled to be returned to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Many critics saw A Link Between Worlds as {{a worthy}} {{successor}} to A Link to the Past, but also remarked {{that the game}} was outstanding in its own right. The game was commended for making enhancements <b>to</b> <b>core</b> and traditional elements of the series. New additions and changes to the established formula were also welcomed. Polygon reviewer Arthur Gies called it the best Zelda game in past twenty years, and GamesRadar writer Lorenzo Veloria {{said that it was}} an essential title for every Nintendo 3DS owner. Reception towards the game's puzzles was overwhelmingly positive; praise was directed towards how well the wall-merging mechanic had been incorporated into dungeon puzzles and integrated into every area of the game. Keza MacDonald of IGN thought A Link Between Worlds was the best puzzle game that Nintendo had ever created. Game Informer writer Dan Ryckert noted that some of the game's dungeons and boss encounters were {{among the best in the}} franchise's history. The level of difficulty present in the puzzles and dungeons was met with approval; the challenge was described as a perplexing experience rather than a frustrating one by GameSpot editor Martin Gaston.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Tomb Raider III was {{accompanied}} by an extensive marketing campaign. To promote the game, English model Nell McAndrew was hired to appear as Lara Croft on a press tour across Italy, Spain, Germany, the US, and Australia. McAndrew also made appearances on various multimedia outlets, including TV shows, radio stations, and department stores, while Lara Croft appeared on the front cover of most UK games magazines. Other highlights included French TV advertisements for the SEAT car manufacturer and a music video for the German band Die Ärzte. British sports lifestyle brand Animal designed and merchandised a range of Lara Croft clothes and accessories, while Core Design launched its own clothing articles. In May 1998, {{a demonstration of the}} game was presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia. The show included a virtual appearance of Lara, which allowed the audience to ask her questions. According <b>to</b> <b>Core</b> Design's PR manager Susie Hamilton, a total of £1.7 millions was spent on the marketing campaign.|$|E
25|$|Except {{for very}} small cores, all cores require vent holes to release gases.

25|$|Electric {{machines}} with a transformer circuit topology, such as induction machines, induction doubly-fed electric machines, and induction or synchronous wound-rotor doubly-fed (WRDF) machines, exhibit very high bursts of torque because the emf-induced active current {{on either side}} of the transformer oppose each other and thus contribute nothing to the transformer coupled magnetic core flux density, which would otherwise lead <b>to</b> <b>core</b> saturation.|$|E
50|$|The Lumes, {{which are}} hostile <b>to</b> <b>Cores,</b> {{propagate}} large plant-like access shafts {{until they are}} close <b>to</b> a <b>Core,</b> and then launch a coordinated attack on the Core until it is destroyed. If successful, the area will become swamped with poisonous spores. To counter the Lumes, the Britech Foundation has created and armed a military wing known as the Core Guardians, who are tasked <b>to</b> defend the <b>Cores</b> using their arsenal of weapons and defensive towers. The war between Britech and the Lumes {{has been going on}} and off for an indeterminate amount of time.|$|R
30|$|In the {{proposed}} approach, {{the behavior of}} each migrating task is further restricted. At runtime, each job activation of a migrating task follows a job-to-core execution pattern elaborated at design {{time in order to}} improve both the schedulability of the system and its utilization factor. In addition, we consider a task-level migration strategy, i.e., various jobs of a migrating task are allowed to be assigned <b>to</b> different <b>cores,</b> but once a job is assigned <b>to</b> a <b>core,</b> migrations of this job prior to its completion are forbidden. In contrast, job-level migration approaches allow each job assigned <b>to</b> a <b>core</b> <b>to</b> migrate <b>to</b> another <b>core</b> prior <b>to</b> its completion. By design, {{the proposed}} model limits the number of migrations, which has been {{recognized as one of the}} main sources of non-determinism on multicores, by limiting work-stealing <b>to</b> occur between <b>cores</b> that share a copy of a task 3.|$|R

25|$|The final {{specification}} proved {{far less}} revolutionary than the Longs Peak proposal. Instead of removing all immediate mode and fixed functionality (non-shader mode), the spec included them as deprecated features. The proposed object model was not included, and no {{plans have been}} announced to include it in any future revisions. As a result, the API remained largely the same with a few existing extensions being promoted <b>to</b> <b>core</b> functionality.|$|E
25|$|The phenomenal {{growth of}} the Internet in mid-to-late 1990s quickly changed the telecom landscape. As the Internet Protocol (IP) became widely adopted, the {{importance}} of multi-protocol routing declined. Nevertheless, Cisco managed to catch the Internet wave, with products ranging from modem access shelves (AS5200) <b>to</b> <b>core</b> GSR routers that quickly became vital to Internet service providers and by 1998 gave Cisco de facto monopoly in this critical segment.|$|E
