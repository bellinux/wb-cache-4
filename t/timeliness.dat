5|$|Almost all reviewers commented {{upon the}} <b>timeliness</b> of the book's release as the {{magnitude}} and causes {{of the most recent}} financial crisis were becoming apparent. Some reviewers also commented upon the <b>timeliness</b> of her previous books, like her novel in which society is devastated by a genetically engineered virus, Oryx and Crake, which coincided with the SARS outbreak. Playing off this theme Canadian magazine The Walrus, at a fund-raiser gala for its charitable foundation, auctioned a crystal decanter with five predictions written by Atwood sealed inside. Journalist Rebecca Eckler was the winning bidder and wrote about the predictions, which include the diminished use of fabric softener and the rise in use of industrial hemp, in an article for Maclean's magazine.|$|E

5|$|The {{lectures and}} book had been {{originally}} scheduled for 2009, but were {{moved up to}} 2008 to avoid conflicting with Atwood's forthcoming novel after the latter book was delayed by its publisher. The content examines borrowing and lending from financial, psychological, theological, literary, and ecological points of view. Its release coincided with extensive {{media coverage of the}} recent financial crisis which led numerous critics to comment on the book's <b>timeliness.</b> In the Canadian market, the book peaked at #1 on The Globe and Mail bestseller list on October 25 and out-sold all previous Massey Lecture books. Critics found the book well-researched, thought-provoking, and humorous. Various reviewers found the discussions on the non-monetary aspects of debt to be the better parts of the book, while some critics identified the sections on ecological debt as the worse parts of the book.|$|E
25|$|Seven {{criteria}} {{measure the}} usability {{of different types}} of public transport and its overall appeal, although they overlap somewhat. The criteria are speed, comfort, safety, cost, proximity, <b>timeliness</b> and directness. Speed is calculated from total journey time including transfers. Proximity means how far passengers must walk or otherwise travel before they can begin the public transport leg of their journey and how close it leaves them to their desired destination. <b>Timeliness</b> is how long they must wait for the vehicle. Directness records how far a journey using public transport deviates from the shortest route.|$|E

25|$|During the 1880s, Peirce's {{indifference}} to bureaucratic detail waxed while his Survey work's quality and <b>timeliness</b> waned. Peirce took years to write {{reports that he}} should have completed in months. Meanwhile, he wrote entries, ultimately thousands during 1883–1909, on philosophy, logic, science, and other subjects for the encyclopedic Century Dictionary. In 1885, an investigation by the Allison Commission exonerated Peirce, but led to the dismissal of Superintendent Julius Hilgard and several other Coast Survey employees for misuse of public funds. In 1891, Peirce resigned from the Coast Survey at Superintendent Thomas Corwin Mendenhall's request. He never again held regular employment.|$|E
25|$|Real-time {{multimedia}} streaming applications require timely {{delivery of}} information and often can tolerate some packet loss to achieve this goal. For example, loss of a packet in audio application may result in loss of {{a fraction of a}} second of audio data, which can be made unnoticeable with suitable error concealment algorithms. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), although standardized for RTP use, is not normally used in RTP applications because TCP favors reliability over <b>timeliness.</b> Instead the majority of the RTP implementations are built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Other transport protocols specifically designed for multimedia sessions are SCTP and DCCP, although, , they are not in widespread use.|$|E
25|$|In 1864, in the United States, wheat, corn, cattle, {{and pigs}} were widely traded using {{standard}} instruments on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the world's oldest futures and options exchange. Other food commodities {{were added to}} the Commodity Exchange Act and traded through CBOT in the 1930s and 1940s, expanding the list from grains to include rice, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Irish potatoes and soybeans. Successful commodity markets require broad consensus on product variations to make each commodity acceptable for trading, such as the purity of gold in bullion. Classical civilizations built complex global markets trading gold or silver for spices, cloth, wood and weapons, most of which had standards of quality and <b>timeliness.</b>|$|E

The test was commissioned to a research institute (Cologne-based WIND GmbH), whose analysts assessed 50 articles from each encyclopedia (covering politics, business, sports, science, culture, entertainment, geography, medicine, history and religion) on four criteria (accuracy, completeness, <b>timeliness</b> and clarity), and judged Wikipedia articles to be more accurate on the average (1.6 on a scale from 1 to 6, versus 2.3 for Brockhaus with lower = better). Wikipedia's coverage was also found to be more complete and up to date, however Brockhaus was judged to be more clearly written, while several Wikipedia articles were criticized as being too complicated for non-experts, and many as too lengthy.|$|E

A $100 million contribution by Stephen Adams enabled the Yale School of Music to become tuition-free and the Adams Center for Musical Arts to be built.|$|E
25|$|Signal Troops is an {{integral}} part of the Armed Forces. Its condition and functioning largely influences efficiency of command, the <b>timeliness</b> of combat equipment and weapons. In its development, the Signal Troops has come a long and difficult process that is inextricably linked with the history of the Armed Forces, the changes in the forms and methods of their use and the improvement of military art. From simple audio and visual means of communication for the transmission of signals and commands on the battlefield to widely branched multi-channel, advanced automated systems that can provide a link of virtually unlimited range of both stationary and moving objects on the ground, in the water, under the water and in the air, this is the historical path of development and improvement of military communications.

On Friday, 11 March 1938, Conrad received a message from an Austrian living near the Austrian/German border, reporting that German forces were advancing from Bad Tölz and Rosenheim towards the Austrian border. The <b>timeliness</b> of this information is critical to political and military manoeuvres. Knowing this, Conrad used the most expedient method available to transmit the message, phoning the report directly to London, even though it exposed his cover. He was told {{that this was the}} first news received from Allied capitals reporting the advance. Conrad continued to receive confirmations of the advance throughout the day. Through his local contacts he was able to warn residents, giving many in danger time to quickly pack and flee—saving lives. The ease of travel quickly changed, and by the next morning Gestapo officials were ripping soles from passengers' shoes in search of money and incriminating documents. At 9 a.m., Saturday morning, 12 March, a large force of German troops entered Kitzbühel, with another at Mittenwald to occupy Innsbruck and the country west as far as the Arlberg Pass.|$|E

500|$|Many critics {{compared}} and contrasted Lazarus {{with other}} genre works. The <b>timeliness</b> of Rucka's premise made the series stand out among dystopian fiction for IGN reviewer Melissa Grey. Garrett Martin wrote in Paste Magazine that {{the series was}} unlike other contemporary class warfare genre fiction like Hunger Games or Blackacre because it is told from the oppressors' point of view. Oliver Sava reviewed the series for The A.V. Club and said it stood out from Image's other science fiction comics [...] "because it's more grounded in current political and economic trends". In {{a review of the}} first issue for Behind the Panels, Richard Gray felt Lazarus did too little to set itself apart from similar books. Rucka specifically addressed fan-drawn parallels to Game of Thrones, saying he had not read the books and purposely avoids watching the show to avoid unintentionally borrowing ideas from it. Lark thinks the comparison to Game of Thrones works to some extent, but points out that Lazarus concentrates more on a single character.|$|E
500|$|Written and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker, [...] "200" [...] was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 14, 2010. It was the 200th episode of the series. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone conceive, write and produce most South Park episodes {{within a week of}} their broadcast date in order to maintain a sense of energy and <b>timeliness.</b> The idea for [...] "200", however, was conceived before the fourteenth season began in March 2010, and before any of the season fourteen episodes that preceded it were conceived. While trying to decide how to celebrate the 200th episode, Parker and Stone started reviewing the plots and controversies of previous episodes, many of which had a common thread of mocking a particular celebrity. This led to the idea of the having all the celebrities band together in a class action lawsuit against the town. Parker said their reactions mirrored the real-life reactions some of the celebrities had to their portrayals, adding, [...] "If they could join forces, they probably would." ...|$|E
500|$|Five {{months after}} the episode aired, Bill Clinton, who served as {{president}} of the United States at the time, held the first ever White House conference on Mental Health.

In 2007, the fictional word [...] "exorcism tongs" [...] appeared in Cracked.com's list [...] "From Cromulent to Craptacular: The Top 12 Simpsons Created Words", ranking in at number 10. The word is used in a scene in which Homer eats a mixture of taffy and Focusyn, which puts him in a [...] "mildly hallucinogenic state". Seeing this, Todd Flanders asks his father, Ned, [...] "Does Mr. Simpson have a demon, daddy?" [...] To which Ned replies, [...] "Looks like it. Run and get daddy's exorcism tongs." [...] About the word, Mark Peters and Daniel O' Brien of Cracked.com wrote [...] "We'd be lying if we said we didn't go out to every Christian-themed general store in the country hoping to acquire our very own set of exorcism tongs the day this episode aired." ...|$|E
500|$|Claudia Puig of USA Today {{praised the}} film's sense of <b>timeliness,</b> writing, [...] "It's tough to capture an era while it's still happening, yet Up in the Air does so brilliantly, with wit and humanity... Reitman {{emerges as a}} modern-day Frank Capra, {{capturing}} the nation's anxieties and culture of resilience." [...] Stephen Saito of IFC.com wrote, [...] "It touches on larger themes of mass unemployment, cultural alienation and technology as a crutch. But ultimately, it's really an expertly done character study that's a dramatic change of pace from director Jason Reitman's previous two films." [...] Jonathan Romney of The Independent wrote, [...] "Its cynical wit almost places it in the Billy Wilder bracket: Up In The Air is as eloquent about today's executive culture as The Apartment was about that of 1960. It is a brutal, desolate film – but also a superb existential rom-com, and the most entertaining lesson in contemporary socio-economics that you could hope for." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and wrote, [...] "This isn't a comedy. If it were, {{it would be hard}} to laugh in these last days of 2009. Nor is it a tragedy. It's an observant look at how a man does a job." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television sources and critics. Although the live-action sequences with Conway Twitty from previous episodes were highly criticized, IGN writer Ahsan Haque {{felt that the}} live-action footage in this episode [...] "blends in pretty well". Haque praised Barrymore's portrayal of Jillian in the episode, saying that she had [...] "some great comedy moments." [...] He went on to grade the episode 8 out of 10, {{and said that the}} live-action footage [...] "seemed to work somehow here, and the storyline took center stage here" [...] and that [...] "you can't argue against an attempt to tell an actual story, and for that reason, this episode's definitely worth watching." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club praised the live-action footage as well, saying that he [...] "liked the splicing in of late night hosts and their jokes about Brian and , if only to add a certain element of <b>timeliness</b> to the material." [...] Heisler graded the episode B-, the second highest grade of the night. He said that [...] "often Family Guy is unbearable" [...] and [...] "has established a certain style and rhythm, jokes come off as smug", but said that he found himself enjoying the episode [...] "more and more as it went on [...] because it was willing to fully embrace the silliness and ridiculousness of what it was setting up." ...|$|E
500|$|Among {{the songs}} {{performed}} by Mouse Rat in [...] "Galentine's Day" [...] were [...] "The Way You Look Tonight", originally performed by Fred Astaire in the 1936 film, Swing Time.

Andy and his band also performs [...] "I Only Have Eyes for You" [...] and [...] "I've Got You Under My Skin". Leslie said reuniting Marlene and Frank would be like reuniting Romeo and Juliet, the protagonists of the William Shakespeare play of the same name, or reuniting actress Jennifer Aniston and actor Brad Pitt. She also warns to the camera for Aniston to [...] "stay away from John Mayer", the musician who previously dated Aniston. In the days prior to the original broadcast of [...] "Galentine's Day", Mayer publicly apologized {{for a number of}} explicit sexual and racial comments he had made in the past months, which prompted news outlets to praise Parks and Recreation for the <b>timeliness</b> of their Mayer joke. Ironically, in May 2011, Jennifer Aniston started dating Justin Theroux, who guest starred in the episode, and they later married.

500|$|As part of Charles' Grammy Award for Album of the Year-winning Genius Loves Company, {{the song}} {{proved to be}} the most popular and {{critically}} acclaimed on the album. Although the song had its early detractors, it received mostly favorable reviews. Several reviewers noted the complementarity of Jones and Charles. The Daily Vault Jason Warburg described the song as a [...] "jazzy, slinky pas de deux" [...] in which Charles matches Jones note for note." [...] JazzTimes Christopher Loudon said Charles [...] "blends seamlessly with Jones on a velvet-and-buckram" [...] performance. The song was described by the Orlando Sentinel Jim Abbott as a recreation of one of the gems from Charles' country music phase of the 1960s that produced the perfect [...] "combination of voices and instruments" [...] with Preston's accompanying role on Hammond B3. As opposed to other tracks on the album, when Charles' voice was understated, this song was said to represent his [...] "indomitable spirit", while Jones performed as [...] "an empathetic foil, [...] her warm, lazy vocals meshing convivially with his over a spare but funky arrangement". Author Mike Evans wrote that [...] "there's a mutual warmth of purpose in every breath [...] take" [...] on the song. Music Week staff noted the <b>timeliness</b> of the release with the biographical film Ray in theaters and described the song as soulful, that finely combines Charles' [...] "deep, honeyed growl with Jones's lighter timber", while noting Preston for his [...] "sweeping" [...] organ work.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Robert Canning of IGN {{gave the}} episode an 8.4/10 {{saying it was}} [...] "Impressive" [...] and [...] "With or without the <b>timeliness</b> {{of the story and}} setting, 'Boy Meets Curl' was a fast and funny episode certain to be a highlight of the season". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, the best grade of the night, saying [...] "Simpsons was one of their best episodes in a long time, and it continues a season that's had some pretty good episodes overall. I wouldn't put this on The Simpsons' top tier, but I think it's definitely on that next tier down, episodes that maybe don't have the most original plots but do have solid jokes throughout. Even the Bart and Lisa B-plot, involving Lisa getting a sudden addiction to Olympic pin collecting, starts out kind of bland and gets better and better as Lisa's jones grows." [...] Jason Hughes of the TV Squad gave the episode a positive review as well saying [...] "All in all, it was a weird time out of Springfield this week, with some highlight moments sprinkled throughout". Steve Tilley of the Toronto Sun wrote [...] "Sure, the episode was probably funnier for Canadians and curlers (and maybe Harry Potter fans) than anyone else, but it did prove Homer has got a bit of meteorological, psychic in him: 'Pack your winter coat, we're going to Canada's warmest city!'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sexual Healing" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun {{praised the}} <b>timeliness</b> of the episode, {{which he said}} has kept South Park relevant throughout its 14 seasons. Harris complimented the episode for addressing the larger issue of how sexual acts among celebrities are dissected and analyzed {{by the media and}} public. MTV News praised the Woods parody, which they said was particularly timely because of the golf pro's recent announcement to return to golf. It said, [...] "It was on-the-nose while still being clever, which is a balance that the makers of [...] "South Park" [...] have mastered brilliantly." [...] Bill Brownstein, from the Canwest News Service, called it [...] "an absolutely blistering and timely satire" [...] on Woods and sexual addiction. A CNN review called the Woods satire [...] "brilliant" [...] and a strong improvement over the previous season's [...] "Dead Celebrities", which also included several cameos of celebrity parodies. The review also found the ending of the episode, with Stan and Cartman growing bored with their video game once it focused on golf rather than sex scandals and fighting, to be a [...] "pretty hilarious gag". Ryan Waxon, of The Cowl, said [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] stood out from other Woods jokes and proved Parker and Stone [...] "can do satire like nobody else". He particularly praised the Woods video game and the subplot with Butters trying to learn about women's pubic hair, claiming, [...] "Butters’ low intelligence and complete innocence make for some the greatest moments that the show has to offer." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{television}} reviewer Ken Tucker {{said the}} episode was [...] "rather short on laugh-out-loud funniness", but included several clever ideas, including the Tiger Woods video game, the satire {{of the media}} attention to the Woods scandal, and [...] "one of the best Kenny death scenes ever". Newsweek writer Joshua Alston said the Woods parody [...] "didn't manage to be terribly funny or insightful", and suggested {{the speed at which}} South Park writers can produce a topical episode just days before its broadcast is actually a detriment to the show. Alston said, [...] "Whereas once the show's creators swiftly turned around topical episodes because they could, now the South Park team is expected to seize on the news." [...] Ramsey Isler of IGN found much of the episode's humor mediocre, in particular the rehabilitation of the celebrities and the CDC studies of the chimpanzees. Isler said he enjoyed Kenny's death and Butters' obsession with [...] "bush", but felt the theme of the episode was too obvious and less clever than previous South Park episodes. The A.V. Club writer Zack Handlen appreciated the <b>timeliness</b> and relevance of the subject matter, but felt [...] "the satirical target here wasn't meaty enough to warrant a full episode, and the developing plot just felt too half-assed". Handlen said some individual jokes were funny, but the episode as a whole was too one-note and redundant. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine said the Woods scandal was several months old, so the episode felt stale and old news. Delgado felt the alien infection theory was too random and lazy, and the idea that men would cheat on their wives if they had more money and opportunity was offensive, but not entirely untrue.|$|E
