5|$|A {{group of}} about 1,500 men began marching towards the {{electric}} distribution center used to power the entire streetcar system, several blocks away from the terminal building. The police had maintained a heavy guard around <b>the</b> <b>building</b> during the ongoing strike and Sheriff Porttens had given orders to use firearms to disperse any attempt by the strikers to take <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> As the crowd neared <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> the police opened fire.

Penn State Abington has a nearby residence hall, Lion's Gate, that houses around 400 freshman. <b>The</b> major <b>buildings</b> on campus include <b>the</b> Sutherland <b>Building,</b> <b>the</b> Woodland <b>Building,</b> and <b>the</b> Lares <b>Building.</b> Other buildings on campus include <b>the</b> Springhouse <b>Building,</b> <b>the</b> Rydal <b>Building,</b> <b>the</b> Conference Center, <b>the</b> Cloverly <b>Building,</b> <b>the</b> Athletics <b>Building,</b> and <b>the</b> Hillcrest <b>Building.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{high level}} of {{insulation}} was used to keep <b>the</b> <b>building</b> warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat {{and the use of}} computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature {{in different parts of the}} Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep <b>the</b> <b>building</b> cool. During summer months, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep <b>the</b> <b>building</b> temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25metres (80ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> achieves the highest rating in <b>the</b> <b>Building</b> Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).|$|E
5|$|After 1952, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> {{served as}} the European centre of the American armed forces and the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. V Corps. It later became the headquarters for the Northern Area Command until 1994. The IG Farben Building was also {{the headquarters of the}} CIA in Germany, which led to its sobriquet 'the Pentagon of Europe'. On April 16, 1975, the US Army renamed <b>the</b> <b>building</b> the General Creighton W. Abrams Building. The renaming did not have full authority in law, because the US was technically leasing <b>the</b> <b>building</b> from the German government and thus was not the rightful owner.|$|E
5|$|After being {{vacated by}} the Keys, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was {{purchased}} by 's Bank. Not long after acquiring <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> the bank removed the ceiling from the chamber, and added a large skylight to create a grand banking hall. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> was repainted in an expensive shade of blue which was fashionable at the time. In 1900, when 's Bank collapsed, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> {{was taken over by}} Parr's Bank. The render was stripped off the outside of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> sometime during the 1910s or 1920s, revealing the limestone underneath. In 1918, the bank became part of Westminster Bank. In the 1960s, the upper floor of the chamber was replaced. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> was presented to the Castletown Commissioners in 1973 by the National Westminster Bank on the condition that it serve the town. It was used as the Town Hall until the opening of the Town Hall and Civic Centre in 1989, and then as the Castletown Rural Library.|$|E

5|$|After the Great Depression, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> {{housed a}} {{succession}} of tenants, including barber shops and cafés. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently because {{a sufficient number of}} local residents came to its defense. It was eventually deeded to the city of Wichita Falls. As <b>the</b> <b>building</b> continued to deteriorate, in 1986 the city gave <b>the</b> <b>building</b> to the Wichita County Heritage Society (WCHS), with the hope that it would eventually be restored, making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District.|$|E
5|$|After the {{decision}} by the King County Superior Court to exempt <b>the</b> <b>building</b> from city preservation ordinances, the university applied for a demolition permit in May 2016.

5|$|As of 2005, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> still {{retained}} {{a number of}} original features, including its gold brocade seats, wall friezes, cornices, and ceiling roses. However, the fabric of <b>the</b> <b>building</b> remained in a poor state of repair, and in January 2008 it was announced once again that <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was to be demolished, and scaffolding was erected at the front in preparation. <b>The</b> <b>building,</b> once considered amongst the most iconic in Manchester, was not regarded as architecturally interesting, and was demolished {{in the spring of}} 2008.

5|$|At about 8:30am {{the wooden}} {{construction}} of {{the main part of}} <b>the</b> <b>building</b> also burned through and collapsed.

5|$|Built in {{a modernist}} style, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> {{has been the}} subject of {{vigorous}} public debate about its heritage value. Some parties, such as the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, consider <b>the</b> <b>building</b> to be an important example of modernist architecture in the city, whilst others consider it ugly. These conflicting views led to animosity in the 1990s, when the State Government refused to heritage list the property, and instead recommended its demolition. Despite this, the City of Perth opted to renovate the tower and keep it as its headquarters. Following this, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was admitted to the State's Heritage Register.|$|E

5|$|By the 1950s, {{railroad}} traffic declined {{and parts}} of Depot Town began to fall into disrepair. The Thompson Block was put up for sale in 1950, standing vacant {{for more than a}} year.
