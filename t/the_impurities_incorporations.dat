We measure the oxygen, silicon, and carbon impurity concentrations using secondary ion mass spectrometry, and measure their effect on the lattice constant by high resolution x-ray diffraction (HR-XRD).

The temperature dependent conductivity curves can be fitted with the grain boundary limited transport model of Seto 1975 and Werner 1994. The grain barrier heights depend significantly on the total sputtering pressure and are in the range of 30 to 80 meV. In situ energy dispersive X ray diffraction EDXRD at a synchrotron radiation source was used to study the growth of the reactively sputtered films. Optical absorption spectra obtained from spectral transmission and reflection measurements are comparable to those of single crystals except of a high absorption level in the band gap E lt; 1. 5 eV, which is higher for films prepared at low sputtering pressures.

Good hotwall deposition uniformity is demonstrated at low temperatures (200 to 300 C). The as-deposited films are amorphous by x-ray diffraction and can be crystallized in subsequent anneal steps with anneal induced film shrinkage of less than 12 percent. Surface oxide formation is possible during this anneal cycle.

The substitution of CVD silicides for standard MOS gate metals appears to be transparent in terms of transistor performance, except for work function effects on the threshold voltage.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis deals with experimental and theoretical studies related {{to the growth of}} crystalline alumina thin films. Alumina, Al 2 O 3, is a polymorphic material utilized in a variety of applications, e. g., in the form of thin films. Many of the possibilities of alumina, and the problems associated with thin film synthesis of the material, are due to the existence of a range of different crystalline phases. Controlling the formation of the desired phase and the transformations between the polymorphs is often difficult. In the experimental part of this work, it was shown that the thermodynamically stable alpha phase, which normally is synthesized at substrate temperatures of around 1000 °C, can be grown using reactive sputtering at a substrate temperature of 500 °C by controlling the nucleation surface. This was done by predepositing a Cr 2 O 3 nucleation layer. Moreover, it was found that an additional requirement for the formation of the α phase is that the depositions are carried out at low enough total pressure and high enough oxygen partial pressure. Based on these observations, it was concluded that energetic bombardment, plausibly originating from energetic oxygen, is necessary for the formation of α alumina (in addition to the effect of the chromia nucleation layer). Further, <b>the</b> effects of <b>impurities,</b> especially residual water, on the growth of crystalline films were investigated by varying the partial pressure of water in the ultra high vacuum (UHV) chamber. Films deposited onto chromia nucleation layers exhibited a columnar structure and consisted of crystalline α-alumina if deposited under UHV conditions. However, as water to a partial pressure of 1 x 10 - 5 Torr was introduced, the columnar growth was interrupted. Instead, a microstructure consisting of small, equiaxed grains was formed, and the gamma-alumina content was found to increase with increasing film thickness. When gamma-alumina was formed under UHV conditions, no effects of residual water on the phase formation was observed. Moreover, the H content was found to be low (< 1 at. %) in all films. Consequently, this shows that effects of residual gases during sputter deposition of oxides can be considerable, also in cases where <b>the</b> <b>impurity</b> <b>incorporation</b> in <b>the</b> films is found to be low. In the modeling part of the thesis, density functional theory based computational studies of adsorption of Al, O, AlO, and O 2 on different alpha-alumina (0001) surfaces have been performed.

40|$|The {{brightening}} additive {{level and}} dc current density of electroplating baths are two parameters {{that affect the}} gap-filling capability and <b>the</b> degree of <b>impurity</b> <b>incorporation</b> in electroplated copper films. Additive incorporation can inhibit grain growth during the room temperature recrystallization process and therefore affect the final grain size. This investigation explores the grain size and microstructure of dc jet-electroplated copper films in 0. 35 and 0. 50 μm Damascene trenches {{as a function of}} current density and brightening additive level after first receiving a high-temperature anneal. Unlike a previous study that explored these variables in blanket Cu films [J. Electrochem. Soc., 152, C 101 (2005) ], {{the results of this study}} suggest that current density, and to a lesser extent additive level, play a role in determining the final grain size in Damascene trenches. In 0. 5 μm trench structures it was found that only higher dc current density levels produce larger cross-sectional grain sizes. In 0. 35 μm trenches, however, both the current density and brightening additive level affected the final grain size. It thus appears that the level of geometrical constraint, the number of available nucleation sites, the amount of stored energy in the microstructure, and the degree of remnant additive incorporation are factors that could influence the final grain size...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{presence}} of <b>impurities</b> in <b>the</b> molecular crystals of organic semiconductors {{is a key}} limiting factor {{for the performance of}} related electronic devices. For this reason, the atomic-scale details of <b>impurity</b> <b>incorporation</b> are important elements for modeling and optimization of organic electronic systems. In this article, we use first-principles density-functional theory calculations to describe the vibrational spectrum of typical <b>impurity</b> culprits in <b>the</b> prototype organic semiconductor pentacene. First, we validate the computational approach by comparing results on vibrational modes of impurity-free pentacene with available theoretical and experimental data.

The results identify distinct impurity-related features which can help understand <b>the</b> evolution of <b>impurities</b> in pentacene samples. © EDP Sciences, 2011...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we study}} the {{influence}} of oxygen additive in the gas phase on hydrogen <b>impurity</b> <b>incorporation</b> into thick nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) films. Various diamond samples were grown on large silicon wafers of 5. 08 cm diameter by adjusting the amount of oxygen and nitrogen additives into a conventional CH 4 /H 2 plasma while keeping the other parameters constant using a 5 -kW microwave plasmaassisted chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) reactor. The morphology, crystalline quality, and hydrogen <b>impurity</b> content of <b>the</b> produced diamond samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, respectively. The Raman and the FTIR spectra of the diamond samples indicate that on {{increasing the amount of}} oxygen additive in the gas phase, the crystalline quality of the NCD films is significantly enhanced, while their bonded hydrogen content decreases drastically. We conclude that a small amount of oxygen addition has an enhancement effect on the overall quality of diamond films ranging from polycrystalline to nanocrystalline in two ways: improving the diamond crystalline quality and suppressing hydrogen <b>impurity</b> <b>incorporation...</b>|$|R
