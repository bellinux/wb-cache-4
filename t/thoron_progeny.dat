40|$|Background: Radon, <b>thoron</b> {{and their}} <b>progenies</b> {{are the most}} {{important}} contributions to human exposure from natural sources. Radon exists in soil gas, building materials, Indoor atmosphere etc. Among all the natural sources of radiation dose to human beings, inhalation of radon contributes a lot. The work presented here emphasizes the long term measurements of radon, <b>thoron</b> and their <b>progeny</b> concentrations in about 100 dwellings using solid state nuclear track detectors. Materials and Methods: Measurements were made using dosimeters and the concentrations were estimated by knowing the track density of films through spark counter, and sensitivity factor for bare, filter and membrane films. Results: Presence of radon and thoron in houses is the effect of several aspects such as the activity concentrations of uranium, radium and thorium in the local soil, building materials, ventilation of houses and also entry of radon into houses through the cracks in floor/wall. Conclusion: The observations reveal that the concentrations of radon and/or thoron are relatively higher in granite than in concrete, cement and bricks. In continuation to this the concentration observed in bathrooms is more compared to kitchen, bedroom and living rooms.

40|$|On 11 March 2011, a 9. 0 {{magnitude}} earthquake, {{which occurred}} at Northern Japan, and subsequent tsunami caused serious {{damage to the}} Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (FDNPS). People living within a radius of 30 km evacuated from their homes. Residents at Namie Town stayed at Tsushima district, which was located in the northwest of the FDNPS. As a highly concentrated radioactive plume passed through this area however, the evacuees werevery much worried about their radiation doses and internal exposures. In order to overcome this anxiety, public people should recognize more detailed knowledge about natural radiation exposure. There are several high back ground radiation areas (HBRAs) in the world. Residents living in these areas {{have been exposed to}} low dose radiation over a long term. Chapter 1 mainly describes the aim of the present study. The motivation and background as well. Chapter 2 describes the recognition of radiation among general public in Namie Town and Aomori Prefecture (Hirosaki, Aomori and Hachinohe Cities). The survey was carried out using anonymous questionnaires. According to the data analysis, people recognized that they were exposed to natural radiations of more than 1 mSv. However, people in Namie Town thought even radiation of 1 mSv would cause some biological effects. In addition, many people recognized that there would be differences in health effects between artificial and natural radiations, internal and external exposures, respectively. In particular, residents of Namie Town concerned about their own internal exposures by ingestion of food and water. Chapter 3 focuses on internal exposures caused by inhalation of radon and <b>thoron</b> <b>progeny</b> because the internal exposures have not yet been clarified in HBRAs. For their dose assessment, radon, thoron and <b>thoron</b> <b>progeny</b> concentrations were measured by passive monitors over a long period. Consequently, annual effective doses are estimated to be 3. 1 ± 2. 0 mSv for radon and 2. 2 ± 2. 5 mSv for thoron respectively. Total dose are estimated to be 5. 3 ± 3. 5 mSv a- 1. The present study has revealed that the radon dose was comparable than the thoron dose, and the total dose was about 2 times higher than the worldwide average. Chapter 4 summarized the present study. The conclusion is obtained as follows: In order to improve radiation risk communication, it is necessary to explain the health risk due to low dose chronic exposure clearly to general public using new scientific findings in HBRAs studies. For instance internal exposures due to inhalation of radon and <b>thoron</b> <b>progeny</b> are unavoidable for general public.

Results: Studies have revealed that the annual average potential alpha energy concentrations of radon and <b>thoron</b> <b>progeny</b> in dwellings of Gudalore were recorded as 3. 54 and 2. 65 mWL respectively. It was also observed that the potential alpha energy concentration (PAEC) values for radon progeny undergo dramatic change with the change of season perhaps due to different aerosol contents in the air. The maximum 222 Rn (3. 93 mWL) and 220 Rn (3. 10 mWL) progeny concentrations were observed during winter months and the minimum values (222 Rn 3. 14 mWL and 220 Rn 2. 20 mWL) were observed during summer.

Accidentally, {{in the midst of}} an observation term, i. e., February 2005, the facility management group of the university changed a strategy for the manner of ventilation, probably because of a recession: (I) tidy everyday ventilation of 7 : 30 - 24 : 00 into (II) shortened weekday ventilation of 8 : 00 - 21 : 00 with weekend halts. This change of ventilation manner brought a clear alteration for the concentrations of radon-related natural radioactivity in indoor air. The present paper concerns an investigation of the effect of the ventilation strategy on the indoor-atmospheric radon-related radioactivity.

40|$|The decay {{products}} of radon and thoron are essentially the radioisotopes of polonium, bismuth and lead, and are solid particulates, which deposit {{in different parts}} of the respiratory tract upon inhalation, subsequently emitting high-energy alpha particles upon their radioactive decay. Development of passive deposition-based direct progeny sensors known as direct radon and <b>thoron</b> <b>progeny</b> sensors have provided an easy-to-use technique for time-integrated measurements of the decay products only. These dosemeters are apt for large-scale population dosimetry to assign inhalation doses to the public. The paper gives an insight into the technique, the calibration, comparison with the prevalently used active grab filter paper sampling technique, alpha track diameter analysis in these progeny sensors, progeny deposition velocity measurements carried out using these detector systems in the indoor as well as outdoor environment, and applications of these sensors for time-integrated unattached fraction estimation...|$|E
40|$|In the past, the radon isotope 220 Rn (thoron) {{was often}} paid little {{attention}} {{in the context of}} radiation protection at home. Measurements in buildings on the Central-Chinese Loess Plateau have shown, however, that in dwellings built from unfired earthen material, thoron and its progenies can significantly contribute to the inhalation dose of the dwellers. In Germany, such buildings mainly comprise traditional half-timbered houses and modern ecological low-energy houses with clay boards and plaster. Measurements of thoron in several such houses show concentrations of up to 150 Bq/m (at 20 cm distance from the wall). Radon and thoron progenies were measured with a newly constructed device which makes use of aerosol precipitation in an electric field upon solid-state nuclear track detectors. <b>Thoron</b> <b>progeny</b> concentrations were in the range from 100 to 1000 nJ/m resulting in a dose contribution of up to about 4 mSv per year...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of radon and thoron equilibrium factors obtained from long term measurements of concentrations of radon, <b>thoron</b> and their <b>progeny</b> in different indoor environment of Banja Luka city (Republic Srpska). The measurements were made in 35 dwellings and 24 schools using CR- 39 and LR- 115 nuclear track detectors, exposed from April 2011 to May 2012. In schools the detectors were positioned about 8 – 10 cm away from walls and surfaces which are potential sources of thoron exhalation, whereas this distance was about 3 – 10 cm in schools. The obtained results for equilibrium factors can be described as log-normally distributed. The geometric mean values (and geometric standard deviations) of radon and thoron equilibrium factors were 0. 17 (1. 9) and 0. 010 (2. 2), respectively. The statistical analysis shows that the difference between radon equilibrium factor obtained for dwellings and schools was not significant. The geometric mean (geometric standard deviation) of thoron equilibrium factors in dwellings, i. e. 0. 013 (2. 0), is higher than the one in schools, 0. 008 (2. 2), and this could be related to the small differences in the detector positions with respect to the wall in schools and in dwellings. The influences of the distance of the detector from the wall, as well as the ones of the floor level, building materials and room type on equilibrium factor were analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Since 1996 / 97, indoor radon {{has been}} {{measured}} in scattered locations around Kosovo. In {{the most recent}} campaign, apart from radon, thoron and Rn and Tn progenies have also been measured. The current survey involves 48 houses, in which different detectors have been deployed side-by-side in one room, {{in order to measure}} indoor radon and thoron gas with RADUET devices based on CR- 39 detectors (analysed by Japanese collaborators) and with direct <b>thoron</b> and radon <b>progeny</b> sensor (DTPS and DRPS) devices based on LR- 115 detectors (analysed by collaborators from India). Estimated arithmetic mean values of concentrations in 48 houses are 122 Bq m 23 for radon and 136 Bq m 23 for thoron. Those for equilibrium equivalent radon concentration and equilibrium equivalent thoron concentration based on measurements in 48 houses are 40 and 2. 1 Bq m 23, respectively. The arithmetic mean value of the equilibrium factor is estimated to be 0. 50 + 0. 23 for radon and 0. 037 + 0. 041 for thoron. The preliminary results of these measurements are reported, particularly regarding DTPS and DRPS being set up in real field conditions {{for the first time in}} the Balkan region. The results are to be understood under the caveat of open questions related to measurement protocols which yield reproducible and representative results, and to quality assurance of Tn and Rn/Tn progeny measurements in general, some of which are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Radon, <b>thoron</b> {{and their}} <b>progenies</b> in the indoor {{environment}} are {{considered as one}} of the health hazards. The alpha emitting nature of these gases made it possible to detect in indoor environment with the help of nuclear track detector techniques. The soil is the main source of indoor radon as it contains varying amounts of uranium and thorium. Thus the exhalation of radon from soil and its environmental activity needs to be studied. In the present study, the measurement of the indoor radon-thoron from the indoor environment and exhalation from soil are carried out using solid state nuclear track detector technique from Sirsa and Bhiwani districts of northern part of India. The canister technique was used to measure the radon ex- halation rate from the soil samples collected from the study area and pinhole based radon-thoron dosimeters were used to measure indoor radon and thoron concentration. The results show that indoor radon concentration varied from 9 to 28 Bq/m 3, with an average of 18. 9 Bq/m 3 and from 5 to 21 Bq/m 3, with an average of 13. 8 Bq/m 3, for Bhiwani and Sirsa, respectively. Similarly, thoron concentration varied from 14 to 48 Bq/m 3, with average of 28. 9 Bq/m 3 and 27 to 54 Bq/m 3, with the average of 39. 0 Bq/m 3, for Bhiwani and Sirsa, respectively. The mass exhalation rates from soil samples were also measured, to estimate their contribution to indoor radon. A correlation study was carried out between soil exhalation rates and indoor radon concentration...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{negative}} ions emitted from the negative ion generator (NIG) help in charging the airborne particles, thereby removing them by electromigration in space charge-induced electric fields (Mayya et al., 2004). The NIGs have also been used to reduce activity concentration of radon/thoron decay products (Sheets and Thomson 1995). The physical arguments suggest different reasons for the activity reduction namely; 1) direct plate-out of freshly formed, charged fine fraction of progeny through drift in the electric field and 2) removal of the coarse fraction, thereby increasing the highly mobile fine fraction and its consequent plate-out. To investigate these aspects, measurements of various parameters like activity concentrations, deposition velocity, aerosol number concentration and the unattached fraction in presence of NIG; a systematic study has been carried out in a room environment wherein a thorium nitrate powder was placed as a source of <b>thoron</b> <b>progeny.</b> The overall decrease in the progeny concentration with NIG i...|$|E
40|$|In-situ {{underwater}} gamma-ray spectrometer KATERINA {{was used}} for continuous measurements of radon progenies (214 Pb, 214 Bi), <b>thoron</b> <b>progeny</b> (208 Tl) and 40 K in submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) sites at Kalogria Bay, SW Peloponnesus (Greece). The spectrometer was deployed attached on measuring platform along with two conductivity - temperature data loggers while underwater battery packs supplied the system for acquisition periods up to 25 days. The radionuclide time series together with salinity data were obtained for spring (wet) and summer (dry) seasons. The 40 K activity concentrations correlated well with salinity of the emanating groundwater. Although the 214 Bi and 208 Tl activities showed usually similar trends anticorrelating with salinity, in some cases 208 Tl did not follow the 214 Bi record due {{to changes in the}} dynamics of the groundwater aquifer. As the half-life of 220 Rn is very short (55. 6 s), its concentration in SGD may depend on the distance from its origin to the monitoring point. The observed temporal variations of 214 Bi and 208 Tl confirmed advantages of continuous in-situ monitoring of SGD in coastal areas. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

The annual annihilation dose has been assessed from measured radionuclide concentration to find out major contributor of lung cancer in the study area. The measurements {{have been carried out}} in NINETY dwellings of THIRTEEN different villages situated in and around the Tosham region. This region is known to be composed of acidic volcanic and associated granites. Dwellings were selected mainly targeting different type building material used in construction of houses like concrete–brick, mud-brick, and mud-thatches along with an idea of different ventilation conditions which affects the equilibrium factor (EF). The EF in this region has been varying from 0. 20 to 0. 72 and 0. 03 – 0. 13 for indoor radon and thoron respectively. The average inhalation dose observed in dwellings of different villages varies from 1. 33  ±  0. 31 – 3. 36  ±  0. 72  mSv/y that lies within the safe limits recommended by ICRP (2011) ...|$|E

The DOE award amount for this period was $ 547, 495. The objective of the project as stated in its proposal was {open_quotes}to improve {{our understanding of the}} physical processes controlling the concentration of radon, <b>thoron,</b> and their <b>progeny</b> in the atmospheric environment. {close_quotes} The original project was directed at developing underlying science that would help with evaluation of the health hazard from indoor radon in the United States and implementation of corrective measures that might be employed to reduce the health hazard. As priorities within the Office of Health and Environment (OHER) changed, and the radon research program was phased out, emphasis of the project was shifted somewhat to be also relevant to other interests of the OHER, namely global pollution and climate change and pollution resulting from energy production. This final report is brief, since by reference it can direct the reader to the comprehensive research publications that have been generated by the project. In section 2, we summarize the main accomplishments of the project and reference the primary publications. There were seven students who received support from the project and their names are listed in section 3. One of these students (Fred Yarger, Ph. D. candidate) continues to work on research initiated through this project. No post-docs received support from the project, although one of the co-principal investigators (Dr. Piotr Wasiolek) received the majority of his salary from the project. The project also provided part-time support for a laboratory manager (Dr. Maryla Wasiolek).

40|$|Humans are {{continuously}} {{exposed to}} ionizing radiation from natural sources. The main contributors to natural radiation are high-energy cosmic radiation and radioactive nuclides that {{originate in the}} earth’s crust. 222 Rn, a decay product of 226 Ra, originates from the naturally occurring 238 U decay series. 222 Rn, the only gas in the 238 U decay series, is chemically inert, but is radioactive and exposure to it and its decay products constitutes about half the radiation dose received by general population. The quantity of radon that escapes from the earth depends mainly on the concentration of radium in the soil along with other factors, like the type of the soil cover, porosity, etc. With this in mind, a systematic study of radionuclide in samples of soil, rocks and water and also in ambient air was measured at about 500 locations in Mysore City, India. Radon, <b>thoron</b> and its <b>progeny</b> concentration in the atmosphere were determined using solid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTD), LR- 115 type II which were placed inside the dosimeters and were suspended at a height of 2. 5 m above the ground. The Gamma ray spectrometry method was employed to estimate the activity of 226 Ra, 232 Th and 40 K in the soil and rock samples. Radon in the soil gas and radon exhalation rates from soil and building materials were also measured using SSNTDs. A gamma ray scintillometer {{was used to measure}} the gamma absorbed dose levels. Uranium analysis in water samples was performed using a laser flurometer. Radium and Radon concentration in water samples was measured using radon bubblers and scintillation cells. Analysis of the samples found that the concentration of 222 Rn, 220 Rn and their daughters in the atmosphere occurred higher during winter and lower during summer. The geometric median activity of 226 Ra, 232 Th and 40 K in soil samples is found to be 20. 3, 64. 0 and 396. 7 Bq kg- 1; and rock samples was found to be 46. 4, 68. 7 and 634. 9 Bq kg- 1 respectively. The average gamma absorbed dose rate in dwellings varies from 46. 2 to 286. 5 nGy h– 1. Radon exhalation rates varied from 8. 3 to 196. 3 mBq m- 2 h- 1 in different types of soil and rock samples. The 222 Rn and Uranium concentrations in water samples were found to vary from 280 to 794, 170 Bq L- 1. and from 0. 3 to 635. 4 μg L- 1 respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{exposure}} of workers in two industries due to work activities involving naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORMs). Our research was intended to provide a better knowledge of working practices and to provide sufficient meaningful information regarding the estimated exposures to workers in these industries due to NORM, focusing in particular on the regulatory aspects relating to naturally occurring radioactive materials. The workers involved in the production of energy in Coal Fired Power Plants (CFPPs) and in fertilizers production in phosphate fertilizer plant (PFP) are subject to radiation exposure through internal and external pathways. In CFPPs, the inhalation of dusts containing naturally occurring radionuclides was found to be the most significant exposure pathway. The highest risk was associated with the intake via inhalation of thorium- 232, which contributes up to 41 % to the annual effective dose. Exposures to individuals resulting from inhalation of radon and <b>thoron</b> <b>progeny</b> represent only 5 %, respectively 1. 5 % from the whole dose. In PFP, the terrestrial gamma external radiation delivers the highest contribution to overall exposure of workers from natural sources (42 %), followed by radon along with its decay products (36 %).
