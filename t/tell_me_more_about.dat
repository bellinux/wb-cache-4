[...] Los Angeles Times critic Margaret Wappler comments that the [...] "minimalist dance-punk of LCD Soundsystem, the analog classicism of Simian Mobile Disco, the fanatical electro-thrash of Justice, the international amalgam of M.I.A., the agitated funk of [...] (Chk Chk Chk) and the art-schooled disco-sleaze of Cansei de Ser Sexy" [...] contributed to the thriving 'new rave' dance scene, which led to a rediscovery of indie rockers, and a critical and intellectual revolution in dance music.|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed! You {{set up for}} a {{connoisseur}} of female character. That's very common, nowadays. Why don't you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> something <b>more</b> <b>about</b> Yourself? We're always talking about me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But this Alan Fairford?' said Nanty--'come--sip up {{the drop}} of brandy, man, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> some <b>more</b> <b>about</b> him, and whether you are seeking him for good or for harm.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But be more definite," [...] she persisted. [...] "Where {{should we}} start? You are over here now on some {{important}} mission. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|STEVE, glancing in {{a mirror}} {{to make sure he}} is still the same person, 'You look a nice girl but dash it all. Whom can you be taking <b>me</b> for? <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> some <b>more</b> <b>about</b> myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay, dear girl. It is {{very very}} sad, but don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{anything}} <b>more</b> <b>about</b> your father. Tell {{it all to}} Jesus, Hetty. He not only sympathises with, but is able to save--even to the uttermost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> yourself. How was it {{that you}} had the {{wonderful}} luck to be chosen to accompany Sir Robert Wilson as his aide-de-camp?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] said Lord Pooley, [...] "I've taken a {{considerable}} responsibility, on your bare word. I {{think you ought}} to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> this." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't want {{to force}} your {{confidence}} by a hair," [...] said Father Brown, very quietly. [...] "But I {{think you could}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> that than I can tell you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Stupid! Now you're {{just trying}} to jolly me; you are; because you men aren't as fond of church as all that, I know you aren't.

6000|$|... "Well, John," [...] said I, [...] "I haven't read {{a best-seller}} {{in a long}} time. Maybe I've had notions about them {{somewhat}} like yours. But <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> yourself. Getting along all right with the company?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little by little, bit by bit," [...] he said, [...] "I am {{beginning}} {{to form a}} sort of picture of this girl, this--what was her name again? Bennett--this Miss Bennett. You have a wonderful knack of description. You make her seem so real and vivid. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> some <b>more</b> <b>about</b> her. She wasn't keen on golf, by any chance, I suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} answer you; {{but you need}} not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> any <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the Jews {{cheating}} us. Christians can cheat as well as Jews, and can rob from their {{own flesh and blood}} too. I do not care for your threats, aunt Sophie, nor for your frowns. I did care for them, but you have said that which makes it impossible that I should regard them any further." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A good deal, off and on. But it's getting chilly and I half {{expect a}} reproving lecture from Miss Hume when I go in. First, though, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> a little <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the young Canadian {{you had with}} you." ...|$|R
