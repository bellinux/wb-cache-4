5|$|A sexy belly dancer named Princess Kashmir {{arrives at}} the party and invites Homer on stage to dance with her. On {{the way to the}} {{restaurant}} bathroom, Bart wanders into the bachelor party room and eagerly snaps a picture of Homer and Kashmir. Bart brings <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> to school and gives a copy of it to Milhouse, who promptly gets requests from other students for a copy of <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> It is not long before everyone in Springfield has one and Marge sees a copy of <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> at her aerobics class and is furious. When Homer gets home that day, Marge immediately shoves <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> in his face and demands an explanation. At that point, Bart inadvertently reveals that it was his picture, angering both his parents. After sending Bart to his room, Marge emotionally kicks Homer out of the house. Homer spends the night at Barney's apartment.|$|E

5|$|Sound {{designer}} Frank Serafine, {{a longtime}} Star Trek fan, {{was invited to}} create the sound effects for <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> Given access to state-of-the-art audio equipment, Serafine saw <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> as the chance to modernize outdated motion picture sound techniques with digital technology. Owing to background noise such as camera operation, much of the ambient noise or dialogue captured on set was unusable; it was Serafine's job to create or recreate sounds to mix back into the scenes.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} the cultural {{construction of the}} Namibian landscape by tourism advertising material, treating landscape photography as a language which can be analysed through signs. Nevertheless, since signs require a consensus of communication, a contextualisation of <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> will also be madε. Therefore, bellow I will attempt firstly, to discuss the theoretical context in which <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> will be analyzed, secondly, to present the geographical context in which <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> were born and thirdly to discuss <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> as signs by locating the points de capiton within them...|$|R
