5|$|Public {{reaction}} to the Who's concerts that included Tommy was overwhelmingly positive. The touring helped keep the album in the public eye, and cleared the band's debts.

5|$|The Who first {{performed}} the song {{live at the}} opening date {{of a series of}} Lifehouse related concerts in the Young Vic theatre, London on 14 February 1971. It has subsequently been part of every Who concert since, often as the set closer and sometimes extended slightly to allow Townshend to smash his guitar or Moon to kick over his drumkit. The group performed live over the synthesizer part being played on a backing tape, which required Moon to wear headphones to hear a click track, allowing him to play in sync. It was the last track Moon played live in front of a paying audience on 21 October 1976 and the last song he ever played with the Who at Shepperton Studios on 25 May 1978, which was captured on the documentary film <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>Are</b> Alright. The song was part of the Who's set at Live Aid in 1985, Live 8 in 2005, T4 on the Beach in 2008 and Capital FM's Summertime Ball concert in 2009, 2010 and 2015 and the radio station's Jingle Bell Ball concerts in 2009 and 2015.|$|E

500|$|Moore next starred with Annette Bening in the {{independent}} film <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>Are</b> All Right (2010), a comedy–drama about a lesbian couple whose teenage children locate their sperm donor. The role of Jules Allgood was written for her by writer–director Lisa Cholodenko, who felt that Moore was the right age, adept at both drama and comedy, and confident with the film's sexual content. The actress {{was drawn to the}} film's [...] "universal" [...] depiction of married life, and committed to the project in 2005. <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>Are</b> All Right was widely acclaimed, eventually garnering an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The critic Betsy Sharkey praised Moore's performance of Jules, who she called an [...] "existential bundle of unrealized need and midlife uncertainty", writing, [...] "There are countless moments when the actress strips bare before the camera—sometimes literally, sometimes emotionally... and Moore plays every note perfectly." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Kids</b> <b>Are</b> All Right earned Moore a sixth Golden Globe Award nomination and a second BAFTA nomination for Best Actress.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea that}} the {{children}} should go to a camp run by Krusty was first suggested by David M. Stern. The animators were enthusiastic about making this episode because they had all gone to summer camps as children and {{thought it would be}} a fun episode to write for. The writers also thought that [...] "it would be fun if while <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> gone Homer and Marge find that as <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> miserable their marriage is better than ever." [...] The layout for Bart and Lisa's cabin was influenced by the director, Mark Kirkland, who as a child went to a Boy Scout camp that had exposed wires and other similar faults. Kirkland was also sure that the character Mr. Black was going to reappear later in the series, but he never did. Al Jean commented, [...] "I guess that the hydrofoil really got Mr. Black out of the show forever." ...|$|E
