25|$|In 1866, Marcus Neff hired {{attorney}} John H. Mitchell {{to complete}} some legal business, {{but failed to}} pay Mitchell's bill. Mitchell sued and received a default judgment against Neff, with Neff's property sold at auction <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> Pennoyer purchased the land from Mitchell, who had purchased the land at the sheriff's auction, and later Neff {{became aware of the}} forced sale. Neff then sued Pennoyer to regain the property in a case that became the U.S. Supreme Court case of Pennoyer v. Neff that defined legal jurisdiction for citizens residing in different states. At the trial, federal judge and Pennoyer adversary Matthew Deady ruled in favor of Neff, with the Supreme Court affirming the decision in 1877. Pennoyer was compelled to give the land back to Neff, and the property became a part of the Willamette Heights neighborhood in later years.|$|E

500|$|In July 2016, during Trump's presidential campaign, his {{opponent}} Hillary Clinton released a campaign video {{of one of}} the club's architects. The architect, Andrew Tesoro, described his dealings with the Trump Organization, where about a dozen employees met him at the finished clubhouse to negotiate reducing his fees. They pressured him into sending a reduced bill, of $50,000 instead of $140,000. After the organization failed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> Tesoro met with Trump who convinced him to accept only $25,000 for his services. The Clinton campaign used the story as part of its effort to demonstrate that the Trump Organization harms small businesses. Later during Trump's campaign, in September 2016, The Washington Post reported that a [...] painting of Trump may be on display at the club. Trump had purchased Michael Israel's work for $200,000 in 2007 through his charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation. According to IRS regulations, the painting would have to be used for a charitable purpose, or donated to a charity, however Melania Trump had planned to hang it in the club's boardroom or conference room, and the artist later stated he believed it was at the clubhouse. Although the painting was purchased at a charity auction, where half of the Trump Foundation's check went to the charity, in September 2016 an IRS director deemed Trump to have violated IRS rules and President Barack Obama publicly criticized Trump's purchase.|$|E

500|$|In July 1991, Creation {{agreed to}} {{relocate}} the production to Eastcote studio, following unexplained complaints from Shields. However, the cash-poor Creation Records was unable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> {{for their time}} at Britannia Row, and the studio refused to return the band's equipment. Dutt recalled, [...] "I don't know what excuse Kevin gave them for leaving. He had {{to raise the money}} himself to get the gear out." [...] Shields' unexpected and random behaviour, the constant delays, and studio changes were having a material effect both on Creation's finances and the health of their staff. Dutt later admitted being desperate to leave the project, while Creation's second-in-command Dick Green had a nervous breakdown around this time. Green later recalled, [...] "It was two years into the album, and I phoned Shields up in tears. I was going 'You have to deliver me this record'." [...] During this time, both Shields and Butcher became affected with tinnitus, and had to delay recording for a further number of weeks while they recovered. Concerned friends and band members suggested this was a result of the unusually loud volumes the group played at their shows. Shields dismissed these concerns as [...] "Ill-informed hysteria." [...] Although Alan McGee was still upbeat and positive about his investment, the 29-year-old Green, who by this time was opening the label's morning post [...] "shaking with fear," [...] became a concern to his co-workers. Publicist Laurence Verfaillie, aware of the label's inability to cover further studio bills, recalled Green's hair turning grey overnight. [...] "He would have not gone grey if it was not for that album," [...] Verfaillie said.|$|E

2500|$|The Venetians {{established}} an outpost on the island, which caused significant {{tension between the}} Byzantine Empire (now represented by Andronikos IV), the Genoese and the Venetians. In the Treaty of Turin of which ended the War of Chioggia between Venice and Genoa, the Venetians were to hand {{over control of the}} island to Amadeo of Savoy and the Genoese were <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for the removal of all fortifications on the island. The Treaty of Turin specified that the Venetians would destroy all the island's [...] "castles, walls, defences, houses and habitations from top to bottom 'in such fashion that the place can never be rebuilt or reinhabited". The Greek populace was not a party to the negotiations, but were to be paid for being uprooted. The baillie of Tenedos, Zanachi Mudazzo, refused to evacuate the place, and the Doge of Venice, Antonio Venier, protested the expulsion. The senators of Venice reaffirmed the treaty, the proposed solution of handing the island back to the Emperor seen as unacceptable to the Genoese. Toward the end of 1383, the population of almost 4000 was shipped out to Euboea and Crete. Buildings on the island were then razed leaving it empty. Venetians continued to use the harbor.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} February 2008, Gazprom {{threatened}} to reduce the supply of natural gas to Ukraine beginning on 3 March 2008, unless the pre-payment for 2008 was paid. The Ukrainian government said it paid for the natural gas which was consumed in 2007, but refused <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for 2008. A Gazprom spokesman claimed that the bill for [...] of gas deliveries to Ukraine valued around $600million remained unpaid. Ukraine disagreed as that debt accumulated in recent months when Russia used its own gas {{to make up for}} a shortfall in less expensive Central Asian gas. On 3 March, Gazprom cut its shipments to Ukraine by 25% and an additional 25% the next day, claiming that the $1.5billion debt still was not paid, although Ukrainian officials stated it had indeed been paid. Gas supplies were restored on 5 March after Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller and Naftohaz CEO Oleh Dubyna agreed during negotiations by phone on a settlement. On 6 March, the Ukrainian cabinet refused to execute the gas agreements made by presidents Yushchenko and Putin. The Ukrainian cabinet did not want to pay in advance for 2008, and it opposed the creation of a Naftohaz–Gazprom venture that would sell gas in Ukraine. Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko stated that Ukraine did not need any additional joint ventures, and as of 1 March 2008, UkrGazEnergo is no longer operating in Ukraine's domestic gas market.|$|E
