40|$|Report evaluates {{and compares}} three {{alternative}} approaches to hygienic containment of human wastes. Three practical means of waste collection: filter-bag collection <b>with</b> <b>compaction</b> by fan suction, canister collection <b>with</b> <b>compaction</b> by force applied to compaction cups or disks, and sleeve collection <b>with</b> <b>compaction</b> by rollers and winding on reel. Potentially useful in airplanes, buses, boats, trains, and campers and temporary toilets for construction sites and outdoor gatherings...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the sealing ability of lateral compaction and tapered single cone gutta-percha techniques in root canals prepared with stainless steel and rotary nickel titanium root canal instruments by fluid filtration method. Study design: The root canals were prepared with stainless steel (SS) and nickel titanium (NiTi) instruments. The canals prepared with SS were obturated <b>with</b> lateral <b>compaction</b> technique using. 02 tapered cones and the canals prepared with NiTi instruments were obturated <b>with</b> lateral <b>compaction</b> technique using. 02 tapered cones or 06 tapered single cones. The amount of leakage was evaluated by fluid filtration model. The results were statistically analyzed with one-way ANOVA. Results: The group prepared with NiTi instruments and filled <b>with</b> lateral <b>compaction</b> technique showed significantly less coronal leakage than the group prepared with SS instruments and filled <b>with</b> lateral <b>compaction</b> technique (p 0. 05). Conclusions: Obturation <b>with</b> lateral <b>compaction</b> of gutta-percha provides a superior coronal seal whilst canal instrumentation with engine-driven NiTi files reduces the extent of microleakage in root canals when compared with stainless steel hand instruments. Tapered single cone technique was comparable <b>with</b> lateral <b>compaction</b> technique because of easier application...|$|R

40|$|In {{the quest}} for atomic spatial and {{picosecond}} temporal resolutions, several groups have integrated an STM <b>tip</b> <b>with</b> an ultrafast optoelectronic switch that gates the tunneling current from the tip. The authors report a novel ultrafast STM tip consisting of a cleaved GaAs substrate with a 1 -{micro}m thick epilayer of low-temperature-grown GaAs (LT-GaAs) deposited on the face. since LT-GaAs has a carrier lifetime of 1 ps, the photo-excitatin of the <b>tip</b> <b>with</b> an ultrafast above-bandgap pulse provides carriers for the tunneling current and photoconductively gates the current from the <b>tip</b> <b>with</b> picoseconds time resolution.

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} can strongly affect plant {{performance as}} many other stress factors. In nature, many combinations of different stress factors may be found. We expect {{that the effects of}} soil compaction may be different depending of the occurrence of other stress. This has not been fully investigated; most studies have included only one stress factor together <b>with</b> soil <b>compaction.</b> In this study, we combine soil <b>compaction</b> <b>with</b> the interaction of shade, low water availability and mechanical stress. We use as a model system tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum), in which the effects of the combination of these factors in a greenhouse experiment were studied on their growth, biomass allocation, root morphology and anatomy. Soil compaction effects on growth and root traits depended strongly on the other factors. In unstressed conditions, plant growth increased <b>with</b> <b>compaction</b> up to 1. 4 g cm- 3 bulk density and then declined. However, at low water and under mechanical stress plant growth declined monotonically <b>with</b> <b>compaction,</b> while under shade, soil compaction had no effect on growth. Soil compaction reduced fine root proportion in all treatments except in shade condition, while it increased root diameter and xylem area only under mechanical stress. These results indicate that analyses of soil compaction effects on plant performance should take the levels of other stress factors into account. More generally, they illustrate the difficulty of interpreting effects of a given stress factor on plants as these effects tend to interact with presence of other stressor...|$|R
