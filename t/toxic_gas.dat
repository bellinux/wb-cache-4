5|$|Chlorine is a <b>toxic</b> <b>gas</b> that {{attacks the}} {{respiratory}} system, eyes, and skin. Because it is denser than air, {{it tends to}} accumulate {{at the bottom of}} poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials.|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{hydrochloric}} acid (fuming {{hydrochloric acid}}) forms acidic mists. Both the mist and the solution have a corrosive effect on human tissue, {{with the potential}} to damage respiratory organs, eyes, skin, and intestines irreversibly. Upon mixing hydrochloric acid with common oxidizing chemicals, such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach, NaClO) or potassium permanganate (KMnO4), the <b>toxic</b> <b>gas</b> chlorine is produced.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine gas {{was also}} used during the Iraq War in Anbar Province in 2007, with insurgents packing truck bombs with mortar shells and {{chlorine}} tanks. The attacks killed two people from the explosives and sickened more than 350. Most of the deaths were caused {{by the force of}} the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the <b>toxic</b> <b>gas</b> is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. In some bombings, over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties. The Iraqi authorities tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population.|$|E

In this paper, the application of electrochemical, semiconductor, catalyticFeld efSect and catalytic gas sensors for the detection of <b>toxic</b> <b>gases,</b> and the role of platinum group metals in these deoices, is discussed. It is very important that precise and rapid detection, alerting, and monitoring of <b>toxic</b> <b>gases</b> should be available to prevent or minirnise accidents involving poisoning or explosions. <b>Toxic</b> <b>gases,</b> including carbon monoxide, hydro-gen sulphide, chlorine, bromine, hydrogen chlo-ride, hydrogen fluoride, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, phosgene, benzene, formaldehyde, methyl bromide, arsine, phosphine, boranes...|$|R

The concentration of the <b>toxic</b> <b>gases</b> should be lowered before reaching ground level. It has being conceived a simple configuration including two half cylinders is potential to reduce the concentration of the <b>toxic</b> <b>gases</b> within the chimney. The split chimney is modeled and its performance under {{a wide range of}} wind speeds is evaluated. The results indicate that the split chimney does not have an ad verse affect on the discharge o f the chimney and is able to reduce the concentration of the exhaust <b>toxic</b> <b>gases</b> at all wind speeds. The results also show there is a side leakage as wind speed increases. Further studies are needed to improve the performance of the split chimney. ...|$|R
5|$|In 1991, Lundgren {{starred in}} Manny Coto's action film Cover Up {{opposite}} Louis Gossett Jr.. Lundgren portrays Mike Anderson, a tough American reporter and US Marine veteran who finds {{his own life}} in jeopardy after stumbling across a political cover-up over a Middle Eastern terrorist plan to release <b>toxic</b> <b>gas</b> and kill thousands of people. The primary terrorist group in the film is the fictional group Black October, in reference to Black September. The film was shot in Israel and Lundgren stays at the famous King David Hotel.|$|E
5|$|The film saw {{breakthrough}} in computer generated effects. About 1,950 {{of the shots}} in The Phantom Menace have visual effects. The scene in which <b>toxic</b> <b>gas</b> is released on the Jedi is the only sequence with no digital alteration. The work was so extensive that three visual effects supervisors divided the workload among themselvesJohn Knoll supervised the on-set production and the podrace and space battle sequences, Dennis Muren supervised the underwater sequence and the ground battle, and Scott Squires, alongside teams assigned for miniature effects and character animation, worked on the lightsaber effects.|$|E
5|$|The third {{mission was}} begun in 1998. It was a {{search and rescue}} mission {{requiring}} fully autonomous robots to take off, fly to a disaster area and search for survivors and the dead amid raging fires, broken water mains, clouds of <b>toxic</b> <b>gas,</b> and rubble from destroyed buildings. The scenario was recreated at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hazardous Material Management and Emergency Response (HAMMER) training facility where the above hazards could be recreated. Because of the realism of the scenario, animatrons were used instead of human actors to simulate survivors incapable of extracting themselves from the disaster area.|$|E

5|$|Evolve {{features}} {{five different}} modes: Hunt, Nest, Rescue, Defend and Arena, which have different objectives {{for both the}} Hunters and the Monster. Evolve provides two different structures to these game modes: Quick Play, which starts a single playthrough match; and Evacuation, {{which serves as a}} five-match, multiplayer story mode. In Evacuation, each match gives the winning side an advantage in the next map, such as having a <b>toxic</b> <b>gas</b> the Monster is immune to, or autonomous gun turrets to assist the Hunters. The Evacuation mode ends with a 'Defend' match. Evolve also features an Observer Mode, allowing players to watch a match without playing in the match. The spectator can jump between cameras and view the match from both the Hunters' and the Monster's perspectives.|$|E
5|$|Gibson {{eventually}} {{discovers the}} game's location and sends a SWAT team, who are sealed {{in another room}} and killed by <b>toxic</b> <b>gas.</b> Simultaneously, he and two officers infiltrate Hoffman's command center in the junkyard, where they find Dan's corpse {{sitting in front of}} several monitors connected to the police headquarter's security cameras. He sees Hoffman brought into the morgue in a body bag and tries to warn Palmer, but an automatic turret gun rises up and kills him along with his men. Hoffman kills Dr. Heffner, Palmer, and everyone else in his path to Jill, who briefly escapes before she is caught and knocked unconscious. He straps her to a chair and locks a reverse bear trap to her head; she awakens as the timer starts and is killed when the trap activates, tearing her face apart and bleeding profusely.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip. The plant officials then order the usage of the remaining methyl isocyanate as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Dilip is busy with the wedding of his sister, and Roy has a final look of the control room. The safety measures fail and a runaway reaction follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking, and an attempt to contain the leak fails. The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind. Motwani rushes to alert {{the people in the}} vicinity of the plant to vacate and head west, since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged. He meets Dilip, who ignores the warning and asks Motwani to leave the area without causing any hindrance to the wedding. Meanwhile, the guests experience irritation in the eyes and discomfort in breathing. Dilip senses the danger and visits the plant, realising that the plant had been compromised. He rushes back to his residence where he finds his family and relatives dying from acute exposure to the <b>toxic</b> <b>gas.</b> He carries away his son, paying farewell to his wife's corpse and flees the slum.|$|E

25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} involves ocean venting {{of hydrogen}} sulfide gas. Portions {{of the deep}} ocean will periodically lose all of its dissolved oxygen allowing bacteria that live without oxygen to flourish and produce hydrogen sulfide gas. If enough hydrogen sulfide accumulates in an anoxic zone, the gas can rise into the atmosphere. Oxidizing gases in the atmosphere would destroy the <b>toxic</b> <b>gas,</b> but the hydrogen sulfide would soon consume all of the atmospheric gas available. Hydrogen sulfide levels might have increased dramatically over a few hundred years. Models of such an event indicate that the gas would destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere allowing ultraviolet radiation to kill off species that had survived the <b>toxic</b> <b>gas.</b> Of course, there are species that can metabolize hydrogen sulfide.|$|E

25|$|The {{technology}} of the day did not render the hydrogen sulphide harmless.
