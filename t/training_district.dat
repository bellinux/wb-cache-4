40|$|Abstract Background The {{cornerstone}} of the health system in Zimbabwe, the district health system has been under {{the responsibility of the}} district health executive since 1984. Preliminary information obtained from some provincial health managers in Midlands Province suggested a poor performance by most district health executives. We therefore investigated the reasons for this poor performance. Methods A descriptive cross sectional study was conducted. Structured interviewer administered questionnaires were used to obtain information from district health managers of five randomly selected districts in the province. Checklists were used to assess resource availability, staffing levels and proxy indicators to effective district health executive function. Data were analysed using Epi Info statistical package. Results Thirty district health managers were interviewed. Almost half of the participants could not list at least five functions of district health executives. Twenty nine managers reported having inadequate management skills requiring <b>training.</b> <b>District</b> health executives failed to meet their targets on expected activities in the year 2010 such as conducting monthly district health executive meetings, conducting quarterly supervision to health centres and submitting quarterly district health reports to the provincial level. Conclusion Poor knowledge on expected functions could have resulted in poor performance. Without adequate management <b>training</b> <b>district</b> health managers are likely to underperform their duties. DHE guidelines were therefore distributed to all districts. Management trainings were conducted to all district health executives throughout the country from November 2011. </p...|$|E

In an attempt to decrease role confusion, the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) and Education Trust have developed the ASCA National Model and Transforming the School Counseling Profession Initiative (ASCA, 2003).

40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{demonstrated}} {{utility of}} GIS for health applications, there are perceived problems in low resource settings: GIS software {{can be expensive}} and complex; input data are often of low quality. This study aimed to test the appropriateness of new, inexpensive and simple GIS tools in poorly resourced areas of a developing country. GIS applications were trialled in pilot studies based on mapping of health resources and health indicators at the clinic and district level in the predominantly rural province of Nusa Tenggara Timur in eastern Indonesia. The pilot applications were (i) rapid field collection of health infrastructure data using a GPS enabled PDA, (ii) mapping health indicator data using open source GIS software, and (iii) service availability mapping using a free modelling tool. Results Through contextualised <b>training,</b> <b>district</b> and clinic staff acquired skills in spatial analysis and visualisation and, {{six months after the}} pilot studies, they were using these skills for advocacy in the planning process, to inform the allocation of some health resources, and to evaluate some public health initiatives. Conclusions We demonstrated that GIS can be a useful and inexpensive tool for the decentralisation of health data analysis to low resource settings through the use of free and simple software, locally relevant training materials and by providing data collection tools to ensure data reliability. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A., Education (Educational Leadership)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. IDEA 2004 {{mandates}} {{a transition}} plan {{be part of}} students with disabilities??? Individual Education Plan (IEP) {{from the age of}} 14 through the time they leave their secondary education [IDEA 2004, ?? 300. 320 (b) ]. Despite {{the letter of the law}} and transition plans being implemented, the post secondary outcomes for students with mild to moderate disabilities continue to be dismal in comparison to their general education peers (National Center for Educational Statistics [NCES], 2003). Many special education teachers at the secondary level have little to no training in the complex and critical process of planning and implementing the transition piece of the IEP (Test, 2009). The purpose of this study was to determine the level of training and involvement of secondary special education teachers in the Elk Grove Unified School District in five identified components of the Transition planning process for students with mild to moderate disabilities with an Individual Education Plan. The secondary purpose of the study was to determine what effect, if any, these teachers??? pre-service and in-service training had on their level of involvement in each category. A 35 -item questionnaire regarding Transition Involvement and Competency was distributed to all members of the target sample. The questionnaire rated secondary special educators??? levels of involvement in five identified components of a transition plan and asked respondents questions about their pre-service and in-service training regarding the five components. The results of the survey suggested secondary special education teachers are most involved in the transition planning components in which they have received the most training and least involved in those who had received little to no <b>training.</b> <b>District</b> Special Education Administrators should consider creating in-service opportunities for their secondary special educators based upon the identified components in which pre and/or in-service training was lacking. The in-service should include a handbook/guide in conjunction with the areas where competency is lacking to be used as a resource and reference. Future research should be conducted to see if the trends and correlations shown in this study have further implications with a broader sample population of secondary special educators and determine if this study???s findings can be generalized.
