5|$|Generally, each {{household}} prepares one badnjak, {{although more}} are cut in some regions. Depending {{on the local}} custom, Montenegrin Serbs may fell two, three, an arbitrary number greater than two, or the number equal to the male members of household plus one. The latter means {{that each of the}} males has a log associated with him, with the thickest log representing the head of household and the thinnest linked to the family's prosperity. If there is only one man in the household, three rather than two logs are prepared. The logs may be cut from different species of tree. In parts of the Bay of Kotor, each household prepares four sets of badnjaks, as they are burned <b>there</b> <b>not</b> only on Christmas Eve, but also on the eves of New Years Day, Epiphany, and the Feast of Saint Sava.|$|E
5|$|Nevill and June adopted Bamber {{when he was}} {{six months}} old. They sent him to St Nicholas Primary and the private Maldon Court prep school, along with Sheila, {{followed}} by Gresham's School, a boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, which he attended from September 1970. He was miserable <b>there,</b> <b>not</b> least because of bullying and a sexual assault. He left Gresham's with no qualifications, but attended sixth-form college and in 1978 passed seven O-levels. Nevill paid for him to visit Australia, where Bamber took a scuba-diving course, then New Zealand. Former friends alleged that he had broken into a jeweller's shop while in New Zealand and had stolen an expensive watch. He had also boasted, they said, {{of being involved in}} smuggling heroin.|$|E
5|$|Sallal's {{popularity}} among his troops declined, and after two bazooka attacks {{on his home}} by disaffected soldiers, he took Egyptian guards. He ordered the execution of his security chief, Colonel Abdel Kader Khatari, after Khatari's police fired into a mob attacking an Egyptian command post in San'a, and had refused to recognize the committee of Arab leaders appointed at Khartoum to arrange peace terms. He also fired his entire Cabinet and formed a new one, installing three army men in key ministries, and took over the army ministry and the foreign ministry for himself. Meanwhile, Nasser announced the release of three republican leaders who had been held prisoner in Egypt {{for more than a}} year, and who were in favor of peace with the royalists. The three were Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and General Amri. When Sallal met with Nasser in Cairo in early November, Nasser advised him to resign and go into exile. Sallal refused and went to Baghdad, hoping to get support from other Arab Socialists. As soon as he left Cairo, Nasser sent a cable to San'a, instructing his troops <b>there</b> <b>not</b> to block an attempt at a coup.|$|E

5|$|This swallow {{is legally}} {{protected}} in Jamaica, {{although it is}} presumed to be extinct <b>there.</b> <b>Not</b> known to the early settlers on the island, it {{was considered to be}} common in the 1800s, but it declined and eventually became rare in the 1890s. In {{the last half of the}} 1900s, it was restricted to the area of Cockpit Country east to the Blue Mountains. The last specimens collected were a pair from Portland Parish on 9 August 1908; the last confirmed sighting was in the Blue Mountains in 1950. It was regarded as rare from the 1960s to the 1980s, although its precarious status was not realised at the time. In 1987, the last major roosting site of this subspecies was destroyed. Birdwatchers in the Gosse Bird Club reported two probable sightings of several birds on Barbecue Bottom Road in Trelawny Parish in August and September 1982, while the last (and unconfirmed) report is of three birds at Hardwar Gap (located on the boundary between Saint Andrew and Portland parishes) on 8 June 1989.|$|E

25|$|Transhumanist {{philosophers}} {{argue that}} <b>there</b> <b>not</b> only exists a perfectionist ethical imperative {{for humans to}} strive for progress and improvement of the human condition, {{but that it is}} possible and desirable for humanity to enter a transhuman phase of existence in which humans enhance themselves beyond what is naturally human. In such a phase, natural evolution would be replaced with deliberate participatory or directed evolution.|$|E

25|$|The Parliament of the United Kingdom {{also drew}} up an {{analysis}} of the key features of Cuba's healthcare system, drawing comparisons with the state funded National Health Service (NHS).

25|$|Many Haredim who {{subscribe}} to the anti-Zionist view still immigrate to the Land of Israel. Their rationalization {{is that they do}} so only as individuals and families, but not as members of the organized mass-immigration, and that they come to the Land solely to live <b>there,</b> <b>not</b> in order to conquer it or rule over it. Such Haredim accordingly do not believe themselves to be in violation of the Three Oaths.|$|E

25|$|Not {{much was}} {{expected}} of the Drillers, nowhere {{more evident than in}} the pre-season coaches poll that had them pegged to finish 4–36. Such opinions were hardly unexpected though, as the Power were a dismal 6–34 the year prior. Even then most of the players inherited were good for little more than trade bait as the NPSL required that teams could field no more than four imports. Experienced players were very hard to come by, as not only had <b>there</b> <b>not</b> been any Canadian teams prior to provide a talent base, but there was another Canadian team entering the league that year, the Toronto Shooting Stars, and they had a head start on finding players.|$|E
25|$|Habsburg {{religious}} intolerance, once unquestioned in {{the core}} lands {{became the subject of}} more intense scrutiny by 1731 when 22,000 suspected crypto-Protestants were expelled from Salzburg and the Salzkammergut. Similar intolerance was displayed to the Jewish population in Bohemia and surrounding areas under the Familianten (Familiantengesetze) in 1726 and 1727. Worse would have followed had <b>there</b> <b>not</b> also been a realisation that there were economic consequences and that some accommodation was required to the more rationalist ideas of western Europe. Among these was cameralism which encouraged economic self-sufficiency in the nation state. Thus domestic industries such as the Linzer Wollzeugfabrik were founded and encouraged, but often such ideas were subjugated by vested interests such as aristocracy and church. Rationalist emphasis on the natural and popular were the antithesis of Habsburg elitism and divine authority. Eventually external powers forced rationalism on Austria.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the command}} of Thiệu, the siege of the barracks started, and rebel {{artillery}} shells soon reduced the buildings to rubble, but the pro-Diệm loyalists fought on, a scant five blocks from the palace. Presidential Guard tanks returned fire, severely damaging nearby roadways. After an hour, Diệm and Nhu suspected that something was amiss and attempted to call Đính's office {{for a second time}} and again were told Đính was not <b>there.</b> <b>Not</b> believing Đính had double-crossed them, the Ngô brothers were heard in the background speculating that Đính had been arrested by the rebels. The generals then phoned Gia Long Palace with an ultimatum. If Diệm resigned immediately, he and Nhu would be safely exiled. If he did not, they would launch air strikes and start shelling the palace within the hour. The generals said {{that there would be no}} negotiation, only a yes or no would be acceptable. Diệm made no reply.|$|E

500|$|When Frederick became king in 1741, {{his army}} {{was behind the}} times in artillery. [...] Not only were <b>there</b> <b>not</b> enough guns, but their quality was poor.
