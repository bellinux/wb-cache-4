5|$|Ginko {{receives}} a letter requesting his presence from Tanyu, a woman infected with a Mushi that demands her {{to write about}} Mushi to expel it. On the way, he meets Koro, a Mushishi {{who is trying to}} capture a rainbow-like Mushi. They go to the house of Tanyu, where her nanny, Tama, says that a white-haired woman told them about the Tokoyami. When Tanyu tried <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> she was afflicted by paralysis and gangrene. Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, Greeley {{traveled}} {{across the}} continent to see the West for himself, <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for the Tribune, and to publicize {{the need for a}} transcontinental railroad. He also planned to give speeches to promote the Republican Party. He went to Chicago, then to Lawrence in Kansas Territory, and was unimpressed by the local people. Greeley took one of the first stagecoaches to Denver, seeing the town then in course of formation as a mining camp of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Sending dispatches back to be published in the Tribune, Greeley took the Overland Trail, reaching Salt Lake City, where he conducted a two-hour interview with the Mormon leader, Brigham Young, the first newspaper interview Young had given. Greeley encountered Native Americans, and was sympathetic, but like many of his time, deemed Indian culture inferior. In California, he explored widely and gave many addresses.|$|E

25|$|Roland and his ka-tet {{travel to}} Thunderclap, {{then to the}} nearby Devar-Toi, to stop a group of psychics known as Breakers who are {{allowing}} their telepathic abilities {{to be used to}} break away at the beams that support the Tower. Ted Brautigan and Dinky Earnshaw assist the gunslingers with information and weapons, and reunite Roland with his old friend Sheemie Ruiz from Mejis. The Gunslingers free the Breakers from their captors, but Eddie is wounded after the battle and dies a short while later. Roland and Jake pause to mourn and then jump to Maine of 1999 along with Oy, in order {{to save the life of}} Stephen King (whom he writes to be an omniscient secondary character in the book); the ka-tet have come to believe that the success of their quest depends on King surviving <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> through his books.|$|E
25|$|Sales of The Yellow Tape were jump-started {{when the}} band {{was taken off the}} bill for the 1991 New Year's Eve concert in Nathan Phillips Square outside Toronto City Hall because a staffer for then-mayor June Rowlands saw the band's name and felt it {{objectified}} women; the decision was further affirmed by city councillor Chris Korwin-Kuczynski. The band shrugged it off and booked another show at McMaster University. However, the media got wind of the story and decided <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> as an example of political correctness gone too far. The first article earned the paper a large quantity of mail against City Hall's decision. The story became more and more prominent until about a week after New Years, when {{the band was}} asked to take a photo in front of City Hall for {{the front page of the}} Toronto Star. The stories targeted Rowlands even though she had not been directly involved in the decision to remove the band from the concert, but in fact had been out of town at the time. The following week, sales of the Yellow Tape exploded — by February 1992, it was outselling even Michael Jackson's Dangerous, Genesis' We Can't Dance and U2's Achtung Baby in some downtown Toronto record stores. They received enough publicity from the incident that MuchMusic offered them its second-ever Intimate and Interactive special on January 17. The tape eventually became the first ever indie release to achieve platinum status (100,000 copies) in Canada.|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt was {{so deeply}} {{affected}} by this tragedy that he begins the chapter with a regret that he had <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at all. [...] "To attempt to give {{a description of the}} play itself or its effect upon the mind, is mere impertinence". Yet what he did write {{turned out to be a}} major piece of literary criticism that contributed to his general concepts about tragedy and poetry, and made a powerful impression on the poet John Keats.|$|E

500|$|In October 1866 Massenet and Ninon were married; {{their only}} child, Juliette, {{was born in}} 1868. Massenet's musical career was briefly {{interrupted}} by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, during which {{he served as a}} volunteer in the National Guard alongside his friend Bizet. He found the war so [...] "utterly terrible" [...] that he refused <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in his memoirs. He and his family were trapped in the Siege of Paris but managed to get out before the horrors of the Paris Commune began; the family stayed for some months in Bayonne, in southwestern France.|$|E
500|$|Manning's {{other works}} {{have largely been}} {{described}} as precursors to the two trilogies. Her pre-war novel, The Wind Changes (1937), set in Ireland, anticipates the future works in its [...] "subtle exploration of relationships {{against a backdrop of}} war." [...] Her post-war works, which are alternately set at home and abroad, are considered first, less than successful steps in clarifying her ideas about an expatriate war and how <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Novels and stories set in England and Ireland are permeated by staleness and discontent, while those set abroad highlight the excitement and adventure of her later works. Two books set in Jerusalem, The Artist Among the Missing (1949) and School for Love (1951), her first commercial and critical success, are also first steps in exploring themes such war, colonialism and British imperialism.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Forget" [...] {{was written}} by Lovato along with the Jonas Brothers, who {{produced}} it with John Fields. The song features Dorian Crozier and Michael Bland on drums, and Fields on bass, guitars and keyboards. Nick Jonas also played the guitar and percussion on the song. The song is registered as [...] "Did You Forget" [...] with the Broadcast Music, Inc. Lovato has stated that [...] "Don't Forget" [...] {{is one of the}} songs on Don't Forget that she relates to the most, and that she felt [...] "a lot of emotion while recording it". In an interview with PopEater, she elaborated, [...] "Everyone goes through the experience of falling in love, but then the other person just walks away, and goes somewhere else. I went through an experience like that and wanted <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I got over it, and now a year later I don't have those feelings about that person anymore." [...] The song and [...] "La La Land" [...] were included as bonus tracks on European editions of her sophomore album Here We Go Again.|$|E
50|$|Gorky {{emphasized}} the importance of writers knowing and experiencing the Soviet Union’s development prior <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Following that method, the authors of The I.V. Stalin White Sea - Baltic Sea Canal visited the canal zone to experience the reality of its construction. Although the reality they saw was manipulated, once on the site they could gather the raw materials related to the industrialization project and use that first-hand knowledge to document and create a history. Within that history, Gorky placed greater emphasis on the social and cultural consequences of the canal project rather than its economic motivation. Thus, the volume highlights the personal narratives of prison inmates and tracks the pedagogical elements of the labor camps.|$|R

500|$|Another Hemingway scholar, Jim Berloon, {{disagrees with}} Tetlow, writing that its only unity {{consists}} of similarities in tone and {{style and the}} recurrence of the Nick Adams character. Although the first vignettes share a common thread about the war, each is distinctly framed, weakening any structural unity that might have existed. He blames the war, {{saying that it was}} too hard for Hemingway <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> cohesively, that it was [...] "too large, terrible, and mentally overwhelming to grasp in its entirety". Instead, he says, Hemingway wrote fragments, [...] "discrete glimpses into hell... like the wreckage of battle lit up from a shell burst at night." [...] The structure apparent in the 1924 collection of vignettes is lost in the later edition because the short stories seem to bear little if any relationship to the interchapters, shattering the carefully constructed order. The sense of discordance is intensified because the action is about unnamed men and soldiers, only referred to with pronouns, and unspecified woundings. The characters are transformed through circumstances and settings, where danger exists overtly, on the battlefield, or, in one case, by a chance sexual encounter in a Chicago taxi.|$|E

2500|$|He {{wrote about}} politics, art, literature, and history. His {{literary}} reputation introduced {{him into the}} most influential literary and political salons in Paris. He met Stendhal, the Prussian geographer [...] Alexander Von Humboldt, the famed banker Jacques Laffitte, the author and historian Prosper Mérimée, the painter François Gérard; {{he was the first}} journalist to write a glowing review for a young new painter, Eugene Delacroix. When a revolution broke out in Spain in 1822, he traveled as far as the Pyrenees <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He soon he collected and published a volume of his articles, the first on the salon of 1822, the second on his trip to the Pyrenees. He was very well paid by Johann Friedrich Cotta, the part-proprietor of the Constitutionnel. [...] Most important for his future career, he was introduced to Talleyrand, the former foreign minister of Napoleon, who became his political guide and mentor. Under the tutelage of Talleyrand, Thiers became an active [...] member of the circle of opponents of the Bourbon regime, which included the financier Lafitte and the Marquis de Lafayette.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{time after}} {{getting up and}} being {{attended}} to again by the aforementioned personnel, TV cameras showed a lingering shot of Foley smiling through his profusely bleeding mouth and lips, with a loose tooth hanging beneath his nose; the tooth having been knocked out due to being struck by the chair which had fallen through the cage and landed on his face, dislocating his jaw. Foley was actually trying to show {{a hole in his}} bottom lip by sticking his tongue through it, but it could not be seen clearly through his beard. The match continued for a while longer, ending with Foley receiving the Tombstone Piledriver after being slammed by The Undertaker onto hundreds of thumbtacks, which Foley himself had strewn onto the ring canvas. Although Foley lost, both wrestlers received a standing ovation for the match, and the event is often said to have jump-started Foley's main event career (Foley has said that although this match grew in legend, the reality was that his career remained [...] "somewhat sluggish" [...] for sometime afterwards until Foley further developed the Mankind character, and fans began to catch on). Many future matches attempted to replicate some of the spots from this match. In his autobiography Have a Nice Day! A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks, Foley wrote that he could not remember much of what happened, and he had to watch a tape of the match <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The match was voted Pro Wrestling Illustrateds Match of the Year for 1998. Although many fans regard the match as a classic, it has generated controversy as well. Critics charge that the falls in the match were so extreme and they set the bar for further bumps so high that the inevitable attempts to equal or surpass them would be very dangerous for any wrestlers involved.|$|E

500|$|Beginning his review, Buddy TV's Oscar Dahl {{declared}} Andy was [...] "one of {{the most}} devastatingly annoying characters on television". Dahl liked Dwight's scenes at Staples, and wrote that series was becoming [...] "more and more difficult <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>about.</b> <b>It's</b> really funny. Consistently funny. Great episodes, week after week, breed {{little in the way}} of discussion [...] We have to appreciate greatness while it's here. The Office is in the midst of a historic run of consistently great episodes. Bask in it." [...] AOL TV writer Michael Sciannamea agreed with Dahl's initial assessment of Andy, and called him the [...] "most obnoxious sitcom character in the last few years". Sciannamea enjoyed seeing more of Angela's and Michael's personalities, and believed Andy was a [...] "short-timer" [...] to the series.|$|R
