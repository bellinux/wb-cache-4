After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told.

Sister Jude knows her to be the Angel of Death, but {{questions}} her about why she has appeared now, instead of the many other times when she attempted suicide: the night her husband left her after she {{told him he had}} infected her with syphilis, leaving her barren, or the night she committed the hit-and-run.

2500|$|According to medieval copies (the {{earliest}} copies {{from the}} 15th century) of the Gospel of Barnabas it was Judas, not Jesus, who was crucified on the cross. This work states that Judas's appearance was transformed {{to that of}} Jesus', when the former, out of betrayal, led the Roman soldiers to arrest Jesus who by then was ascended to the heavens. This transformation of appearance was so identical that the masses, followers of Christ, and even the Mother of Jesus, Mary, initially thought that the one arrested and crucified was Jesus himself. The gospel then mentions that after three days since burial, Judas' body was stolen from his grave, and then the rumors spread of Jesus being risen from the dead. When Jesus was informed in the third heaven about what happened, he prayed to God to {{be sent back to}} the earth, and descended and gathered his mother, disciples, and followers, and told <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> of what happened.

2500|$|That the {{ordinances}} were enacted [...] "'because of,' {{not merely}} 'in spite of'", their suppression of Santería religious practice is {{revealed by the}} events preceding enactment of the ordinances. The minutes and taped excerpts of the June 9 session, {{both of which are}} in the record, evidence significant hostility exhibited by residents, members of the city council, and other city officials toward the Santería religion and its practice of animal sacrifice. The public crowd that attended the June 9 meetings interrupted statements by council members critical of Santería with cheers and the brief comments of Pichardo with taunts. When Councilman Martinez, a supporter of the ordinances, stated that in pre-revolution Cuba [...] "people were put in jail for practicing this religion", the audience applauded. Other statements by members of the city council were in a similar vein. For example, Councilman Martinez, after noting his belief that Santería was outlawed in Cuba, questioned, [...] "if we could not practice this [...] in our homeland , why bring it to this country?" [...] Councilman Cardoso said that Santería devotees at the Church [...] "are in violation of everything this country stands for." [...] Various Hialeah city officials made comparable comments. The chaplain of the Hialeah Police Department told the city council that Santería was a sin, [...] "foolishness", [...] "an abomination to the Lord", and the worship of [...] "demons." [...] He advised the city council that [...] "We need to be helping people and sharing with <b>them</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> that is found in Jesus Christ." [...] He concluded: [...] "I would exhort you [...] [...] [...] not to permit this Church to exist." [...] The city attorney commented that Resolution 87-66 indicated that [...] "This community will not tolerate religious practices which are abhorrent to its citizens...." [...] Similar comments were made by the deputy city attorney. This history discloses the object of the ordinances to target animal sacrifice by Santería worshippers because of its religious motivation.|$|E
