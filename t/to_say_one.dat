5|$|The next day, Bart {{plans to}} reveal what he witnessed, but Seymour and Edna {{fear that they}} would be fired if anyone found out and they swear him to secrecy. They hire him as their gofer so they can {{secretly}} exchange messages. Bart agrees for a while because the reward for his cooperation is that Milhouse will inherit Bart's poor school record. Eventually, Bart grows frustrated about his home, school and social life continually being interrupted to help them advance their relationship, putting him in embarrassing situations. One afternoon at school, after he is embarrassed in front of his classmates by having <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> of Seymour's messages to Edna out loud, Bart bitterly gathers the entire school in front of a janitor's closet and he opens the door to reveal that Seymour and Edna are making out.|$|E
500|$|The Nyaya school {{criticized the}} Jain {{doctrine}} of anekantavada, states Karl Potter, as [...] "wanting <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> thing at one time, {{the other at}} another", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction. The Naiyayikas states that {{it makes no sense}} to simultaneously say, [...] "jiva and ajiva are not related" [...] and [...] "jiva and ajiva are related". Jains state that jiva attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of anekantavada makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya Hindu texts.|$|E
2500|$|The Bowery, {{former home}} to the punk-rock nightclub CBGB that closed in 2006, was once known for its many {{homeless}} shelters, drug rehabilitation centers and bars.

2500|$|The phrase [...] "On the Bowery", {{which has}} since fallen into disuse, was a generic way <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> was down-and-out.

2500|$|When it {{is deemed}} {{that there has}} been little or no interference, or that it is {{impossible}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> way or the other, the rules provide that no let is to be allowed, in the interests of continuity of play and the discouraging of spurious appeals for lets. [...] Because of the subjectivity in interpreting the nature and magnitude of interference, the awarding (or withholding) of lets and strokes is often controversial.|$|E
2500|$|By {{his second}} wife, Claudia Marcella Major, {{he may have}} had a daughter, whose {{existence}} remains unclear, but this hypothetical figure is referred to as [...] "Vipsania Marcella". It is possible that this daughter may have been a second daughter by Caecilia Attica, but there is no information <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> way or the other. The existence of this daughter rests solely on Publius Quinctilius Varus being mentioned as the son-in-law of Agrippa in Augustus' funeral oration for Agrippa.|$|E

Novak responded: [...] "I told Mr. Isikoff... that I do not identify my sources on any subject if they're on a confidential basis until they identify themselves...

2500|$|At the Atkin, Harris was {{examined}} by a doctor, who issued a preliminary diagnosis of apoplexy. Later in the evening, four other doctors arrived, including Harris's brother-in-law, John Fouche. These doctors rejected the initial diagnosis, and suggested a possible morphine overdose. Around 10:00 PM, Harris briefly regained consciousness, and managed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> final word: [...] "poisoned". He died shortly afterward, {{with the official}} cause listed as [...] "unknown." [...] No copy of his manuscript, High Times and Hard Times, has ever been found.|$|E
2500|$|Two of the book's early admirers were Sir Walter Scott (who {{called it}} [...] "positively beautiful") and Lord Byron (who {{said of the}} book, [...] "I know it by heart"). Years later, poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow said The Sketch Book {{was one of the}} {{earliest}} works to excite his interest in literature. As he said, [...] "Every reader has his first book; I mean <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>one</b> book among all others which in early youth first fascinates his imagination, and at once excites and satisfies the desires of his mind... To me, this first book was The Sketch Book of Washington Irving".|$|E

5000|$|Speakers of Wu {{varieties}} are mostly unaware of this term for their speech since the term [...] "Wu" [...] {{is a relatively}} recent classificatory imposition on what are less clearly defined and highly heterogeneous natural forms. <b>Saying</b> <b>one</b> speaks Wu is akin <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>one</b> speaks a Romance language.

[...] During an event held for the annual community rights day at the Knesset, Netanyahu proclaimed that he was [...] "asked to come here in the middle of my busy schedule <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> thing to the male and female members of the LGBT community: We must be guided by the conviction that every person is created in the image of God." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{wording of}} the {{proposed}} advert caused considerable debate among atheists and Christians alike and Sherine discussed it in a post-launch article, [...] "Probably the best atheist bus campaign ever", on the Guardian's [...] "Comment Is Free" [...] section. Dawkins stated that he preferred the wording [...] "There is almost certainly no God". Ariane Sherine claims {{it is necessary to}} be factually accurate, and that as it is impossible to disprove the existence of God it is only possible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> 'probably' does not exist. Critic D. J. Taylor felt that this qualification let the campaign down, but admired it for introducing some tentativeness into an often polarised debate, while atheists including A. C. Grayling think that they can be certain there is no God and therefore the word 'probably' should not be used. It was also suggested that inserting the word would avoid a breach of the Advertising Standards Authority's rules.|$|E
2500|$|Bahá'u'lláh wrote three {{obligatory}} prayers — the short, {{the medium}} {{and the long}} — and Bahá'ís are free to choose <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> of the three each day. [...] The short and the medium prayer have to be said at specific times; the short has to be said once between noon and sunset and the medium has to be said three times daily: once between dawn and noon, once between noon and sunset and once between sunset and two hours after sunset. The long prayer can be said {{at any time in}} the day. The medium and long prayers also include movements and gestures during the prayers, which are themselves obligatory except when a person is physically incapable of performing them. Shoghi Effendi has written that the motions and gestures are symbolic and are used to help maintain concentration during the prayers. Furthermore, the obligatory prayer is to be preceded by ablutions, the cleaning of the hands and face, and one has to face the Qiblih, which is the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh.|$|E

2500|$|At the Battle of Gettysburg, Baxter's I Corps brigade arrived {{around noon}} just as Confederate Maj. Gen. Robert Rodes's 8,000 man {{division}} {{began to appear}} on Oak Hill. Baxter's brigade advanced far beyond the nearest Federal brigade on the right flank {{of the line and}} deployed in a V shaped formation along the Mummasburg Road. Rodes's division attacked piecemeal, and scores of Colonel Edward A. O'Neal's men were mowed down. Shortly afterward, a Confederate brigade under Colonel Alfred Iverson advanced without skirmishers and moved past Baxter's men, who were hidden behind a stone wall. Suddenly, the men of Baxter's brigade rose up and delivered a lethal fire into the North Carolinians. In one of the most one-sided exchanges during the war, Baxter's surprise attack killed, wounded and captured 758 of 1300 men in Confederate Iverson's brigade and eliminated it as an effective fighting force in under ten minutes. Running low on ammunition, Baxter's men withdrew to the north end of Cemetery Ridge, having lost all of the officers on Baxter's staff and close to half the brigade in defense of the I Corps right flank. He received glowing praise from his division commander, Maj. Gen. John C. Robinson, and a subordinate wrote that, [...] "I wish <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> word outside of my regiment in regard to Generals Baxter and Robinson. They were on every part of the field, encouraging and stimulating the men by their presence and bravery." ...|$|E
