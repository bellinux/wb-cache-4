5|$|Washington's second inauguration {{took place}} in the Senate Chamber of Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the first at this site) on March 4, 1793. The presidential oath of office was {{administered}} by Supreme Court associate justice William Cushing. Washington's inaugural address was just 135 words, the shortest to date. This inauguration was brief and simple, a sharp contrast to the extravaganza four years earlier, which, in the eyes of many, had all <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> a monarchical coronation.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the {{territory}} gained its first representative in the Parliament, although at first with limited speaking and voting rights. In 1974 it gained a fully elected, but still advisory House of Assembly. In 1988 it gained <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> self-government with a Legislative Assembly {{with most of}} the powers and responsibilities of an Australian state, although subject to a federal right of veto, similar to the arrangements adopted for the Northern Territory in 1978. The Legislative Assembly legalised some things that were prohibited in other parts of Australia, such as prostitution and X-rated pornography; in 2006, an attempt to allow civil unions for same-sex couples was overruled by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Nicholson was {{at first}} seen as an {{improvement}} over the Catholic Thomas Dongan, the outgoing governor. However, the province's old guard was unhappy that Andros removed all of the provincial records to Boston, and then Nicholson alarmed the sometimes hardline Protestant population by preserving <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> the chapel in Fort James that Dongan and the handful of New York's Catholics had used for worship. In response to a rumored Dutch invasion of England (a rumor {{that turned out to}} be true), Nicholson in January 1689 ordered the provincial militias to be on alert to protect the province for the king. Unknown to Nicholson, events in England had already changed things.|$|E

5|$|Throughout Battleship Division Nine's {{time with}} the Grand Fleet, combating boredom was a {{constant}} difficulty. Located at the northeastern tip of Scotland, the islands surrounding Scapa Flow {{were little more than}} barren, cold, windswept specks of land devoid of <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> civilization. Due to the efforts of the officers to keep their men entertained, however, morale remained high throughout the war. The British worked hard to turn the anchorage into a more inviting place. Central to these efforts were sporting events. The Fleet held numerous inter-ship competitions, including soccer, rugby, rowing, track, and boxing, which were followed with intense interest by the men of the respective ships.|$|E
5|$|Read {{retired from}} {{military}} life on 20 March 1975 and was succeeded by Air Marshal James Rowland, {{who later became}} Governor of New South Wales. Considered disdainful of bureaucracy and some of <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> high office, Read refused to sit for the traditional portrait painted of former Chiefs of the Air Staff. As CAS during the Whitlam Labor government, which was generally antipathetic to imperial knighthoods, he was not raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) until the 1976 Queen's Birthday Honours, after the Liberal Party under Malcolm Fraser had been returned to power. Originally from Vaucluse, in Sydney's east, by 2010 Read was living in Safety Beach, on the New South Wales Mid North Coast. He died at Woolgoolga and District Retirement Village on 17September 2014.|$|E
5|$|Segrè was {{appointed}} {{assistant professor of}} physics at the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of the Via Panisperna boys. In 1934, he met Elfriede Spiro, a Jewish woman whose family had come from Ostrowo in West Prussia, but had fled to Breslau when that part of Prussia became part of Poland after World War I. After the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933, she had emigrated to Italy, where she worked as a secretary and an interpreter. At first she did not speak Italian well, and Segrè and Spiro conversed in German, in which he was fluent. The two were married at the Great Synagogue of Rome on 2 February 1936. He agreed with the rabbi to spend the minimal amount on the wedding, giving the balance of what would be spent on a luxury wedding to Jewish refugees from Germany. The rabbi managed to give them many of <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> a luxury wedding anyway. The couple had three children: Claudio, born in 1937, Amelia Gertrude Allegra, born in 1937, and Fausta Irene, born in 1945.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, social parvenus {{who took}} on <b>the</b> {{external}} <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> noble classes (such as {{the wearing of}} a sword) were severely criticised, sometimes by legal action; laws on sumptuous clothing worn by bourgeois existed since the Middle Ages.|$|R

25|$|Rawat {{inherited}} the first organization he {{was associated with}} (Divine Light Mission) from his father. Moving away from <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> Indian culture and religion, he later established Elan Vital and Words of Peace International, independent of culture, beliefs and lifestyles, and not bound to the traditions of India. The Prem Rawat Foundation (TPRF) founded in 2001, added more focus to humanitarian efforts.|$|E
25|$|Debendranath Tagore {{took over}} the reins of the Brahmo Samaj in 1843 and not only resurrected it but also enriched it in many ways. It became the {{inspiration}} for the Bengal Renaissance. It was he who gave the Brahmo movement <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> a separate faith and introduced its own unique rituals. The Brahmo Samaj cast a very wide-ranging influence on its parent Hindu society, much wider than its limited membership would ostensibly permit.|$|E
25|$|The ministeriales {{were not}} legally free people, but held social rank. Legally, their liege lord {{determined}} whom they could {{or could not}} marry, {{and they were not}} able to transfer their lords' properties to heirs or spouses. They were, however, considered members of the nobility since that was a social designation, not a legal one. Ministeriales were trained knights, held military responsibilities and surrounded themselves with <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> knighthood, and so were accepted as noblemen.|$|E
50|$|After {{the party}} was coopted by General Francisco Franco and {{consolidated}} with the Carlists, it ceased to have a fascist character (to the extent Fascism is considered revolutionary) inasmuch as Franco was a Monarchist, although it retained many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> external <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> fascism.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, her {{depiction}} on this doorway {{also gives}} her <b>the</b> full <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> royalty, including <b>the</b> false beard of the pharaoh.

2500|$|His {{review of}} the film {{is one of the few}} to go into {{detailed}} comparison with the novel.

25|$|Alice Crocker Lloyd (December 9, 1893 – March 3, 1950) was {{not only}} the University of Michigan's longest serving Dean of Women, but also a {{trailblazer}} in progressive educational programs and ideals for young women at the time. She proved to be both a confidante and advisor to her students, but also cautioned against falling into <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> social life that could be found in the collegiate experience. In many ways her advice is still relevant to women seeking an education today.|$|E
25|$|Riis emphatically {{supported}} {{the spread of}} wealth to lower classes through improved social programs and philanthropy, but his personal opinion of the natural causes for poor immigrants' situations tended to display <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> a racist ideology. Several chapters of How the Other Half Lives for example, open with Riis' observations {{of the economic and}} social situations of different ethnic and racial groups via indictments of their perceived natural flaws; often prejudices that may well have been informed by scientific racism.|$|E
25|$|As {{the number}} of shops grew, they {{underwent}} a transformation. <b>The</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> a modern shop, which had been entirely absent from the sixteenth and early seventeenth century store, gradually made way for store interiors that are more familiar to modern shops. Prior to the eighteenth century, there were no counters, display cases, chairs, mirrors, changing-rooms, etc. However, the opportunity for the customer to browse merchandise, touch and feel products began to be available, with retail innovations from the late 17th and early 18th centuries.|$|E
50|$|Feuillade {{had made}} two earlier serials, Fantômas and Les Vampires, about cunning criminals. Though popular with audiences, the serials both drew {{criticism}} for glorifying outlaws. Feuillade answered these concerns by creating the hero Judex, who had <b>the</b> sinister <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flamboyant villains so popular at the time.|$|R

60|$|The {{merchant}} nodded, and, {{turning to}} a great chest, produced <b>the</b> unemblazoned <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> a slave. These Vas Kor immediately donned.

25|$|Although {{he is not}} {{considered}} part of the Third Dynasty of Ur, Ishbi-Erra did make some attempts at continuing <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> that dynasty, most likely to justify his rule. Ishbi-Erra had ill luck expanding his kingdom, however, for other city-states in Mesopotamia rose to power as well. Eshnunna and Ashur were developing into powerful centers. However, he did succeed in repulsing the Elamites from the Ur region. This gave the Isin dynasty control over the culturally significant cities of Ur, Uruk, and the spiritual center of Nippur.|$|E
25|$|After {{the success}} of Dresden, Butcher {{returned}} to the traditional fantasy genre with his second series, Codex Alera. The series chronicles {{the life of a}} young man named Tavi from the Calderon Valley of Alera on the world of Carna. The people of Alera have grown complacent with <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> empire (the story is based loosely on the late Roman Empire) and their control of powerful elemental forces known as furies. On March 3, 2003, Jim Butcher announced that Ace won a bidding war against rival publisher Del Rey Books for the rights to the series.|$|E
25|$|The {{opponents of}} the theory argue that Raj Darbhanga was never a kingdom but rather a zamindari with all <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> princely state. The rulers of Raj Darbhanga were the largest landowners in India, and thus were called Raja, and later Maharaja and Maharajadhiraja. However they were never given the status of ruling prince. Further, after conquest of Bengal and Bihar, the British Raj {{initiated}} the Permanent Settlement, and the Raja of Darbhanga was recognised only as a Zamindar. Raj Darbhanga also paid yearly lagan (land tax) to old existing Zamindar of Darbhanga, Kachari at Khan Sahib ki deaorhi.|$|E

25|$|Despite a {{rough terrain}} and a harsh climate, Sonora, {{like the rest}} of the {{northern}} Mexico, is rich in mineral resources. This has led to a history of self-reliance, and many see themselves as the heirs to a pioneering tradition. A large part of this is linked to the vaquero or cowboy tradition, as much of the state’s economy has traditionally been linked to livestock. Sonorans and other norteños (northerners) have a reputation for being hard working and frugal, and being more individualistic and straightforward than other Mexicans. Although most people in the state are employed in industry and tourism, <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> the cowboy, jeans, cowboy hats and pickup trucks, are still very popular.|$|E
25|$|Following the Revolution, {{there was}} a policy of {{removing}} all Imperial emblems from the palace, including those on the stonework, plaster-work and iron work. During the Soviet era, many of the palace's remaining treasures were dispersed around the museums and galleries of the Soviet Union. Some were sold for hard currency while others were given away to visiting dignitaries. As the original contents disappeared and other items from sequestered collections began to be displayed in the palace, the distinctions between the rooms' original and later use have become blurred. While some rooms have retained their original names, and some even <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> Imperial Russia, such as the furnishings of the Small and Large Throne Rooms, many other rooms are known by {{the names of their}} new contents, such as The Room of German Art.|$|E
25|$|Assad began {{planning}} to seize power {{shortly after the}} failed Syrian military intervention in the Jordanian Black September crisis, a power struggle between the PLO and the Hashemite monarchy. While Assad had been in de facto command of Syrian politics since 1969, Jadid and his supporters still held <b>the</b> <b>trappings</b> <b>of</b> power. After attending Nasser's funeral, Assad returned to Syria for the Emergency National Congress (held on 30 October). At the congress Assad was condemned by Jadid and his supporters, {{the majority of the}} party's delegates. However, before attending the congress Assad ordered his loyal troops to surround the building housing the meeting. Criticism of Assad's political position continued in a defeatist tone, with the majority of delegates believing that they had lost the battle. Assad and Tlass were stripped of their government posts at the congress; these acts had little practical significance.|$|E
50|$|Two {{centuries of}} Gothic control of Iberia {{incrementally}} suppressed the ancient institutions, classic learning, and manners of the Roman Empire.

Arianism meanwhile took deep root among the Visigoths as the form of Christianity that they received.|$|R
