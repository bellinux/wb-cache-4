40|$|The {{techniques}} {{used for the}} investigation of a patient with lung carcinoma {{are determined by the}} mode of presentation of the disease. The first step is based on the clinical examination and the chest X-ray (frontal and lateral view). The pathological examination of the tumor represents the second step. Depending on the operability of the patient {{at this stage of the}} investigation, further evaluation will (or will not) be performed to determine the extension of the tumor, using TNM staging system. Any candidate for surgery has to be bronchoscoped in order to evaluate the endobronchial spread of the tumor and to look for additional lesions. <b>Transverse</b> <b>tomography</b> of the thorax is the central part of any staging procedure. The choice among the other methods of investigation depends on the site of the tumor in the thorax. Mediastinoscopy is only needed in case of a lesion of unknown nature located in the anterior mediastinum or in addition to CT scan when there is a suspicion of mediastinal involvement. Transthoracic needle aspiration is best performed on peripheral lesions. In small cell lung carcinoma, the preoperative work-up should be very systematic even in the absence of clinical or laboratory abnormality. Whereas in certain cases the investigation of a patient with lung carcinoma can be limited to a clinical examination and a chest X-ray, any candidate for surgery has to be submitted to a detailed TNM staging...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To predict which {{intercostal}} artery supplies a tumor {{by examining}} the spatial relationship between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the intercostal artery feeding the tumor on <b>transverse</b> computed <b>tomography</b> (CT) images. Materials and Methods: Between January 2000 and September 2009, 46 intercostal arteries supplying HCCs smaller than 4 cm were noted in 44 patients, and CT scans and angiograms of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. The intercostal artery feeding the tumor was marked on the CT scan showing {{the center of the}} tumor. In addition, its spatial relationship with the tumor center was examined. The angle of the tumor location was measured on the transverse CT scan in the clockwise direction from the sagittal line on the virtual circle centered in the right hemithorax.

Results: Of 46 intercostal arteries feeding HCC, 39 (85 %) were the first ones observed from the tumor center in a counterclockwise direction on the transverse CT image containing the tumor center. The level of the tumor-feeding intercostal artery was significantly correlated with the angle of the tumor, as the posteriorly located tumor tends to be supplied by lower intercostal arteries, while the laterally located tumor by upper intercostal arteries (Spearman coefficient =- 0. 537; p < 0. 001) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{review article}} {{presents}} several pitfalls {{and limitations of}} image interpretation of anatomical risk factors for patellar instability. The most important imaging examinations for the work-up of patients with patellar instability are the true lateral radiograph and <b>transverse</b> computed <b>tomography</b> (CT) or MR images of the knee. Primary anatomical risk factors are an insufficient medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), patella alta, trochlear dysplasia, increased distance from the tibial tuberosity to the trochlear groove (TTTG), and torsional limb parameters. Limitations of the Caton-Deschamps index {{are related to the}} clear identification of the patellar and tibial articular margin. Classification of trochlear dysplasia according to the Dejour system on radiographs and MR images revealed a weak reliability. The comparability of TTTG values obtained on CT and MR images at various flexion angles and different varus alignments of the knee is limited. Thus MRI performed with a dedicated knee coil may underestimate the TTTG distance compared with CT images. Increased lateral patellar tilt is a consequence of primary anatomical risk factors rather than an independent anatomical risk factor for patellar instability. The pretest likelihood of a torn MPFL on MR images is very high after an acute episode of lateral patellar dislocation. Surgical restoration of the patellofemoral joint stability addresses the complex multifactorial biomechanics by a custom-made management such as MPFL reconstruction, sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty, as well as medialization and distalization of the tibial tubercle. Quantification of anatomical risk factors for patellar instability in each person is important for highly individual treatment...|$|R

Materials and Methods: This study included 106 woman {{suspected of having}} adnexal torsion who underwent CT with coronal reformations and subsequent surgical exploration. Two readers independently recorded the CT findings, such as the thickening of a fallopian tube, twisting of the adnexal pedicle, eccentric smooth wall thickening of the torsed adnexal mass, eccentric septal thickening of the torsed adnexal mass, eccentric poor enhancement of the torsed adnexal mass, uterine deviation to the twisted side, ascites or infiltration of pelvic fat, and the overall impression of adnexal torsion with a transverse scan alone or combined with coronal reformation and a transverse scan. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were used to compare diagnostic performance. Results: Fifty-two patients were confirmed to have adnexal torsion. The addition of coronal reformations to the transverse scan improved AUCs for readers 1 and 2 from 0. 74 and 0. 75 to 0. 92 and 0. 87, respectively, for detecting adnexal torsion (p < 0. 001 and p = 0. 004, respectively).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural {{effusion}} (MPE) {{is a common}} complication of lung cancer. One widely used treatment for MPE is Endostar, a recombined humanized endostatin based treatment. However, the mechanism of this treatment is still unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of Endostar in mice with MPE. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell line expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was injected into pleural cavity to establish MPE mice model. Mice were randomly divided into four groups. High dose of Endostar (30 mg/kg), low dose of Endostar (8 mg/kg), normal saline, or Bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) was respectively injected into pleural cavity three times with 3 -day interval in each group. <b>Transverse</b> computed <b>tomography</b> (CT) was performed to observe pleural fluid formation 14 days after LLC cells injection. Mice were anesthetized and sacrificed 3 days after final administration. The volume of {{pleural effusion}} n was measured using 1 ml syringe. Micro blood vessel density (MVD), Lymphatic micro vessel density (LMVD), the expression level of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and VEGF-C were observed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. RESULTS: The volume of pleural effusion as well as the number of pleural tumor foci, MVD and the expression of VEGF-A were significantly reduced in high dose of Endostar treat group. More importantly, LMVD and the expression of VEGF-C were markedly lower in treat group than those in the other three control groups.

The MENT algorithm has been adapted for the reconstruction of the transverse and longitudinal phase space distributions at particle accelerators allowing a determination of crucial beam parameters.

These profiles can be obtained from diverse standard monitoring devices, e. g. wirescanners or optical transition radiation stations.

The {{aim of this study}} is to establish a mouse model of MPE using Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell lines expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Methods The mouse model was created by injecting LLC-EGFP cells directly into the pleural cavity of mice that were sacrificed periodically. The dynamic growth and metastasis of tumor cells were screened using in vivo fluorescence imaging. The remaining mice were subjected to <b>transverse</b> computed <b>tomography</b> (CT) imaging periodically to analyze the formation rate of pleural effusion. The survival rate and tumor metastasis were also observed. Pleural fluid was gently aspirated using a 1 mL syringe and its volume was measured. When two or more mice bore pleural effusion at the same time, we calculated the average volume. The correlation of pleural effusion with the integrated optical density (IOD) were analyzed. Results Four days after the inoculation of LLC-EGFP cells, green fluorescence was observed by opening the chest wall. The tumor formation rate was 100 %, and the IOD gradually increased after inoculation. The metastasis sites were mediastinal, and the hilar lymph nodes were contralateral pleural as well as pericardial. The metastasis rates were 87 %, 73 % and 20 %, respectively. The CT scan revealed that the formation rates of pleural effusion on days 7, 14 and 21 were 13 %, 46 % and 53 %, respectively. The average volume of pleural effusion increased obviously on day 10 and peaked on day 16 with a value of 0. 5 mL. The mean survival time of nude mice was 28. 8 days. The volume of pleural effusion and IOD were significantly correlated (r= 0. 91, P< 0. 000, 1). Conclusion A mouse model of lung cancer malignant pleural effusion was successfully established by injecting LLC lines expressing EGFP into the pleural cavity under a microscope. The model can enable dynamic observations of the biological behavior of tumor cells in the pleural cavity. It might be helpful for basic research on advanced lung cancer as well as anti-tumor drug development...|$|R

One year of home-based daily FES in {{complete}} lower motor neuron paraplegia: recovery of tetanic contractility drives the structural improvements of denervated muscle. Kern H, Carraro U, Adami N, Hofer C, Loefler S, Vogelauer M, Mayr W, Rupp R, Zampieri S. Source Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Electrostimulation and Physical Rehabilitation, Department of Physical Medicine, Wilhelminenspital, Vienna, Austria. Abstract OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes muscle atrophy, which is particularly severe, due to inability to perform tetanic contractions, when {{lower motor neurons}} (LMN) are involved. We performed a longitudinal study in 25 Europeans suffering from complete conus cauda syndrome from 0. 7 to 8. 7 years comparing functional and structural thigh muscle properties before and after 2 years of home-based daily training by functional electrical stimulation (FES). The mid-term results after 1 year and preliminary muscle biopsy observations at project end-point from a subset of subjects are here reported. METHODS: Muscles were electrically stimulated at home by means of large surface electrodes and a custom-designed stimulator. The poor excitability of the LMN denervated muscles was first improved by twitch-contraction training. Then, tetanic contractions against progressively increased loading were elicited. Finally, standing-up exercises were daily performed. The bulk of thigh muscle was estimated by <b>transverse</b> computer <b>tomography</b> (CT) scan and force measurements. Needle biopsies of vastus lateralis were harvested before and after 2 years of FES. RESULTS: The 1 year home-based daily FES training induced: (1) very similar increases in muscle excitability and contractility in right and left legs; (2) feasibility to elicit tetanic contractions by means of train-stimulation with about ten times improvement of muscle force; (3) increase in the 26 % of muscle bulk, as shown by CT scan analyses, improving appearance of limbs and muscle cushioning; (4) myofiber size increase (+ 94 %) in a small series of muscle biopsies obtained after 2 years of FES. None of the subjects that performed 1 year home-based daily FES training (20 persons) had worsened their functional class, while 20 % (4 / 20) improved to functional class 4, that is, the ability to stand. DISCUSSION: The European Union (EU) Project Rise shows that 'home-based daily FES training' is a safe and effective therapy that may maintain life-long physical exercise by active muscle contraction (FES is the only option for denervated muscle) as a procedure to recover the early-lost tetanic contractility of denervated muscle, and to counteract muscle atrophy {{in order to prevent}} clinical complications.

There is no {{existing}} worldwide published {{method for}} mediastinum compartment classification based on transverse section images for {{the differential diagnosis}} of mediastinal tumors. Herein, we describe a new method for anatomic mediastinal compartment classification using <b>transverse</b> section computed <b>tomography</b> (CT) images {{and the use of}} this method to classify mediastinal lesions, and thus evaluate whether the method is sufficiently user-friendly and useful. In a publication of the Japanese Association for Research on the Thymus (JART), we proposed the following four medias-tinal compartments based on transverse CT images: superior portion of mediastinum, anterior mediastinum (prevascular zone), middle mediastinum (peri-tracheoesophageal zone), and posterior mediastinum (paravertebral zone). In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed 445 pathologically proven mediastinal mass lesions, and categorized them into the proposed four compartments by consensus reading. Mass lesions were classified into compartments based on the loca-tion of the lesion centroid, and each lesion was satisfactorily categorized into a compartment. Almost all thymic epithelial tumors (99 %, 244 / 246), all 24 thymic malignant lymphomas and a majority of germ cell neoplasms (93 %, 54 / 58) were clas-sified as being in the anterior mediastinum compartment. The majority of intrathoracic goiters (82 %, 14 / 17) were categorized as being in the superior portion of the mediastinum compart-ment. Approximately two-thirds of mass lesions in the middle mediastinum were cysts, including foregut and pericardial cysts. Approximately 80 % of 37 mass lesions in the poste-rior mediastinum were neurogenic tumors. Correspondingly, 29 of the 49 neurogenic tumors (60 %) were categorized as being in the posterior mediastinum, while 10 (20 %) were in the superior portion of the mediastinum, 4 (8 %) in the ante-rior mediastinum, and 6 (12 %) in the middle mediastinum. Our findings showed that the newly proposed mediastinal compartment classification using transverse images appears to be user-friendly enough for practical clinical application and may be helpful in differential diagnoses...|$|R

The variation of the GAs that performs best on the benchmark function, {{in terms of the}} number of maxima discovered, is selected for the determination of automatic point correspondence between two images. The selected variation of the GAs involves an iterative procedure for the formation of a genetic population of individuals (or chromosomes). Each individual encodes the position of a point of interest on one of the available images as well as parameters of a local transformation that generates the position of the corresponding point on the other image. The proposed algorithm aims to discover individuals that corresponds to local maxima of an objective function that measures the similarity between patches of the two images. When the GAs-based multimodal optimization algorithm terminates, pairs of corresponding points between the two images are obtained that can be used for the generation of a dense deformation field by means of the thin plate splines model. The proposed algorithm is applied to 2 D medical images (dental and retinal images) under known transformations (similarity and elastic transformation) and is also assessed on medical images with unknown transformations (computer <b>tomography</b> <b>transverse</b> slices). The proposed algorithm is compared against the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, and a well-known non-rigid registration algorithm, based on free-form deformations (FFD) using various quantitative criteria. The obtained results indicate that in case of known similarity transformations, the proposed multimodal GAs-based algorithm and the ICP algorithm present equivalent performance, whereas the FFD algorithm is clearly outperformed. In the case of known sinousoidal deformations, the proposed multimodal GAs-based and the FFD algorithm achieve equivalent performance and clearly outperform the ICP algorithm. Finally, in the case of unknown elastic deformations, the proposed GAs-based algorithm appears to perform marginally better than the FFD algorithm, whereas it clearly outperforms the ICP algorithm.
