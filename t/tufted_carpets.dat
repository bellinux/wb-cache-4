However, the city was well known for carpet making and weaving. Although most of the mediaeval weavers who thrived in the city had left by the 19th century, the city was the home of Hugh MacKay Carpets’ factory, which produced the famous brands of axminster and <b>tufted</b> <b>carpets</b> until the factory went into administration in April 2005.

2500|$|Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton {{are made}} by massive looms that weave {{together}} ‘bobbins’ of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. <b>Tufted</b> <b>carpets</b> are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying [...] "loopers". <b>Tufted</b> <b>carpets</b> can be twist pile, velvet, or loop pile. Twist pile carpets are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, {{so that in the}} finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet pile carpets tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop pile carpets are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate ‘mistake’ on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.|$|E

50|$|The <b>tufted</b> <b>carpet</b> is {{the most}} common {{manufacturing}} technique. It implies poking yarn tufts in a textile support close to a sewing machine.

40|$|Abstract. Firstly, {{based on}} the {{structure}} of <b>tufted</b> <b>carpet</b> looms (DHGN 801 D- 400), the lumped parameter models were built, in which included the massless shafts, lumped masses, disk and elastic support. Secondly, according to various parts of the relationship between force and deformation, the transfer matrix of right and left ends were established, thus the universal transfer matrix of shaft units was determined by solving the various parts transfer matrix simultaneously. Thirdly, the dynamic behavior model of coupling shafts in <b>tufted</b> <b>carpet</b> looms was given, and different natural frequencies were acquired by simulating the model in Matlab. Lastly, the dynamic behavior model using transfer matrix was verified to be effective and feasible by experiment. Introductions The structure of coupling shafts in weaving equipments is very complicated.

To compete in a changing industry, Mohasco gradually moved manufacturing south into the Carolinas and eventually Georgia. In 1963, the company turned some of its attention to furniture manufacturing.|$|R

When the quality of the bulrush deteriorated in the 20th century, due to the change from salt water to fresh water (see Zuiderzee), the industry switched over to using coir imported from India to produce mats and carpets.

5000|$|Product dyeing, {{also known}} as garment dyeing, {{is the process of}} dyeing {{products}} such as hosiery, sweaters, and carpet after they have been produced. This stage of dyeing is suitable when all components dye the same shade (including threads). This method is used to dye sheer hosiery since it is knitted using tubular knitting machines and then stitched prior to dyeing. <b>Tufted</b> <b>carpets,</b> with the exception of carpets produced using solution dyed fibers, are often dyed after they have been tufted. This method is not suitable for apparel with many components such as lining, zippers, and sewing thread, as each component may dye differently. The exception is tinting jeans with pigments for a “vintage” look. In tinting, color is used, whereas in other treatments such as acid-wash and stone-wash, chemical or mechanical processes are used. After garment construction, these products are given the [...] "faded" [...] or [...] "used" [...] look by finishing methods as opposed to dyeing.|$|E

40|$|London-based artist David Mabb’s {{project has}} evolved out of several months spent researching Lithuanian applied arts {{production}} during the Soviet period {{known as the}} ‘Kruschev Thaw’. At that time protocols were developed to place artists/master craftsman in charge of industrial production of ceramics, glass, stained glass, textiles, and carpets — an initiative called ‘art into everyday life’ — that extended through to the 1970 s and the ‘Brezhnev Stagnation’. It was a period that also produced a number of elegant modernist buildings. After independence this history and the objects/buildings have been devalued because of their Soviet associations.

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} was to to {{quantify}} the arising amount of production waste in carpet production especially in the dominating tufting technology in Germany and to line out the state of technology and research activities {{in the field of}} recycling of used carpet Materials. In 1994 about 170 Mill. sq m of <b>tufted</b> <b>carpets</b> have been produced in Germany. The corresponding volume of wastes was about 22. 000 metric tons. At end use level about 330 Mill. sq m have been sold in Germany. This is a volume near by 500. 000 metric tons per year which has to be handled as wastes after approximately 10 years of use.
