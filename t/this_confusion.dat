5|$|Drosera anglica {{was first}} {{described}} by William Hudson in 1778. It has frequently been {{confused with the}} other circumpolar long-leaf Drosera, D. intermedia. <b>This</b> <b>confusion</b> was fueled by the resurfacing of an older name, D. longifolia (described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753), which was regarded as being too ambiguous in description and had been applied to specimens of both D. anglica and D. intermedia. Herbarium specimens were also a mix of the two species. These points led Martin Cheek to propose D. longifolia for rejection as a species name in 1998. The proposal was accepted and the taxon listed as rejected in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} six crew members, {{a total of}} 160 {{passengers}} were on board {{at the time of}} the crash. Although there were 169 names on the original passenger list, nine did not board the flight. All the bodies were recovered from the wreckage. Karnataka Home Minister V. S. Acharya said eight people were initially reported to have survived, although one person died of his injuries—this was however refuted by an Air India spokesman who confirmed that all initial survivors were alive. <b>This</b> <b>confusion</b> arose after fire fighters rescued a little girl who died on the way to hospital. The airport manager at Mangalore, Peter Abraham confirmed that there were difficulties when trying to reach the plane.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Beatty's battlecruisers were in {{position}} to block Hipper's chosen egress route, while other forces were en route to complete the encirclement. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the IIScouting Group began {{to pass through the}} British forces searching for Hipper. One of the cruisers in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron spotted Stralsund and signaled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, however those were some 50km (31mi) ahead. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. <b>This</b> <b>confusion</b> allowed the German light cruisers to escape and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape.|$|E

5|$|Mauretania was {{a client}} kingdom of Rome ruled by Ptolemy of Mauretania. Caligula invited Ptolemy to Rome and then {{suddenly}} had him executed. Mauretania was annexed by Caligula and subsequently divided into two provinces, Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis, separated by the river Malua. Pliny claims that division {{was the work of}} Caligula, but Dio states that in AD 42 an uprising took place, which was subdued by Gaius Suetonius Paulinus and Gnaeus Hosidius Geta, and the division only took place after this. <b>This</b> <b>confusion</b> might mean that Caligula decided to divide the province, but the division was postponed because of the rebellion. The first known equestrian governor of the two provinces was Marcus Fadius Celer Flavianus, in office in AD 44.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{there was}} {{considerable}} confusion over the difference between columbium (niobium) and the closely related tantalum. In 1809, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918g/cm3, and tantalum—tantalite, with a density over 8g/cm3, {{and concluded that the}} two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name tantalum. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two different elements in the tantalite sample, and named them after children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe) and pelopium (from Pelops). <b>This</b> <b>confusion</b> arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium. The claimed new elements pelopium, ilmenium, and dianium were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>confusion</b> in the {{identification}} of the site has hindered study. The Chajoma capital has been investigated archaeologically, under the assumption that it was the Poqomam capital. Although the Chajoma ruins of Jilotepeque Viejo have been well described archaeologically, the archaeological data has been associated with the history of a different site entirely. Doubts about {{the identification}} of the archaeological site were first raised by Robert M. Carmack, who realised that the supposed Poqomam capital was not located within the Poqomam linguistic area but rather within the linguistic area of the Kaqchikels. The Poqomam who were settled in the new colonial settlement of Mixco by the Spanish had a long history of fine polychrome ceramic production, but no evidence of such production had been recovered during archaeological investigations, and the ruins were considered too distant from colonial Mixco.|$|E

5|$|The Path of the Wizard {{continues}} {{immediately after}} {{the events of the}} first level. The remains of the Uruk-hai and orc army flee into Fangorn Forest. However, within the forest, the Ents, led by Treebeard, have awoken and joined the fight against Sauron. Gandalf helps the ents as they destroy the rest of the army, and then assists them in bringing down a dam holding back the River Isen. This floods Isengard, trapping Saruman (Christopher Lee), who had joined forces with Sauron, in his tower, Orthanc. Gandalf and Pippin (Billy Boyd) then head to Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, leaving Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Rohirrim to follow them. Gandalf has gone ahead of the others because Sauron mistakenly believes that Pippin has the Ring, and Gandalf plans to use <b>this</b> <b>confusion</b> to distract Sauron as Frodo and Sam are led by Gollum (Andy Serkis) towards Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. In Minas Tirth, Gandalf helps repulse the enemies from the walls for a time, but eventually, they break through the city's defenses. Gandalf and the soldiers of Minas Tirith then retreat to a courtyard, where they must defend the fleeing civilians from the enemy. Once the people are safely inside, Gandalf can do little but await the arrival of Aragorn.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{nearing the}} British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers {{split into two}} groups. Seydlitz, Moltke, and Blücher went north to shell Hartlepool, while Von der Tann and Derfflinger went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby. The two ships {{destroyed}} the coast guard stations in both towns, along with the signalling station in Whitby. By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and began to retreat eastward. Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl's withdrawal, and following the bombardment of the target cities, turned back to rendezvous with the German fleet. By this time, David Beatty's battlecruisers were in position to block Hipper's chosen egress route, while other forces were en route to complete the encirclement. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the IIScouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper. One of the cruisers in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron spotted Stralsund, and signaled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships.

25|$|Also, p and f are {{sometimes}} pronounced somewhat similarly among speakers of Malay descent. For example, the two Malay names 'Fazlin' and 'Pazlin' may sound almost identical when spoken by Malays, whereas <b>this</b> <b>confusion</b> would not arise when spoken by a British Speaker.|$|E

25|$|Many mishnayot (single {{paragraph}} units) in the Mishnah {{and in the}} Tosefta are midrashic halakot. On {{the other}} hand, the halakhic midrashim contain independent halakot without statements of their Scriptural bases. <b>This</b> <b>confusion</b> is {{explained by the fact}} that the redactors of the two forms of halakot borrowed passages from one another.|$|E
25|$|While {{there may}} be {{arguments}} in favour {{of some of these}} variant romanizations in specific contexts, their use, especially if mixed, leads to confusion when romanized Japanese words are indexed.

25|$|A {{matter of}} some {{confusion}} for Anglicans {{elsewhere in the}} world is that while the Anglican Church of Canada is a province of the Anglican Communion, the Ecclesiastical Province of Canada is merely one of four such ecclesiastical provinces of the Anglican Church of Canada. <b>This</b> <b>confusion</b> is furthered by the fact that Canada has ten civil provinces, along with three territories.|$|E

5000|$|Clenbuterol is {{occasionally}} {{referred to}} as [...] "bute" [...] and <b>this</b> risks <b>confusion</b> with phenylbutazone, also called [...] "bute". Phenylbutazone, which is a drug also used with horses, was tested for in the 2013 European meat adulteration scandal.|$|R
25|$|Currently, the {{consensus}} among major Islamic schools is that apostasy (leaving Islam) is considered treason {{and that the}} penalty is death; this is supported not in the Quran but in hadith. <b>This</b> <b>confusion</b> between apostasy and treason almost certainly had {{its roots in the}} Ridda Wars, in which an army of rebel traitors led by the self-proclaimed prophet Musaylima attempted to destroy the caliphate of Abu Bakr.|$|E

25|$|Thanksgiving {{occurred}} {{later in}} 1888 and 1899 than is possible under current U.S. law: {{as a result}} of changes between 1939 and 1941, Thanksgiving is always held on the fourth Thursday in November. The last time the fourth Thursday of November fell within Hanukkah before 2013 was in 1861, before Thanksgiving existed. As a result of <b>this</b> <b>confusion,</b> some media reports have mistakenly claimed that Thanksgivukkah had never occurred prior to 2013.|$|E
25|$|There is, however, {{hardly any}} {{agreement}} as to exactly {{why such a}} murder occurred or who was behind it. Marlovians say that <b>this</b> <b>confusion</b> arises from scholars asking the wrong question. Instead of {{trying to find out}} why he was killed, they should be asking why those particular people would have met at that particular place on that particular day. The Marlovian theory argues that the most logical reason for that meeting to have taken place would have been to fake his death.|$|E
25|$|In initial biographical news reporting, {{there was}} {{confusion}} regarding his clan lineage; {{it was written}} that his paternal lineage derived from the Sadozai clan. <b>This</b> <b>confusion</b> might have arisen from sources stating he {{was chosen as the}} tribal chief, or Khan, of the Popalzai. Traditionally, the Popalzai tribe has been led by members of the Sadozais. The first King of Afghanistan, Ahmad Shah Durrani, was the leader of the Sadozais, and the Sadozai lineage continued to rule Afghanistan until 1826 when the Barakzais ascended to the throne.|$|E
