5|$|California condors {{have the}} largest {{wingspan}} of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both body length and weight only by the <b>trumpeter</b> <b>swan</b> and the introduced mute swan. The American white pelican and whooping crane also have longer bodies than the condor. Condors are so large {{that they can be}} mistaken for a small, distant airplane, which possibly occurs more often than they are mistaken for other species of bird.|$|E
5|$|Native trumpeter (Cygnus buccinator) and tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) and {{non-native}} mute swans (Cygnus olor) may all {{be found}} on the lake in winter. Tundra swans are absent in summer as they migrate to the arctic and subarctic to nest, however, the non-native, Eurasian mute swans compete for habitat with the non-migrating <b>trumpeter</b> <b>swan</b> population and is an impediment to restoration of the native trumpeters around the Great Lakes. Additional native birds hosted by the lake include cardinals, blue jays, finches, orioles, woodpeckers, teal, mallards, resident and migratory Canada geese, and an occasional bald eagle.|$|E

25|$|Northern Ponds is {{a series}} of naturalistic ponds home to a variety of {{waterfowl}} and other aquatic birds both wild and captive. Captive residents include black-necked crane, red-breasted goose, lesser white-fronted goose, American ruddy duck, barnacle goose, and <b>trumpeter</b> <b>swan.</b> A wide variety of wild bird species can also be found in the ponds, including several native ducks such as mallards and mergansers, as well as other birds such as black-capped night-herons.|$|E
25|$|The {{status of}} most {{species in the}} Rocky Mountains is unknown, due to {{incomplete}} information. European-American settlement of the mountains has adversely impacted native species. Examples of some species that have declined include western toads, greenback cutthroat trout, white sturgeon, white-tailed ptarmigan, <b>trumpeter</b> <b>swan,</b> and bighorn sheep. In the United States portion of the mountain range, apex predators such as grizzly bears and gray wolves had been extirpated from their original ranges, but have partially recovered due to conservation measures and reintroduction. Other recovering species include the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon.|$|E
25|$|True to its roots, Elk Island National Park still {{maintains}} a thriving elk population, estimated at 605 in 2007, {{as well as}} around 300 moose and over 500 deer. Parks Canada transferred eighteen western moose from Elk Island to Nova Scotia's Cape Breton Highlands National Park between 1947 and 1949. Reintroduction of traditional species {{has been an important}} focus as well. Besides the success of the wood and plains bison introduction, beaver were reintroduced in 1942, and in 2007 numbered near 1000. 1987 saw the beginning of a <b>Trumpeter</b> <b>Swan</b> reintroduction programme which is now seeing mating pairs returning to Elk Island, raising hope for a sustainable population.|$|E

25|$|The ducks, geese, and swans are small- to large-sized {{birds with}} a broad and {{elongated}} general body plan. Diving species vary from this in being rounder. Extant species {{range in size from}} the cotton pygmy goose, at as little as 26.5cm (10.5in) and 164g (5.8oz), to the <b>trumpeter</b> <b>swan,</b> at as much as 183cm (6ft) and 17.2kg (38lb). The wings are short and pointed, and supported by strong wing muscles that generate rapid beats in flight. They typically have long necks, although this varies in degree between species. The legs are short, strong, and set far {{to the back of the}} body (more so in the more aquatic species), and have a leathery feel with a scaly texture. Combined with their body shape, this can make some species awkward on land, but they are stronger walkers than other marine and water birds such as grebes or petrels. They typically have webbed feet, though a few species such as the Nene have secondarily lost their webbing. The bills are made of soft keratin with a thin and sensitive layer of skin on top (which has a leathery feel when touched). For most species, the shape of the bill tends to be more flattened to a greater or lesser extent. These contain serrated lamellae which are particularly well defined in the filter-feeding species.|$|E
500|$|... 311 {{species of}} birds have been reported, almost half of which nest in Yellowstone. As of 1999, twenty-six pairs of nesting bald eagles have been documented. Extremely rare {{sightings}} of whooping cranes have been recorded, however only three examples of this species are known {{to live in the}} Rocky Mountains, out of 385 known worldwide. Other birds, considered to be species of special concern because of their rarity in Yellowstone, include the common loon, harlequin duck, osprey, peregrine falcon and the <b>trumpeter</b> <b>swan.</b>|$|E

500|$|Along some {{portions}} of the North Pacific coastline, bald eagles which had historically preyed mainly kelp-dwelling fish and supplementally sea otter (Enhydra lutris) pups are now preying mainly on seabird colonies since both the fish (possibly due to overfishing) and otters (cause unknown) have had precipitous population declines, causing concern for seabird conservation. Because of this more extensive predation, some biologist have expressed concern that murres are heading for a [...] "conservation collision" [...] due to heavy eagle predation. Eagles have been confirmed to attack nocturnally active, burrow-nesting seabird species such as storm petrels and shearwaters by digging out their burrows and feeding on all animals they find inside. If a bald eagle flies close by, waterbirds will often fly away en masse, though in other cases they may seemingly ignore a perched eagle. If the said birds are on a colony, this exposed their unprotected eggs and nestlings to scavengers such as gulls. Bird prey may occasionally be attacked in flight, with prey up {{to the size of}} Canada geese attacked and killed in mid-air. Unprecedented photographs of a bald eagle unsuccessfully attempting to prey on a much larger adult <b>trumpeter</b> <b>swan</b> (Cygnus buccinator) in mid-flight were taken recently. While adults often actively prey on waterbirds, congregated wintering waterfowl are frequently exploited for carcasses to scavenge by immature eagles in harsh winter weather. Bald eagles have been recorded as killing other raptors on occasion. In some cases, these may be attacks of competition or kleptoparasitism on rival species but ended with the consumption of the victim. Raptorial birds reported to be hunted by these eagles have included large adults of species such as red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) and black (Coragyps atratus) and turkey vultures (Cathartes aura).|$|E
