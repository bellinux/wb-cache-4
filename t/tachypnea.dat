5|$|Chronic {{users of}} {{benzodiazepine}} medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to tolerance to benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with midazolam {{results in the}} development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a few days or more a withdrawal syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as clorazepate dipotassium. When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and <b>tachypnea.</b> In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{findings}} {{in people with}} tension pneumothorax are chest pain and respiratory distress, often with an increased heart rate (tachycardia) and rapid breathing (<b>tachypnea)</b> in the initial stages. Other findings may include quieter breath sounds {{on one side of}} the chest, low oxygen levels and blood pressure, and displacement of the trachea away from the affected side. Rarely, there may be cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels), altered level of consciousness, a hyperresonant percussion note on examination of the affected side with reduced expansion and decreased movement, pain in the epigastrium (upper abdomen), displacement of the apex beat (heart impulse), and resonant sound when tapping the sternum. This is a medical emergency and may require immediate treatment without further investigations (see below).|$|E

25|$|Symptoms {{and signs}} of early {{hypercapnia}} include flushed skin, full pulse, <b>tachypnea,</b> dyspnea, muscle twitches, reduced neural activity, headache, confusion and lethargy, increased cardiac output, an elevation in arterial blood pressure, and a propensity toward arrhythmias. In severe hypercapnia, symptoms progresses to disorientation, panic, hyperventilation, convulsions, unconsciousness, and eventually death.|$|E
25|$|Patent ductus arteriosus* {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{congenital}} heart defect in dogs around the world. It is inherited in toy and miniature Poodles, and seen commonly in German Shepherds, Pomeranians, Bichon Frises, and Malteses. Signs include a continuous heart murmur, bounding (strong) femoral pulse, <b>tachypnea</b> (increased breathing rate), dyspnea (labored breathing), and exercise intolerance.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{and signs}} of early {{hypercapnia}} include flushed skin, full pulse, <b>tachypnea,</b> dyspnea, extrasystoles, muscle twitches, hand flaps, reduced neural activity, and possibly a raised blood pressure. According to other sources, symptoms of mild hypercapnia might include headache, confusion and lethargy. Hypercapnia can induce increased cardiac output, an elevation in arterial blood pressure, and a propensity toward arrhythmias. Hypercapnia may increase pulmonary capillary resistance. In severe hypercapnia (generally PaCO2 greater than 10 kPa or 75 mmHg), symptomatology progresses to disorientation, panic, hyperventilation, convulsions, unconsciousness, and eventually death.|$|E
25|$|Pyruvate {{dehydrogenase}} (PDH) deficiency is a congenital degenerative {{metabolic disease}} {{resulting from a}} mutation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) located on the X chromosome. While defects {{have been identified in}} all 3 enzymes of the complex, the E1-α subunit is predominantly the culprit. Malfunction of the citric acid cycle due to PDH deficiency deprives the body of energy and leads to an abnormal buildup of lactate. PDH deficiency is a common cause of lactic acidosis in newborns and often presents with severe lethargy, poor feeding, <b>tachypnea,</b> and cases of death have occurred.|$|E

2500|$|In severe heat stroke, {{there may}} be confused, hostile, or {{seemingly}} intoxicated behavior. [...] Heart rate and respiration rate will increase (tachycardia and <b>tachypnea)</b> as blood pressure drops and the heart attempts to maintain adequate circulation. [...] The decrease in blood pressure can then cause blood vessels to contract reflexively, resulting in a pale or bluish skin color in advanced cases. [...] Young children, in particular, may have seizures. Eventually, organ failure, unconsciousness and death will result.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms of {{pulmonary}} embolism are typically sudden in onset and may include one or {{many of the}} following: dyspnea (shortness of breath), <b>tachypnea</b> (rapid breathing), chest pain of a [...] "pleuritic" [...] nature (worsened by breathing), cough and hemoptysis (coughing up blood). More severe cases can include signs such as cyanosis (blue discoloration, usually of the lips and fingers), collapse, and circulatory instability because of decreased blood flow through the lungs and into {{the left side of}} the heart. About 15% of all cases of sudden death are attributable to PE.|$|E
2500|$|Patients with {{symptoms}} of CAP require evaluation. Diagnosis of pneumonia is made clinically, {{rather than on}} the basis of a particular test. Evaluation begins with a physical examination by a health provider, which may reveal fever, an increased respiratory rate (<b>tachypnea),</b> low blood pressure (hypotension), a fast heart rate (tachycardia) and changes in the amount of oxygen in the blood. Palpating the chest as it expands and tapping the chest wall (percussion) to identify dull, non-resonant areas can identify stiffness and fluid, signs of CAP. Listening to the lungs with a stethoscope (auscultation) can also reveal signs associated with CAP. A lack of normal breath sounds or the presence of crackles can indicate fluid consolidation. Increased vibration of the chest when speaking, known as tactile fremitus, and increased volume of whispered speech during auscultation can also indicate fluid.|$|E
2500|$|When inhaled, {{trichloroethylene}} produces {{central nervous}} system depression resulting in general anesthesia. Its high blood solubility results in a less desirable slower induction of anesthesia. At low concentrations it is relatively non-irritating to the respiratory tract. [...] Higher concentrations result in <b>tachypnea.</b> [...] Many types of cardiac arrhythmias can occur and are exacerbated by epinephrine (adrenaline). [...] It was noted in the 1940s that TCE reacted with carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbing systems (soda lime) to produce dichloroacetylene and phosgene. Cranial nerve dysfunction (especially the fifth cranial nerve) was common when TCE anesthesia was given using CO2 absorbing systems. [...] These nerve deficits could last for months. [...] Occasionally facial numbness was permanent. [...] Muscle relaxation with TCE anesthesia sufficient for surgery was poor. [...] For these reasons as well as problems with hepatotoxicity, TCE lost popularity in North America and Europe to more potent anesthestics such as halothane by the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|There are now {{significant}} {{reports of}} ictal EEGs in 20 cases, which objectively document the seizures of Panayiotopoulos syndrome and their variable localisation at onset. [...] All these recorded seizures occurred while {{the children were}} asleep. The onset of the electrical ictal discharge was mainly occipital (7 cases) or frontal (7 cases)and consisted of rhythmic monomorphic decelerating theta or delta activity with small spikes. The ﬁrst clinical manifestation which appeared long (1–10 minutes) after the electrical onset, usually consisted of opening of the eyes as if the children were waking from sleep. At this stage, usually the children responded, often correctly, to simple questions. On many occasions, tachycardia was the first objective sign when ||ECG|| was recorded. Vomiting was a common ictal symptom occurring at any stage of the seizures but not as the ﬁrst clinical manifestation. Seizures associated with ictal vomiting {{did not have any}} particular localization or lateralization. Vomiting occurred mainly when the ictal discharges were more diffuse than localized. Sometimes only retching without vomiting occurred, and on a few occasions, vomiting did not occur. Other autonomic manifestations included mydriasis, pallor, cyanosis, <b>tachypnea,</b> hypersalivation, and perspiration at various stages of the ictus. Of non-autonomic manifestations, deviation of eyes to the right or left occurred before or after vomiting without any apparent EEG localisation; it was present in seizures starting from the occipital or frontal regions.|$|E

50|$|Still, many simply define dyspnea as {{difficulty}} in breathing without further specification, which may confuse it with e.g. labored breathing or <b>tachypnea</b> (rapid breathing). Labored breathing has occasionally {{been included in the}} definition of dyspnea as well. However, in the standard definition, these related signs may be present at the same time, but don't necessarily have to be. For instance, in respiratory arrest by a primary failure in respiratory muscles the patient, if conscious, may experience dyspnea, yet without having any labored breathing or <b>tachypnea.</b> The other way around, labored breathing or <b>tachypnea</b> can voluntarily be performed even when there is no dyspnea.|$|E
