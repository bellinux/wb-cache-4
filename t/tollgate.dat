5|$|The Broadmead {{shopping}} centre was redeveloped {{in the early}} years of the century, involving the demolition of one the city's tallest mid-century towers, <b>Tollgate</b> House, in the construction of Cabot Circus. The former Bristol and West Tower was reworked into a glass skyscraper with glass panels in place of its concrete outer cladding. In 2005, the city council undertook extensive consultations about the future of tall buildings in Bristol, and identified support for new tall buildings so long as they are well designed, sustainable, distinctive and 'fit' into the existing urban landscape.|$|E

Various historic sites associated with the National Road can be found along Alt US40, including a toll-gate house (La Vale <b>Tollgate</b> House) and mile-marker in LaVale. The toll-gate house in LaVale is the last remaining toll-gate house on the National Road in Maryland. Several historic bridges from the National Road, since bypassed by newer bridges, are still present along the route of Alt US40, including the Casselman Bridge over the Casselman River in Grantsville and a bridge in Clarysville.|$|E

40|$|Toll roads or controlled-access {{roads are}} very {{commonly}} used, e. g. in Asia. Drivers expect to drive smoother and faster on the toll roads compared to on regular roads. However, long queues on toll roads, {{particularly at the}} <b>tollgates,</b> often happen and create many problems. Being able to accurately predict travel time and volume of the <b>tollgates</b> would allow appropriate measures to improve traffic flow and safety to be taken. This paper describes a novel investigation {{on the use of}} scaling methods with Support Vector Regression (SVR) for highway <b>tollgates</b> travel time and volume prediction tasks as well as an investigation of the most important features for these tasks.

40|$|Toll roads or controlled-access {{roads are}} widely used around the world, for {{instance}} in Asian countries. It is often expected that drivers can drive smoother and faster on the toll roads or controlled-access roads compared to on regular roads. However, long queues happen frequently on toll roads and cause lots of problems, especially at the <b>tollgates.</b> Accurate predictions of travel time and volume at the <b>tollgates</b> are necessary for traffic management authorities {{in order to take}} appropriate measures to control future traffic flow and to improve traffic safety. This thesis describes a novel investigation on the combination of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and scaling methods for highway <b>tollgates</b> travel time and volume predictions. The major contribution of this thesis includes 1) an approach to handling the missing data; 2) selection of important features; 3) investigation of three scaling methods and discussion of their suitability.

25|$|Before World War II, Crawley was a slowly growing {{market town}} based around a north–south High Street. Beyond the {{buildings}} fronting the road, ancient fields and allotments survived. Towards {{the north end}} of the street, a footpath ran southeastwards between buildings and through the fields. In the 1930s this footpath was upgraded into a long cul-de-sac called Northgate Road, taking its name from the nearby northern <b>tollgate</b> on the High Street—part of the main London–Brighton road which was turnpiked in the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{alignment}} of Route32 was first designated in 1964, {{when the state}} took over jurisdiction of a highway from U.S. Route 130 in South Brunswick, eastward along Forsgate Drive to the intersection with County Route 522 and County Route 535 in Monroe Township. Exit 8A originally had an exit ramp from the <b>tollgate</b> to Route 32 west. However, this was changed due to heavy congestion at the ramp. The turnpike ramp to Route 32 westbound was closed off but leaving most of the old pavement in place, creating a stub ramp. In its place, a new, two-lane ramp to County Route 535 was built. Motorists must now take CR 535 south to access NJ 32 westbound.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tollgates</b> {{were built}} along the turnpike {{to hold its}} revenue until the company's stock was retired. One of the <b>tollgates</b> was called Watson Place and was most likely located near Ganoga Lake. In 1807 the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike made $1339.07. Initially $60,000 of stock {{in the form of}} 600 shares was created for the company. Stock in the company that owned the turnpike was sold at $100 per share. 10% of this stock was payable {{at the time of the}} {{purchase}} and the rest came in installments. The Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike received a moderate amount of use, especially during the spring, when the Susquehanna River was commonly used as a method of travel to New York.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} find out the {{effectiveness}} of ICT on the supply side and how infrastructure limitations have a bearing on service delivery in the Zimbabwean public sector. In this paper we focus on ZINARA a parastatal mandated by the government of Zimbabwe to administer among other things, the collection of <b>tollgates</b> fees for the purposes of building new and up grading the existing infrastructure. A qualitative research design {{in the form of a}} case study was used to guide this research. Observations and interviews were the research instruments used to collect data from the <b>tollgates</b> under study and from senior executives at ZINARA Head Office in Harare. The study shows that ZINARAâ€™s migration from a manual system to ICT led tolling system, has improved revenue collection but has not eliminated queues at some toll gates under study. We recommend that ZINARA should introduce prepaid tolling for left hand driven trucks and other techno-savvy road users and dedicate a green route for them to avoid delays especially at the <b>tollgates</b> with more than one lane. In addition a swiping system that allows use of debit and credit cards may also be introduced...|$|R

25|$|The towpath crosses {{from the}} west bank to the east bank at the bridge. A little further to the east is the Old <b>Tollgate</b> Bridge, a red brick single span with ashlar {{dressing}} dating from the late 1700s, which crosses the Old River Ancholme. Continuing northwards, the towpath crosses the entrance to the Caistor Canal, disused since 1877. A 20th century steel span is supported by stone abutments, built around 1785, when the canal opened. The bridge is Grade II listed as is the adjacent first lock, one of five that remain on the Caistor Canal. Hibaldstow Bridge was rebuilt in 1889 to a design by Alfred Atkinson, and the wrought-iron span, which rests on brick piers, was supplied by a company of ironfounders called Messrs Porter and Co of Lincoln. It replaced an earlier wooden swing bridge, dating from Rennie's reconstruction, and the piers from that bridge were probably reused. Atkinson was also responsible for Cadney Bridge, rebuilt in 1882, for which the wrought iron span was supplied by Messrs Goodwin, Jardine and Co of Glasgow. Again, the piers from an earlier bridge were probably reused.|$|E

500|$|After an {{intersection}} with Edgewood Road, which is MD24's old alignment, the state highway meets I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. Immediately {{to the north}} of that interchange is a diamond interchange with the southern ends of MD924 (Emmorton Road) and <b>Tollgate</b> Road. MD924, which is the old alignment of MD24, and <b>Tollgate</b> Road parallel MD24 to the east and west, respectively. [...] The two highways serve residential subdivisions bypassed by MD24 between Edgewood and Bel Air; MD924 serves the village of Emmorton. [...] MD24 also passes close to the historic home Woodside, accessed via Singer Road; Woodview, found at the west end of Plumtree Road; and Whitaker's Mill Historic District on Ring Factory Road. [...] The state highway parallels Plumtree Run as it approaches Bel Air. [...] MD24 passes by Upper Chesapeake Medical Center before meeting US1Business (Belair Road) at {{an intersection}} surrounded by shopping centers, including the Harford Mall. [...] The state highway crosses over the Ma and Pa Trail, a rail trail that follows the abandoned right-of-way of the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad, and Heavenly Waters, a tributary of Winters Run, before reaching its junction with US1 (Bel Air Bypass).

40|$|A long queue {{can occur}} at <b>tollgates</b> {{due to the}} amount of {{transaction}} time required to perform ticket payment and toll fee collection. This problem can be addressed by the use of an electronic toll collection (ETC) system. A case study conducted on the Jakarta Intra Urban, Cikupa-Merak, and Cawang Pluit Toll Roads suggests that the queueing at the <b>tollgates</b> when modelled followed a Poisson distribution. The average cash transaction time was approximately 5 to 6 seconds, while the ETC transaction time was only 4 seconds. Furthermore, the capacity of the cash system gate was 550 to 620 vehicles/hour (which is above the minimum service standard of 450 vehicles/hour),whereas the electronic gate capacity was 770 to 870 vehicles/hour. This study demonstrates that the ETC system is more effective than the cash system in terms of reducing the number of queueing vehicles...|$|R

40|$|The {{starting}} point {{of this paper is}} that the collection costs of urban road pricing {{have turned out to be}} unexpectedly high. A comparative cost analysis of the congestion charging system of London, Stockholm, Oslo and Singapore also shows that there are large collection cost differences. The most striking difference is between Oslo and London. Oslo, like Stockholm has the necessary, natural, qualities for a central city toll ring with a limited number of entrances; just 18 and 19 <b>tollgates</b> are required. For large historic cities like London with hundreds of inlets to the central city, <b>tollgates</b> at every entrance would involve high investment costs and be very obtrusive in the street scene. The problem is, however, that the present London charging system, with no <b>tollgates,</b> shows high running costs, ten times higher than in Oslo, in spite of the fact that the charged number of vehicles is the same in the two cities. This is a formidable obstacle to alleviating urban traffic congestion in many big cities. The charging technology could hopefully be developed, however, another approach is to develop and combine other measures including traffic regulation, parking policy and public transport subsidisation, which would be only second-best in a hypothetical situation where road pricing is without costs. This paper focuses on parking policy. Two strands of parking policy reform are discussed; fringe benefit taxation of free workplace parking which has recently been introduced in Sweden and a two-part tariff at parking meters, which is suggested as an extension of congestion charging to all day traffic within the central city.
