5|$|During the Battle of Vergas, Ibrahim {{decided to}} attack the Maniots from the rear. His plan was to send a small fleet with a few {{soldiers}} to land at the Bay of Diros, 2 kilometers south of Areopolis. The aim of this was to capture the unguarded Areopoli, which cut the communication lines of the defenders at Vergas and demoralize them as well. He would <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> attack the Maniots from the rear and control the mountain passes to eastern Mani and Gytheio. Authors Peter Greenhalgh and Edward Eliopoulos describe this plan as excellent.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the film}} went into production, the {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, rather than in Portland, came after debate on how to match the locations that were introduced in the first film. One member involved in the decision process pointed out that Vancouver had been scouted as a potential setting for Twilight, {{and it was only}} because the U.S. dollar had, at that time, dropped below the Canadian dollar that Oregon drew Twilight principal photography to Portland and its surrounding areas. Vancouver was chosen because it allowed a higher production value, while the surrounding areas contained beautiful forests and gray weather. With this decision, however, came the issue of reconstructing key sets that were used in the first film. For the exterior of Forks High School, crew members were able to find a parking lot, but the school's steps needed to be filmed with a greenscreen backing to match those that were originally presented in Twilight. David Thompson Secondary School would <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> serve as the interior for the high school scenes.|$|E
5|$|Operation Cobra was the codename for an {{offensive}} {{launched by the}} First United States Army (Lieutenant General Omar Bradley) seven weeks after the D-Day landings, during the Normandy Campaign of World War II. The intention was {{to take advantage of}} the distraction of the Germans by the British and Canadian attacks around Caen, in Operation Goodwood and break through the German defenses that were penning in his troops, while the Germans were unbalanced. Once a corridor had been created, the First Army would <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> advance into Brittany, rolling up the German flanks once free of the constraints of the bocage country. After a slow start the offensive gathered momentum and German resistance collapsed as scattered remnants of broken units fought to escape to the Seine. Lacking the resources to cope with the situation, the German response was ineffectual and the entire Normandy front soon collapsed. Operation Cobra, together with concurrent offensives by the British Second Army and the Canadian First Army, was decisive in securing an Allied victory in the Normandy Campaign.|$|E

5|$|The biggest {{component}} of Árbenz's project of modernization was his agrarian reform bill. Árbenz drafted the bill {{himself with the}} help of advisers that included some leaders of the communist party as well as non-communist economists. He also sought advice from numerous economists from across Latin America. The bill was passed by the National Assembly on 17 June 1952, and the program went into effect immediately. The focus of the program was on transferring uncultivated land from large landowners to their poverty stricken laborers, who would <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> begin a viable farm of their own. Árbenz was also motivated to pass the bill because he needed to generate capital for his public infrastructure projects within the country. At the behest of the United States, the World Bank had refused to grant Guatemala a loan in 1951, which made the shortage of capital more acute.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{provided}} for a cash grant of $12.5 million (about $94 million at 2007 prices) to be disbursed to the Alaskan {{government in a}} number of phases, to fund the construction of mental health facilities in the territory. To meet the ongoing costs of the program, the bill transferred one million acres (4,000km²) of federally owned land in Alaska to the ownership of the proposed new Alaska Mental Health Trust as a grant-in-aid—the federal government owned about 99% of the land of Alaska at the time. The trust would <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> use the assets of the transferred land (principally mineral and forestry rights) to obtain an ongoing revenue stream to fund the Alaskan mental health program. Similar provisions had applied in other US territories to support the provision of public facilities prior to the achievement of statehood.|$|E
5|$|The largely free {{elections}} of 1950 were {{won by the}} popular Árbenz, and represented the first transfer of power between democratically elected leaders in Guatemala. Árbenz had personal ties to {{some members of the}} communist PGT, which was legalized during his government, and a couple of members played a role in drafting the new president's policies. Nonetheless, Árbenz did not try to turn Guatemala into a communist state, instead choosing a moderate capitalist approach. The PGT too committed itself to working within the existing legal framework to achieve its immediate objectives of emancipating peasants from feudalism and improving workers' rights. The most prominent component of Árbenz's policy was his agrarian reform bill. Árbenz drafted the bill himself, having sought advice from economists across Latin America. The focus of the law was on transferring uncultivated land from large landowners to poor laborers, who would <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> begin viable farms of their own.|$|E

25|$|Nakahashi's {{plan had}} been to secure the Sakashita Gate, then use {{flashlights}} to signal the nearby rebel troops at police headquarters to join him. Having gained control over access to the Emperor, the rebels would <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> prevent anyone but Honjō and others they approved of from seeing him. Nakahashi had difficulty contacting his allies, however, and by 08:00 Honma had learned of {{his involvement in the}} uprising. Nakahashi was ordered at gunpoint to leave the palace grounds. He did so, joining Kurihara at the Prime Minister's residence. His soldiers remained at the gate until they were relieved at 13:00, at which point they returned to their barracks. For this reason, these 75 soldiers {{were not included in the}} government's official tally of rebel forces.|$|E
25|$|Capturing {{them would}} deal a deathblow to the Egyptian's {{strategic}} {{operation in the}} entire Peninsula. The capture of these four objectives were hoped to be {{the means by which}} the entire Egyptian Army would rout and fall back into Egypt proper, which British and French forces would <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> push up against an Israeli advance, and crush in a decisive encounter. On 24 October, Dayan ordered a partial mobilization. When this led to a state of confusion, Dayan ordered full mobilization, and chose to take the risk that he might alert the Egyptians. As {{part of an effort to}} maintain surprise, Dayan ordered Israeli troops that were to go to the Sinai to be ostentatiously concentrated near the border with Jordan first, which was intended to fool the Egyptians into thinking that it was Jordan that the main Israeli blow was to fall on.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been some {{concerns}} over possible problems related to hydrogen gas leakage. Molecular hydrogen leaks slowly from most containment vessels. It has been hypothesized that if significant amounts of hydrogen gas (H2) escape, hydrogen gas may, because of ultraviolet radiation, form free radicals (H) in the stratosphere. These free radicals would <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> act as catalysts for ozone depletion. A large enough increase in stratospheric hydrogen from leaked H2 could exacerbate the depletion process. However, {{the effect of these}} leakage problems may not be significant. The amount of hydrogen that leaks today is much lower (by a factor of 10–100) than the estimated 10–20% figure conjectured by some researchers; for example, in Germany, the leakage rate is only 0.1% (less than the natural gas leak rate of 0.7%). At most, such leakage would likely be no more than 1–2% even with widespread hydrogen use, using present technology.|$|E

25|$|The {{core of the}} Assyrian army lay in its chariots. Originally these chariots {{were used}} as two-horse vehicles. The Ancient Egyptians and Sumerians used war chariots in this fashion as firing mobile {{platforms}} or as mobile command platforms; the elevated view would give the general some ability {{to see how the}} troops fared in battle. The Assyrians also used chariots in reconnaissance, carrying messages to and from the front lines, ans for battle. However, the rise of cavalry in the 1st millennium BC meant that by the 7th century BC, the chariot was demoted to combat duties only; lighter chariots consisting of two to three horses were later upgraded under the reign of Ashurnasirpal II to heavy four horse chariots. Such chariots could contain up to four men. Heavier chariots also found new roles, smashing into enemy formations and dispersing the infantry in the process. The Assyrian cavalry and infantry would <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> exploit the gap and rout the enemy, thereby taking the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|As {{seen in the}} {{dimorphism}} between queens and workers, castes can {{be determined}} based on both behavior and morphology. As part of the Epiponini tribe, A. pallipes is characterized by being neotropical, polygynous and in relative abundance. The queens’ primary job is to reproduce whereas the workers are charged with foraging for food, caring for the larvae and defending the nest. As necessary {{with this type of}} hierarchy, there must be a mechanism for distinguishing between females’ ability to reproduce in a social setting. This reproductive control or suppression has been recently credited to pre-imaginal caste determination via the mechanism of insemination. The lack of intermediate females (workers with developed ovaries) implies heavy control of reproduction. It is hypothesized that only with the advent of insemination, the female will <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> develop their ovaries adequately to become a layer. Observation has denoted that interactions among queen A. pallipes are unaggressive therefore implying that workers are most important in queen selection.|$|E
25|$|Having {{secured the}} coastal regions around the Jaba River, the {{squadron}} {{slowly began to}} move inland in order to strike into the enemy's rear, securing the many villages along the way. First they cleared to Sovele Mission, then the villages of Opai, Nihero and Morokaimoro, reaching Kilipaijino {{by the end of}} hostilities. As they went, each village taken became a patrol base and from there the squadron would gather topographical information such as track and terrain reports, and locate the enemy. Once sufficient information had been gathered and passed on to II Corps, the patrols would then attempt to ambush the enemy or try to take a prisoner. These raids were very effective in tying down the enemy and keeping them away from the 3rd Division's flanks, as they forced the Japanese to deploy troops to their rear areas, removing men from the front against which the larger infantry forces were <b>then</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> engage.|$|E
