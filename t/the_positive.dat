5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> reviews however, The Swarm {{failed to}} {{increase}} attendance. In fact, park gate figures fell by 200,000 following {{the addition of}} the coaster. The park as well as many others have blamed the park's branding from 2009 to 2012 as the issue.|$|E

5|$|In the Geiger–Marsden experiment, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden (colleagues of Rutherford {{working at}} his behest) shot alpha {{particles}} at thin sheets {{of metal and}} measured their deflection {{through the use of}} a fluorescent screen. Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high momentum of the alpha particles, and the low concentration of <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> charge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha particles to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection. To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy deflection. Rutherford concluded that <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> charge of the atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly.|$|E

Thallium(III) oxide, Tl2O3, is a black solid which decomposes above 800°C, forming the thallium(I) oxide and oxygen.|$|E
