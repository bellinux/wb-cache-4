40|$|IN this paper, first, {{we shall}} present {{a theory of}} rent in the {{agricultural}} sector characterized either by fixed-rent or by share <b>tenancy</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> (section I). Then we shall study some implications of this theory of rent. Specifically, it will be observed that the average product of land would tend to be smaller with a peasant farmer than with a fixed-rent or share tenant (section II). Furthermore, if the tenant consumes agricultural as well as non-agricultural products, it will be found {{that there is a}} major dilemma in determining the optimal terms of trade between agriculture and industry (non-agriculture). For the terms of trade which respectively maximize (a) the tenant's utility function, (b) the tenant's income, (c) the total agricultural production and rent, and (d) the marketed surplus of agricultural goods to be exchanged for industrial goods, are usually all different from each other. We shall, however, see that they may coincide only under a very restrictive condition (section III). I. A tenant's equilibrium and the rent Suppose that land is homogeneous; and that the production function is homogeneous of degree one in land and labour. The members of the tenant family are assumed to distribute the land, whatever it may be, equally among themselves for cultivation. Each member will be called a tenant. The amount of land per tenant thus being given, production depends only upon labour as follows: where q is output and I labour. The marginal product of labour, by assump-tion, either (i) becomes zero for a finite labour (I), with a maximum output q; or (ii) approaches zero asymptotically. 1 In other words, either q = ma,xq(l) = q(l), and q'(l) = 0, (2) or limg-'(Z) = 0. (3) Z->co The tenant has a utility function as given by u = u(xu x 2) (4) where u is utility, and xx and x % are the quantities of respectively agricultura...|$|E

50|$|The Newbiggin Jury is a {{relic of}} the old manorial system. Usually of twelve men, it was {{responsible}} for upholding law and order, administering the Poor Law of the Barony of Greystoke; and maintaining the common lands remaining after the Enclosure Act of 1775. These included public quarries, lanes and byways, village greens, lime kilns, common land and watering places. They were responsible for the employment and paying the wages of a rabbit and mole catcher, a quarryman and a carter. They also raised money to build the school and the adjoining schoolteacher's house.The Newbiggin Jury Records exist as far back as 1799. Among the entries are a resolution to sack the mole catcher for failing in his duty, the appointment of his replacement, and an account of the annual dinner held at Greystoke Castle for Jurymen.The Newbiggin Jury (and the neighbouring Stainton Jury) were active until the early 1980s. A challenge that they were not a legal entity was successful, and their duties and responsibilities were passed to Dacre Parish Council.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of widespread tree cultivation by local community {{in some countries}} {{during the last three}} decades has been explained by researchers with a macro perspective. This study is to understand the phenomenon at the micro level and from the native (peasant or farmer) point of view. This study aims to explain the tradition and changes in tree cultivation. Theoris economic system were used as the basis to explain the tradition and changes in tree cultivation in Rambahan village community of the Kuansing District and Ranggang Village community of Tanah Laut District. Case study method was used in this study. The data were collected  from informants through individual interviews and focused group discussions. The results of this study show that the cultivation of trees has been practiced and institutionalized in the everyday lives of local people and passed down from generation to generation, as well as a source of socio-economic stability of families. Factors that farmers take into consideration in the selection of tree crops to be cultivated are price, easy to sell, harvesting intensity, knowledge and skills, labor availability (particularly family labor), and capital availability. The results of this study also indicate that some elements of the economic system of Ranggang and Rambahan communities have the characteristics of capitalism adherent, while some other elements have the characteristics of pre-capitalism. In other words, two communities are in a transition between pre-capitalism and capitalism as shown in the practice of tree cultivation.
