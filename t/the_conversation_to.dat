5|$|When Beria told Stalin {{about the}} Manhattan Project and its {{importance}} Stalin handpicked Molotov {{to be the}} man in charge of the Soviet atomic bomb project. However, under Molotov's leadership the bomb, and the project itself, developed very slowly and Molotov was replaced by Beria in 1944 on the advice of Igor Kurchatov. When Harry S. Truman, the American president, told Stalin that the Americans had created a bomb never seen before, Stalin relayed <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> Molotov and told him to speed up development. On Stalin's orders the Soviet government substantially increased investment in the project.|$|E
25|$|Perverted-Justice {{functions}} {{by supporting}} volunteers who act as informants in chat rooms where children and minors can typically be found. The volunteers' public profiles have youthful-sounding usernames, young ages, {{and pictures of}} children. The administrators of the site {{say they do not}} initiate online contact with the users, and refuse to act on tips from the public as a result. If a user starts chatting to the volunteer and turns <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> sex, the volunteer responds positively and encourages them to divulge personal details, particularly a telephone number, ostensibly needed to verify their identity so that a meeting can be arranged.|$|E
25|$|The {{cocktail}} party effect is the phenomenon {{that a person}} hears his or her name even when not attending to <b>the</b> <b>conversation.</b> <b>To</b> study this, a screening measure for attentional control was given that tested a person’s ability {{to keep track of}} words while also doing math problems. Participants were separated into two groups---low and high span attentional control ability groups. They listened to two word lists read simultaneously by a male and a female voice and were told to ignore the male voice. Their name was read by the “ignored” male voice. Low span people were more likely to hear their name compared to high span people. This result suggests that people with lower attentional control ability have more trouble inhibiting information from the surrounding environment.|$|E

25|$|The Union {{building}} {{proved to}} be a location that was ideal for his crimes, both in providing victims, and in concealing the evidence of their murders. Sailors arriving in the port of Aberdeen would usually visit the Sailor's Union building soon after disembarking. There they could collect their mail and, if they wished, set some money aside in savings. Gohl would usually be on duty, alone. Typically Gohl would ask if the sailors had any family or friends in the area. Then he would turn <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> the topic of money and valuables. If the sailor was just passing through, and would not be missed by anyone in the area, and had more than a trivial amount of cash or valuables on hand, Gohl would choose him as his next victim.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson {{reported}} <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> Secretary of Foreign Affairs John Jay, who {{submitted the}} ambassador's comments and offer to Congress. Jefferson argued that paying tribute would encourage more attacks. Although John Adams agreed with Jefferson, {{he believed that}} circumstances forced the U.S. to pay tribute until an adequate navy could be built. The U.S. had just fought an exhausting war, which put the nation deep in debt. Federalist and Anti-Federalist forces argued over {{the needs of the}} country and the burden of taxation. Jefferson's own Democratic-Republicans and anti-navalists believed that {{the future of the country}} lay in westward expansion, with Atlantic trade threatening to siphon money and energy away from the new nation, to be spent on wars in the Old World. The U.S. paid Algiers the ransom, and continued to pay up to $1million per year over the next 15 years for the safe passage of American ships and the return of American hostages. A $1million payment in ransom and tribute to the privateering states amounted to approximately 10% of the U.S. government's annual revenues in 1800.|$|E
25|$|Brent tells Neil {{that he has}} a {{date for}} the Christmas party, when he really does not. With Gareth's help, he {{searches}} Internet romance websites for suitable women, and lines up three possible candidates for blind dates. He takes the first to dinner, but accidentally steers <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> breasts. He calls from his car to arrange a meeting with the second woman (voiced by Julia Davis), who does not realise who Brent is, and mocks the manager from The Office documentary. Brent hangs up. On the third date, Brent immediately finds the woman unattractive and boring. Dawn returns to Britain and arrives at the office. She and Tim immediately recreate old times by winding up Gareth. Brent pushes Neil's patience too far when he brings his dog into the office to show to the staff. Neil bars Brent from the office and later stops anyone who does not work for Wernham Hogg from going to the Christmas dinner. At the party, Brent anxiously awaits his fourth blind date. When the woman, Carol, arrives, she and Brent hit it off straight away. Lee tells Dawn {{that it is time to}} leave. She and Tim say awkward goodbyes and she leaves with Lee.|$|E

500|$|The Governor of Queensland, Sir Colin Hannah, gave {{a speech}} denigrating the Whitlam Government on 15 October, in {{violation}} of the convention that state governors remain neutral. Hannah held a dormant commission as Administrator of the Commonwealth to act as Governor-General in the event of Kerr's death, resignation, or absence from Australia. Whitlam immediately contacted Buckingham Palace to arrange for Hannah's dormant commission to be revoked, a process which took ten days to complete. Although Whitlam later alleged that he never contemplated dismissing Kerr during the crisis, on 16October, while speaking with Kerr and visiting Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, he told Kerr that if the crisis continued, [...] "It could be a question of whether I get to the Queen first for your recall, or whether you get in first with my dismissal". Kerr saw the statement as a threat; Whitlam later stated the comment was [...] "flippant" [...] and designed to turn <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> another subject.|$|E

500|$|The Rhodesian Cabinet {{waited in}} vain for Wilson's reply {{for the rest of}} 9 November and the next day. After briefly meeting Smith late on 10 November, Johnston warned Wilson that evening that the Rhodesians seemed poised to declare {{independence}} in the morning. The British Prime Minister tried repeatedly to call Smith, but did not get through until Smith was already chairing a Cabinet meeting on the independence issue around 08:00 Central Africa Time (06:00 in London) on 11 November. Wilson attempted to talk Smith out of unilateral action by telling him the status quo could continue, and the two argued inconclusively about the proposed Royal Commission. Returning to his Cabinet meeting, Smith reported <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> his ministers, and, after debating for a while, the Cabinet {{came to the conclusion that}} Wilson was simply attempting to buy more time and that there was no sign of actual progress. Smith asked if Rhodesia should declare its independence, and had each Cabinet minister answer in turn. According to Smith's account, [...] "each one, quietly but firmly, without hesitation, said: 'Yes'." ...|$|E
500|$|After surrendering, Diệm called Lodge by {{telephone}} {{for the last}} time. Lodge did not report <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> Washington, so it was widely assumed that the pair last spoke on the previous afternoon when the coup was just starting. However, after Lodge died in 1985, his aide, Colonel Mike Dunn said that Lodge and Diệm spoke {{for the last time}} around 07:00 on 2 November moments after Diệm surrendered. When Diệm called, Lodge [...] "put [...] on hold" [...] and then walked away. Upon his return, the ambassador offered Diệm and Nhu asylum, but would not arrange for transportation to the Philippines until the next day. This contradicted his earlier offer of asylum the previous day when he implored Diệm to not resist the coup. Dunn offered to personally go to the brothers' hideout to escort him so that the generals could not kill him, but Lodge refused, saying, [...] "We just can't get that involved." [...] Dunn said, [...] "I was really astonished that we didn't do more for them." [...] Having refused to help the brothers to leave the country safely, Lodge later said after they had been shot, [...] "What would we have done with them if they had lived? Every Colonel Blimp in the world would have made use of them." ...|$|E
500|$|A male-centred {{viewpoint}} dominated English-language {{comic books}} throughout the 20th century and, with few exceptions, placed women in subordinate roles as victims, helpers, or sex objects. [...] To academic Katie Mullins, Seth's narrative viewpoint follows from this tradition, though the book superficially has {{little in common}} with the masculine adventuring generally associated with mainstream comic books. [...] The author's female characters play peripheral roles, and the character's obsessive collecting and self-absorption alienate him from relationships with females, who at times encourage him to find meaning in life outside comics—advice he ignores. [...] The book highlights the overwhelmingly masculine homosociality of the collector's world, which Seth hints at with the name of the [...] "Book Brothers" [...] book store the character frequents. [...] In one panel, the store sign is obscured so that only [...] "Book Brothe" [...] is visible, suggesting a [...] "Book Brothel", and thus evoking the fetishism inherent in collecting. [...] The intelligent Ruthie provides a love interest that nevertheless manages only to feed Seth's self-absorption: he is attracted to her physically and also to her bookishness, but she takes second place in his life to his obsession with Kalo, whose real name she discovers for him. [...] Seth finds he does not know her well enough to give a satisfactory answer to Chester's [...] "So what's she like?" [...] Whenever she leads <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> her own thoughts and interests, Seth changes the subject. [...] She ends by leaving him.|$|E

500|$|Fall Out Boy {{was formed}} in 2001 in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette, Illinois by friends Pete Wentz and Joe Trohman. Wentz was a [...] "visible fixture" [...] of the {{relatively}} small Chicago hardcore punk scene of the late 1990s, performing in various groups such as Birthright, Extinction and First Born, as well the metalcore band Arma Angelus and the more political Racetraitor, [...] "a band that managed to land the covers of Maximumrocknroll and Heartattack fanzines before releasing a single note of music." [...] Wentz was growing dissatisfied with the changing mores of the community, which he viewed as a transition from political activism to an emphasis on moshing and breakdowns. With enthusiasm in Arma Angelus waning, he created a pop punk side project with Trohman as an [...] "easy and escapist" [...] project. Trohman met Patrick Stump, then a drummer for grindcore band Xgrinding processX {{and a host of}} other bands that [...] "never really managed," [...] at a Borders bookstore in Wilmette. While discussing Neurosis with a friend, Stump interrupted <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> correct their classification of the band in a conversation that soon shifted to the new band. Stump, viewing it as an opportunity to try out with [...] "local hardcore celebrity" [...] Wentz, directed Trohman to his MP3.com page, which contained sung-through acoustic recordings. Stump intended to try out as a drummer, but Trohman urged him to bring out his acoustic guitar; he impressed the duo with songs from Saves the Day's Through Being Cool. While Wentz wanted Racetraitor bandmate Andy Hurley in the group as drummer, Hurley appeared uninterested and too busy.|$|E
500|$|Back at Elsinore, Hamlet {{explains}} to Horatio {{that he had}} discovered Claudius's letter with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's belongings {{and replaced it with}} a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead. A foppish courtier, Osric, interrupts <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> deliver the fencing challenge to Hamlet. Hamlet, despite Horatio's pleas, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of wine Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her, but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius's plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor. Horatio, distraught at the thought of being the last survivor and living whilst Hamlet does not, says he will commit suicide by drinking the dregs of Gertrude's poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live on and tell his story. Hamlet dies in Horatio's arms, proclaiming [...] "the rest is silence". [...] Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching towards Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's deaths. Horatio promises to recount the full story of what happened, and Fortinbras, seeing the entire Danish royal family dead, takes the crown for himself, and orders a military funeral to honor Hamlet.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, Fazekas {{noted that}} the {{producers}} felt [...] "bad" [...] about the chances for a third season due to the series' low viewership, adding she [...] "would love to see it live on, even if it's in some other form, digital or whatever.

[...] She also added that ABC wanted some sort of conclusion to the series, and so the writers and producers {{would find a way}} to conclude the lingering plot threads in some form if the series was not renewed. On May 12, 2016, ABC canceled the series. Loeb said he did not understand the decision, as [...] "there were no conversations" [...] regarding the series, with Marvel only receiving a call from ABC saying Agent Carter was canceled. He added that since the networks decide what content they would like from Marvel Television, [...] "if someone wants to call and say, 'We want a two-hour Agent Carter [...] for May 2017,' [...] We'll put together the greatest Agent Carter movie we can.” Atwell added that she was also not part of <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> <b>to</b> cancel the series and called it [...] "a network political thing" [...] since ABC wanted Atwell to headline the more [...] "mainstream" [...] drama Conviction [...] "to get their ratings up" [...] instead of staying on Agent Carter, which Atwell felt had gained a [...] "cult following". After speculation regarding a revival for the series by Netflix, chief content officer Ted Sarandos stated the streaming service passed on reviving Agent Carter because it is [...] "looking for truly original brands to own and in that Marvel space we already have" [...] original Marvel series. He also added that due to existing international broadcasting [...] "deal complexities" [...] for the series, Netflix would not have been able to air Agent Carter globally, as [...] "Some of those output partners still had it on the air, so they would argue its covered by their output [...] Unfortunately, it was a business decision more than a creative one." ...|$|E
