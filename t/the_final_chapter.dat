5|$|Tom Savini {{agreed to}} return to make-up duties for <b>The</b> <b>Final</b> <b>Chapter</b> because he felt he {{should be the one}} to bring Jason full circle in terms of his look from child to man. Savini used his design from the {{original}} Friday the 13th, with the same practice of application as before, but molded from Ted White's face. Since Jason is not the actual killer in A New Beginning, it was not necessary to do any major designing for Jason's look. Only a head mask to cover the top and back of the head, like the one Brooker wore while wearing the hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who cites A New Beginning as almost a direct sequel to <b>The</b> <b>Final</b> <b>Chapter,</b> did base his head-mask on Tom Savini's design for <b>The</b> <b>Final</b> <b>Chapter.</b>|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>chapter</b> Cochrane {{argues that}} each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism.

If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E
