5|$|Unlike westernized instrumentation, {{there is}} no set tuning for kulintang sets {{throughout}} the Philippines. Great variation exist between each set {{due to differences in}} make, size and shape, alloy used giving each kulintang set a unique pitch level, intervals and timbre. Though the tuning varies greatly, there does exist some uniformity <b>to</b> <b>contour</b> when same melody heard on different kulintang sets. This common counter results in similar interval relationships of more or less equidistant steps between each of the gongs. This tuning system, not based upon equal temperament or upon a system of standard pitches but on a similar/certain pattern of large and small intervals, could also be found among the gamelan orchestras of western Indonesia. In fact, though the Maguindanao, Maranao and Tausug artists technically have no concept of scale (because emphasis placed on the concept of “rhythmic modes”), the Pelog and Slendro scales of Java were found to be most satisfactory to their own varying pentatonic/heptatonic scales.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the subjective rating of wheelchair comfort and discomfort (numerical rating scale questionnaire) and the duration of objective in-chair movement reduction "settling down time" following initial contact with the seating surface. Healthy young subjects (n =  22) sat for 5  min on contoured foam or wood cushion surfaces fitted to otherwise identical wheelchairs. Force sensing resistors attached to each quadrant of the sitting interface measured the relative movements of the subjects over time. A significant correlation was found between settling down time (SDT) and reported leg/feet discomfort (p =  0. 003; correlation co-efficient =  0. 44); and a significant negative correlation was found between SDT and overall comfort (p =  0. 015; correlation co-efficient = - 0. 36). When comparing cushion surfaces: SDT was significantly longer (p <  0. 0001) for subjects sitting on wood (5. 8  s) compared <b>to</b> <b>contoured</b> foam (3. 9  s); Leg/feet discomfort was significant higher (p =  0. 007) for subjects sitting on wood (1. 1 out of 10) compared <b>to</b> <b>contoured</b> foam (0. 3 out of 10); Overall discomfort was significant higher (p =  0. 009) for subjects sitting on wood (1. 3 out of 10) compared <b>to</b> <b>contoured</b> foam (0. 5 out of 10); Comfort was significantly lower (p =  0. 001) for subjects sitting on wood (6. 5 out of 10) compared <b>to</b> <b>contoured</b> foam (8. 3 out of 10); Support was significantly lower (p =  0. 001) for subjects sitting on wood (6. 4 out of 10) compared <b>to</b> <b>contoured</b> foam (8 out of 10). The {{results of this study}} suggest that the shape and firmness of the surface at the buttock-wheelchair interface can affect a subject's SDT following initial contact with the seat as well as their perception of comfort and discomfort. In addition, there appears to be a relationship between longer SDT's and increased discomfort ratings, and shorter SDT's and increased comfort ratings. Therefore, testing for SDT's may be useful in the indirect objective assessment of wheelchair cushions and possibly other types of seating surfaces with design differences that aim to improve comfort and minimize discomfort...|$|R
25|$|The {{administration}} of the colony was promoting a transition from horizontal farming which largely ignored terrain <b>to</b> <b>contour</b> farming which fits with the frame and women, who {{did most of the}} agricultural work, resisted the transition. At the same time an unfounded rumor spread that the Kom traditional land would be sold to either the chairman of the KNC or to Igbo people in Nigeria (the KNC at this point had a platform of having the region join with Nigeria).

25|$|Because the M2 tidal {{constituent}} dominates in most locations, {{the stage}} or {{phase of a}} tide, denoted by the time in hours after high water, is a useful concept. Tidal stage is also measured in degrees, with 360° per tidal cycle. Lines of constant tidal phase are called cotidal lines, which are analogous <b>to</b> <b>contour</b> lines of constant altitude on topographical maps. High water is reached simultaneously along the cotidal lines extending from the coast out into the ocean, and cotidal lines (and hence tidal phases) advance along the coast. Semi-diurnal and long phase constituents are measured from high water, diurnal from maximum flood tide. This and the discussion that follows is precisely true only for a single tidal constituent.|$|E
25|$|Like weaving, {{knitting}} is {{a technique}} for producing a two-dimensional fabric made from a one-dimensional yarn or thread. In weaving, threads are always straight, running parallel either lengthwise (warp threads) or crosswise (weft threads). By contrast, the yarn in knitted fabrics follows a meandering path (a course), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically {{above and below the}} mean path of the yarn. These meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than woven fabrics. Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motions, such as socks and hosiery. For comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the bias), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from stretchable material such as spandex. Knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them <b>to</b> <b>contour</b> to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further. Extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc. can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches. Thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the knitted fabric more bulk and less drape than a woven fabric.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{multiscale}} biologically motivated technique for contour detection by texture suppression. Standard edge detectors react to all the local luminance changes, irrespective whether they are due <b>to</b> the <b>contours</b> of the objects represented in the scene, rather than to natural texture like grass, foliage, water, etc. Moreover, edges due to texture are often stronger than edges due <b>to</b> true <b>contours.</b> This implies that further processing is needed <b>to</b> discriminate true <b>contours</b> from texture edges. In this contribution we exploit the fact that, in a multiresolution analysis, at coarser scales, only the edges due <b>to</b> object <b>contours</b> are present while texture edges disappear. This is used in combination with surround inhibition, a biologically motivated technique for texture suppression, in order <b>to</b> build a <b>contour</b> detector which is insensitive to texture. The experimental results show that our approach is also robust to additive noise...|$|R

40|$|Human {{electrophysiological}} studies {{support a}} model whereby sensitivity <b>to</b> so-called illusory <b>contour</b> stimuli is first seen within the lateral occipital complex. A challenge to this model posits that the lateral occipital complex {{is a general}} site for crude region-based segmentation, based on findings of equivalent hemodynamic activations in the lateral occipital complex <b>to</b> illusory <b>contour</b> and so-called salient region stimuli, a stimulus class that lacks the classic bounding contours of illusory contours. Using high-density electrical mapping of visual evoked potentials, we show that early lateral occipital cortex activity is substantially stronger <b>to</b> illusory <b>contour</b> than <b>to</b> salient region stimuli, whereas later lateral occipital complex activity is stronger to salient region than <b>to</b> illusory <b>contour</b> stimuli. Our results suggest that equivalent hemodynamic activity <b>to</b> illusory <b>contour</b> and salient region stimuli probably reflects temporally integrated responses, {{a result of the}} poor temporal resolution of hemodynamic imaging. The temporal precision of visual evoked potentials is critical for establishing viable models of completion processes and visual scene analysis. We propose that crude spatial segmentation analyses, which are insensitive <b>to</b> illusory <b>contours,</b> occur first within dorsal visual regions, not the lateral occipital complex, and that initial illusory contour sensitivity {{is a function of the}} lateral occipital complex...|$|R
2500|$|Extended wear {{hearing aids}} are hearing devices that are non-surgically {{placed in the}} ear canal by a hearing professional. [...] The {{extended}} wear hearing aid represents the first [...] "invisible" [...] hearing device. These devices are worn for 1–3 {{months at a time}} without removal. [...] They are made of soft material designed <b>to</b> <b>contour</b> to each user and can be used by people with mild to moderately severe hearing loss. Their close proximity to the ear drum results in improved sound directionality and localization, reduced feedback, and improved high frequency gain. While traditional BTE or ITC hearing aids require daily insertion and removal, extended wear hearing aids are worn continuously and then replaced with a new device. [...] Users can change volume and settings without the aid of a hearing professional. The devices are very useful for active individuals because their design protects against moisture and earwax and can be worn while exercising, showering, etc. [...] Because the device’s placement within the ear canal makes them invisible to observers, extended wear hearing aids are popular with those who are self-conscious about the aesthetics of BTE or ITC hearing aid models. As with other hearing devices, compatibility is based on an individual’s hearing loss, ear size and shape, medical conditions, and lifestyle. [...] The disadvantages include regular removal and reinsertion of the device when the battery dies, inability to go underwater, earplugs when showering, and for some discomfort with the fit since it is inserted deeply in the ear canal, {{the only part of the}} body where skin rests directly on top of bone.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{research into}} pattern cutting via mould-making techniques for body conscious, contoured clothing {{used in the}} theatrical costume industry (film, television and theatre). With their considerable experience as costume makers, the authors recognized a gap in knowledge and documentation for this approach to pattern cutting. The intentions were to expand the range of techniques available for theatrical costume professionals, allowing practitioners to draw complex style lines directly onto the body shape and onto inanimate objects. The research explored different approaches {{through a series of}} three-dimensional experiments, which included contouring the body with moulds to achieve sculptural or abstract forms and discovering the capabilities, advantages and restrictions of the technique. The enquiry includes a variety of methodologies, which investigated the practical, technical and historical background <b>to</b> <b>contoured</b> pattern cutting. Object-based research considered the design and manufacture of body conscious garments. Action-based research and semi-structured interviews with practitioners, considered the skills costume makers use <b>to</b> produce <b>contoured</b> clothing and the ethics connected with drawing styles directly onto the human body.
