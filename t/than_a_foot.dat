5|$|As {{the team}} {{advanced}} to the front, they were brought under heavy enemy rifle, grenade and mortar fire. Just as the three had reached the front lines, a Japanese grenade landed among them. It was less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung himself on the grenade, taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by grenade fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E
5|$|Two {{or three}} feet of snow may turn into less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> of ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow outwards. Ice is lost {{at the edges of}} the glacier to icebergs, or to summer melting, and the overall shape of the glacier does not change much with time. The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is {{desirable}} to drill deep ice cores at places where there is very little flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.|$|E
25|$|The 2002 {{season was}} the worst season for Brann in twelve seasons. Brann {{finished}} third from the bottom and had to play play-off {{to stay in the}} top league. Fortunately for Brann (equally unfortunately for Sandefjord, their opponent) the matches ended 0–0 (away), 2–1 (home), and Brann narrowly avoided relegation after a Sandefjord shot went less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> wide in injury time.|$|E

25|$|A behind, worth 1 point, is scored {{when the}} ball passes between a goal post and a behind post at any height, or if the ball hits a goal post, or if any player sends the ball between the goal posts by {{touching}} it with {{any part of the}} body other <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot.</b> A behind is also awarded to the attacking team if the ball touches any part of an opposition player, including his foot, before passing between the goal posts. When an opposition player deliberately scores a behind for the attacking team (generally as a last resort to ensure that a goal is not scored) this is termed a rushed behind. As of the 2009 AFL season, a free kick is awarded against any player who deliberately rushes a behind.|$|E
500|$|In central Greenland {{a typical}} year might produce {{two or three}} feet of winter snow, plus {{a few inches of}} summer snow. [...] When this turns to ice, the two layers will make up no more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> of ice. [...] The layers {{corresponding}} to the summer snow will contain bigger bubbles than the winter layers, so the alternating layers remain visible, which makes it possible to count down a core and determine the age of each layer. [...] As the depth increases {{to the point where the}} ice structure changes to a clathrate, the bubbles are no longer visible, and the layers can no longer be seen. [...] Dust layers may now become visible. [...] Ice from Greenland cores contains dust carried by wind; the dust appears most strongly in late winter, and appears as cloudy grey layers. [...] These layers are stronger and easier to see at times in the past when the earth's climate was cold, dry, and windy.|$|E
500|$|St Stephen's Chapel {{remained}} largely unchanged until 1692 when Sir Christopher Wren, {{at the time}} the Master of the King's Works, was instructed to make structural alterations. He lowered the roof, removed the stained glass windows, put in a new floor and covered the original gothic architecture with wood panelling. He also added galleries from which the public could watch proceedings. The result was described by one visitor to the chamber as [...] "dark, gloomy, and badly ventilated, and so small... when an important debate occurred... the members were really to be pitied". When the future Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone remembered his arrival as a new MP in 1832, he recounted [...] "What I may term corporeal conveniences were... marvellously small. I do not think that in any part of the building it afforded the means of so much as washing the hands." [...] The facilities were so poor that, in debates in 1831 and 1834, Joseph Hume, a Radical MP, called for new accommodation for the House, while his fellow MP William Cobbett asked [...] "Why are we squeezed into so small a space that it is absolutely impossible that there should be calm and regular discussion, even from circumstance alone... Why are 658 of us crammed into a space that allows each of us no more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> and a half square?" ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 22, 1905, when Mascot {{could not}} {{navigate}} above the forks due to low water, its owners, the Kamm line, leased the gasoline launch Dix {{to provide service}} to points above the forks, including La Center. [...] Dix was owned by Thomas Byers, who had been operating the launch in Portland harbor since {{the opening of the}} Lewis and Clark Exposition on June 1, 1905. [...] Dix could carry 12 passengers, and drew less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> of water when loaded.|$|E
2500|$|The hammer throw {{was one of}} {{the events}} in which the American team was not as strong as at the 1924 Games. Ed [...] "Rip" [...] Black, the {{eventual}} Trials winner and Olympic bronze medalist, was only fifth after the qualifying rounds and the last man to make the final; in the final he improved by almost eight feet and won. Matt McGrath, the 1912 Olympic champion, nearly qualified for his fifth consecutive Olympics; he missed fourth place by less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot.</b> In the javelin the top Americans were evenly matched; IC4A champion Hines also won at the Trials, with defending AAU champion Harlow the runner-up ahead of Sager and Bartlett. None of the four made an impact in Amsterdam.|$|E

2500|$|Including {{all three}} parts, the Serpent Mound extends about , and varies in height from less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> {{to more than}} three feet (30–100cm). Conforming to {{the curve of the}} land on which it rests, with its head {{approaching}} a cliff above a stream, the serpent winds back and forth for more than eight hundred feet and seven coils, and ends in a triple-coiled tail. The serpent head has an open mouth extending around the east end of a -long hollow oval feature that may represent the snake eating an egg, though some scholars posit that the oval feature symbolizes the sun, the body of a frog, or merely the remnant of a platform. The effigy's extreme western feature is a triangular mound approximately [...] at its base and long axis. There are serpent effigies in Scotland and Ontario that are very similar.|$|E
2500|$|This {{event was}} the second of four nor'easters during the 2009-2010 winter that brought heavy snow to enough of the Northeast's {{population}} to be numerically recognized by NOAA's NESIS intensity rating. [...] The first and third of these systems, the December 2009 Nor'Easter and the February 9–10, 2010 North American blizzard, respectively, combined with this event to bring the snowiest winter on record {{to much of the}} Mid-Atlantic. [...] Additionally, this event {{was the second}} of three major Mid-Atlantic snowstorms that occurred over a 12-day period; each subsequent storm focused its heaviest snow slightly farther north: the January 30, 2010 storm (not recognized by NESIS) dropped more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> of snow across Virginia and the lower Chesapeake Bay region, while the February 9–10, 2010 North American blizzard bulls-eyed the Maryland-Pennsylvania border with as much as 38.3 inches.|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese beachheads {{from which}} the Kokoda {{campaign}} was launched were located about three key positions along a [...] stretch of the north coast of New Guinea: Gona to the west, Buna {{to the east and}} Sanananda–Giruwa in the centre. Roughly [...] northeast of Port Moresby, it approximates to the most direct line from there to the north coast. The settlements are located on a thin coastal strip that separates the sea from a tidal forest swamp of mangroves, nipa and sago. Rivers flowing across the broad, flat, coastal plain from the Owen Stanley Range disappear into the swamps and discharge to the sea through many coastal creeks. The coastal strip is rarely more than a few hundred yards at its widest, to little more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> pad separating the swamp from the sea. The few paths through the swamp were seldom more than [...] wide.|$|E

2500|$|The Minnesota Vikings' U.S. Bank Stadium faced {{a similar}} controversy; because the Minneapolis offices of Wells Fargo, a rival {{to the new}} stadium's naming rights sponsor U.S. Bank, are located within the {{vicinity}} of the stadium, Wells Fargo agreed to only install [...] "non-mounted," [...] non-illuminated signage on its building, such as letters painted directly onto the roof. After the original agreement was reached, Wells Fargo had asked the team to allow the installation of [...] "raised, illuminated lettering. mounted on beams more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> above the roof rather than painted on the roof as agreed upon". Such signage would be visible in overhead views of U.S. Bank Stadium (such as camera shots during event telecasts), Wells Fargo threatened to light the entire rooftops of its offices if the Vikings chose to deny the requested change. In December 2015, the Vikings sued Wells Fargo for violating the agreement, after they began to construct an illuminated sign on their rooftop. On June 23, 2016, Judge Donovan W. Frank ruled in favor of the Vikings, and ordered Wells Fargo to remove the raised, illuminated signage.|$|E

There have been reported cases of even larger moose, including a bull that reportedly scaled , but none are authenticated and some may not be considered reliable. Behind only the two species of bison, the moose is the second largest land animal in both North America and Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Paxes with {{elaborate}} metalwork framing an image {{in a medium}} that would withstand kissing and wiping are the sort that have been most likely to survive. Other objects that might {{seem to have had}} another purpose, such as plaquettes, ivory panels or small painted enamel plaques, may have been made for a pax. [...] Equally other objects began life as serving some other purpose, and were turned into paxes. Some still have a metal fitting at the rear, either a handle or a slot for a long wooden handle to fit into (a few of these survive). Glass or rock crystal over an image below allowed the image to be kissed repeatedly but not damaged, and enamel also wore relatively well. [...] Carved shell and mother of pearl are sometimes used. [...] Even with a frame paxes are usually less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> high, and the images often 4 to 6 inches high. [...] The inventory of the royal treasure of King Richard II of England lists many paxes among its nearly 1,200 items, including two of plain ungilded silver with red crosses, which Jenny Stratford suggests were for use in Lent. [...] Several record who gave them, or from whom they were seized for offences.|$|E
