5|$|Built {{at a cost}} {{of about}} £300,000, Tubantia was, {{according}} to author Nigel Pickford, one of the most luxurious passenger ships of the era. Royal Holland Lloyd made extensive use of electricity throughout Tubantia, powering everything from fans and ventilation, <b>to</b> <b>laundry</b> equipment, to cigar lighters for passengers. The ship also boasted her name spelled out in lights, suspended between the two funnels. Tubantia could accommodate up to 1,520 passengers: 250 first-class, 230 intermediate-class, 140 special third-class, and 900 third-class passengers. The liner was launched on 13 November 1913, and completed trials in the River Clyde in March 1914.|$|E

2500|$|A Roadblock is a {{task that}} only one team member may perform. A Roadblock clue is given as a cryptic question, such as [...] "Who's really hungry?" [...] (leading to task {{involving}} exotic food) or [...] "Who wants to get down and dirty?" [...] (for a task related <b>to</b> <b>laundry).</b> Based on this information and observation of any other racers at the task, the team must decide which member will complete the task before reading the full task description. Once a team announces its decision of who will complete the Roadblock, it cannot be taken back. The Roadblock task is performed only by the selected racer while his or her partner waits in a designated area, although the partner is usually able to supply words of encouragement and advice. Further, unless directed by the task instructions, the selected racer can gain help from other racers that have been selected to do the Roadblock or from locals. Some Roadblocks may involve the non-selected racer, such as leading a camel his or her partner rides, or helping his or her partner solve a puzzle. On completing the Roadblock, the selected racer receives their next clue which they then return to their partner to read. If a racer cannot finish a Roadblock, or opts to quit the Roadblock, the team must take a four-hour penalty, which either starts when the next team arrives at the roadblock, or if all teams are present, when they reach the Pit Stop for that leg. Some legs feature two Roadblocks, often {{the first and the}} final legs when this occurs. The second Roadblock in such cases generally require that the non-participating racer from the first Roadblock perform that one.|$|E
