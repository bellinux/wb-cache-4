5|$|<b>Trespass</b> in English law {{is an area}} of {{tort law}} broadly divided into three groups: <b>trespass</b> to the person, <b>trespass</b> to goods and <b>trespass</b> to land.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} what mental element is {{expected}} in cases of <b>trespass</b> to goods; while <b>trespass</b> to the person requires intent, the requirements for <b>trespass</b> to goods have never been tested in court. The common remedy is damages, which may be awarded regardless of if any actual harm is suffered; where there is damage, the defendant will only be liable {{if he could have}} reasonably foreseen it, as in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (No 5). Valid defences are those of statutory authority, consent, where it is necessary to interfere with the goods, or jus tertii.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} tackle the problem {{to reduce the number}} of <b>trespasser</b> {{fatalities}} it is important to broaden the knowledge related to <b>trespassing.</b> Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the sites of frequent <b>trespassing</b> on Finnish railways, to investigate <b>trespassing</b> behaviour and characteristics at selected sites, and to explore opinions about possible countermeasures to prevent <b>trespassing.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{some regions}} of the world, a {{property}} owner may use reasonable (typically meaning nondeadly) force to prevent a person from <b>trespassing</b> on his, her or its land, or to expel a <b>trespasser.</b> However, a property owner may not force a <b>trespasser</b> off his land if doing so would expose the <b>trespasser</b> to a risk of serious injury. For example, a <b>trespasser</b> who takes shelter in a stranger's barn during a powerful storm cannot be expelled until the storm is over.|$|R
5|$|The Bill of Middlesex {{exploited}} the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex. Prior {{to the introduction}} of bills, a writ would have to be issued, with different writs depending on the issue. If A wished to sue B for <b>trespass,</b> debt and detinue, the court would have to issue an individual writ for each action, with associated delays and costs for A, and then ensure that B appeared in court. Bills, on the other hand, were traditionally used against court officials and the court's prisoners; as such, the defendant was assumed to already be in the court's custody and presence in court was unnecessary. Thus a legal fiction arose; if A wished to sue B for <b>trespass,</b> debt and detinue, he would have a writ issued for <b>trespass.</b> B would be arrested as a result, and the detinue and debt actions undertaken by bill after he had been detained. Eventually it became even more fictitious; if A wished to sue B merely for debt and detinue, a <b>trespass</b> writ would be obtained and then quietly dismissed when B was detained in custody. This was originally undertaken through getting a writ of <b>trespass</b> from the Chancery, but eventually a shorter workaround was used; as the King's Bench retained criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex, the <b>trespass</b> (which was fictitious anyway) would be said to have occurred in that county, allowing the King's Bench to issue its own bill of arrest. This became known as the Bill of Middlesex, and undermined the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, which normally dealt with such civil cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{black swan}} of <b>trespass</b> on alien waters.|$|E
5|$|The general {{principle}} {{is that a}} <b>trespass</b> to the person must be a direct and intentional act, while if it was indirect or unintentional the tort of negligence is more appropriate, as established in Letang v Cooper. The tort of <b>trespass</b> to the person contains three possible types; assault, battery and false imprisonment.|$|E

30|$|RESTRAIL {{research}} started {{through an}} extensive {{collection and analysis}} of data about railway suicides and <b>trespassing</b> accidents. The work resulted in {{a description of the}} state-of-the-art based on a literature review, up-to-date statistics on railway suicides and <b>trespassing</b> accidents compiled from different sources, information on possible countermeasures to prevent railway suicides and <b>trespassing</b> accidents, and analysis of the consequences of railway suicides and <b>trespassing</b> accidents (see [7] for detailed review).|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{given that}} a {{substantial}} number of interviewed trespassers considered <b>trespassing</b> to be safe and so many trespassers assumed that <b>trespassing</b> is legal, it is worth considering information campaigns to raise awareness of the illegality of <b>trespassing</b> and the dangers related to it as one form of preventing <b>trespassing.</b> Finnish Rail Agency is participating in the Operation Lifesaver, which is a non-profit, international, public education programme (originally from the United States) to prevent collisions, deaths and injuries at highway-rail grade crossings and on railroad rights-of-way [11]. Therefore, the support of Operation Lifesaver should be considered when campaigning to prevent <b>trespassing.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{recovery}} of the King's Bench was thanks to its use of Chancery-like procedure; centrally, the system of bills. Prior to this, a writ {{would have to be}} issued, with different writs depending on the issue. If A wished to sue B for <b>trespass,</b> debt and detinue, the court would have to issue an individual writ for each action, with associated time delays and costs for A, and then ensure that B appeared in court. Bills, on the other hand, were traditionally used against court officials and the court's prisoners; as such, the defendant was assumed to already be in the court's custody and presence in court was not needed. Thus a legal fiction arose; if A wished to sue B for <b>trespass,</b> debt and detinue, he would have a writ issued for <b>trespass.</b> B would be arrested as a result, and the covenant, detinue and debt actions undertaken by bill after he had been detained. Eventually it became even more fictitious; if A wished to sue B merely for debt and detinue, a <b>trespass</b> writ would be obtained and then quietly dismissed when B was detained in custody. This was originally undertaken through getting a writ of <b>trespass</b> from the Chancery, but eventually a shorter workaround was used; since the King's Bench retained criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex, the <b>trespass</b> (which was fictitious anyway) would be said to have occurred there, allowing the King's Bench to issue a bill of arrest on its own. This became known as the Bill of Middlesex, and undermined the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, which would normally deal with such civil cases.|$|E
5|$|Land {{is defined}} as the surface, subsoil, {{airspace}} and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses. The rights of landowners over airspace are not unlimited; in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd, the action for <b>trespass</b> failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred metres above the land. This was backed up by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which provides that it is not <b>trespass</b> if the aircraft is flying at a reasonable height. An overhanging crane can constitute <b>trespass,</b> as in Woolerton v Costain, as can an advertising sign, as in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. Possession does not necessarily mean the ownership of land, but the right to eject or exclude others from it.|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Middlesex was a {{legal fiction}} {{used by the}} Court of King's Bench to gain {{jurisdiction}} over cases traditionally in the remit of the Court of Common Pleas. Hinging on the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over the county of Middlesex, the Bill allowed it to take cases traditionally in the remit of other common law courts by claiming that the defendant had committed <b>trespass</b> in Middlesex. Once the defendant was in custody, the <b>trespass</b> complaint would be quietly dropped and other complaints (such as debt or detinue) would be substituted.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} the survey {{directed}} at engine drivers revealed approximately 100 problematic sites. On average about 40 daily trespassers could be observed at selected research sites. The trespassers were typically adults and males. The answers from <b>trespasser</b> interviews showed that {{the main reason for}} <b>trespassing</b> is taking a short cut. Half of the respondents assessed that the <b>trespassing</b> is safe and 15 % assumed that <b>trespassing</b> is legal. Furthermore, they indicated that the most effective measures to prevent <b>trespassing</b> is fencing the tracks or building an underpass. In fact, the engine drivers usually indicated the same measures.|$|R
30|$|This study {{identified}} {{the sites of}} frequent <b>trespassing</b> on Finnish railways, investigated <b>trespassing</b> behaviour at selected sites, and explored opinions about preventive measures.|$|R
5000|$|The {{amendment}} {{states that}} [...] "the new offence will be committed {{where a person}} is in a residential building as a <b>trespasser</b> having entered it as a <b>trespasser,</b> knows or ought {{to know that he}} or she is a <b>trespasser</b> and is living in the building or intends to live there for any period." ...|$|R
5|$|The Court of Appeals {{held that}} Blacksmith could {{independently}} bring the claim for <b>trespass,</b> {{for which he}} need only show a right to possession. The Court of Appeals also held that Fellows' title was invalid, because the payment of compensation was a condition precedent. Welles, in dissent, agreed that Blacksmith could individually sue for <b>trespass,</b> but disagreed that the appraisal was a condition precedent; he would have reversed and granted a new trial, with costs. The Court of Appeals remanded back to the Supreme Court, after which a writ of error was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|On 1 June 2007 the {{building}} and its curtilage were designated as a protected site {{for the purposes of}} Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The effect of the act was to make it a specific criminal offence for a person to <b>trespass</b> onto the site.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Texas filed a <b>trespass</b> to try title suit {{to reclaim}} the lake bed for the state. In Welder v. State, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin {{declared}} the lake permanent and navigable-in-fact, granting the bed to the state under {{the purview of the}} Texas Game, Fish and Oyster Commission (later Texas Parks and Wildlife Department). Without permission from the Texas Attorney General, the Texas Land Commissioner then sold the bed to a private buyer for agricultural use in 1918. In the 1948 case of State v. Bryan, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin upheld the sale as valid under color of law, and immune from a <b>trespass</b> to try title suit due to the one-year statute of limitations on land sales. However, under the Texas Water Rights Adjudication Act of 1967, Green Lake was classified as a public body of water. The Supreme Court of Texas affirmed this classification in 1988, rejecting the argument of the bed's then-owner {{that it was not a}} lake by definition, but a natural depression flooded with surface runoff.|$|E
30|$|Because of a {{substantial}} overlap among identified sites, approximately 100 unique locations could be identified. <b>Trespassing</b> seems to concentrate near big cities where the population density {{is high and}} rail traffic is dense. In addition, <b>trespassing</b> {{was seen as a}} communal problem. Based on the returned survey forms it was possible to identify some locations where people from all the age groups were frequently <b>trespassing.</b> At these locations people do not necessarily consider <b>trespassing</b> as wrong and they may not understand the risk incurred by it.|$|R
50|$|Any {{person who}} is in a {{building}} or is on land as a <b>trespasser</b> whilst having a firearm with them commits the offence of <b>trespassing</b> with a firearm. It is immaterial whether or not they have any ammunition with them at the time or whether they actually intend to use it at the place in which they were <b>trespassing.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Trespassing</b> {{was most}} common between 11  a.m. and 7  p.m. The quietest phase was between 11  p.m. and 6  a.m., when only 2.3 % of <b>trespasses</b> occurred.|$|R
5|$|McCormack {{starred in}} the science-fiction film Alien <b>Trespass</b> (2009), in which he played Doctor Ted Lewis, who gets possessed by an alien marshal, Urp, after he crash-lands on Earth. When asked about his {{interpretation}} on the character, McCormack commented that his first instinct was to make Ted Lewis more alien, sounding like Spock. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Shepton {{benefits}} from a sizeable park, {{a gift of}} land from a local man, John Kyte Collett. As a boy he {{was thrown out of}} the grounds of local estates for <b>trespass</b> so in later life he purchased and gave land to the town to provide a public space; this park, which opened in 1906, is called Collett Park in his honour.|$|E
5|$|The {{suit was}} {{originally}} brought by John Blacksmith in 1846. Represented by lawyer John H. Martindale, Blacksmith sued Joseph Fellows and Robert Kendle, {{agents of the}} Land Company, for the torts of assault and battery and <b>trespass,</b> quare clausum fregit, with the sawmill as the locus in quo. Blacksmith's wife and Ely S. Parker (Blacksmith's successor as sachem of the Wolf Clan), together the administrators of Blacksmith's estate, succeeded Blacksmith as plaintiffs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Trespassing</b> etc. {{on nuclear}} sites (Section 12): Extends a {{previous}} ban on <b>trespassing,</b> {{imposed by the}} Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, to cover any nuclear site.|$|R
30|$|During 19  days of {{measurement}} {{a total of}} 1, 954 <b>trespasses</b> were detected. More {{than half of them}} occurred at location 3. During days when the camera was working all the time, some 70 <b>trespasses</b> occurred at location 3. The corresponding numbers at location 1 and 2 were 18 and 34, respectively. This amounts to roughly 40 daily <b>trespasses</b> by location on average.|$|R
50|$|Two days later, on July 6, 1993, Stahl {{was arrested}} for <b>trespassing</b> when he refused to leave the jail property. A jury, in 1994, found Stahl not guilty of <b>trespassing.</b>|$|R
5|$|Andrew married Fenenna, the {{daughter}} of Ziemomysł of Kuyavia, {{before the end of}} 1290. Andrew then held a general assembly for the barons and the noblemen of five counties to the east of the river Tisza—Bihar, Kraszna, Szabolcs, Szatmár, and Szolnok—at Nagyvárad (now Oradea in Romania) in early 1291. The assembly outlawed Stephen Balogsemjén, a staunch supporter of the late LadislausIV, for major <b>trespass.</b> From the assembly, Andrew went to Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia in Romania). Here he issued the decrees of his 1290 diet at the assembly of the local noblemen, Saxons, Székelys and Romanians, in February or March. Around the same time, Andrew dismissed Amadeus Aba and made Ivan Kőszegi palatine.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Catawba {{sued the}} state of South Carolina and 76 public and private land-owning entities, as named representatives of a {{defendant}} class estimated at 27,000 persons. The tribe contended that the Treaty of Nation Ford was void because of the federal Nonintercourse Act and because the state had not {{lived up to its}} obligations (by delaying the purchase for 2.5 years, by spending only $2,000 on the new reservation, and buying land for the new reservation from within the old reservation). The tribe sought both possession of the lands and 140 years of <b>trespass</b> damages. The Catawba were represented by the Native American Rights Fund (NARF).|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the band's studio albums from <b>Trespass</b> to Calling All Stations were {{digitally}} remastered by Nick Davis {{across three}} box sets: Genesis 1970–1975, Genesis 1976–1982 and Genesis 1983–1998. Each album {{is presented as}} a two-disc set containing a CD/Super Audio CD of a new stereo mix and a DVD with a 5.1 surround sound mix and bonus features including previously unreleased live performances, interviews, and concert programs. Two DVD box sets followed, Genesis Live 1973–2007 and Genesis Movie Box 1981–2007, in 2009.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} a nuno to {{successfully}} curse a person, the <b>trespasser</b> must come in close proximity of the nuno. If the <b>trespasser</b> is within range, the Nuno can spit on {{any part of the}} trespasser's body. The <b>trespasser</b> will then experience aches or soreness on the affected part of the body, such as stomach pains, swollen genitals (after urinating on the mound), or swollen feet (after kicking the mound).|$|R
50|$|The Court {{also held}} {{that in order}} for force to be reasonable, the person using it will {{normally}} need to have given a <b>trespasser</b> notice that they are <b>trespassing</b> and a reasonable opportunity to leave. In addition, the Court held that a defendant could not rely on a mistaken belief as to whether they were in peaceable possession of the land or whether the other party was <b>trespassing.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... 40 activists {{were arrested}} by cantonal police before noon {{and the others}} in the evening. 58 activists were {{reported}} to the Public Prosecutor for <b>trespassing.</b> The nuclear operator Axpo submitted a criminal complaint for <b>trespassing.</b>|$|R
