At around 7 a.m, an explosion had been heard by the security guard, Sudhir Kumar, who along with his friend found smoke in the transformer room. The fire brigade and the Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) were informed and the fire was brought under control by 7.25 a.m. Inspection of the transformer by the Superintendent of the DVB and his team revealed that three of the low <b>tension</b> <b>cable</b> leads of the transformer had been partially burnt. At about 10.30 a.m., Inspectors from DVB along with Senior Fitter, conducted repairs on the transformer by replacing two aluminium sockets on the B-Phase of the low <b>tension</b> <b>cable</b> leads. The repairs, it appears, were carried out with the help of a die and hammer without the use of a crimping machine. DVB completed their repairs between 10:30 am and 11 am.

In the process of solving the dynamic differential equation of <b>tension</b> <b>cable,</b> the effects of boundary conditions on the natural frequencies of external prestressed tendons are analyzed.

With the same tensioning force, the relative variance decreases with the increase of cable length. In the practical test, only the upper and lower bound limits can be obtained according to the measured prestressed tendon frequencies, while the real effective prestress values are between them.

40|$|Introduction: Aluminium {{is widely}} used {{in a lot of}} {{applications}} due to his versatile properties; it has the electrical conductivity (37, 7 × 106 S/m) and thermal conductivity (237 W/m·K) of a metal with a relative low density (2. 7 g/cm 3) and a good resistance to oxidation. For this reason it has been used for decades in structural application (aeronautic industry) and for electronic application (high <b>tension</b> <b>cable).</b> Unfortunately the mechanical properties are not so promising. In order to improve the mechanical properties of this metal, “Carbon nanotube (CNT) Reinforced Aluminum” are studied even if the number of papers in the literature is decidedly lower by comparing with “Carbon Reinforced Polymers”. This occurs because of the difficulty in the preparation of a composite with a good rate of dispersion of CNTs due, for example, to the low wettability between metal and carbon. Usually it is avoided the preparation of composites by melted metal because of the possibility of carbide formation with a consequent decreasing of several properties. The most used way to prepare CNTs aluminium composites is the powder metallurgy that allows the possibility to mix nanoparticles with aluminium powder to obtain a good rate of dispersion. In this work the composites, with different CNTs content, were prepared by a controlled melting, in inert gas,and a fast casting of a mix powder of aluminium and CNTs. Tensile strength and Young modulus were evaluated and correlated with the...|$|E
