5|$|A {{man from}} Glastonbury {{is engaged to}} a girl from Wookey. A witch living in Wookey Hole Caves curses the romance so that it fails. The man, now a monk, seeks revenge on this witch who—having been jilted herself—frequently spoils budding relationships. The monk stalks <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> into the cave and she hides in a dark corner {{near one of the}} {{underground}} rivers. The monk blesses the water and splashes some of it at the dark parts of the cave where <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> was hiding. The blessed water immediately petrifies <b>the</b> <b>witch,</b> and she remains in the cave to this day.|$|E

5|$|Players {{navigate}} <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> protagonist {{through the}} 2D game world from a side-view perspective. Cauldron {{is divided into}} two modes of play: shooting while flying and jumping along platforms. Areas of the game world set on the surface feature <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> flying on a broom stick, while underground segments require <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> to run and jump in caverns. In the flying segments, players must search for four randomly scattered coloured keys to access underground areas that contain six ingredients. The objective is to collect the ingredients and return them to the witch's cottage to complete a spell that can defeat the Pumpking. While traversing the game world, <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> encounters Halloween-themed enemies such as pumpkins, ghosts, skulls, and bats, as well as other creatures like sharks and seagulls. A collision with an enemy causes the witch's magic meter (which is also used to fire offensive projectiles at enemies) to decrease. The character dies once the meter is depleted. After dying, the character reappears on the screen and the meter is refilled. Players are given limited opportunities for this to occur, and the game ends once the number of lives reaches zero.|$|E

5|$|Various folk traditions across Europe are analyzed, {{such as the}} Alpine Perchtenlaufen, {{where women}} broke social {{conventions}} by attacking men or engaging in lesbianism. Duerr compares these traditions to the benandanti of early modern Friuli, and to the Livonian werewolf, viewing them as representing the clash between order and chaos. Christian society in the Late Middle Ages began to construe <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> as a creature inside of society rather than outside it, which partly led to <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> trials of the early modern period. Duerr argues that the societies of European Christendom began to increasingly accept female nudity in art and fashion during the Late Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} Cornish and Devonian icons, clotted cream has become entrenched in local folklore.

Another myth, from Dartmoor, tells of a princess who wanted to marry an elven prince, but according to tradition had to bathe in pure cream first. Unfortunately, a witch who wanted the prince for her daughter kept souring the cream. Eventually, the prince offered the princess clotted cream, which <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> was unable to sour.|$|E

5|$|Dante's {{rewriting}} of the Lucanian scene 'recuperates' <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> Erichtho {{by making}} her {{necessary to the}} Dantean Virgil's status as guide: she thus functions {{in accord with the}} Christian providence that controls the advancement of the Commedias plot line. At the same time, the Lucanian Erichtho is both marginalized and subordinated to a higher power. In this sense, Dante's rewriting of Erichtho also undoes Lucan's subversion of the original Virgilian model.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the thirteenth century, the Bilwis is less and less {{frequently}} treated as the personification of a supernatural power but becomes increasingly identified as a malevolent human being, a witch. Still later, with the rise of <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> persecution {{at the end of the}} Middle Ages, the Bilwis was demonized; she becomes an incarnation of the devil for <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> and sorcerer. A final development has taken place since the sixteenth century, especially in northeast Germany, the Bilwis has been conceived of as a grain spirit bringing wealth; yet this latest manifestation of the Bilwis has its harmful side, the Bilwis-cutter, who is blamed for the unexplained patterns that are formed among the rows of standing grain. The cutter is a sorcerer or witch that cuts down the corn with sickles that are fastened to its feet. He is classified as an essentially malevolent Corn Spirit. Thus, the Bilwis is exceedingly polymorphous, taking on many appearances and meaning in all German-speaking areas throughout the Middle Ages. The Bilwis is one of the strangest and most mysterious beings in all folklore; its varying forms reflect the concerns of a farm culture, and it serves to explain the eerie appearance of turned-down rows of plants in cornfields.|$|E
5|$|From 1885 {{until his}} death in 1908 his work was {{dominated}} by prose and poems. The 1895 prose text Der Schmetterling contains autobiographical accounts. Peter's enchantment by <b>the</b> <b>witch</b> Lucinde, of whom he regards himself a slave, is possibly in reference to Johanna Kessler. Peter, like Busch, returns to his birthplace. It is similar in style to the romantic travel story that Ludwig Tieck established with his 1798 Franz Sternbald's Wanderungen. Busch plays with its traditional forms, motifs, pictures, literary topics and form of narration.|$|E
