25|$|Historically, {{red blood}} cell {{transfusion}} was considered when the hemoglobin level fell below 100g/L or hematocrit falls below 30%. Because each unit of blood given carries risks, a <b>trigger</b> <b>level</b> lower than that at 70 to 80g/L is now usually used {{as it has been}} shown to have better patient outcomes. The administration of a single unit of blood is the standard for hospitalized people who are not bleeding, with this treatment then followed with re-assessment and consideration of symptoms and hemoglobin concentration. Patients with poor oxygen saturation may need more blood. The advisory caution to use blood transfusion only with more severe anemia is in part due to evidence that outcomes are worsened if larger amounts are given. One may consider transfusion for people with symptoms of cardiovascular disease such as chest pain or shortness of breath. In cases where patients have low levels of hemoglobin but are cardiovascularly stable, parenteral iron is a preferred option based on both efficacy and safety. Other blood products are given where appropriate, such as clotting deficiencies.|$|E

It passed the south solar pole in June 1994 {{and crossed the}} ecliptic equator in February 1995. The solar X-ray and cosmic gamma-ray burst experiment (GRB) had 3 main objectives: study and monitor solar flares, detect and localize cosmic gamma-ray bursts, and in-situ detection of Jovian aurorae. Ulysses was the first satellite carrying a gamma burst detector which went outside the orbit of Mars. The hard X-ray detectors operated in the range 15–150 keV. The detectors consisted of 23-mm thick × 51-mm diameter CsI(Tl) crystals mounted via plastic light tubes to photomultipliers. The hard detector changed its operating mode depending on (1) measured count rate, (2) ground command, or (3) change in spacecraft telemetry mode. The <b>trigger</b> <b>level</b> was generally set for 8-sigma above background and the sensitivity is 10−6 erg/cm2 (1 nJ/m2). When a burst trigger is recorded, the instrument switches to record high resolution data, recording it to a 32-kbit memory for a slow telemetry read out. Burst data consist of either 16 s of 8-ms resolution count rates or 64 s of 32-ms count rates from {{the sum of the}} 2 detectors. There were also 16 channel energy spectra from the sum of the 2 detectors (taken either in 1, 2, 4, 16, or 32 second integrations). During 'wait' mode, the data were taken either in 0.25 or 0.5 s integrations and 4 energy channels (with shortest integration time being 8 s). Again, the outputs of the 2 detectors were summed.|$|E

40|$|A new {{methodology}} for the optimization {{of the daily}} operations of a pumping plant has been developed. Two major issues have been investigated in relation to pump operations; maximizing pumping during off-peak electricity tariff periods and minimizing the head against which water is pumped. The new approach {{presented in this paper}} incorporates the combination of both a pump schedule and <b>trigger</b> <b>levels</b> to control the system. Different <b>trigger</b> <b>levels</b> are used during different periods of the day, such that peak pumping and pumping head are minimized. Additionally, scheduling is used to maximize pumping in the off-peak period thereby ensuring that the maximum amount of water is available in elevated storage facilities at the start of peak tariff periods. A genetic algorithm that incorporates realvalue and integer decision variables has been developed to determine the best combinations of <b>trigger</b> <b>levels</b> and scheduling for a predicted demand flow for the next day. The methodology has been applied to the Murray Bridge Water Treatment plant in South Australia. The current operating controls based on fixed <b>trigger</b> <b>levels</b> in the upper tank at this plant have been compared with the new combined scheduling/trigger levels operating controls approach.

Stream FSS load data collected in the mine-impacted Magela Creek catchment in the wet-dry tropics were used to derive water quality management <b>trigger</b> <b>levels</b> for two approaches – a Before-After-Control-Impact Paired difference design (BACIP) and a regression relationship between observed FSS load and corresponding event discharge characteristics. The results indicate that both the BACIP and regression relationship approaches behave similarly, with similar FSS load events elevated above <b>trigger</b> <b>levels.</b> Notwithstanding this, it is recommended that in order to reliably assess the location and magnitude of a catchment disturbance on FSS load, a combination of BACIP and regression relationship approaches must be adopted. In this study, an event with a FSS load above <b>trigger</b> <b>levels</b> associated with both BACIP and the regression relationship fitted for the downstream site is considered to be significantly elevated {{as a result of a}} disturbance within the mine-impacted region.

40|$|At many water {{filtration}} plants water is delivered by pumps from a clear water storage to nearby tanks {{in other parts}} of the water distribution system. The control of the pumps in terms of startup and shut-down is usually achieved by <b>trigger</b> <b>levels</b> based on tank low and high water levels. This paper investigates the use of genetic algorithm optimisation to optimise the operation of pumps with the objective of minimising the pumping cost whilst staying within the operating constraints of minimum and maximum water levels for the tanks. Results for a case study are presented. Two different formulations of the genetic algorithm are considered. In both cases, it is assumed that the demand for the day has been forecast and that the water treatment output has been set to this value. Penalty costs are applied to degrade the fitness of solutions in a genetic algorithm population when the tank level drops below or rises above contracted minimum and maximum levels. In addition, a penalty cost is applied when a pump starting limitation is violated. In the first formulation, the <b>trigger</b> <b>levels</b> for the lower tank are optimised. The optimised <b>trigger</b> <b>levels</b> were found to be dependent on the starting level in the upper tank. In the second formulation, the <b>trigger</b> <b>levels</b> in the upper tank are optimised. The outcome of the genetic algorithm optimisation for the second case shows that the lower tank is too small to enable any feasible selection of <b>trigger</b> <b>levels</b> for the upper tank. The results show that there is potential for savings in pumping costs by using genetic algorithm optimisation for real-time operation of {{water filtration}} plant pump operations. A. R. Simpson, D.
