5|$|From July to August 1764, Johnson {{negotiated}} a treaty at Fort Niagara with about 2,000 Native Americans in attendance, primarily Iroquois. Although most Iroquois had {{stayed out of}} the war, Senecas from the Genesee River valley had taken up arms against the British, and Johnson worked <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> into the Covenant Chain alliance. As restitution for the Devil's Hole ambush, the Senecas were compelled to cede the strategically important Niagara portage to the British. Johnson even convinced the Iroquois to send a war party against the Ohio Native Americans. This Iroquois expedition captured a number of Delawares and destroyed abandoned Delaware and Shawnee towns in the Susquehanna Valley, but otherwise the Iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as Johnson had desired.|$|E
5|$|The hostility {{between rival}} Spanish factions in Trujillo continued, and Vasco de Herrera {{was unable to}} unite the colonists behind him. He decided the best option would be to found a new town, and {{possibly}} abandon Trujillo. Cerezeda opposed him at every turn, believing this {{would lead to the}} ruin of the Spanish enterprise in Honduras. Natives working the mines near Trujillo rebelled against their excessive tax burden, killing several Spaniards. Vasco de Herrera seized this opportunity as an excuse to launch a punitive expedition, but instead marched inland in an attempt to found another colony. The Nahuas of Papayeca rebelled against the excessive cruelty of Andrés de Cereceda under their leader Picecura, and fled to the wilds. In 1531, Vasco de Herrera attempted <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to their settlements.|$|E

They rename the bar and try to continue running it but get no business and {{have to find a}} way to market their unwelcoming business. Homer gets help from Moe Szyslak, who suggests that they allow people to do illegal things in their pub. They find out that smoking is now banned from Irish pubs and Moe urges the Simpsons to turn it into a smokeasy. They do a roaring trade, but are closed down by the Irish authorities. As a punishment, Homer and Grampa are deported back to America and have to pay a small fine.

5|$|The {{troops for}} the Ranger company {{were to be}} Airborne qualified, so the Ranger Training Center heavily {{recruited}} troops from the 82nd Airborne Division and 11th Airborne Division who had already completed United States Army Airborne School. In spite of this, only one Ranger operation in the conflict ever required an airborne landing. At the first Airborne Ranger graduation in November 1950, each Ranger was given a black and gold Ranger Tab as a shoulder sleeve insignia. A few days later, each Ranger was issued a blue and white tab and instructed to sew it above the Ranger Tab. The Airborne Ranger Companies then in Korea were deactivated on August 1, 1951. They were merged into the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> up to strength with airborne-qualified combat-experienced replacements. The 187th had been moved to Kyushu, Japan’s southern island {{to take on a}} (then Top Secret) mission to save the UN negotiators at Kaesong, North Korea.|$|E
5|$|Before Crisis {{opens with}} the trainee Turks {{on a mission}} {{in the city of}} Midgar to {{investigate}} AVALANCHE activities. With help from Reno, AVALANCHE retreat. However, the attack proves to be a diversion for a greater strike at the town of Junon, where President Shinra is set to give a speech. President Shinra is shot, but survives, and calls in Sephiroth. However, it transpires that even the attack on the President was a diversion, and AVALANCHE's real target was a weapon called the Mako Cannon, which they planned to fire at Midgar, destroying the city. Elfé and Sephiroth do battle at the cannon, but the fight ends inconclusively, and AVALANCHE withdraw. AVALANCHE next target Rayleigh a professor carrying data on the SOLDIER members and their creation. The Turks are sent to protect Rayleigh, accompanied by several Shinra guards, including Cloud. Fuhito, a scientist working for AVALANCHE, is able to corrupt Rayleigh's data when the Turks disobey orders and save Rayleigh instead of protecting the information. Using the SOLDIER data, Fuhito develops an elite unit known as the Ravens, using them to capture two SOLDIERs, Essai and Sebastian. The Turks succeed in rescuing the pair, and are then sent to destroy AVALANCHE, accompanied by Zack. Essai and Sebastian, however, are captured once again, and turned into Ravens. Even though Zack is able <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to their senses, he is unable to save them.|$|E
5|$|The debacle in Russia {{loosened}} the French {{grip on the}} German princes. In 1813, Napoleon {{mounted a}} campaign in the German states <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> into the French orbit; the subsequent War of Liberation culminated in the great Battle of Leipzig, {{also known as the}} Battle of Nations. In October 1813, more than 500,000 combatants engaged in ferocious fighting over three days, making it the largest European land battle of the 19th century. The engagement resulted in a decisive victory for the Coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden, and it ended French power east of the Rhine. Success encouraged the Coalition forces to pursue Napoleon across the Rhine; his army and his government collapsed, and the victorious Coalition incarcerated Napoleon on Elba. During the brief Napoleonic restoration known as the 100 Days of 1815, forces of the Seventh Coalition, including an Anglo-Allied army under the command of the Duke of Wellington and a Prussian army under the command of Gebhard von Blücher, were victorious at Waterloo (18 June 1815). The critical role played by Blücher's troops, especially after having to retreat from the field at Ligny the day before, helped to turn the tide of combat against the French. The Prussian cavalry pursued the defeated French in the evening of 18 June, sealing the allied victory. From the German perspective, the actions of Blücher's troops at Waterloo, and the combined efforts at Leipzig, offered a rallying point of pride and enthusiasm. This interpretation became a key building block of the Borussian myth expounded by the pro-Prussian nationalist historians later in the 19th century.|$|E

Their son Alisher was born in November 1999, and in late 2002 {{he was diagnosed with}} acute lymphocytic leukemia. In search for qualified treatment the family moved to Cologne, Germany, and used fundraisers and donations from gymnastics fans to pay for medical bills.

Several of the soldiers managed to push the barges into the river, and pull some of their comrades to safety, but it was difficult work: the darkness and the swiftness of the current made steadying the barges difficult, and the angry citizens of Nijmegen were firing arrows and small arms at the marauders.

25|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} the AWA, Jannetty and Michaels were {{contacted}} by WWF owner Vince McMahon informing them {{that he was willing}} <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> if they were able to be more professional this time round. By the end of May the team was working for the WWF under the shortened name The Rockers. They officially made their television debut on the June 18, 1988 edition of WWF Superstars of Wrestling in a squash match. The Rockers made their pay-per-view (PPV) debut at the 1988 Survivor Series as part of the 10 team tag match. They eliminated The Bolsheviks from the match before being eliminated by a double-disqualification in a brawl with the Brain Busters. The brawl between The Rockers and The Brain Busters led to a match taped for WWF Superstars of Wrestling where both teams were disqualified once again, this time before the match could really start. This led to a series of house show matches between the two teams, a series of matches that drew rave reviews from the fans. One match in particular on January 23, 1989 was rated as one of the 50 greatest matches in the PWI 10th year anniversary issue. The Brain Busters narrowly defeated The Rockers, as Anderson held down Marty Jannetty's leg as Blanchard pinned him. The feud continued to rage on as they clashed at Saturday's Night Main Event in a match that saw both teams counted out for brawling on the floor.|$|E
