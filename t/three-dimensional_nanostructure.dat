40|$|A simple {{process of}} {{fabricating}} a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>nanostructure</b> on a silicon surface {{was investigated in}} this study. The silicon surface area irradiated by focused ion beam (FIB) was selectively etched in HF, whereas the non-irradiated area was scarcely etched, and consequently, a concave nanostructure was fabricated on the irradiated area. To control {{the depth of the}} nanostructure, the depth dependence on ion irradiation parameters was investigated. As a result, {{it was found that the}} depth of the irradiated area can be controlled by changing ion irradiation parameters, such as dose and ion energy. Under a low-dose condition, the irradiated area was scarcely etched, due to the formation of an amorphous layer on the interior of silicon.

30|$|In this work, {{silver and}} gold nanohelix arrays (NHAs) are {{fabricated}} on non-seeded glass substrates with GLAD in a substrate cooling system. Self-shadowing deposition is achieved by ensuring the high directivity of the vapor flux.

Silver and gold spiral-like NHAs were successfully deposited on non-seeded glass substrates. At the corners of the metal NHAs were “hot spots” where the electric fields were stronger than the field along a straight metal nanorod. Additionally, the extension of a SERS substrate from a two-dimensional nanostructure to this <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>nanostructure</b> increases its overall surface area [15], enabling the adsorption and detection of more target molecules; therefore, a three-dimensional NHA is expected to exhibit a stronger SERS response than straight nanorod arrays.

In the case of disordered mesoporous materials, however, the main difficulty of the method lies in the data analysis. A stochastic model is presented, which enables one to reconstruct the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>nanostructure</b> of liquids confined in disordered mesopores starting from small-angle scattering data. This so-called plurigaussian model is a multi-phase generalization of clipped Gaussian random field models. Its potential is illustrated through the synchrotron SAXS analysis of a gel permeated with a critical nitrobenzene/hexane solution that is progressively cooled below its consolute temperature. The reconstruction brings to light a wetting transition whereby the nanostructure of the pore-filling liquids passes from wetting layers that uniformly cover the solid phase of the gel to plugs that locally occlude the pores. Using the plurigaussian model, the dewetting phenomenon is analyzed quantitatively at the nanometre scale in terms of changing specific interface areas, contact angle and specific length of the triple line.

In order to increase the strength of the substrate-anatase interface without transforming the phase into rutile, samples were calcined at 450 ºC for 2 hours. The resulting coatings were characterised by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), non-contact optical profilometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The photocatalytic activity of the deposited coatings were evaluated in the gas-phase for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) removal by electron ionisation mass spectrometry whilst irradiated by light of wavelength 376 - 387 nm for 100 minutes. Anatase phase titania supported on a fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass substrate showed the highest photoactivity for NO 2 remediation.

However, information on the nature, distribution, formation, and reactivity of SOVs, as well as relationships among SOVs, is lacking. Investigating SOVs is difficult because of disturbance by the crystal phase, morphology of bulk materials, and synergistic effect between substrate and catalyst host. Herein, by clarifying the origin of SOVs and their distribution, one-dimensional (1 D) tungsten oxide nanowires (NWs) with numerous SOVs were synthesized. Compared with the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>nanostructure,</b> the high aspect ratio of ID NW exposed the SOVs {{on the surface of}} the nanostructure rather than embedding them in the bulk. To investigate accurately the effect of SOVs on electrocatalytic activity, we dearly identified how SOVs of tungsten oxide catalyst regulate iodide reduction reactions in the solar cell by in situ filling of SOVs in electrodes and maintaining the crystal phase and morphology of NWs. Iodide reduction reaction activity was notably dependent on tungsten oxide catalyst SOVs, which serve as important catalytic site descriptors. These findings may clarify the fundamental features of SOVs on metal oxides and contribute to the rational design of efficient catalysts and supports...|$|E

We demonstrate the stepwise supramolecular assembly of discrete building blocks through specific and selective RNA-RNA interactions, based on results from quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), ellipsometry, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) experiments. The assembly can be controlled to give a densely packed single layer of RNA polyhedrons at the fluid lipid bilayer surface. We show that assembly of the 3 D structure can be modulated by sequence specific interactions, surface charge and changes in the salt composition and concentration. In addition, the tertiary structure of the RNA polyhedron can be controllably switched from an extended structure to one that is dense and compact.
