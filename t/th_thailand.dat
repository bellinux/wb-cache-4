40|$|Facts {{show that}} Indonesia needs {{to improve its}} ability to compete in various fields with the {{development}} of human resources. Unfortunately, according to UNDP, {{the current state of the}} human resource is miserable. Indonesia was ranked 109 of 174 in the ranking of competitiveness at the 46 lowest in Southeast Asia, while Singapore is the 2 nd and Malaysia at the 27 th. Philippines to the 32 th, and Thailand to 34 th, and includes the most corrupt country in the world. According to the Human Development Index survey, as disclosed by Yutata Hadi Andoyo, the Director of Private Higher Education Directorate of Directorate General of Higher Education of national education department, the quality of Indonesian human resources is currently ranked 105 th. For an illustration, the human resources in Southeast Asia namely Singapore was ranked 25 th, Brunei 26 th, Malaysia 56 <b>th,</b> <b>Thailand</b> 57 th and Philippines 77 th. In an effort to improve human resources, the role of education is quite prominent. Therefore, it is important for national development to focus on improving the quality of education. Qualified education will be obtained in a high quality school, and qualified school will produce qualified human resources as well. This study aimed to examine the role of continuous improvement, top management commitment, and quality management systems in encouraging the implementation of TQM in order to improve education quality management. Data was collected from the Foundation Chairman, Chairman, Rector of Private Colleges in Kopertis region XI - Borneo's which is consists of 120 private universities using questionnaires. Then, the data is used to perform data analysis using SEM techniques. Statistical test results showed that continued improvement proven to have positive and significant influence on the management of quality improvement of education through the implementation of TQM, top management commitment proven to have positive and significant influence on the management of quality improvement of education through the implementation of TQM, and quality management system proven to have positive and significant influence on the management of education quality improvement through the implementation o...|$|E

40|$|The "People's Constitution" {{drafted in}} 1997 {{was seen as}} a {{watershed}} event in Thai constitutional history due to the breadth and depth of its reforms. Yet just ten years later, in August 2007, a new Constitution was promulgated, the 18 <b>th</b> since <b>Thailand</b> became a constitutional monarchy in 1932. The latest version followed the ouster in September 2006 of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in a military coup. This article examines the main differences between the 1997 and 2007 versions of the Constitution and how these changes relate to the current unrest in Thailand. The analysis suggests that Thailand's current instability is best understood in terms of how social struggles over access to power played out in constitutional choices. Though Thailand's urban elites and middle class had driven the drafting of the earlier Constitution, when the populist leadership it produced threatened their interests they were quick to support the traditional military and royal networks in ousting the elected government and replace the People's Constitution with one that is deliberately less democratic. Yet, because the drafting process failed to generate support beyond narrow elite circles, and the new institutional arrangements no longer provide the inclusive governance Thai people have come to expect, the new Constitution has generated tensions that suggest Thailand is unlikely to experience stability any time soon.

40|$|Orientia tsutsugamushi, the {{etiologic}} agent of potentially fatal scrub typhus, {{is characterized by}} a high antigenic diversity, which complicates the development of a broadly protective vaccine. Efficacy studies in murine and nonhuman primate models demonstrated the DNA vaccine candidate pKarp 47, based upon the O. tsutsugamushi Karp 47 -kD HtrA protein gene, to be a successful immunoprophylactic against scrub typhus. To characterize 47 -kD HtrA protein diversity among human isolates of Orientia, we sequenced the full open reading frame (ORF) of the 47 -kD HtrA gene and analyzed the translated amino acid sequences of 17 patient isolates from Thailand (n= 13), Laos (n= 2), Australia (n= 1), and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (n= 1) and 9 reference strains: Karp (New Guinea), Kato (Japan), Ikeda (Japan), Gilliam (Burma), Boryong (Korea), TA 763, TH 1811 and <b>TH</b> 1817 (<b>Thailand),</b> and MAK 243 (China). The percentage identity (similarity) of translated amino acid sequences between 16 new isolates and 9 reference strains of O. tsutsugamushi ranged from 96. 4 % to 100 % (97. 4 % to 100 %). However, inclusion of the recently identified Orientia chuto sp. nov. reduced identity (similarity) values to 82. 2 % to 83. 3 % (90. 4 % to 91. 4 %). These results demonstrate the diversity of Orientia 47 -kD HtrA among isolates encountered by humans and therefore provide support for the necessity of developing a broadly protective scrub typhus vaccine that takes this diversity into account...|$|R

We derived from this review the geographic coordinates of sites where ticks were collected in the past. In complement, we realised field works to collect ticks on unexplored sites. The location of theses sites was obtained with a GPS (Global Positioning System). Hence, we were able to build up a location-based inventory of ticks covering almost the whole Thailand. These data were then processed in a GIS to assess in every region the presence of tick species and to map the distribution of species known as potential vectors of viruses which are likely to be pathogenic to humans. All the GIS processings were undertaken using SavGIS©, a GIS freeware developed by IRD. This research represents a starting point for assessing tick-borne virus spread and the related risk of zoonosis in Thailand...|$|R

Background: Bartonellagenus {{is a group of}} facultative intracellular pathogens that posses able to survive and proliferate inside of erythrocytes. Classified within this genus,Bartonella bacilliformisis of special relevance. This microorganism is the etiological agent of the so called Carrion’s Disease (Human bartonellosis). Additionally the presence of sub-clinical cases (asymptomatyc carriers) is of special interest, because acts as a reservoir of this illness. Carrión’s Disease is an endemic illnes in Perú, affecting in a special manner the north interandean valleys. However, the current in use diagnostic techniques (Giemsa Stain) possess low sensitivity and specificity, and due to the fact thatB. bacilliformispossess a low growth (weeks), bacterial cultures lacks of clinical utility. Thus suspictious cases frequently are not confirmed, and the real relevance of this illness remains underestimated. This work is addressed to the direct identification from blood samples ofBartonella baciliformisusing a conventional PCR. All patients were from the Cajamarca area being enrolled by the Epidemiological Surveillance program of DIRESA.

40|$|Line 63 - 1 is a 'Sunset'-derived {{transgenic}} papaya {{expressing the}} coat protein (CP) gene from a mild mutant of a Hawaiian isolate of Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV). Previous work showed that line 63 - 1 R, plants exhibited {{a range of}} resistance to severe PRSV isolates from Hawaii (HA), Jamaica (JA), <b>Thailand</b> (<b>TH),</b> and Brazil (BR). Genetic and molecular data obtained in this study confirm that line 63 - 1 has two CP transgene insertion sites; segregation analysis shows that the CP and the npt H genes are present at both loci. To study the potential effect of gene dosage on resistance, various populations of R- 1, R- 2, and R- 3 seedlings were challenged by PRSV HA, BR, and TH. A R, population obtained by self-pollination of line 63 - 1 hermaphrodite R- 0 plant exhibited resistance to all three isolates. The percentage of plants resistant to all three PRSV isolates increased in 63 - 1 -derived populations {{as a result of}} recurrent selection. Additional genetic studies demonstrate that the number of resistant plants in a 63 - 1 -derived population is directly correlated with the number of plants with multiple transgene copies.

40|$|Melon {{yellow spot}} virus (MYSV), a {{tentative}} {{member of the}} genus Tospovirus, is considered a distinct serotype {{due to the lack}} of a serological relationship with other tospoviruses in its nucleocapsid protein (NP). Recently, a virus isolate collected from diseased watermelon in central Taiwan (MYSV-TW) was found to react with a rabbit antiserum (RAs) prepared against the NP of Watermelon silver mottle virus (WSMoV), and a monoclonal antibody (MAb) prepared against the common epitope of the NSs proteins of WSMoV-serogroup tospoviruses, but not with the WSMoV NP-specific MAb, in both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting. In this investigation, both RAs and MAb against MYSV-TW NP were produced. Results of serological tests revealed that the RAs to MYSV-TW NP reacted with the homologous antigen and the crude antigens of members of the WSMoV serogroup, including members of the formal species WSMoV and Peanut bud necrosis virus, and members of three tentative species, Watermelon bud necrosis virus, Capsicum chlorosis virus and Calla lily chlorotic spot virus. The MAb to MYSV-TW NP reacted only with the homologous antigen and the other geographic isolates of MYSV from Japan (JP) and <b>Thailand</b> (<b>TH).</b> Our results of reciprocal tests indicate that the NP and the NSs protein of MYSV are serologically related to those of WSMoV-serogroup tospoviruses. Furthermore, we show that both the MYSV NP MAb and the WSMoV NP MAb are reliable tools for identification of MYSV and WSMoV from single or mixed infection in field surveys, as verified using species-specific primers in reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction...|$|R

The study areas are over the Indian Ocean from Latitude 30 °S to 30 °N and Longitude 40 °E to 120 °E. The used data were during May to October since the years 1996 to 2000, and also covered the years where El Niño and La Niña were present. When the heat flux over the Southeast Indian Ocean was increased about 100 w/m 2, this persisted for approximately five consecutive days before the average onset date of the 15 <b>th</b> May in <b>Thailand.</b> Once the recorded increase in heat flux of five days had passed, it was then observed that {{after a period of}} eleven days this caused the onset of rainfalls at nine Thai meteorological stations. From the observations recorded the results showed a correlation between the development of heat flux and rainfalls. During the normal years (1996, 1999 and 2000) the correlation of the heat flux with the rainfalls data at the twelve primary meteorological stations in Thailand were computed by linear regression analysis and the best of these resulted in coefficient of determination(R 2) = 0. 782.

The 8 th article is titled as “SWOT ANALYSIS OF MA EDUCATIONAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME OF ALLAMA IQBAL OPEN UNIVERSITY, ISLAMABAD” written by Dr. S. Manzoor Hussain SHAH and uazzam Ali SAQIB from Allama Iqbal Open University Islamabad, Pakistan. Their major objectives of the study were to explore various internal aspects of the MA Educational Planning and Management (EPM) programme of Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU), Islamabad to find its strengths and weaknesses, and to look into external aspects for identifying the opportunities and threats to the programme. Based on the study, a number of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats were found which provided a basis for reviewing and revising a number of components of the programme. The study explored the various aspects of MA EPM programme of AIOU in the light of programme objectives as well as the national and international needs with special considerations to a distance education programme. The finding of the study revealed recognition of a number of strengths and opportunities of the programme related to enrolment, workshops, examination, job placement, job satisfaction, and performance of the graduates in a competitive environment. At the same time, the study reflected few weaknesses and threats to the programme associated with the written assignments, tutors, study material, study tours, relevance of the curriculum to local needs, need to update the content, and revision of the curriculum. Recommendations of the study include periodically revising the curriculum, upgrading the courses books, improving the evaluation methods of assignments, introducing more activities for both learning and evaluation, and including study tours in the workshops. The study also recommended the EPPSL department to induct part-time/visiting faculty members in emergency situations to achieve the programme objectives. The researcher further recommended the EPPSL department to maintain the record of the graduates for prompt access to them for research purposes and to train the students for offering more cooperation with the researchers. More follow-up studies may be conducted to determine the viability and impact of EPM programmes of AIOU on the society. The 9 h article is from Turkey and titled as “ASSESSING CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING IN MATHEMATICS: Using Derivative Function to Solve Connected Problems”, written by Nevin ORHUN, from Anadolu University, Science Faculty, Eskisehir, Turkey. According to the author open and distance education {{plays an important role in}} the actualization of cultural goals as well as in societal developments. This is an independent teaching and learning method for mathematics which forms the dynamic of scientific thinking. Distance education is an important alternative to traditional teaching applications. These contributions brought by technology enable students to participate actively in having access to information and questioning it. Such an application increases students’ motivation and teaches how mathematics can be used in daily life. Derivative is a mathematical concept which can be used in many areas of daily life. The aim of this study is to enable the concept of derivatives to be understood well by using the derivative function in the solution of various problems. It also aims at interpreting difficulties theoretically in the solution of problems and determining mistakes in terms of teaching methods. In this study, how various aspects of derivatives are understood is emphasized. These aspects concern the explanation of concepts and process, and also their application to certain concepts in physics. Students’ depth of understanding of derivatives was analyzed based on two aspects of understanding; theoretical analysis and contextual application. Follow-up interviews were conducted with five students. The results show that the students preferred to apply an algebraic symbolic aspect instead of using logical meanings of function and its derivative. In addition, in relation to how the graph of the derivative function affects the aspect of function, it was determined that the students displayed low performance. The 10 <b>th</b> article from <b>Thailand</b> which is written by Orachorn KITCHAKARN from Bngkok University, and titled as “PEER FEEDBACK THROUGH BLOGS: An Effective Tool For improving Students’ Writing Abilities”. This study is second part research of the autor. The first part was published previously again in TOJDE sı that we publish it to compete eachother. Study is investigated the effects of peer feedback activity through blogs on students’ writing ability and examined their attitudes towards peer feedback activity. The research was conducted using a single group pretest-posttest design. Blog, the website, was used as a medium for peer feedback activity. Participants were 34 second-year students who studied EN 013 course (English for Expressing Ideas) in the first semester of the academic year 2012 at Bangkok University. Two writings tests and a questionnaire were used as instruments for data collection to acquire information. The results revealed that students’ writing scores on the pretest and posttest were significantly different. It can be concluded that peer feedback activity through blogs had a significant role to play in improving students’ writing skill. The students also expressed positive attitudes towards the value of peer feedback activity. 11 th article from Uludag University, Turkey and written on “PRE-SERVICE SCIENCE TEACHERS’ PERCEPTIONS ABOUT EFFECTIVE DESIGN OF BLENDED UNIVERSITY CHEMISTRY COURSES” by Zehra OZDILEK and Sehnaz BALTACI-GOKTALAY, Faculty of Education Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technologies.

COMEAU from Segi University, and Penang, and Tung Lai CHENG from School of Business & Administration, Wawasan Open University, Penang, Malaysia. They mentioned and dicussed in their article that results of the digital “Tsunami” changes in education in the 21 st has been huge. Recall that in the year 2000 there was no such thing as internet broadband, Facebook or iTunes which is now a daily commodity. No doubt changes in technology will continue to accelerate. Education is about learning. Learning happens everywhere and technology creates a platform of almost limitless opportunities for better learning. With the recent digital development of Open Education Resources (OER) and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), these emergence towards free and open resources and courses has a tremendous potential to democratise education. There is no denying that it’s one of the biggest discussions being had in education and around the world. Will the digital ‘tsunami’ phenomenon revolutionise the landscape of education? Some believe that this new medium will revolutionise both online and conventional education. This paper attempts to explore the hype issues that surround the notion of democratisation movement that gears towards open and free education. This paper looks into the impact and the types of evidence that are being generated across initiatives, organisations and individuals in order to make a summative analysis and recommendations. Finally, this paper hopes to provide some insight into the dynamics of the evolution of digital ‘tsunami’ in present higher education.

He mentioned that branding is considered to be particularly important in the marketing of online educational programs. A critical step to establishing the brand is naming the product appropriately. To this end, one can secure the services of professionals or to rely on a do-it-yourself approach. The research reported here aimed to identify the features that non-professionals (graduate students) consider to be important in the name for an on-line educational product, and to compare these to the recommendations made by naming professionals (as reported in the literature). A survey directed at current and prospective graduate students at a traditional university asked about the desirability of 16 characteristics in the name of a new line of online courses. The six characteristics that were deemed most critical are (in order of importance) : self-explanatory, memorable, easy to pronounce, has appealing associations, suggests/hints at the key features, and short. These are the same features that professionals in the business of creating new product names generally consider as best practices in creating a...|$|R
