5|$|The exact mass-luminosity {{relationship}} {{depends on}} how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher opacity has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star {{does not need to}} produce as much energy <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> hydrostatic equilibrium. By contrast, a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly and the star must burn more fuel <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> equilibrium. Note, however, that a sufficiently high opacity can result in energy transport via convection, which changes the conditions needed <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> equilibrium.|$|E
