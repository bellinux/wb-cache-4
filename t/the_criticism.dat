5|$|<b>The</b> <b>criticism</b> {{against the}} artistic freedom of giving a {{personal}} {{interpretation of a}} distant historic event, could have been directed at many other historic paintings of the 19th century. <b>The</b> <b>criticism</b> against Midvinterblot {{would be in the}} same vein during the following years. Larsson retorted that he would happily delegate the task to a younger talent—but he made a second version in oil (№ 237) in which he made the temple wider and where he added an executioner in the centre. The sets of characters were more closely assembled and the frieze-like quality was enhanced.|$|E

5|$|Albrecht stated his {{original}} {{aim was to}} draw attention to the law, not to have Knut put down. In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo to prevent them from killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. His case was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been against the law of nature. In response to <b>the</b> <b>criticism</b> against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E

It was Harrison's final album under {{his contract with}} Apple Records and EMI, and the last studio album issued by Apple.

5|$|In 1908, Zermelo {{published}} his axiom system for set theory. He had two motivations {{for developing the}} axiom system: eliminating the paradoxes and securing his proof of the well-ordering theorem.

His response to <b>the</b> <b>criticism</b> included his axiom system and a new proof of the well-ordering theorem. His axioms support this new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>criticism</b> {{did little}} to dissuade Etty from {{attempting}} to reproduce the success of Cleopatra, and he concentrated on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages.|$|E
