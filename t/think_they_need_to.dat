Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally.

Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out.

50|$|Regardless {{of these}} {{differences}} of emphasis, however, most preachers and congregations would agree that preaching must be honouring to God rather than to human beings. In practice, {{this means that the}} preacher as expositor should be concerned with speaking about what God sees as important. This will be of little use, however, if it does not connect to what the people in the congregation see as important - even if it only does so by seeking to upset their priorities. But the principle must be that when a church is exposed to expository preaching, they are being enabled to hear God speak rather than being told what they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> hear.|$|E

[...] Ian Lang, a professor at the Victorian College of the Arts also expressed his view on the storyline concluding quickly. He said [...] "I think anybody who has suffered a serious illness like bulimia knows that it's not possible to really portray it in a half-hour drama." [...] Rick Kausman of the Australian Medical Association spoke to groups of high school students in Geelong and said the storyline was raised by the students.

[...] Frances Sanders of the Eating Disorders Foundation of Victoria was concerned that someone at risk of developing bulimia may see the show and try it. She thought that it was good that Home and Away was addressing the issue though, as viewers would <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> get some help.

First of all, I briefly sketch what the phenomenon of moral luck is about, and then I present and discuss the main arguments that intend to show that such a phenomenon is just an illusion that we must unmask after reflection. Next, I argue against those positions as a whole by making a general point, which I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> address, but which, I will try to show, they cannot. What all those arguments necessarily presuppose is a notion of a person’s true desert, as actual-enactment independent, which is indeed unintelligible. Hence, my ambitious conclusion is that no general argument against moral luck can ultimately work—unless an intelligible notion of ultimate true desert can be presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this bachelor's thesis is to see how public {{libraries}} have adopted the new e-book readers and how the libraries think the e-readers will affect them in the future. There are three different theories in this study which are used {{to see how the}} e-book reader influences the libraries as an innovation and as a remediation from the paper book as well as its evolution. The authors have used four qualitative interviews where they have tried to find the most relevant librarians for the purpose. It was found that all the libraries in the study <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> learn about the e-reader and its functions to be able <b>to</b> understand users’ <b>needs,</b> but <b>they</b> haven´t agreed if they should have the e-reader as a library loan.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{argue for the}} {{importance}} of the formal teaching of environmental ethics. This is, we argue, both because environmental ethics is <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> respond to the environmental issues generated by the neoliberal movement in politics and economics, and because a form of environmental ethics is implicit, but unexamined, in that which is currently taught. We maintain that students <b>need</b> <b>to</b> become aware of the latent ethical dimension in what they are taught. To help them, we <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> understand how models and metaphors structure and impact their worldviews.

This is then intellectualized by way of Clifford Geertz 2 ̆ 7 s concept of culture and his model for the analysis of sacred symbols.
