2500|$|An article {{published}} in the Indian Express described the match as one <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of cricket's [...] "famous rivalries", noting the unstable and often tense political {{relations between the two}} neighboring countries as well as the complex [...] historical, geographical and cultural links between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Sharjah cricket stadium is famous for having previously hosted many cricket duels between arch-rivals India and Pakistan and the intense atmosphere surrounding this latest contest brings the ground back into the spotlight again. Many Afghan cricketers grew up and learnt cricket while living in refugee camps in Pakistan. Afghan fast bowler Hamid Hassan, who himself had been ruled out of the match through injury, said that the entire country was eagerly counting down to the big game with Pakistan, while all-rounder Mohammad Nabi added that the opportunity to play against a top team like Pakistan was a dream-come-true.|$|E
2500|$|Orbison {{also began}} collaborating with Bill Dees, {{whom he had}} known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote [...] "It's Over", a {{number one in the}} UK, and a song <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of his {{signature}} pieces {{for the rest of his}} career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, [...] "A pretty woman never needs any money". Just 40 minutes later, [...] "Oh, Pretty Woman" [...] was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a Bob Hope movie, the epithet [...] "mercy" [...] Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, and a merging of his vulnerable and masculine sides, it rose to number one in the fall of 1964 in the US and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It hit number one in the UK as well, spending 18 weeks total on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies. Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as Billboard magazine noted, [...] "In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the only American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making Orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic." ...|$|E

60|$|As for Madrono Ranch, Naismith {{owned it}} and had set the price at fifty dollars an acre. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> {{thousand}} dollars, for there were twenty acres. As a farming investment, using old-fashioned methods, it was not worth it. As a business investment, yes; for {{the virtues of the}} valley were on the eve of being discovered by the outside world, and no better location for a summer home could be found. As a happiness investment in joy of beauty and climate, it was worth a thousand times the price asked. And he knew Naismith would allow time on most of the amount. Edmund's suggestion was that they take a two years' lease, with option to buy, the rent to apply to the purchase if they took it up. Naismith had done that once with a Swiss, who had paid a monthly rental of ten dollars. But the man's wife had died, and he had gone away.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Lapham {{would not}} {{let her know that}} she was ignorant of the fact {{attributed}} to her knowledge. She remained listening to Zerrilla, and piecing out the whole history of her presence there from the facts of the past, and the traits of her husband's character. One of the things she had always had to fight him about was that idea of his that he was bound to take care of Jim Millon's worthless wife and her child because Millon had got the bullet that was meant for him. It was a perfect superstition of his; she could not beat it out of him; but she had made him promise {{the last time he had}} done anything for that woman that it should BE the last time. He had then got her a little house in one of the fishing ports, where she could take the sailors to board and wash for, and earn an honest living if she would keep straight. That was five or six years ago, and Mrs. Lapham had heard nothing of Mrs. Millon since; she had heard quite enough of her before; and had known her idle and baddish ever since she was the worst little girl at school in Lumberville, and all through her shameful girlhood, and the married days which she had made so miserable to the poor fellow who had given her his decent name and a chance to behave herself. Mrs. Lapham had no mercy on Moll Millon, and she had quarrelled often enough with her husband for befriending her. As for the child, if the mother would put Zerrilla out with some respectable family, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>ONE</b> thing; but as long as she kept Zerrilla with her, she was against letting her husband do anything for either of them. He had done ten times as much for them now as he had any need to, and she had made him give her his solemn word that he would do no more. She saw now that she was wrong to make him give it, and that he must have broken it again and again for the reason that he had given when she once scolded him for throwing away his money on that hussy-- ...|$|E
