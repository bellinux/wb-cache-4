5|$|According to William of Newburgh {{writing in}} the 1190s, the plan failed because of Geoffrey’s early death in 1151. The dying Geoffrey decided that Henry would have the {{paternal}} and maternal inheritances while he needed <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> overcome Stephen, and left instructions that his body would not be buried until Henry swore an oath that once England and Normandy were secured the younger Geoffrey would have Anjou. Henry’s brother Geoffrey died in 1154, too soon to receive Anjou, but not before being installed count in Nantes after Henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord.|$|E
5|$|Between January 2010 and 2015, {{a quarter}} of {{emergency}} room doctors said they had seen a major surge in patients, while nearly half had seen a smaller increase.

Four depleted panzer divisions were not enough to defeat the First US Army. The disastrous Operation Lüttich drove the Germans deeper into the Allied envelopment.|$|E

5|$|Eventually the {{leadership}} of the SRRC and the TNG were reconciled, and the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was formed in 2004 by Somali politicians in Nairobi. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed from Puntland was elected as President. The TFG later moved its temporary headquarters to Baidoa. President Yusuf requested that the African Union deploy military forces in Somalia. However, as the AU lacked <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> do so, Yusuf brought in his own militia from Puntland. Along with the U.S. funding the ARPCT coalition, this alarmed many in south-central Somalia, and recruits flocked to the ascendant Islamic Courts Union (ICU).|$|E
5|$|Georgine Milmine {{was born}} in Ontario, Canada. Before joining McClure's as a researcher, she worked for the Syracuse Herald in New York.

Apparently when McClure's was sold, the new publisher threw away the research, including the first edition.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Japanese forces under Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi {{attacked}} Alamo Force's {{position at}} Aitape in the Battle of Driniumor River.

This left Brigadier General Clarence A. Martin without <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> implement Krueger's strategy, and he conducted a fighting withdrawal instead. Krueger travelled to Aitape where Hall presented him a counterattack plan, which he approved. By August, the fighting had ended and Adachi had been defeated.|$|E

However, even though Nintendo expressed interest in Paradigm's early presentations, the game was cancelled because Nintendo did not have <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> aid in its development at that time. There were rumors of a sequel on the Nintendo GameCube and later the Wii, development courtesy of Factor 5, but no game was ever shown. After their briefing time at E3 2010, Nintendo announced a sequel titled Pilotwings Resort for the Nintendo 3DS, which was released as a launch title for the handheld console.|$|E
5|$|The {{apartheid}} government greatly limited {{freedom of}} expression, through censorship, reduced economic freedom, and reduced mobility for black people.

The government established the Directorate of Publications in 1974 through the Publications Act, but this body only responded to complaints, and took decisions about banning material that was submitted to it.

5|$|The {{territorial}} {{agreement between}} the triumvirate and Sextus Pompeius began to crumble once Octavian divorced Scribonia and married Livia on 17 January 38BC. One of Pompeius' naval commanders betrayed him and handed over Corsica and Sardinia to Octavian. Octavian lacked <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> confront Pompeius alone, however, so an agreement was reached with the Second Triumvirate's extension for another five-year period beginning in 37BC.|$|E
5|$|Warcraft {{requires}} {{players to}} collect resources, and to produce buildings and units {{in order to}} defeat an opponent in combat. Non-combatant builders deliver <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> the Town Center from mines, from which gold is dug, and forests, where wood is chopped. As both are limited resources which become exhausted during the game, players must collect them efficiently, and also retain forests as defensive walls in the early game when combat forces are small.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a central administration arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E

5|$|Both the Zygalski-sheet {{method and}} each bomba worked {{for only a}} single {{scrambler}} rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six bomby were produced. However, the Germans introduced two new rotors on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines on a given day. This {{increased the number of}} possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then only read the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> produce 54 more bomby or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski to re-use his previous method of working out the wiring within these rotors. This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{maintained}} {{peace with}} Scotland during his reign, {{where he was}} the feudal lord of Alexander II. Henry assumed that he had the right to interfere in Scottish affairs and brought up the issue of his authority with the Scottish kings at key moments, but he lacked the inclination or <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> do much more. Alexander had occupied parts of northern England during the First Barons' War but had been excommunicated and forced to retreat. Alexander married Henry's sister Joan in 1221, and after he and Henry signed the Treaty of York in 1237, Henry had a secure northern frontier. Henry knighted Alexander III before the young King married Henry's daughter Margaret in 1251 and, despite Alexander's refusal to give homage to Henry for Scotland, the two enjoyed a good relationship. Henry had Alexander and Margaret rescued from Edinburgh Castle when they were imprisoned there by a rebellious Scottish baron in 1255 and took additional measures to manage Alexander's government during the rest of his minority years.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, the Western Allies {{agreed to}} open a second front (the Western Front) in Western Europe to take {{pressure}} off the beleaguered Red Army in the Soviet Union. While Britain and the United States did not yet possess <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> mount a full invasion, invasion plans {{that came to be}} known as Operation Sledgehammer were drawn up, in case the German position in Western Europe weakened or the USSR's situation became dire. In August 1942 Anglo-Canadian forces attempted an abortive landing—Operation Jubilee—at the French port of Dieppe; the landing was designed to test the feasibility of a cross-channel invasion. The attack was poorly planned and ended in disaster; 4,963 soldiers were killed, wounded or captured. Following the Anglo-American victory against Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in North Africa in May 1943, British, American and Canadian troops invaded Sicily in July 1943, followed by Italy in September. By December the Allies' progress had slowed facing tenacious German resistance and the difficult geography of the Italian Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|In late 1143, Stephen faced a {{new threat}} in the east, when Geoffrey de Mandeville, the Earl of Essex, rose up in {{rebellion}} against the King in East Anglia. Stephen had disliked the baron for several years, and provoked the conflict by summoning Geoffrey to court, where the King arrested him. Stephen threatened to execute Geoffrey unless the baron handed over his various castles, including the Tower of London, Saffron Walden and Pleshey, all important fortifications because they were in, or close to, London. Geoffrey gave in, but once free he headed north-east into the Fens to the Isle of Ely, from where he began a military campaign against Cambridge, {{with the intention of}} progressing south towards London. With all of his other problems and with Hugh Bigod in open revolt in Norfolk, Stephen lacked <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> track Geoffrey down in the Fens and made do with building a screen of castles between Ely and London, including Burwell Castle.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Beersheba in October 1917, it {{was again}} Chauvel and his Desert Mounted Corps that had the {{critical}} role. Chetwode believed that the EEF did not have <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> defeat the Turks in their fixed positions so he planned to drive the Turks from them by turning the enemy flank at Beersheba, in a waterless area on the flank of the enemy line. The Desert Mounted Corps would have a long overnight approach over waterless desert {{and would have to}} capture the town with its wells intact or be forced to retreat. The Battle of Beersheba went right down to the line, but the mission was accomplished, albeit not without a mounted infantry bayonet charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade– the last of history's great cavalry charges– to capture the town and its vital water supply. Few battles have been won in such spectacular fashion. For this decisive victory, and the subsequent capture of Jerusalem, Chauvel was mentioned in despatches twice more, and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1918 New Year Honours List.|$|E
5|$|Lacking <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> rebuild Sarawak {{after the}} war, Charles Vyner Brooke decided to cede Sarawak as British Crown Colony and a Cession Bill was put {{forth in the}} Council Negri (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly), which was debated for three days.

This caused hundreds of Malay civil servants to resign in protest, sparking an anti-cession movement and {{the assassination of the}} second colonial governor of Sarawak Sir Duncan Stewart. Despite the resistance, Sarawak became a British Crown colony on 1 July 1946. Anthony Brooke opposed the cession of Sarawak to the British Crown, for which he was banished from Sarawak by the colonial government. He was only allowed to return 17 years later after Sarawak had become part of Malaysia. In 1950 all anti-cession movements in Sarawak ceased after a clamp-down by the colonial government.|$|E

Ownership of sufficient <b>resources</b> <b>to</b> buy <b>the</b> items the trader bids for, or ownership of <b>resources</b> <b>the</b> trader offers for sale are examples of such market-imposed constraints.
