40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for factoring a two-impulse orbital transfer into a three- or four-impulse transfer which solves the rendezvous problem and satisfies an intermediate timing constraint. Both {{the time of}} rendezvous and the intermediate time of a alinement are formulated as any element of a finite sequence of times. These times are integer multiples of a constant plus an additive constant. The rendezvous condition is an equality constraint, whereas the intermediate alinement is an inequality constraint. The two timing constraints are satisfied by factoring the impulses into collinear parts that vectorially sum to the original impulse and by varying the resultant period differences {{and the number of}} revolutions in each orbit.

The technical focus is on cargo vehicle propulsion for exploration-class missions to the Moon and Mars. Relatively high MPD thruster efficiencies of 0. 43 and 0. 69 have been reported at about 5000 s specific impulse using hydrogen and lithium, respectively. Efficiencies of 0. 10 to 0. 35 in the 1000 to 4500 s specific impulse range have been obtained with other propellants (e. g., Ar, NH 3, N 2). Thermal efficiency data in excess of 0. 80 at MW power levels using pulsed thrusters indicate the potential of high MPD thruster performance.

40|$|Abstract. For a {{sequence}} of values of the <b>total</b> horizontal <b>impulse</b> that converges to 0, there are solitary waves that minimise the energy in a given neighbourhood of the origin in W 2, 2 (R). The problem arises {{in the framework of}} the classical Euler equation when a two-dimensional layer of water above an infinite horizontal bottom is considered, at the surface of which solitary waves propagate under the action of gravity and weak surface tension. The adjective “weak ” refers to the Bond number, which is assumed to be sub-critical (< 1 / 3). This extends previous results on the conditional energetic stability of solitary waves in the super-critical case, namely those by A. Mielke ([7]) and by the author ([1]). Like in the latter, the method is based on di-rect minimisation and concentrated compactness, but without relying on “strict sub-additivity”, which is still unsettled in the present case. Instead, a complete and careful analysis of minimising sequences is performed that allows us to reach a conclusion, based only on the non-existence of “vanish-ing ” minimising sequences. However, in contrast with [1], we are unable to prove the existence of minimisers for all small values of the <b>total</b> horizontal <b>impulse.</b> In fact more is needed to get stability, namely that every minimising sequence has a subsequence that converges to a global minimiser, after possible shifts in the horizontal direction. This will be obtained as a con-sequence of the analysis of minimising sequences. Then exactly the same argument as in [1] gives conditional energetic stability and is therefore not repeated...|$|R

The translational velocity is well approximated for a wide range of experimentally gener-ated vortex rings. It is observed that starting jets with a converg-ing radial velocity create vortex rings with a significantly higher translational velocity. The converging radial velocity was observed to increase translational velocity by as much as 30 % over parallel jet flows with identical volume flux and nozzle diam-eter, but the exact increase is specific to the nozzle arrangement and driving conditions.
