Hossington also revealed in an earlier interview in 2015 that, as part of the thirtieth anniversary, 'the hospital itself will be in jeopardy.' Kent commented on the storyline saying: 'We'll bring in some Holby characters, plus some other faces from the past and something major will happen <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> lead characters that will take them a very long time to recover from — the ramifications will be felt in the ED for some time.' ...|$|E

However, lawyers representing the rally organisers stated that was not the case, rather, the event was [...] "a show of support <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> fellow Royal Marines and not a 'political protest. A related online government petition raised over 100,000 signatures calling for Sergeant Blackman's immediate release stating that the soldier had been condemned for defending his country. Within hours of the MoD's decision Michael Fallon, Minister for Defence, put out a government statement saying that the UK would maintain military operations in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future.|$|E

While I ultimately liked the episode, {{it felt like the}} show was continuing to use her as a punching bag to move the plot forward. Need something bad to happen <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> characters? Just take it out on Regina! Granted, it’s a formula that has served Once Upon A Time in the past, but at this point, it just felt repetitive. That’s why “Only You” and “An Untold Story” provided such a fresh change of pace for a season finale that not only sets up the next phase of the story, but also promises to put Regina in a more central role." ...|$|E
