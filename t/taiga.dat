5|$|The {{peninsula}} {{is covered}} by <b>taiga</b> {{in the south and}} tundra in the north. In the tundra, cold and windy conditions and permafrost limit the growth of the trees, resulting in a landscape dominated by grasses, wildflowers, and shrubs such as dwarf birch and cloudberry. In northern coastal areas, stony and shrub lichens are common. The <b>taiga</b> in the southern areas is composed mostly of pine trees and firs.|$|E
5|$|Tundra {{occurs in}} the far Northern Hemisphere, north of the <b>taiga</b> belt, {{including}} vast areas of northern Russia and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Siberian accentor is {{parasitised}} by the <b>taiga</b> tick, {{which can}} host the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi, {{the cause of}} Lyme disease.|$|E
5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax {{community in the}} far north of the northern hemisphere is moist <b>taiga</b> or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest). <b>Taiga</b> is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba natural {{communities}} may {{be grouped}} within five ecozones: boreal plains, prairie, <b>taiga</b> shield, boreal shield and Hudson plains. Three of these—taiga shield, boreal shield and Hudson plain—contain part of the Boreal forest of Canada which covers the province's eastern, southeastern, and northern reaches.|$|E
5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} <b>taiga.</b> It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The <b>taiga</b> is dominated by coniferous trees, notably balsam fir and black spruce, though the deciduous white birch, trembling aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, pine marten, short-tailed weasel, and American mink. Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. Willow ptarmigan, common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} subarctic willow and birch forests, and open coniferous woodland, often close to rivers or bogs, although pairs {{are also found}} in mountains and spruce <b>taiga.</b> In winter, the Siberian accentor occupies bushes and shrubs, often near streams, but may {{also be found in}} dry grassland and woods.|$|E
5|$|The bird life is {{dominated}} by species from the Siberian <b>taiga,</b> which are otherwise not common in Norway. Species inhabiting the park include Siberian jay, pine grosbeak, Bohemian waxwing, common crane and whooper swan. Several species of sparrow and charadriiformes are also common. There are also three species of Falconiformes—rough-legged buzzard, merlin and osprey, the latter which can be seen hunting over Ellenvatn and Ødevatn. The great grey owl and northern hawk-owl are common in years with good access to rodents.|$|E
5|$|The flora {{found in}} the {{mountain}} belongs to the Central Asian steppe and consists of coniferous forests of the <b>taiga.</b> The plant species reported are 28 listed in the Mongolian Red Book, 15 very rare species, and 28 species listed as rare species. The species listed in the IUCN Red List are found here: two critically endangered species, four endangered species, and eight vulnerable species.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} its western border {{running along the}} Finland–Norway border. The two most {{prominent}} lakes are Ellenvatn and Ødevatn, both of which flow into tributaries of the river Pasvikelva. The fauna and flora are typical of the Siberian <b>taiga,</b> and include some species uncommon for Norway. The park is a habitat for the brown bear and also has a large population of moose; reindeer husbandry takes place during winter. Eight species of fish live in the lakes and the park has 190 species of flowering plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{trends of}} large polychrome {{paintings}} {{continued into the}} Edo period (1603–1868). The Rinpa school, best represented by Tawaraya Sōtatsu and Ogata Kōrin, used vibrant colors to depict classical themes from Japanese literature and Heian period poetry. In the 18th century, paintings of Yuan dynasty scholar-amateur painters were brought to Japan and imitated, giving rise to the Nanga or Bunjinga style of painting. Two {{of the most prominent}} painters of this school were Ike no <b>Taiga</b> and Yosa Buson.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{areas of}} the {{wilderness}} area are covered by a <b>taiga</b> forest of Scots pine. Less common trees include downy birch, goat willow, aspen and rowan. Logging {{in the past has}} mostly occurred in the southern part ("Kessi"), a large proportion of Vätsäri's forests being old-growth forests. The barren soil makes for poor growth conditions and most of the ground vegetation in the forests is subshrubs. One area with limestone rock features green spleenwort. The reserve is located in an area between a western and eastern vegetation zones, giving rise to unique combinations of species, such as Siberian spruce and red cottongrass.|$|E
5|$|About 190 {{species of}} {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} park have been registered, {{most of which are}} part of the natural composition of the Siberian <b>taiga.</b> Marsh Labrador tea is the most common, the park being one of only three locations in Norway where it occurs. The most common berry plant is lingonberry; common bilberry and bog bilberry are also common, but do not carry good yields of berries. In August there is normally a good yield of cloudberry, and occasionally there can be found Arctic raspberry. There is a limited number of marine plants. The steep cliffs at Revsaksskaret allow mountainous plants to thrive, such as Alpine chickweed, white bluegrass and brittle bladder-fern. These were common throughout the area after the last glacial period, but have vanished with forestation. Other mountainous plants common in the region are not found in Pasvik because of low oxygen levels in the lower soil levels.|$|E
5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, temperate deciduous forest, <b>taiga,</b> tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, {{the human body is}} a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays {{a significant role in the}} ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.|$|E
5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and <b>Taiga</b> bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern European Plain {{encompasses}} Belarus {{and most}} of European Russia. The plain is mostly mountain-free and comprises several plateaus. Russia's northernmost regions are tundra. The Russian Tundra {{is located on the}} coastline with the Arctic and is known for its total darkness in the winter. <b>Taiga</b> reaches Russia's southern borders in Siberia and accounts for 60% of the country. Towards the Ural Mountains and in northern Kazakhstan, the climate is mostly temperate. South-West Russia and Kazakhstan are mostly steppe. The Kazakh steppe covers one-third of Kazakhstan and is the world's largest dry steppe region. Armenia is mostly mountainous and its climate is continental. The landlocked country shares no direct border with other members states. It is located in the south-western part of Asia, occupying the north-eastern part of the Armenian Plateau, and is located between the Caucasus and the Near East.|$|E
5|$|The James Bay {{hydroelectric}} dam complex contains several {{relatively short}} 735kV power lines that send electricity to three principal substations, ordered from west to east: Radisson, Chissibi, and Lemoyne. From these substations, six 735kV power lines traverse the vast expanses of <b>taiga</b> and boreal forest in clear-cut stretches of land; this shows up clearly in aerial photos. The terrain {{that the power}} lines cross is {{for the most part}} not mountainous, but smooth and replete with lakes. Generally, four of the lines runs together in two pairs and the other two run solo, although the two single lines sometimes do run in a pair. Two intermediate 735kV power lines, one in the north and one in the south, connect all six power lines along their path to southern Quebec.|$|E
5|$|Tigers can {{occupy a}} wide range of habitat types, but will usually require {{sufficient}} cover, proximity to water, and an abundance of prey. Compared to the lion, the tiger prefers denser vegetation, for which its camouflage colouring is ideally suited, and where a single predator is not at a disadvantage compared with the multiple felines in a pride. A further habitat requirement is the placement of suitably secluded den locations, which may consist of caves, large hollow trees, or dense vegetation. Bengal tigers in particular live in many types of forests, including wet, evergreen, and the semievergreen of Assam and eastern Bengal; the swampy mangrove forest of the Ganges Delta; the deciduous forest of Nepal, and the thorn forests of the Western Ghats. In various parts of their range they inhabit or have inhabited additionally partially open grassland and savanna as well as <b>taiga</b> forests and rocky habitats.|$|E
5|$|Tigers once ranged widely across eastern Eurasia, {{from the}} Black Sea in the west, to the Indian Ocean in the south, and from Kolyma to Sumatra in the east. Over the past 100 years, {{they have lost}} 93% of their {{historic}} range, and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and from large areas of Southeast, Southern, and Eastern Asia. Today, they range from the Siberian <b>taiga</b> to open grasslands and tropical mangrove swamps. The remaining six tiger subspecies have been classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The global population in the wild is estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 individuals, down from around 100,000 {{at the start of}} the 20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other, in which about 2,000 tigers live on the Indian subcontinent. A 2016 global census estimated the population of wild tigers at approximately 3,890 individuals. Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. The extent of area occupied by tigers is estimated at less than , a 41% decline from the area estimated in the mid-1990s. In 2016, the WWF declared that the world's count of wild tigers has risen for the first time in a century.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>taiga</b> is {{dominated}} by podzolic and cryogenic <b>taiga</b> soils, characterized by clearly defined horizontal structure (only in the southern <b>taiga</b> there are sod-podzolic soil). Formed in a leaching regime, poor humus om. Groundwater is normally found in the forest close to the surface, washing calcium from the upper layers, resulting in {{the top layer of}} soil of the <b>taiga</b> discolored and oxidized. Few areas of the <b>taiga,</b> suitable for farming, are located mainly in the European part of Russia. Large areas are occupied by sphagnum marshes (here {{is dominated}} by podzolic-boggy soil). To enrich the soil for agricultural purposes should be making lime and other fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Taiga</b> - {{the most}} {{extensive}} natural area of Russia - stretches from the western borders of Russia to the Pacific. It occupies {{the territory of the}} Eastern Europe and West Siberian plains to the north of 56 ° -58 ° N and most of the territory east of Yenisei River <b>taiga</b> forests reach the southern borders of Russia in Siberia <b>taiga</b> only accounts for over 60% of Russia. In the north-south direction the eastern <b>taiga</b> is divided (east of the Yenisei River), with a continental climate, and west, with a milder climate, in general, the climate zone is moist, moderately warm (cool in the north) in the summer and harsh winter, there is a steady snow cover in the winter. In the latitudinal direction the <b>taiga</b> is divided into three subzones - northern, middle and southern <b>taiga.</b> In the western <b>taiga</b> dense spruce and fir forests on wetlands alternate with pine forests, shrubs and meadows on the lighter soils. Such vegetation is typical of the eastern <b>taiga,</b> but it plays an important role not fir and larch. Coniferous forest, however, does not form a continuous array and sparse areas of birch, alder, willow (mainly in river valleys), the wetlands - marshes. Within the <b>taiga</b> are widespread fur-bearing animals - sable, marten, ermine, moose, brown bear, wolverine, wolf, and muskrat.|$|E
25|$|In the 2007 NHK <b>Taiga</b> drama, Fuurin Kazan, Uesugi Kenshin {{is portrayed}} by Japanese singer-songwriter Gackt. The 2009 NHK <b>Taiga</b> drama Tenchijin {{tells the story}} of Uesugi Kenshin, {{although}} its main focus is on Naoe Kanetsugu, the page and later advisor to Uesugi Kenshin's adopted son and heir Uesugi Kagekatsu.|$|E
25|$|In {{temperate}} Europe, {{mixed forest}} with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species {{in central and}} western Europe are beech and oak. In the north, the <b>taiga</b> is a mixed spruce–pine–birch forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the <b>taiga</b> gives way to tundra as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many olive trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; Mediterranean Cypress is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian grassland (the steppe) extends eastwards from Ukraine and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into <b>taiga</b> to the north.|$|E

25|$|The Denali Complex, dated roughly to 10,500 to 8,000 years ago, was {{originally}} defined by F. H West. Some Denali Complex archaeological sites: Mt. Hayes, Swan Point, and Gerstle River. Both Nenana and Denali technology persist in central Alaska throughout the Holocene. The {{relationship between the}} proposed Nenana and Denali complexes is as of yet unresolved. The boreal forest in Interior Alaska (Interior Alaska-Yukon lowland <b>taiga</b> of Tanana region and Copper Plateau <b>taiga</b> of Ahtna region) was established 8,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} {{forests of}} spruce, fir, pine, and larch, collectively {{known as the}} <b>taiga,</b> made up the largest natural zone of the Soviet Union, an area {{about the size of}} the United States. Here too the winter is long and severe, as witnessed by the routine registering of the world's coldest temperatures for inhabited areas in the northeastern portion of this belt. The <b>taiga</b> zone extended in a broad band across the middle latitudes, stretching from the Finnish border in the west to the Verkhoyansk Range in northeastern Siberia and as far south as the southern shores of Lake Baykal. Isolated sections of <b>taiga</b> are found along mountain ranges, as in the southern part of the Urals, and in the Amur River Valley in the Far East. About 33 percent of the population lives in this zone, which, with the mixed forest zone, included most of the European part of the Soviet Union and the ancestral lands of the earliest Slavic settlers.|$|E
25|$|Except for the Arctic Ocean {{coastal plain}} and high elevations, most of Yukon {{is in the}} boreal forest ecoregion. Most {{mountain}} peaks and higher elevations are characterized by Alpine tundra while the coastal plain is Arctic coastal tundra. More precisely, according to Environment Canada's ecozone definitions, southern and central Yukon {{is part of the}} Boreal Cordillera Ecozone while the northern forest is part of the <b>Taiga</b> Cordillera Ecozone. The Peel River area in the northeast is in the <b>Taiga</b> Plains Ecozone and the Arctic coast is in the Southern Arctic Ecozone.|$|E

25|$|The {{geography}} of Russia describes the geographic features of Russia, a country extending {{over much of}} northern Eurasia. Comprising much of eastern Europe and northern Asia, it is the world's largest country in total area. Due to its size, Russia displays both monotony and diversity. As with its topography, its climates, vegetation, and soils span vast distances. From north to south the East European Plain is clad sequentially in tundra, coniferous forest (<b>taiga),</b> mixed and broadleaf forests, grassland (steppe), and semi-desert (fringing the Caspian Sea) as the changes in vegetation reflect the changes in climate. Siberia supports a similar sequence but is predominantly <b>taiga.</b> The country contains forty UNESCO biosphere reserves.|$|E
25|$|The park is {{situated}} in the WWF terrestrial ecoregion Scandinavian and Russian <b>taiga,</b> even though a significant portion {{is situated}} above the treeline, and therefore becomes more like the Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands ecoregion.|$|E
25|$|The Karelian Isthmus {{lies within}} the {{ecoregion}} of Scandinavian and Russian <b>taiga.</b> Geobotanically, it {{lies at the}} juncture of the Central European, Eastern European and Northern European floristic provinces of the Circumboreal Region of the Holarctic Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 NHK <b>Taiga</b> drama Ryōmaden, {{which deals}} with the Bakumatsu period, portrayed Perry as a menacing, steadfast {{military}} commander {{who was able to}} subjugate the then-seemingly invincible Tokugawa shogunate through blunt negotiation. He was played by Timothy Harris.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic Cordillera is {{a narrow}} ecozone {{compared}} to other Canadian ecozones. The majority of this ecozone borders the Northern Arctic, while the small segment within Labrador borders the <b>Taiga</b> Shield. However, bordering the <b>Taiga</b> Shield seems to affect neither itself nor the ecozones it borders because their biological properties appear to be opposites (cold climate versus warm climate; different species of plants and animals). While the Arctic Cordillera mountain system includes most of the Arctic islands and regions such as Bathurst Island, Cornwall Island, Amund Ringnes Island, Ellef Ringnes Island, Ellesmere Island, Baffin Island, Bylot Island and Labrador, the Arctic Cordillera Ecozone only covers Ellesmere Island, Baffin Island, Axel Heiberg Island, Bylot Island and Labrador.|$|E
