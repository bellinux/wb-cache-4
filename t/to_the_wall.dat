30|$|During conditioning, {{a greater}} amount of solvent evaporates from the cell {{cavities}} than from <b>the</b> cell <b>walls,</b> which increases <b>the</b> concentration of solute in <b>the</b> cavities compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> This concentration difference causes <b>the</b> solute <b>to</b> diffuse from <b>the</b> cavities <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> [3].|$|R
40|$|A scaling {{theory is}} {{developed}} for diffusion-limited cluster aggregation in a porous medium, where the primary particles and clusters stick irreversibly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> pore space {{as well as}} to each other. Three scaling regimes are predicted, connected by smooth crossovers. The first regime is at low primary particle concentrations where the primary particles stick individually <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> <b>The</b> second regime is at intermediate concentrations where clusters grow to a certain size, smaller than the pore size, then stick individually <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> <b>The</b> third regime is at high concentrations where the final state is a pore-space-filling network.

From 2006 until present time, several sources such as RIAA, Rolling Stone, and Time have claimed that Michael Jackson has sold 750 million units (or even 1 billion), however, Adrian Strain, a representative from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) has said that this figure is unreal.|$|E
5|$|According to the Shenboo Atlas of 1933, in the 1930s {{most people}} lived within the {{perimeter}} of the Xi'an Wall but still {{there were a lot of}} unoccupied open areas. Among the visitors who came to see the Xian Wall were American captain (later general) Stilwell in 1922 and the Czech sinologist Jaroslav Průšek (1906–1980) in 1933. In 1983, the administration of the Xi'an municipality carried out more renovations and additions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> At that time, the Yangmacheng tower, the Zhalou sluice tower, the Kuixinglou dipper tower, the Jiaolou corner tower and the Dilou defense tower were all refurbished; the crumbling parts of the rampart were changed into gates; and the moat was restored. In May 2005, all of Xi'an's ramparts were inter-connected.|$|E

Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, the Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseinni ordered an opening be made at the {{southern}} end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall.
