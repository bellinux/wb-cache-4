5|$|The Original All Blacks {{introduced}} several innovations to rugby in France and the British Isles. At {{the time}} of their tour many critics in the Northern Hemisphere blamed the use of the wing–forward for the All Blacks success. These critics claimed this player—who fed the ball into the scrum—would obstruct opposition players, and that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>they</b> were not being penalised was due to poor refereeing. Their success however was due to a combination of factors, the most important being the team's discipline and organisation, which was described at the time as a scientific approach.|$|E
25|$|The {{night of}} 30 January 1895 was stormy. In the North Sea, {{conditions}} were freezing {{and there were}} huge seas. SS Elbe had left Bremerhaven for New York {{earlier in the day}} with 354 passengers aboard. Also at sea on this rough night was the steamship Crathie, sailing from Aberdeen in Scotland, heading for Rotterdam. As conditions grew worse, the Elbe discharged warning rockets to alert other ships to her presence. The Crathie either did not see the warning rockets or chose to ignore them. She did not alter her course, with such disastrous consequences, that she struck the liner on her port side with such force that whole compartments of the Elbe were immediately flooded. The collision happened at 5.30 am and most of the passengers were still asleep.The Elbe began to sink immediately and the captain, von Goessel, gave the order to abandon ship. Amid great scenes of panic the crew managed to lower two of the Elbes lifeboats. One of the lifeboats capsized as too many passengers tried in vain to squeeze into the boat. Twenty people scrambled into the second lifeboat, of whom 15 were members of the crew. The others were four male second-class passengers and a young lady’s maid by the name of Anna Boecker, who had been lucky enough to be pulled from the raging sea after the first boat had capsized. Meanwhile, {{on the other side of}} the Elbe, Captain von Goessel had ordered all the women and children to assemble there but no other lifeboats were launched because the ropes on the derricks were all frozen up, and so they perished along with the captain. Within 20 minutes of the collision, the Elbe had sunk and the only survivors were the 20 people in the one surviving lifeboat. These people now had to endure mountainous seas and below-zero temperatures and they were 50 miles from land. Things looked bleak; the Elbes distress rockets had not been seen by any passing vessels and so no one knew of their predicament. After five hours in the raging storm, their luck changed. A fishing smack from Lowestoft called the Wildflower found them. In desperate conditions the crew of the Wildflower struggled to pull the 20 survivors from the lifeboat, which had begun to break up. The skipper, William Wright, said later that the survivors would not have lasted another hour in those conditions, and believed that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>they</b> had stayed alive for five hours was the expertise of the Elbes crewmen aboard the lifeboat.|$|E
50|$|The Anglos in Texas were Americans, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> had {{not been}} annexed by the United States in 1836 were {{northern}} Congressional resistance to another slave state and a dispute with Mexico over the southern boundary of Texas. While waiting for admission, the Texans in 1839 expelled the Cherokee, Shawnee, {{and most of the}} Delaware that the Mexican government had encouraged to settle in eastern Texas to keep Americans out in the first place. Houston was re-elected president and set about repairing the damage done by Lamar's administration. He not only had to deal with Comanches, but a second war with Mexico (1841-42).|$|R

The vast majority of patients who present with stroke-like symptoms, in whom onset time is suspected to be> 3 to 4. 5 hours and cannot be established reliably, are not con-sidered for thrombolytic therapy according to standard practice guidelines.

It was important, though, for the King to gain the backing of the City of London, and Exton, on his behalf, attempted to achieve this in October 1387 by requesting, unsuccessfully, that all the craft guilds would take an oath of loyalty to Richard. On the other hand, Knighton's Chronical suggests that although the King attempted to force the City to raise an army for royal use, Exton informed him that the inhabitants [...] "were in the main craftsmen and merchants, with no great military experience" [...] and that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>they</b> could ever be raised in arms was to defend the city itself. Nevertheless, the King despatched a warrant for the arrest of the rebel lords, and it was the responsibility of Exton to execute it; however, says Jonathan Sumption, Exton [...] "quailed before such a task [...] resolved that the city had no business executing a warrant of this kind." [...] In December that year he authorised the opening of the city gates to the Lords Appellant (although only [...] "once their victory [...] had become certain"). Indeed, he may have actually greeted the lords outside the city gates and accompanied them back into London.

40|$|Radical Islamism is a {{challenging}} new pheno- menon {{in the modern}} world, including Indonesia. Solo presents an especially interesting case because of the disproportionate nature of the radical Islamic groups that have emerged here especially that of the Front Pemuda Islam Surakarta (FPIS) {{as well as other}} vigilante groups in the city. This paper will explore and map out the nature of Islam in Solo and asks what triggers the the emergence of the radical groups here. Dramatic changes at the national level have made Solo more politically conducive for radical Islamic groups, but this is not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>they</b> have flourished. In addition, historical and sociological factors may help such groups to emerge. Hence, the dominance of the abangan group (the nominal Muslims) and the intensity of dakwah (preaching) conducted by some Islamic groups has given rise to the ‘instant’ Muslims who see Islam as the ultimate solution to their problems. The call for jihād and the application of sharī‘ah laws are among the contentious political style that the groups propagated. It is these issues that the paper is interested to investigate.

60|$|This island, {{although}} generally {{called one}} of the Marquesas, is by some navigators considered as forming one of a distinct cluster, comprising the islands of Roohka, Ropo, and Nukuheva; upon which three the appellation of the Washington Group has been bestowed. They form a triangle, and lie within the parallels of 8° 38′ and 9° 32′ south latitude, and 139° 20′ and 140° 10′ west longitude, from Greenwich. With how little propriety they are to be regarded as forming a separate group will be at once apparent, when it is considered that they lie in the immediate vicinity of the other islands, that is to say, less than a degree to the north-west of them; that their inhabitants speak the Marquesan dialect, and that their laws, religion, and general customs are identical. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>they</b> were ever thus arbitrarily distinguished, may be attributed to the singular fact, that their existence was altogether unknown to the world until the year 1791, when they were discovered by Captain Ingraham, of Boston, Massachusetts, nearly two centuries after the discovery of the adjacent islands by the agent of the Spanish Viceroy.

Spaceboy is bewildered {{when there is a}} sudden flash. Seconds later, his surroundings and [...] "perfect life" [...] is burnt to ash. The Monocle appears and asks if Spaceboy really thought it would [...] "all turn out all right". Spaceboy wakes up and the story proceeds to Hazel and Cha-Cha's Hideaway where Agnes has taken off the shoes (out of respect) of The Séance (leaving him open to use his powers). Hazel and Cha-Cha enter the room where Seance (presumed dead by the duo), a useless Spaceboy, and Agnes are held and reveal to have with them the nuclear explosive codes which Kennedy had given to Hargreeves Seventeen Years Ago. The duo activate <b>the</b> codes <b>only</b> to discover that it has a timer. Seconds later, Cha-Cha pulls out a gun and blasts Hazel's brains out before pulling the trigger on himself. It's revealed that Séance (with God's help) has returned from the dead and that he had possessed Cha-Cha {{and at the same time}} disarm the codes. Meanwhile, at the Perseus Building, spoiled son of corporate millionaire (Mr.Perseus) is arguing with the board of his corporation on what to do with millions that has recently come into his possession. To one of the board member's disaray, he proposes that they invest the money on some Experiments, and that anyone who tries to get in his way will be killed. The story proceeds to the Corrections Department (The Office At The End Of Time) where Carmichael is discussing tactics to the Temps Aeternalis on how they're to finish the job of assassinating John F. Kennedy which the older Number Five had failed to do so. Carmichael reveals the younger Number Five in the front of the room (causing the Temnps to react immediately via pulling their laser guns out) to which Number Five responds not to bother and that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> aren't dead already is because he has decided to help. Later that night, Seance, Spaceboy, and Kraken meet at back at The Umbrella Academy where Séance appears to be digging up Pogo's grave. It's revealed that Pogo wasn't buried under his memorial, but rather a Temps Aeternalis agent who tells them (through Séance) that Number Five is planning to go back to 1963, Dallas, to assassinate JFK, which angers Kraken. Séance, Kraken and Spaceboy use the dead agent's time machine to go back in time. Meanwhile back in Hazel and Cha-Cha's Hideaway, Body (Inspector Lupo's Chimpanzee Partner) and a handful of officers are tending to Agnes (who apparently remained at the scene of the crime). Body then hears a beeping sound, Agnes tells him it is the nuclear detonator (with one second remaining), ending Chapter Four (and the world).|$|R

40|$|We {{all know}} that the call for student savings and the {{textbook}} affordability crisis have catapulted OER and open textbooks into the spotlight. But that 2 ̆ 7 s not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>they</b> have such a valuable {{role to play in}} higher ed and libraries. While student savings are nice, student learning is nicer! This presentation will focus on the vital role open textbooks and OER can - and should - play in instruction and advancing pedagogical and curricular change. Librarians are at the front lines of curriculum development, pedagogical innovation, and assessment of student learning. Locally, we cultivate and value our collaborations with partners in Teaching 2 ̆ 6 Learning and IT, and many of us are members of curriculum committees, and other campus governance structures that focus on impacting student learning. At the national level, in 2013, the Association of College and Research Libraries published a white paper, 2 ̆ 2 Intersections of Scholarly Communication and Information Literacy: Creating Strategic Collaborations for a Changing Academic Environment, 2 ̆ 2 where the case was made for 2 ̆ 2 strategic realignment for librarians in order for libraries to be resilient in the face of tremendous change in the scholarly information environment 2 ̆ 2. At that time, the intersections reflected the ACRL Information Literacy Standards and focused on the economics of the distribution of scholarship, digital literacies, and libraries 2 ̆ 7 changing roles. All three intersections emphasized the importance of innovations in teaching, publishing and content rights, and technology. There are many successful examples of librarians and faculty engaging on these topics. Today, with the launch of the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education and its emphasis on Threshold Concepts combined with the growing awareness and adoption of open educational content in higher ed we have even more opportunities for successful collaborations, particularly among scholarly communications and information literacy librarians. This presentation will make the case for how open textbooks and OER can foster collaboration between instruction librarians, scholarly communication librarians, and faculty in order to advance access to course content, improve student learning, and continue the crusade for saving students money on course content. Join us to discuss how pedagogy and assessment around open textbooks can be the key to: 1) deepening information literacy and scholarly communications awareness by including open educational content in library instruction sessions (and our captive audiences), and 2) engaging librarians and faculty in university-wide dialog about open educational content...|$|R

60|$|But {{that they}} wouldn’t was {{more and more}} {{perceptible}} from day to day. They continued to “chivey,” as Morgan called it, and in due time became aware {{of a variety of}} reasons for proceeding to Venice. They mentioned a great many of them—they were always strikingly frank and had the brightest friendly chatter, at the late foreign breakfast in especial, before the ladies had made up their faces, when they leaned their arms on the table, had something to follow the demitasse, and, in the heat of familiar discussion as to what they “really ought” to do, fell inevitably into the languages in which they could tutoyer. Even Pemberton liked them then; he could endure even Ulick when he heard him give his little flat voice for the “sweet sea-city.” That was what made him have a sneaking kindness for them—that they were so out of the workaday world and kept him so out of it. The summer had waned when, with cries of ecstasy, they all passed out on the balcony that overhung the Grand Canal. The sunsets then were splendid and the Dorringtons had arrived. The Dorringtons were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>they</b> hadn’t talked of at breakfast; but the reasons they didn’t talk of at breakfast always came out in the end. The Dorringtons on the other hand came out very little; or else when they did they stayed—as was natural—for hours, during which periods Mrs. Moreen and the girls sometimes called at their hotel (to see if they had returned) as many as three times running. The gondola was for the ladies, as in Venice too there were “days,” which Mrs. Moreen knew in their order an hour after she arrived. She immediately took one herself, to which the Dorringtons never came, though on a certain occasion when Pemberton and his pupil were together at St. Mark’s—where, taking the best walks they had ever had and haunting a hundred churches, they {{spent a great deal of}} time—they saw the old lord turn up with Mr. Moreen and Ulick, who showed him the dim basilica as if it belonged to them. Pemberton noted how much less, among its curiosities, Lord Dorrington carried himself as a man of the world; wondering too whether, for such services, his companions took a fee from him. The autumn at any rate waned, the Dorringtons departed, and Lord Verschoyle, the eldest son, had proposed neither for Amy nor for Paula.|$|E

60|$|The key to an {{operation}} that should at once, {{with the aid of}} the disaffected liberals and the Irish, turn out Mr. Gladstone and secure the English elections, was an understanding with Mr. Parnell. The price of such an understanding was to drop coercion, and that price the tory leaders resolved to pay. The manœuvre was delicate. If too plainly disclosed, it might outrage some of the tory rank and file who would loathe an Irish alliance, and it was likely, moreover, to deter some of the disaffected liberals from joining in any motion for Mr. Gladstone’s overthrow. Lord Salisbury and his friends considered the subject with “immense deliberation some weeks before the fall of the government.” They {{came to the conclusion that}} in the absence of official information, they could see nothing to warrant a government in applying for a renewal of exceptional powers. That conclusion they profess to have kept sacredly in their own bosoms. Why they should give immense deliberation to a decision that in their view must be worthless without official information, and that was to remain for an indefinite time in mysterious darkness, was never explained when this secret decision some months later was revealed to the public.(122) If there was no intention of making the decision known to the Irishmen, the purpose of so unusual a proceeding would be inscrutable. Was it made known to them? Mr. McCarthy, at the time acting for his leader, has described circumstantially how the Irish were endeavouring to obtain a pledge against coercion; how two members of the tory party, one of them its recognised whip, came to him in succession declaring that they came straight from Lord Salisbury with certain propositions; how he found the assurance unsatisfactory, and asked each of these gentlemen in turn on different nights to go back to Lord Salisbury, and put further questions to him; and how each of them professed to have gone back to Lord Salisbury, to have conferred with him, and to have brought back his personal assurance.(123) On the other hand, it has been uniformly denied by the tory leaders that there was ever any compact whatever with the Irishmen at this moment. We are not called upon here to decide in a conflict of testimony which turns, after all, upon words so notoriously slippery as pledge, compact, or understanding. It is enough to mark what is not denied, that Lord Salisbury and his confidential friends had resolved, subject to official information, to drop coercion, and that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> visible <b>reason</b> why <b>they</b> should form the resolution at that particular moment was its probable effect upon Mr. Parnell.|$|R
