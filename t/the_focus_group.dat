25|$|Rephrasing {{refers to}} skills in which leader repeats what others are saying for more {{clarification}} during a group discussion. <b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> leader typically asks group members for more in-depth opinions after rephrasing. It allows group members {{to have a}} broad perspective in order to view topics from different angles and interpretations. Emotional Control refers to the group leader’s ability to control his or her emotions {{in order for the}} discussion to be effective. It requires developing a tough skin {{to be able to take}} on the lead in the discussion when people lose their tempers. Leaders must aim to diffuse anger and redirect the emotions with constructive analysis and suggestions. S/he must allow providing an avenue to release all the emotions within constructively. After dealing with emotions, the leader must redirect the focus of group discussion.|$|E

25|$|Result: Maria {{suggested}} that Odyssey create a cookbook aimed at professional women; whilst David and Andrew disagreed, everybody else did {{and despite the}} idea being badly received by <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group,</b> Maria persuaded Sean {{to go with it}} anyway, as she thought that it was better to have a target market. The resulting book, while produced fairly professionally, was strongly criticised due to the cover not even making clear that it was a cookbook. On Platinum, the team came up with a book called #Where'sMummy?, which was aimed at people leaving home for the first time, and was designed to tie in with Twitter and other forms of social media. Lucy did not get on with the sub-team of Amy, Alice and Ashleigh and frequently argued with them, and when the book was produced, it contained many spelling errors that the clients were not impressed by (though they did acknowledge the time constraints the group were under). However, Navdeep delivered strong pitches for the cookbook, and Platinum secured orders from all three retailers, with a final total of 7,500 orders. On Odyssey, Maria and Andrew fronted the first two pitches, which seemingly went down well with the clients and {{with the rest of the}} team. However, Sean made the unusual decision to change the pitchers to Patrick and David for the third pitch, which did not go so well. Odyssey ultimately only got 800 orders, from just one of the retailers.|$|E
25|$|There is {{flexibility}} of <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> research in {{being used as}} a qualitative method or a combination of the former with quantitative techniques (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library).The moderator is permitted to inquire into and examine unforeseen issues due to this kind of format. Has high face validity and naturalistic- as it includes storytelling, joking, disagreements, boasting and more (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library & Morgan). It is relatively inexpensive/relatively low cost (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library). Provides relatively fast results (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library).Consumes lesser time unlike structured interviews in order to increase sample sizes and resource investment (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library). It is helpful and important for needs assessment and project evaluation projects (Savithiri, 2009).Regarding the facts and numbers in research, meaning behind these facts can also be found and confirmed through surveys as it is qualitative in nature(Savithiri, 2009). It is relatively simple to carry out (n.d., National Center for Postsecondary Improvement). It consumes less time as large sample size can be studied (n.d., National Center for Postsecondary Improvement).Information is gained from group interaction due to group dynamics (n.d., National Center for Postsecondary Improvement). It helps in obtaining and gathering contracted and incisive data of specific topic (Morgan).Many new perspectives and opinions are obtained which results in insights (Morgan). Sensitive topics can be discussed leading to personal disclosures (Silverman, 2004).Often these interactions result in creating ‘synergistic effects’ (Silverman, 2004).Vocabulary and language used can be observed (Silverman, 2004). It is much more efficient when the data being gathered is very much related to the researcher’s interests(Morgan).The moderator keeps the discussion in sync with the topic and makes sure one individual does not dominate the other; hence follows an ‘egalitarian’ method(Silverman, 2004 & n.d., Focus Groups: Issues Regarding Advantages and Disadvantages). Non-verbal behavior as well plays a role in the moderator’s decision making and research results (n.d., Focus Groups: Issues Regarding Advantages and Disadvantages). High possibilities in resulting in rich and in-depth information or data (n.d., Focus Groups: Issues Regarding Advantages and Disadvantages & Deem, 1997). It is useful for exploratory research (Deem, 1997). Group interaction can be observed in a controlled setting(Deem, 1997). The reactions of participants towards each other can be analyzed (n.d., Southalabama Education: Strengths and Weaknesses of Focus Groups). Previously neglected or unnoticed phenomena can be drawn towards the researcher’s attention(Silverman, 2004).Helps to inform the development of survey instruments(Silverman, 2004).Opportunistic use of focus groups results in improvised research design and impoverished data(Silverman, 2004).|$|E

500|$|The {{first season}} of Parks and Recreation started to receive {{criticism}} before the premiere episode aired. According to a March 18, 2009, report that was leaked to television journalist Nikki Finke, focus groups responded poorly to a rough-cut {{version of the}} pilot. Many focus group members felt the show was a [...] "carbon copy" [...] of The Office. Some found it predictable, slow-paced and lacking in character development, and felt {{the beginning of the}} episode needed to better explain the setting and plot. Some viewers said the show lacked strong male characters, particularly a [...] "datable" [...] lead. On the other hand, viewers said the show's portrayal of government bureaucracy was [...] "very believable" [...] and had the potential to generate amusing situations. While Poehler's character drew mixed comments, the actress herself was [...] "well liked". The early feedback left many critics and industry observers skeptical about the show's chances of success. In response to the leak, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment, said the feedback on rough cuts is usually negative, even with ultimately successful shows.

500|$|Batman Returns was {{released}} in 1992 with financial success and generally favorable reviews from critics, but Warner Bros. was disappointed with its box office run, having made $150 million less than the first film. Director Tim Burton was asked to restrict himself {{to the role of}} producer, with approval of Joel Schumacher as director and the husband and wife screenwriting couple Lee and Janet Scott-Batchler, who agreed with him that [...] "the key element to Batman is his duality. And it's not just that Batman is Bruce Wayne". Their original script introduced a psychotic Riddler with a pet rat accompanying him. The story elements and much of the dialogue still remained in the finished film, though Schumacher felt it could be [...] "lighted down". Schumacher claims he originally had in mind an adaptation of Frank Miller's [...] Warner Bros. rejected the idea as they wanted a sequel, not a prequel, though Schumacher was able to include very brief events in Bruce Wayne's childhood with some events of the comic The Dark Knight Returns. Akiva Goldsman, who worked with Schumacher on The Client, was brought in to rewrite the script. Burton, who was more interested in directing Ed Wood, later reflected he was taken aback by some of <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> meetings for Batman Forever, a title which he hated. Producer Peter MacGregor-Scott represented the studio's aim in making a film for the MTV Generation with full merchandising appeal.|$|E

30|$|To {{answer the}} {{research}} questions, the researchers utilized an inductive qualitative approach using both <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> and individual interviews. <b>Focus</b> <b>groups</b> were chosen because they allow for openness and promote disclosure; additionally, participants often ask questions of each other, {{which can lead}} the group into unplanned discussions about new phenomena related to the topic (Wilkinson 1998).

Organization Skills helps focus group leaders to plan the theme for group discussions and also develop a printed outline for the meetings. There may be more productive discussions when every member of <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> has a copy of the printed agenda before starting the discussion.

The study also aims {{to determine whether it}} is possible to <b>group</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> used in my study and iPod into Bourdieu´s model. Material/Method: The reference material used in this paper is mainly gathered from books concerning Pierre Bourdieu´s theories. I have also had four <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> of two different characters, to study their attitudes towards Apples mp 3 -player iPod. I have then applied the results of <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> to Bourdieu´s theories and models concerning habitus, social fields, capital and lifestyles, and studied whether there are any divergences in attitudes between the groups.

According to the responses from the people in <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>groups,</b> <b>the</b> attitude and usage of iPod do not mirror people’s social class or background, which goes against Bourdieu´s’ theory.
