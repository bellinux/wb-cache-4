5|$|<b>The</b> <b>blunt</b> {{and short}} claws of Deinocheirus {{are similar to}} those of the therizinosaur Alxasaurus, which {{indicates}} the long arms and claws were used for digging and gathering plants. <b>The</b> <b>blunt</b> claws of the feet could have helped the animal from sinking into substrate when wading. The robust hind limbs and hip region indicates the animal moved slowly. The large size of the animal may have helped it against predators such as Tarbosaurus, but in turn it lost the running ability of other ornithomimosaurs. The long neural spines and possible tail fan may have been used for display behaviour. Deinocheirus was likely diurnal (active during the day), since the sclerotic rings of the eyes were relatively small in comparison with its skull length. The hand had good mobility relative to the lower arm, but was capable of only a limited flexing motion, unable to close in grasping.|$|E
5|$|After the referendum, Chrétien {{attempted}} to pursue constitutional recognition of distinct society, but {{was stopped by}} <b>the</b> <b>blunt</b> refusal of Ontario Premier Mike Harris to discuss any constitutional matters. Not wanting to engage the same negotiations with provincial governments that had dominated the Trudeau and Mulroney governments, Chrétien opted to pursue unilateral Federal changes to fulfill his government's commitments. This included the Act respecting constitutional amendments, which required permission from the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia for Federal approval to be granted to any Constitutional amendment, granting Quebec a de facto veto. The Federal parliament also officially recognized Quebec as a distinct society. Both changes, not being constitutional amendments, are theoretically reversible by future parliaments.|$|E

5|$|Three swords {{are carried}} before the monarch into the Abbey: <b>the</b> <b>blunt</b> Sword of Mercy (also known as Curtana), the Sword of Spiritual Justice and the Sword of Temporal Justice. All three are {{believed}} to have been supplied at the time of JamesVI&I between 1610 and 1620, probably {{by a member of the}} Worshipful Company of Cutlers, using blades that were created in the 1580s by Italian bladesmiths Giandonato and Andrea Ferrara. Since the 15thcentury it had been usual practice for new swords to be made for each coronation. Sold in the civil war, they were returned at the Restoration, and their first recorded use was at the coronation of JamesII in 1685.|$|E
5|$|The traditions {{established}} in the medieval period continued later. By {{the middle of the}} 15thcentury, a crown was formally worn on six religious feasts every year: Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Whitsun, All Saints' Day, and one or both feasts of StEdward. A crown was also displayed and worn at the annual State Opening of Parliament. Around this time, three swords– symbols of kingship since ancient times– were being used in the coronation ceremony to represent the king's powers in the administration of justice: the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Temporal Justice, and <b>the</b> <b>blunt</b> Sword of Mercy. Another emerging item of state regalia was the orb, described in Tudor inventories as a round ball with a cross of gold, which underlined the monarch's sovereignty. Orbs had been pictorial emblems of royal authority in England since the early Middle Ages but a real orb was probably not used at any English coronation until that of HenryVIII in 1509; it would be added to the coronation regalia in the 17thcentury.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{intensity}} and <b>the</b> degree of <b>blunting</b> are <b>the</b> main factors which define the working {{capacity of a}} grinding wheel. When we consider the discrete contact of a grinding wheel with a work piece, the size of <b>the</b> <b>blunting</b> area can be such a factor. The article presents a mathematic model to calculate <b>the</b> <b>blunting</b> area of an abrasive grain whereby the main mechanisms of its wear such as mechanical and physicochemical phenomena are taken into account. The mechanical wear is studied {{from the standpoint of}} the kinetic theory of strength, a durability parameter for the abrasive grain is determined; the physicochemical wear is studied from the mass transfer theory, and coefficients of chemical affinity with the abrasive material are experimentally defined for the assortment of work piece materials. As mechanical and physicochemical wear of abrasive grain depend on the initial size of <b>the</b> <b>blunting</b> area, <b>the</b> suggested mathematic model is the first to consider nonlinear back-coupling, taking into account the size of <b>the</b> <b>blunting</b> area. <b>The</b> developed mathematic model is a multiple-factor one, which will allow to predict the worn area of the abrasive wheel for, and under different technological conditions...|$|R

25|$|Caterhams {{have very}} poor {{aerodynamics}} due to <b>the</b> <b>blunt</b> windscreen, open-wheel design, and open cockpit. At very high speeds, lift becomes a problem. To combat this, the CSR has several features that reduce lift by 50%. The front cycle wings are fitted {{closer to the}} tires to reduce turbulence. In addition, they have a small lip that angles air upward and creates {{a small amount of}} down force. Also, the new front suspension scheme reduces turbulence and drag formerly caused by the spring and damper units. The biggest enhancement is the vent added on top of the nose cone. On previous Caterhams, the air from the radiator caused turbulence by knocking against the engine and other parts on the underside. A plastic panel behind the radiator now directs air straight out through the vent, creating down force and reducing turbulence.|$|E
