50|$|First, a {{tightened}} bolt experiences only a {{small fraction}} of any external load which is applied lateso that a <b>fully</b> <b>tightened</b> bolt can (depending on the exact application) sustain a much greater load than loosely tightened bolt.|$|R
30|$|While {{conducting}} the test {{on the various}} frames, bolts were <b>fully</b> <b>tightened</b> ensuring full fixity at the supports. The dial gauge was checked for proper functioning before it was mounted in the position, and the contact between the dial gauge tip and the frame surface was ensured. The jack centerline was aligned along the beam axis.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{questions}} about this knot's security, it does present some advantages for use in rappels. Because the knot is offset from the axis of tension, it can slide more easily over rough surfaces than other knots; and it is quickly tied and readily untied. Since a stuck rope on a descent also represents a serious hazard to climbers, these advantages, along with ease of tying, have led to its popularity. It is recommended by some sources with the caveats that the ends be left very long (>30 cm), the knot be carefully dressed and <b>fully</b> <b>tightened</b> by pulling individually on all four strands, and then subjected only to moderate rappelling loads.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{track of}} the ride opened in 1985, but a second track was built for the 1986 season. This newer track does not run {{parallel}} to the first, and instead gives a different ride experience. La Ronde once replaced the seats for new seats with safety belts, but were removed to classic bars {{at the request of}} riders. [...] The seats have one lapbar for each row, as well as an individual seatbelt that attaches to the seat divider instead of the seat. This allows riders to [...] "float" [...] during airtime because the seatbelt does not come down to the seat even when <b>fully</b> <b>tightened,</b> new trains build by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters.|$|R
30|$|The RC frames were cast, {{and after}} curing, these were {{mounted on the}} {{reaction}} frame. The bolts were <b>fully</b> <b>tightened</b> <b>to</b> ensure the fixity of supports. The alignment of jack was checked along the beam axis. The initial reading on the proving ring and the dial gauge was recorded. The application of horizontal load was {{with the help of}} a screw/hydraulic jack, and horizontal displacement was noted down from dial gauge. The load was applied at a uniform rate. The loads and the deflections were recorded at regular intervals for each test setup. The load was applied continuously till it remains constant for a particular time on the loading gauge and then moves in a reverse order. This is called as plastic state condition. The collapse load corresponding to this stage was recorded as an ultimate load.|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} procedure {{that results in}} a significant reduction of the computation time and effort {{in the design of}} single plate framing connections is presented herein. This simplified method is based upon the current design procedure which is applicable to partially restrained shear connections. A total of 140 steel beams with 700 analyses and 500 composite beams were used to develop the simplified method. Tables are provided for the design of most commonly used connections. The simplified single plate design is applicable for <b>fully</b> <b>tightened</b> 3 / 4, 7 / 8, and 1. inch A 325 or A 490 bolts used in either standard round or slotted holes, or snug tight A 325 or A 490 bolts in standard holes. These studies have led to a single table of the restraint design moments which greatly simplifies the design procedure...|$|R
