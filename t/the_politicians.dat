5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> became less {{satisfied}} with the solution. Kjeller was considered {{too far away from}} the city center (about , but along the mainline railway), while travel to Gressholmen needed to be made by ferry. <b>The</b> <b>politicians</b> also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport, and it had become clear that serving Gressholmen was interfering with ship traffic. A committee was established to look into the matter. While considering many locations, it made detail surveys of only two places: Ekeberg, located southeast of the city center, and Fornebu, to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E

5|$|Although the U.S. {{command in}} Saigon and <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> in Washington became {{increasingly}} {{aware of this}} arrangement during 19661967, they declined to overtly interfere due to the political ramifications of conducting military operations against a neutral country and the wishes of Sihanouk. Washington still had hopes of reopening a dialog with Sihanouk, and refrained from any actions that might alienate him further.|$|E
5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach <b>the</b> <b>politicians,</b> informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E
5|$|Z. Marcas is a novelette by French author Honoré de Balzac first {{published}} in 1840. Set in contemporary Paris, it describes {{the rise and fall}} of a brilliant political strategist who is abandoned by <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> he helps into power. Destitute and forgotten, he befriends a pair of students who live next door to him in a boarding-house. The story follows their many discussions about the political situation in France.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} {{concerns}} of the scientists participating in the elaboration of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment reports, we study a principal-agent relationship between a politician and a researcher that captures some stylized facts regarding the involvement of politics into scientific research. <b>The</b> <b>politician</b> contracts with a researcher {{in order to get}} some scientific advice about a policy relevant variable. <b>The</b> <b>politician</b> trades off <b>the</b> policy that he would implement {{in the absence of any}} reelection concerns with a desire to please voters by choosing a policy that is supported by scientific advice and that turns out to be the ``right'' policy ex post. As a consequence, <b>the</b> <b>politician</b> bribes <b>the</b> researcher to bias his scientific advice towards the ideal policy of <b>the</b> <b>politician.</b> We study <b>the</b> optimal contracts under symmetric and under asymmetric information about the researcher's ability and concern for reputation, as well as the selection of a researcher by <b>the</b> <b>politician.</b> Thereby we identify several conflicts between the interests of the voters and those of <b>the</b> <b>politician...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{politician}} sets {{policy in}} a changing environment, while a voter learns {{about the ability of}} <b>the</b> <b>politician</b> in order to decide whether to reelect him or not. When the voter cannot observe which policies are optimal, policies are unresponsive to relevant information, and uninformative about the ability of <b>the</b> <b>politician.</b> When <b>the</b> voter can observe optimal policies with arbitrarily large noise and enough decisions by <b>the</b> <b>politician,</b> (i) <b>the</b> voter appoints good policy-makers and tosses out bad policy-makers almost always, (ii) <b>the</b> <b>politician</b> chooses policy as with no career concerns, and (iii) consistent policy records are indicative of ability when past information depreciates fast...|$|R
5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of <b>the</b> <b>politicians,</b> who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would {{open the door for}} an Egyptian take-over and the loss of his power. The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E
5|$|As CGS, Duigan {{proved to}} be an undistinguished {{appointment}} and was not particularly well regarded by <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> of the day. He implemented several organisational changes, one of which was the disestablishment of the GOC position and its replacement with an army board to control the military. When the board was established in November 1937, it included Fred Jones, the Minister of Defence, and Duigan as first military member. Duigan offered little counter to the favouring of the fledgling Royal New Zealand Air Force by the New Zealand Government of the time, and this affected morale within the army.|$|E
5|$|As head of Ileana, Bogdan-Pitești {{organized}} Joséphin Péladan's 1898 {{visit to}} Bucharest. It was a much-publicized event, which {{attracted the attention}} of high society and received ample coverage in the press; Bogdan-Pitești accompanied Péladan on visits to various Bucharest landmarks, including the Athenaeum, the Chamber of Deputies, the Orthodox Metropolitan and Domnița Bălașa churches, as well as the Roman Catholic Saint Joseph Cathedral. Among <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> who attended the ceremonies were Nicolae Filipescu, Constantin Dissescu, Take Ionescu, Ioan Lahovary, and Constantin C.

5|$|He did not tarry long there either: on December 12–13, {{he was in}} Kraków; on December 17, in Wrocław; {{and shortly}} after, he settled in Leipzig, where many notable Polish {{soldiers}} and politicians formed an émigré community. Soon he and some others began plotting an uprising against Russian rule in Poland. <b>The</b> <b>politicians,</b> grouped around Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Kołłątaj, sought contacts with similar opposition groups in Poland and by spring 1793 had been joined by other politicians and revolutionaries, including Ignacy Działyński. While Kołłątaj and others had begun planning an uprising before Kościuszko joined them, his support was a major boon to them, as {{he was among the}} most popular individuals in Poland.|$|E
5|$|People {{struggled}} to survive together, and a rich culture based on shebeens (informal and mostly illegal pubs), mbaqanga music and beer-brewing developed. The shebeens {{were one of}} the main forms of entertainment. People came to the shebeens not only for skokiaan or baberton (illegally self-made alcoholic beverages), but to talk about their daily worries, their political ideas and their fears and hopes. In these shebeens <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> tried to influence others and get them to conform to their form of thinking. If one disagreed he immediately became suspect and was classified as a police informer.|$|E
5|$|Rieber has {{suggested}} a package for <b>the</b> <b>politicians,</b> {{where he would}} create a company that would borrow money to build both the Ulriken Tunnel, a shortening of the line from Hønefoss to Sandvika (the Ringerike Line) and electrify the railway. Since NSB based their fares on the route length traveled, financing would be covered by a surcharge equal to the distance saved; ticket price would remain the same and within twenty years the debt would be covered. The government opposed the suggestion—Trygve Bratteli commenting {{that even though the}} financing was private, it would still have to use the same funding as government debt, and would jeopardize other projects, like the Nordland Line.|$|E

5|$|The American {{command in}} Saigon and <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> in Washington {{were opposed to}} a wet season Hmong offensive, {{supporting}} instead a holding action {{on the edge of}} the Plain of Jars as a prelude to a possible cease-fire. Washington also insisted that U.S. airpower be used to interdict PAVN supply lines, not as close air support for ground operations. Vang Pao took up the offensive anyway, but his forces could only occupy half of the Plain before his offensive sputtered out at the end of July.|$|E
5|$|The Duke {{occupied}} {{the post of}} Lord Warden until 1765, save for two periods when it was filled by James Butler, the Duke of Ormonde and John Sidney, the Earl of Leicester. He carried out extensive work to make the castle more habitable, building extensions towards the north bastion and constructing a small house in the south bastion for the soldiers. Under the subsequent Lord Wardens, <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> Robert Darcy, the Earl of Holderness, and Francis North, the Earl of Guildford, the castle continued to house artillery but it became increasingly less military in character.|$|E

He left the magazine in 1974 to visit Patagonia, which resulted in his first book. He produced five other books, including The Songlines (1987), which was a bestseller. His work is credited with reviving the genre of travel writing, and his works influenced other writers such as William Dalrymple, Claudio Magris, Philip Marsden, Luis Sepúlveda, and Rory Stewart.|$|E

5|$|The {{city council}} voted {{in favour of}} {{building}} the Ring Line on 25 June 1997, against the votes of the Progress Party. However, the decision did not include how the line would be financed, and <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> stated that they were hoping that the state would use national road funds to finance the project. This was partially ensured in December, when a political agreement was reached for Oslo Package 2, a financing plan for investments in public transport in Oslo and Akershus between 2002 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|A weary Emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, an {{increasingly}} discontented ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: all these factors presaged the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve the overthrow of the Imperial system would soon appear within the Army ranks. Republicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, and had little support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a serious threat to the monarchy. These officers favored a republican dictatorship, which they believed would be superior to the liberal democratic monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination {{at the beginning of the}} 1880s, discontent in the army grew in scope and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor was uninterested and <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> proved incapable of re-establishing the government's authority over the military.|$|E
