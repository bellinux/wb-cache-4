500|$|The {{costumes and}} looks {{for each of}} the {{different}} women were chosen by Spears and Kahn. The scenes in the sauna were suggested by Kahn, {{as a response to the}} attacks Spears received over the years about her weight. He stated, [...] "I knew that the whole world would be watching, so I wanted something in there that stated, 'This is Britney, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> should respect her'". The set was cleared for two hours, leaving her and Kahn alone shooting the sequence. Kahn also decided to end the video with an image of Spears smiling, because [...] "We just needed to tell everybody she's OK".|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{have almost}} seen all of Dar al-Manasir and I know of whole gardens being {{sold in the}} [...] Shaiqiyah Country and Rubatab Country. But I know {{of no more than}} two {{instances}} when a Mansuri ever sold his palm trees. And in both cases they only sold one, two or three trees reacting in an emergency situation. Usually, in such situations of financial difficulties the people will ask the person to be patient until they collectively manage {{to come up with the}} necessary money. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> cannot put a price on a palm tree; you would not be able to sell it. Date trees do not have a price! Your palm trees and your offspring are regarded as one (التمر دي و جناك واحيد)".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not with me!' {{she almost}} shrieked. 'No! not with wretched, ignorant, {{polluted}} me! I see--oh God, I see it all! And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{want him to}} marry her--her--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I suppose <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{would give}} no answer yesterday?' Ada Fortescue said, {{as the two}} girls walked briskly back toward Chamounix, {{followed}} more leisurely by Mr. Hawtrey and his friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{likes to}} meet one's friends, but I {{do not know}} if <b>this</b> alone <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> sent for me," [...] he said. [...] "If it is not, you see your servant!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Criticism has {{no clear}} motivation: [...] "why {{are you telling}} me <b>this,</b> and <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> telling me about it now?".|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{insisted upon}} a valet!" [...] James Van Teyl exclaimed, his voice thick with anger. [...] "He's planted here to rob for you! Is that it, eh, Fischer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I {{begin to}} understand! <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{wanted to learn}} to manage a canoe and train {{yourself}} to walking through the bush. But it's a ridiculous undertaking. Your father, who found it, could not locate the ore again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she cried, [...] "as I am {{an honest}} woman and loyal! <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> left the boat {{down to the}} shoore, you old traitor, you, is it? To help off sich noxious trade as {{this out of the}} hands of her majesty's quorum and rotulorum? Eh? Stand back, cowards! Will you strike a woman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I thought I had got at his secret, {{and said}} carelessly: [...] "Then I suppose <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the reason <b>why</b> <b>you</b> broke off your {{engagement}} with Miss Millikens?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "A celebrated publicist, {{recently}} deceased {{at a great}} age. You see him unfolded by {{this work}} of multiform genius, in every aspect known to art, religion, nature, and the population. From his knees downwards he is clearly devoted to nature, and is portrayed as about to enter his bath. From his waist to his knees he is devoted to religion--mark the complete disappearance of the human aspect. From his neck to his waist he is devoted to public affairs; observe the tweed coat, the watch chain, and other signs of practical sobriety. But the head is, after all, the crown of the human being, and is devoted to art. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> cannot make {{out that it is}} a head. Note its pyramidal severity, its cunning little ears, its box-built, water-tightal structure. The hair you note to be in flames. Here we have the touch of beauty--the burning shrub. In the whole you will observe that aversion from natural form and the single point of view, characteristic of all twentieth-century æsthetics. The whole thing is a very great masterpiece of childlike contortionism. To do things as irresponsibly as children and contortionists--what a happy discovery of the line of least resistance in art that was! Mark, by the way, this exquisite touch about the left hand." ...|$|E
5000|$|St. Paul wrote, [...] "Let {{every person}} be {{subordinate}} to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been established by God. ...<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. Pay to all their dues, taxes to whom taxes are due, toll to whom toll is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due." ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} for crosswalks is that no two metadata schemes are 100% equivalent. One scheme may have a field that doesn't exist in another scheme, or it may have a field that is split into two different fields in another scheme; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> often lose data when mapping from a complex scheme to a simpler one. For example, when mapping from MARC to Simple Dublin Core, you lose the distinction between types of titles: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not {{understand}} you," [...] said Bradley; [...] "and now suppose you answer a few questions. Who are <b>you?</b> What country <b>is</b> <b>this?</b> <b>Why</b> did <b>you</b> bring me here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the name}} of Heaven," [...] I cried at length as I blundered into both {{of them in the}} kitchen, [...] "be off out of <b>this.</b> <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dr. McCarthy," [...] said I, [...] "this is all {{a mystery}} to me. I should be glad if you could explain to me who <b>this</b> man <b>is,</b> and <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have tolerated him so long in your house." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{present day}} Gweno {{people are a}} mixture {{of all those who}} came to make the {{beautiful}} mountains of Ugweno their home. Historically, their ancestors came from Taita, Voi, Chaga, as well as Southern Pare tribes. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> can find many Gweno families today who trace their roots from elsewhere, such as the Suya, Sangi and Wanzava families. A good example are the Odongo (and others) who were called by the Suya from Nguru mountain region of Tanzania to prevent conflicts.|$|E

5000|$|With this method, you are {{to start}} off by {{assuming}} a posture in which you are not to use your hands. You are to think of getting your body close to your opponent before striking him. However, {{if you think of}} reaching out both of your hands, your body will remain distant. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> must always think of quickly getting your body close to the enemy. When you are distant, you will exchange blows of the sword, and it will be rather easy to move closer to your opponent (Thomas Cleary translates this technique as [...] "Body of the Short-Armed Monkey".) ...|$|E
6000|$|ATTEN. Indeed, {{to go from}} a deathbed to hell is {{a fearful}} thing to think on. But, good {{neighbour}} Wiseman, be pleased to tell me who <b>this</b> man <b>was,</b> and <b>why</b> <b>you</b> conclude him so miserable in his death? ...|$|R

50|$|In the {{software}} world {{the audience is}} predictable and targeted, making learning styles more predictable. On a website, it's anybody's guess who might be using the site. The website visitor might be a particle physicist, a teen or a grandparent. Learning styles, comfort levels and expectations differ greatly. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> perhaps <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{hear a lot of}} references to progressive disclosure in conversations and interviews, but rarely any ideas about how to apply it effectively.|$|R
5000|$|Canadian {{athletic}} {{facilities are}} often listed by their [...] "maximum capacity", {{which is often}} an estimate of their largest recorded crowd in the facility. These maximum capacities can and often do include standing room patrons and attendees seated on grass surrounding a playing field. Seated Capacity is {{the actual number of}} permanent seats, be they grandstands or permanently in use bleachers. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> will sometimes see larger capacities listed for these sites when searching for them on line. When capacity numbers have mismatched on source sites, unless the larger capacity could be confirmed as a seated capacity, the smaller capacity number has been listed here.|$|E

50|$|The {{carapace}} width {{has been}} measured {{in size from}} 40 to 80 mm. Being a lithode crab it has an asymmetrical body. Diet of the scaled crab is known to include brittle stars {{as they have been}} witnessed feeding on the echinoderms. Few other prey species have been observed but it can assumed that other food sources {{are similar to those of}} similar crab species. The crab themselves are prey to the sea otter and presumably other large predators. Females and males differ in the structure of their abdomen. The female's abdomen is covered in plates whereas the male's is covered in vestigial plates. These plates give the male a rubbery look and feel to their abdomens. Many have be observed to have a symbiotic relationship with certain species of sea anemone. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> will also find them inhabiting areas containing Metridium senile and Metridium giganteum.|$|E

6000|$|Florence was {{the first}} to change. Bursting into tears, she said from her full heart, 'Oh, Mama, Mama! why do we meet like <b>this?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> ever kind to me when there was no one else, that we should meet like this?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! madam," [...] the King of the Gold Mines {{said to her}} [...] "how <b>is</b> <b>this?</b> <b>Why</b> do <b>you</b> {{waste your}} pity on these princes, who {{love you so much}} that all their trouble would be well repaid by a single smile from you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{quote the}} Mansuri 'Abdallah Ahmad al-Hassan Abu Qurun (عبدالله أحمد الحسن أبو قرون) in 2005: [...] "I have almost seen all of Dar al-Manasir and I know of whole gardens being {{sold in the}} {{neighbouring}} Shaiqiyah Country and Rubatab Country.

50|$|Depending on the {{material}} used, compression garments can be designed to keep athletes cool or warm depending on {{the requirements of the}} sport. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> will see both athletes in the winter and summer olympics wearing similar looking compression outfits. For example, speedskaters can wear compression bodysuits in the cold rink, while beach volleyball players can wear a similar-looking piece made out of a more breathable, lightweight blend. Both athletes will use moisture wicking materials such as nylon and spandex to keep them lightweight, while cotton would retain moisture and weigh them down in action. In addition, speed skaters take advantage of the aerodynamic advantage they can get from wearing a skintight suit, while a beach volleyball player has the added benefit of SPF 50+ garments to keep them protected on a sunny day. These athletes show, pictured on the right, show the diverse range of benefits that make compression garments so popular {{in a wide range of}} sports and designs.|$|E
5000|$|Such a {{triangle}} represents ONE person, whereas communication takes place between TWO (objects, not necessarily persons). So imagine another triangle and consider {{that for the}} two to understand each other, the content that the [...] "triangles" [...] represent must fit or be aligned. Clearly, this calls for synchronisation and an interface as well as scale among other things. Notice also, that we perceive the world mostly through our eyes and in alternative phases of seeing and not seeing with change in the environment {{as the most important}} information to look for. Our eyes are lenses and we see a surface (2D) in ONE direction (focusing) if we are stationary and the object is not moving either. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> may position yourself {{in one corner of the}} triangle and by replicating (mirroring) it, you will be able to see the whole picture, your cognitive epistemological and the ontological existential or physical model of life, the universe, existence, etc. combined.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{begin to}} {{understand}} you, Chippewa; you wish {{me to believe that}} YOU are a friend to America, and that the Pottawatamie <b>is</b> not.

6000|$|... "Only to some extent. It's {{my opinion}} {{that there are more}} deer and bears about the smaller ranches than you could find {{anywhere}} else.

2500|$|Her speech {{also sought}} to express the idea that really terrible things happen to good people: [...] "I would call it, in terms of writing, in terms of poetry, it's a laundry list. Because all you're doing is: <b>This</b> <b>is</b> who we <b>are,</b> and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what we think, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what we feel, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> - <b>you</b> know?... I just wanted to admit, you know, that we didn't deserve this, and nobody does. And so I wanted to link our tragedy, in every sense, you know - we're no {{different}} from anything else that has hurt...." ...|$|R
