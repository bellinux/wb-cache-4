5|$|Berg {{returned}} to Columbia {{after the season}} to continue working on his law degree. Despite White Sox owner Charles Comiskey offering him more money to come <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training,</b> Berg declined, and informed the White Sox {{that he would be}} reporting late for the 1927 season. Noel Dowling, a professor to whom Berg explained his situation, told Berg to take extra classes in the fall, and said that he would arrange with the dean a leave of absence from law school the following year, 1928.|$|E
5|$|In late 1903, a {{baseball}} column {{suggested that the}} Detroit Tigers were interested in Shay, but he {{was said to be}} happy playing in California. During Shay's tenure in San Francisco, he got married. Shay went <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> with the St. Louis Cardinals before the 1904 season. He impressed the team, prompting speculation that shortstop Dave Brain would move to third base and third baseman Jimmy Burke would serve as a utility infielder. Shay played 99 games for the Cardinals in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Koufax and Drysdale did {{not report}} <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> in February. Instead, they both signed {{to appear in the}} movie Warning Shot, {{starring}} David Janssen.

After four weeks, Koufax gave Drysdale the go-ahead to negotiate new deals for both of them. Koufax ended up getting $125,000 and Drysdale $110,000 ($ today). They rejoined the team in the last week of spring training.|$|E

5|$|To {{prepare for}} the 1928 season, Berg went up to a lumber camp in New York's Adirondack Mountains three weeks before {{reporting}} to the White Sox spring training facility in Shreveport, Louisiana. The hard labor did wonders for him, as he reported <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> on March 2, 1928 in excellent shape. By {{the end of the}} season, Berg had established himself as the starting catcher.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Holloman again {{spent the}} season with the Volunteers, posting a record of 17–10 with a 4.46 ERA. After the season ended, the Chicago Cubs signed him and gave him an {{invitation}} <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training.</b> Holloman's outgoing nature clashed with manager Frankie Frisch, who did not appreciate the pitcher's attitude. It was, partially, {{for this reason that}} Holloman did not make the major league roster. Holloman split the 1950 season between Nashville and the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League. Combined, he had 13 wins and 13 losses on the year. In 1951, he spent seven games with Nashville, but spent most of {{the season with}} the Augusta Tigers of the Sally League, where he posted an 11–9 record and a 3.87 ERA.|$|E

5|$|Jordan then further {{surprised}} {{the sports world}} by signing a minor league baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994. He reported <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> in Sarasota, Florida, and {{was assigned to the}} team's minor league system on March 31, 1994. Jordan has stated this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who had always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball player. The White Sox were another team owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2013 season, Baseball America ranked Fernández as the Marlins' best {{prospect}} and {{the fifth}} best prospect in all of baseball. The Marlins invited Fernández <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> but sent him to minor league camp before the season began. However, they chose to add Fernández to their 25-man Opening Day roster, {{due in part to}} injuries to Nathan Eovaldi and Henderson Álvarez. Also, Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria hoped that promoting Fernández would buy him goodwill with the fans, following a fire sale the previous offseason. He was planned to be limited to approximately 150 to 170 innings during the 2013 season in order to protect his development. He was the second youngest National League player that season, older only than the Nationals' Bryce Harper.|$|E
5|$|Shuey sat out {{the whole}} 2006 season, as he {{received}} a hip replacement. The procedure, which involved installing a metal hip, was performed in Montreal, as it was not approved in the United States. On February 2, 2007, he signed a minor league contract with the Orioles that included an invitation <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training.</b> He suffered an injury and {{did not make the}} cut, and was sent to the minor leagues. He made one appearance for the Class-AA Bowie Baysox, and then joined the Norfolk Tides, the Orioles' Class-AAA affiliate. His contract was then purchased on June 19, 2007, and he appeared in that night's game against the San Diego Padres.|$|E

5|$|The Chicago White Sox of the American League (AL) invited Stricklett <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> in 1904, {{where he}} roomed with Ed Walsh. Stricklett taught Walsh the spitball. After {{pitching}} {{in one game}} for the White Sox, allowing eight earned runs in seven IP, he received his release, and pitched for the Milwaukee Brewers of the Class-A American Association {{for the remainder of}} the season, where he pitched to a 24-11 record in 267 innings pitched (IP). The Boston Americans of the AL purchased the rights to Stricklett in August 1904, but allowed him to remain in Milwaukee.|$|E
5|$|The White Sox {{brought on}} new manager Jack Onslow {{to begin the}} 1949 Chicago White Sox season. He {{had a problem with}} Seerey, who arrived {{overweight}} <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training,</b> and did not consider him worthy of practicing with the other players until he got the weight back down. After playing in four games for the Sox, his last coming on May 7, Seerey was sent to the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, ending his major league career. He played for four minor league teams in 1949: Los Angeles, the Newark Bears, the Kansas City Blues, and the San Antonio Missions.|$|E
5|$|After being demoted back to Buffalo, the Indians traded Robertson on August 3 to the Montreal Expos for Pierre-Luc Marceau. He {{pitched in}} seven {{games for the}} Edmonton Trappers to end the season, {{finishing}} with a 1–3 record and a 5.73 ERA. He was on the Expos' 40-man roster for September, but did not play a game for them, and in October he {{was removed from the}} roster. In November, the Cincinnati Reds signed him to a minor league contract with an invitation <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training.</b> During spring training in 2005, Robertson competed with Aaron Harang, Brandon Claussen, Luke Hudson, and Josh Hancock for two spots in the Reds' rotation. At the end of spring training, he was assigned to the Reds' minor league squad, the Louisville Bats. Robertson spent the season there, pitching in 28 games, 18 of them starts, and ended the year with a 5–11 record and a 5.46 ERA.
