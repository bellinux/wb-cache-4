This null model almost always contains a model in which all of the variables are uncorrelated, and as a result, has a very large chi-square (indicating poor fit).

50|$|The Kerby {{method is}} similar to the Burgess method, but differs in two ways. First, while the Burgess method uses {{subjective}} judgment to select a cutoff score for a multi-valued predictor with a binary outcome, the Kerby method uses classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. In this way, the selection of the cutoff score is based not on subjective judgment, but on a statistical criterion, such as the point where <b>the</b> <b>chi-square</b> value is a maximum.|$|E

The value of a is 20 times the probability that a Poisson-distributed random variable exceeds 8, and it is easily calculated as 1 minus the sum of the probabilities corresponding to 0 through 8. By trivial algebra, the last term reduces simply to a. Numerical computation shows that the value of λ that minimizes <b>the</b> <b>chi-square</b> statistic is about 3.5242. That is the minimum chi-square estimate of λ. For that value of λ, <b>the</b> <b>chi-square</b> statistic is about 3.062764. There are 10 cells. If the null hypothesis had specified a single distribution, rather than requiring λ to be estimated, then the null distribution of the test statistic would be a chi-square distribution with 10 − 1 = 9 degrees of freedom. Since λ had to be estimated, one additional degree of freedom is lost. The expected value of a chi-square random variable with 8 degrees of freedom is 8. Thus the observed value, 3.062764, is quite modest, and the null hypothesis is not rejected.|$|E
