5|$|As {{soon as it}} was {{sufficiently}} dark, Grayburn led his platoon along the ramp to the bridge, their faces blackened and their boots muffled with strips of torn up curtains. The platoon moved forward {{on either side of the}} girders along the sides of the road, but was quickly spotted by enemy forces on the bridge. Grayburn was shot in the shoulder but continued to press his men on, until the withering enemy fire became too intense and he was forced <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> back. He was the last person to descend from the ramp into cover.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Lathbury, {{comprised}} the 1st, the 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions, the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, the 1st(Parachute) Squadron, Royal Engineers and the 1st(Airlanding) Anti-Tank Battery, Royal Artillery. The airlanding anti-tank battery were {{equipped with the}} 1st Para Brigade's only anti-tank guns, the British 6pounder. Despite the formation being a parachute brigade, {{the only way to}} transport the anti-tank guns and the jeeps required <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> when they had landed, was by glider. Transporting artillery by air was something new to the British or any other army, and this would be the first time that any artillery guns had ever been flown into combat.|$|E
5|$|Brody {{runs into}} Mike, who tells {{his father that}} Sean is with his friends, {{drifting}} towards Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station, and apologizes for disobeying him and putting Sean in danger. Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety and quickly finds them, but when the shark returns, he panics and maroons the police boat on Cable Junction. He then tries <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> in with a winch but hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next attack sends most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to Cable Junction while Sean and Jackie are trapped on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody hits the power cable with an oar to attract the shark, and encourages it to bite the cable; the shark is fatally electrocuted, and its body sinks {{to the bottom of}} the sea. The kids rejoice as Brody picks up Sean and Jackie, and they join them on Cable Junction to await rescue.|$|E

5|$|In 1858, {{a wealthy}} {{businessman}} from Keosauqua, Iowa, Leonard John Rose, formed the party after hearing stories from gold miners returning from California. He subsequently financed a well-equipped wagon train that included twenty horses and two hundred head of purebred red Durham cattle. He also acquired four large covered wagons and three yoke of oxen <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> each wagon. The Rose company left Iowa in early April, and in mid-May {{they were joined}} by the Baley company, led by a forty-four-year-old veteran of the Black Hawk War, Gillum Baley. Their combined outfits numbered twenty wagons, forty men, fifty to sixty women and children, and nearly five hundred head of cattle. John Udell, a 62-year-old Baptist minister kept a daily journal of the party's travels, recording the locations of their campsites, documenting their progress, and noting the availability of resources.|$|E
5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} set {{detailed requirements}} for geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, {{particularly if they}} rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and to assess the effects of tides by measurement with specially constructed gauges. FitzRoy chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival there on 1 April 1836, the entire crew set to work, first erecting FitzRoy's new design of a tide gauge that allowed readings to be taken from the shore. Boats were sent all around the island to carry out the survey, and despite being impeded by strong winds, they took numerous soundings to establish depths around the atoll and in the lagoon. FitzRoy noted the smooth and solid rock-like outer wall of the atoll, with most life thriving where the surf was most violent. He had great difficulty in establishing the depth reached by living coral, as pieces were hard to break off and the small anchors, hooks, grappling irons, and chains they used were all snapped off by the swell as soon as they tried <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> up. He had more success using a sounding line with a bell-shaped lead weight armed with tallow hardened with lime; this would be indented by any shape that it struck to give an exact impression of the bottom; it would also collect any fragments of coral or grains of sand.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{attempting}} {{to prove to}} himself he can {{have a good time}} without Marge, leaves Bart, Lisa and Maggie under the supervision of Lionel Hutz and goes out by himself. Finding Moe's Tavern more depressing than usual, Homer visits the hilltop where he and Marge used to come to on dates before they got married. Ironically, Marge has also taken Ruth there to finish the night, but they leave just before Homer arrives. Chief Wiggum finds Homer depressed and offers him a ride home, which Homer accepts. As Ruth and Marge are driving home, Chief Wiggum, with Homer as a passenger in his patrol car, spots Ruth's car and claims that one tail light is slightly smaller than the other. He decides <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> over. Reluctant to stop, Ruth reveals to Marge that the car she's driving actually belongs to her ex-husband, and that she had stolen it as revenge for stiffing her on child support (although Marge points out that Ruth could've just reported him to child services). Ruth leads the police on a high-speed chase rather than turning herself in. Homer realizes it is Marge in the car, and believes she is leaving him after discovering that she can have a better time without him. Ruth successfully evades Wiggum by turning off her headlights, which leads him to believe her car is a ghost car.|$|E

5|$|The game is {{displayed}} on a black-and-white television screen, and the tanks are controlled by two joysticks each. Pushing both joysticks moves the player's tank forward, and <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> both back causes the tank <b>to</b> stop. <b>Pulling</b> <b>them</b> in different directions or amounts causes the tank to turn in place or while moving, respectively. A button {{on the top of}} the right joystick fires a shell.|$|R
5000|$|The accumulator, however, {{is really}} two registers: {{designated}} [...] and [...] [...] Pushing the accumulator {{when it is}} set to 8 bits will not preserve , which {{could result in a}} loss of transparency should the ISR change [...] in any way. Therefore, the accumulator must always be set to 16 bits before being pushed or pulled if the ISR will be using [...] It is also more efficient to set the index registers to 16 bits before pushing them. Otherwise, the ISR has to then push an extra copy of the status register so it can restore the register sizes prior <b>to</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> from the stack.|$|R
25|$|Suction pumps, {{a special}} device for lips uses vacuum pumping to {{increase}} {{blood pressure in}} each lip and <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> out a bit, making it quite an instrument to adjust proper lip length/value in a slow determinite step-by-step way.

25|$|Compared {{to other}} superhero {{characters}} of the Silver Age of Comic Books, The Question was more ruthless in his methods. For example, when he was fighting some criminals in a sewer and knocked them into a deep and fast moving water flow, he declined <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> out despite their real danger of drowning. Instead, he left to notify the police to retrieve them in case they survived the ordeal.|$|E
25|$|In Villach in {{the year}} 1235, three women are accused of {{witchcraft}} by a priest. While one {{claims to be a}} witch through persuasion from the church, one denies it, another does neither and curses the priest. He orders them hanged and drowned. That done, he urges the guards <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> back up for a ritual to make sure the so-called witches never come back to life. The guards refuse, claiming they are dead enough. The priest returns late at night to perform the ritual. One of the corpses, one of a hag with a blind eye suffers a seizure but dies, while another corpse, a younger woman, takes on a demonic appearance and kills the priest and burns his book with the rites in it.|$|E
60|$|The {{idea was}} so {{acceptable}} in the prevalent {{absence of any}} idea, that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the suggestion to have <b>'em</b> out, and <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>'em</b> out, mobbed the two vehicles so closely that {{they came to a}} stop. On the crowd's opening the coach doors, the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time, that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and other symbolical tears.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to field artillery, where horse-drawn guns were attended by gunners on foot, the armies generally had horse batteries, where {{each of the}} gunners were provided with mounts. Horse artillery generally used lighter pieces, although the British had some 9-pounder (medium-weight) horse batteries; for added speed, these had a team of 8 horses <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them,</b> rather than 6. In addition, horse artillery ammunition wagons were harnessed with an extra pair (6 horse instead of 4). Heavy artillery pieces needed a team of 12 horses. With the individual riding horses required for officers, surgeons and other support staff, {{as well as those}} pulling the artillery guns and supply wagons, an artillery battery of six guns could require 160 to 200 horses. By contrast, in 1813, Captain Bogue’s Troop, armed solely with Congreve rockets, a type of rocket artillery, required only 105 horses. Agility was important; the ideal artillery horse was 15 to 16 hands high, strongly built, but able to move quickly.|$|E
25|$|The Poona Division's {{had planned}} on {{a maximum of}} 6 percent of the {{division}} becoming casualties. In addition to each battalion's surgeons, there were the field ambulance units assigned {{to each of the}} brigades. However, these units were not intended to function as hospitals, and were only supposed to triage and stabilize the wounded before sending them back to field hospital units. Line of communication troops had to donate their own supplies to the medical units that were overrun with casualties. With Townshend's offensive, there was only one river boat equipped as a hospital ship. With the ambulances full, many of the wounded were placed on A.T. carts, which were nothing more than simple carts pulled by animals that performed most of the land hauling {{at this point in the}} campaign. In some cases, the wounded were simply laid atop boxes of ammunition or other supplies. With animal transport limited by short-sighted decisions of Nixon and his predecessors, the Poona Division only 330 animal pulled carts and 740 animals <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the week}} {{preceding}} the race London experienced {{a series of}} riots; several football matches were called off, but the London–Surrey Cycle Classic was allowed to proceed. On race day British riders Liam Holohan, Kristian House and Tom Murray and Brazil's Cleberson Weber opened up a 6-minute gap in the breakaway before the peloton started <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> back on the final Box Hill climb. 2009 British road race champion House won the King of the Mountains award. The lead quartet were {{swept up in the}} final 9kilometres as Great Britain and England controlled the pace. Kurt Asle Arvesen then made a bid for the win before being brought back. With 12kilometres to go, Tyler Farrar suffered a puncture. After chasing furiously he reached the peloton with 2kilometres to go, only to see his chance of the win wiped out as a crash occurred; according to Heinrich Haussler it was caused by two riders fighting. The crash split the peloton and in a group of just 20 riders Mark Cavendish beat Sacha Modolo of Italy and France's Samuel Dumoulin in a sprint finish on the Mall.|$|E

Both men want to donate stained glass windows to a local church, and Sobotka refuses to withdraw his larger, more expensive window which had been installed first. Valchek becomes curious {{as to how the}} struggling union can afford the window. He has the cops in his district harass Sobotka and his union, from having Ellis Carver ticket their cars for minor infractions <b>to</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> over for [...] "random" [...] DUI checkpoints directly outside the bar they frequent.

5|$|The Epiriotes {{launched}} their first assault {{against the city}} at daybreak. However, {{they were unable to}} get a firm footing because of the trench and were repulsed by the defenders, who were encouraged by the women. In order to circumvent this obstacle. Pyrrhus ordered a 2,000 picked force of Gauls and Chaonians commanded by Ptolemy to attempt to go around the trench. Finding their path blocked by the wagons, they began <b>to</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> out of the ground. Aware of the danger, Acrotatus used a series of depressions to attack this force from the rear and managed to the push the Epiriote flanking group into the trench after inflicting heavy casualties upon them. Unable to make an impact on the defences, Pyrrhus ordered his troops to withdraw to their camp at nightfall.|$|R
25|$|Grouper {{are often}} found around reefs. They have stout bodies and large mouths. They are not built for long-distance or fast swimming. They {{can be quite}} large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100kg are not uncommon. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do not have many teeth {{on the edges of}} their jaws, but they have heavy {{crushing}} tooth plates inside the pharynx. They lie in wait, rather than chasing in open water. They are found in areas of hard or consolidated substrate, and use structural features such as ledges, rocks, and coral reefs (as well as artificial reefs like wrecks and sunken barges) as their habitat. Their mouth and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance. They also use their mouth to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill muscles are so powerful that it is nearly impossible <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> out of their cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in. There is some research indicating that roving coral groupers (Plectropomus pessuliferus) sometimes cooperate with giant morays in hunting.|$|E
25|$|According {{to initial}} claims {{made by the}} railway, the {{engineer}} that left the train unattended went to the explosion zone and uncoupled the last 9 undamaged tank cars that {{were still on the}} tracks {{at the end of the}} derailment. After uncoupling the tank cars, he used a rail car mover <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> away from the derailment site. This version of events has been disputed by Lac-Mégantic's fire chief, who indicated that a volunteer firefighter had used a rail car mover borrowed from a local factory to remove these cars from danger. It was later revealed that two employees of Tafisa (Serge Morin, Sylvain Grégoire), a firefighter (Benoît Héon), the MMA engineer (Tom Harding) and a member of the family-owned excavation company Lafontaine and Son (Pascal Lafontaine) had worked to move 9 tank cars away from the fire. Tafisa, a local particleboard industry that moves much of its product by rail, has a rail car mover which has the capability to deactivate the brakes on the cars it tows. Morin, aided by his colleague Grégoire, used the rail car mover to move the first 5 tank cars away from the fire. When they could not find a level crossing to move the rail car mover back to the disaster site, they used a loader to remove another 4 tank cars, 2 at a time. Because the loader lacked equipment to deactivate railcar brakes, Harding told the men to use the loader to break the air lines on cars to release the air brakes on each of these four cars. Lafontaine's workers hauled gravel to the site, created firebreaks and blocked manholes as burning oil spread into the town's storm sewer system.|$|E

50|$|Many toilet {{training}} pants use flexible sides for {{the wearer}} <b>to</b> easily <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> {{off and on}} like normal underwear. This is to increase independence, make training easier, and {{are designed to be}} child-friendly, as well as to make them designed like normal underwear, unlike most traditional diapers in which the diaper is fastened by cheap velcro straps which are unadjustable. Also unlike normal diapers, the sides are sold already fastened with the goal of enabling wearers to put them on independently.|$|R
50|$|This {{variation}} {{looks to}} be better than the wet-nanoFET as it has none of the liquid based problems of the wet-nanoFET. Unfortunately, not much information has been released on how it manages to transport particles to the charging pad. Once at the charging pad, it uses a piezoelectric layer to get the particles moving and to get them off the charging pad. This breaks the adhesion force and severely reduces their attraction to the charging pad, allowing the acceleration grid <b>to</b> start <b>pulling</b> <b>them</b> out.|$|R
50|$|Bikini waxing is {{the removal}} of pubic hair using a special wax, which can be hot or cold, that adheres <b>to</b> hairs and <b>pulls</b> <b>them</b> out when the wax is removed quickly from the skin, usually with a cloth strip. While the {{practice}} is mainly associated with women, male waxing is sometimes done to remove men's pubic hair.|$|R
500|$|During test runs, the {{locomotives}} displayed excellent {{acceleration and}} an ability to maintain schedules better than conventional steam engines, although they also demonstrated serious reliability problems and relatively high maintenance costs. On one occasion, the two locomotives broke down while hauling a train from Colorado to Omaha, necessitating a 2800-class Pacific steam locomotive <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> {{along with the rest of}} the train for the remainder of the journey. The locomotives worked on several routes in a variety of different capacities, including both passenger and perishable freight service, although they never entered regular revenue service; in June 1939, the railroad returned them to GE in Chicago for what UP president W. M. Jeffers called [...] "necessary modification and/or reconstruction".|$|E
500|$|Among his brothers, Benjamin showed {{himself to}} be the most {{technically}} adept. He saw the need for farm machinery and expanded the company's line to include farm equipment, including combine harvesters and the steam-powered traction engines required <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> through the fields. In 1883, Benjamin Holt produced his first horse-drawn [...] "Link-Belt Combined Harvester". It allowed a farmer to combine cutting and threshing grain into a single mechanical operation, enabling farmers to cut more wheat in one pass, increasing productivity and cutting labor hours nearly in half. One key innovation Holt implemented was using flexible chain belts rather than gears to transmit power from the ground wheels to the working parts of the machine.|$|E
500|$|In {{the middle}} of the battle, when the 6th Massachusetts was driven back, Private Joseph S.G. Sweatt of Company C {{perceived}} that several of his comrades had been hit and were left in the woods. In an effort <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>them</b> out, he rushed forward, towards the Confederate position. For this action, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. According to his citation, [...] "When ordered to retreat, this soldier turned and rushed back to the front, in the face of heavy fire from the enemy, in an endeavor to rescue his wounded comrades, remaining by them until overpowered and taken prisoner."

In the past, men would buy garters or sock suspenders to help this, but with the introduction in the 1960s of better elastics such as spandex, it is mostly unnecessary now.
