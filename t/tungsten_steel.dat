40|$|Abstract. Due to its {{excellent}} thermophysical properties, tungsten {{has been}} used as structural materials for divertor components of fusion reactors. With the development of technology, the helium cooled high performance divertor requires the high reliable joining between tungsten and ferritic martensitic high chromium steel. However, the difference of thermal expansion coefficients between <b>tungsten</b> and <b>steel</b> causes high thermally residual stresses, which will yield failure of the joint. Therefore, the preparation of the joint between <b>tungsten</b> and <b>steel</b> is a key issue for divertor application. A brazing process, using rapidly solidified Ni-based foil-type filler and a vanadium slice as intermediate materials, was developed to investigate the joining of <b>tungsten</b> and <b>steel</b> for divertor components, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the joint were also studied. The elements and phases compositions in the boning regions were analyzed by electron probe microanalysis and X-ray diffraction. Micro-hardness distribution and tensile strength of joint were measured by nano-indenter and mechanical testing machine, respectively. The results indicated that the integral bonding was achieved at the bonding regions of the brazed joint. The typical microstructure of the joint was consisted of W/V and V/steel brazed seams separated by a V slice. The hard and brittle vanadium borides with 25 GPa hardness were produced at the W/V and V/steel brazed seams. The as-bonded W/steel joint with tensile strength of 143 MPa was obtained, and specimens appeared a brittle fracture mode and fractured in the brittle vanadium boride layers during tensile testing...|$|R

Micro EDD is a new EDM method taking air as machining medium, using narrow pulse width, long pulse interval, low discharge current and connecting the tool electrode with the anode of pulse generator. Using EDM shaping machine and brass, <b>tungsten</b> and <b>steel</b> as tool electrode respectively, micro cylinders are deposited on high-speed steel surface. And then the microstructure of deposit is analyzed detailedly. Results show that elements of the deposited material distribute uniformly, whose components depend on the tool electrode material. As the high cooling rate of the solidification process, the deposit grain size refines obviously, {{which leads to the}} hardness of <b>tungsten</b> or <b>steel</b> deposit increasing.

50|$|The {{hardness}} {{and density}} of tungsten are applied in obtaining heavy metal alloys. A {{good example is}} high speed steel, which can contain as much as 18% tungsten. Tungsten's high melting point makes tungsten a good material for applications like rocket nozzles, for example in the UGM-27 Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile. Tungsten alloys are used {{in a wide range}} of different applications, including the aerospace and automotive industries and radiation shielding. Superalloys containing tungsten, such as Hastelloy and Stellite, are used in turbine blades and wear-resistant parts and coatings. Quenched (martensitic) <b>tungsten</b> <b>steel</b> (approx. 5.5% to 7.0% W with 0.5% to 0.7% C) was used for making hard permanent magnets, due to its high remanence and coercivity, as noted by John Hopkinson (1849 - 1898) as early as 1886. The magnetic properties of a metal or an alloy are very sensitive to microstructure. For example, while the element tungsten is not ferromagnetic (but iron, of course, is), when present in steel in these proportions, it stabilizes the martensite phase, which has an enhanced ferromagnetism, as compared to the ferrite (iron) phase, due to its greater resistance to magnetic domain wall motion.|$|E
50|$|The ripper is {{the long}} claw-like device {{on the back}} of the bulldozer. Rippers can come as a single (single shank/giant ripper) or in groups of two or more (multi shank rippers). Usually, a single shank is {{preferred}} for heavy ripping. The ripper shank is fitted with a replaceable <b>tungsten</b> <b>steel</b> alloy tip, referred to as a 'boot'.Ripping rock breaks the ground surface rock or pavement into small rubble easy to handle and transport, which can then be removed so grading can take place. With agricultural ripping, a farmer breaks up rocky or very hard earth (such as podzol hardpan), which is otherwise unploughable, in order to farm it. For example, much of the best land in the California wine country consists of old lava flows. The grower shatters the lava with heavy bulldozers so surface crops or trees can be planted.Some bulldozers are equipped with a less common rear attachment referred to as a stumpbuster, which is a single spike that protrudes horizontally and can be raised to get it (mostly) out of the way. A stumpbuster is used to split a tree stump. A bulldozer with a stumpbuster is used for landclearing operations, and is often equipped with a brush-rake blade.|$|E
