25|$|Aquinas argued from degree, {{considering}} {{the occurrence of}} degrees of goodness. He believed that <b>things</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> called good, must be called good {{in relation to a}} standard of good—a maximum. There must be a maximum goodness that which causes all goodness.|$|E
25|$|Why {{is it that}} we {{are sure}} a {{particular}} activity — e.g. Olympic target shooting — is a game while a similar activity — e.g. military sharp shooting — is not? Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize that two people we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps important to note that this is not always a conscious process — generally we don't catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively see the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that {{the same is true of}} language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough <b>things</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> games and enough <b>things</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> not games that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Colet urges {{people to}} “return to the God {{of love and}} peace; return to Christ, in whom is the true peace of the Spirit which passeth all understanding; return to the true priestly life”. “Be ye {{reformed}} in the newness of your minds, that ye may know those <b>things</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> of God; and the peace of God shall be with you”.|$|E

25|$|The Holiness Code is {{contained}} within the Priestly Code, close to the end, but is a distinct subsection placing particular emphasis on <b>things</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> holy, and which {{should be done to}} honour the holy. It also contains the warnings from Yahweh about what will occur if the laws are not followed, as well as promises for the event that the laws are followed.|$|E
25|$|We create karma {{in three}} {{different}} ways, through actions that are positive, negative, or neutral. When we feel kindness and love and with this attitude do good <b>things,</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> beneficial to both ourselves and others, this is positive action. When we commit harmful deeds out of equally harmful intentions, this is negative action. Finally, when our motivation is indifferent and our deeds are neither harmful or beneficial, this is neutral action. The results we experience will accord {{with the quality of}} our actions.|$|E
25|$|I {{have learned}} {{that many of the}} Greeks believe Pythagoras said all things are {{generated}} from number. The very assertion poses a difficulty: How can things which do not exist even be conceived to generate? But he did not say that all things come to be from number; rather, in accordance with number – on the grounds that order in the primary sense is in number and it is by participation in order that a first and a second and the rest sequentially are assigned to <b>things</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> counted.|$|E
25|$|Simmel {{believed}} people created {{value by}} making objects, then separating themselves from that object and {{then trying to}} overcome that distance. He found that <b>things</b> <b>which</b> <b>were</b> too close were not considered valuable and <b>things</b> <b>which</b> <b>were</b> too far for people to get were also not considered valuable. Considered in determining value was the scarcity, time, sacrifice, and difficulties involved in getting the object.|$|R

60|$|A <b>thing</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> {{limited in}} quantity, {{even though its}} possessors do not act in concert, is still a monopolized article. But even when monopolized, a <b>thing</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> the gift of nature, and {{requires}} no labor or outlay as the condition of its existence, will, if there be competition among the holders of it, command a price only if it exist in less quantity than the demand.|$|R
25|$|While {{teachers}} {{point out}} the vital importance of good posture both {{for the sake of}} the quality of the playing and to reduce the chance of repetitive strain injury, advice as to what good posture is and how to achieve it differs in details. However all insist on the importance of a natural relaxed position without tension or rigidity. <b>Things</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> almost universally recommended is keeping the left wrist straight (or very nearly so) to allow the fingers of the left hand to move freely and to reduce the chance of injury and keeping either shoulder in a natural relaxed position and avoiding raising either of them in an exaggerated manner. This, like any other unwarranted tension, would limit freedom of motion, and increase the risk of injury.|$|E
25|$|We do not {{perceive}} by an immediate intuition that God exists, {{nor do we}} prove it a priori. But we do prove it a posteriori, i.e., from {{the things that have}} been created, following an argument from the effects to the cause: namely, from <b>things</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> moved and cannot be the adequate source of their motion, to a first unmoved mover; from the production of the things in this world by causes subordinated to one another, to a first uncaused cause; from corruptible things which equally might be or not be, to an absolutely necessary being; from things which more or less are, live, and understand, according to degrees of being, living and understanding, to that which is maximally understanding, maximally living and maximally a being; finally, from the order of all things, to a separated intellect which has ordered and organized things, and directs them to their end.|$|E
25|$|The {{progress}} of the strong depends on the conditions of their development and the possibility left to parents of transmitting to their offspring the qualities which they have acquired {{in the course of}} their existence. Modern society must, therefore, allow to all a certain stability of life, a home, a garden, some friends. Children must be reared in contact with <b>things</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> the expression of the mind of their parents. It is imperative to stop the transformation of the farmer, the artisan, the artist, the professor, and the man of science into manual or intellectual proletarians, possessing nothing but their hands or their brains. The development of this proletariat will be the everlasting shame of industrial civilization. It has contributed to the disappearance of the family as a social unit, and to the weakening of intelligence and moral sense. It is destroying the remains of culture. All forms of the proletariat must be suppressed. Each individual should have the security and the stability required for the foundation of a family. Marriage must cease being only a temporary union. The union of man and woman, like that of the higher anthropoids, ought to last at least until the young have no further need of protection. The laws relating to education, and especially to that of girls, to marriage, and divorce should, above all, take into account the interest of children. Women should receive a higher education, not in order to become doctors, lawyers, or professors, but to rear their offspring to be valuable human beings.|$|E

It appealed strongly to alternative audiences who'd grown up with rap music, but simply hadn't related to it since the rise of gangsta". Thornton expressed some frustration with the Dr. Octagon nickname, saying, [...] "I just made a record. I was an artist on a project, and I think people [...] that I was an artist on a project.

There was then a morning service, prayers and lessons, and a communion service. The choir, choirmaster and organist were supplied by the Parish Church. The choir sang the Venite, Te Deum and Jubilate, and Psalms 84, 122 and 132. The congregation joined in with the hymns Christ is our corner stone, We love the place, O God, and Pour out thy spirit from on high. Bearing {{in mind that the}} local population was very poor and had had little opportunity in their lives to attend church, the Bishop's sermon was based on Second Epistle to the Corinthians 4:18: [...] "We look not at the <b>things</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> seen, but at the <b>things</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> not seen, for the <b>things</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> seen are temporal, and the <b>things</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> not seen are eternal," [...] and he spoke at length about life after death and Jesus' work with the poor.
