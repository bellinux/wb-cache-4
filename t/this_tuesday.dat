The Undertaker also became the first wrestler to win the WWF Championship in his twenties since Bruno Sammartino and is the first wrestler to win the WWF Championship at Survivor Series and was the youngest WWF Champion in history until having this record broken by Yokozuna in April 1993 at WrestleMania IX. WWF President Jack Tunney ordered a rematch for <b>This</b> <b>Tuesday</b> in Texas six days later, where he lost the title back to Hogan.

2500|$|Hogan {{soon became}} {{embroiled in a}} heated feud with the 468-pound Earthquake, who had crushed Hogan's ribs in a sneak attack on The Brother Love Show in May 1990. On television, announcers {{explained}} that Hogan's injuries and his WrestleMania VI loss to Warrior both took such a huge toll on his fighting spirit {{that he wanted to}} retire. Viewers were asked to write letters to Hogan and send postcards asking for his return (they got a postcard-sized picture in return, autographed by Hogan, as a [...] "thank you"). Hogan returned by SummerSlam, and he for several months dominated Earthquake in a series of matches across the country. His defeat of this overwhelmingly large foe caused Hogan to add a fourth demandment – believing in yourself, and he also became known as [...] "The Immortal" [...] Hulk Hogan. Hogan became the first wrestler to win two Royal Rumble matches in a row, as he won the 1991 Royal Rumble match. At WrestleMania VII, Hogan stood up for the United States against Sgt. Slaughter, defeating him for his third WWF Championship, and then defeating him again in the rematch at United Kingdom-only pay-per-vew UK Rampage at London Arena. In the fall of 1991, Hogan was challenged by Ric Flair, the former NWA World Heavyweight Champion who recently arrived in the WWF. The feud remained unresolved, as Hogan lost the WWF Championship to The Undertaker at Survivor Series, and he won it back at <b>This</b> <b>Tuesday</b> in Texas six days later. Flair had interfered in both matches and due to the resulting controversy, the title was again declared vacant. The WWF Championship was decided at the 1992 Royal Rumble in the Royal Rumble match, but Hogan failed to regain the championship as he was eliminated by friend Sid Justice and in turn caused Sid to be eliminated, leaving Flair the winner and new champion. Hogan and Sid patched things up and teamed together on the February 8 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event against Flair and Undertaker, but during the match Sid abandoned Hogan, starting their feud. At WrestleMania VIII, Hogan defeated Sid via disqualification due to interference by Sid's manager Harvey Wippleman. Hogan was then attacked by Papa Shango and was saved by the returning Ultimate Warrior.|$|E

That night he encamps {{at a place called}} Rohrsdorf; which may be eight miles west-by-north from Dresden, as the crow flies; and ten or more, if you follow the highway round by Wilsdruf on your right. The real direct Highway from Meissen to Dresden {{is on the other side}} of the Elbe, and keeps by the River-bank, a fine level road; but on this western side, where Leopold now is, the road is inland, and goes with a bend. Leopold, of course, keeps command of this road; his columns are on both sides of it, River on their left at some miles distance; and incessantly expect to find Rutowski, drawn out on {{favorable}} ground somewhere. The country is of fertile, but very broken character; intersected by many brooks, making obliquely towards the Elbe (obliquely, with a leaning Meissen-wards); country always mounting, till here about Rohrsdorf we seem to have almost reached the watershed, and the brooks make for the Elbe, leaning Dresden way. Good posts abound in such broken country, with its villages and brooks, with its thickets, hedges and patches of swamp. But Rutowski has not appeared anywhere, during <b>this</b> <b>Tuesday.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Rain still heavier, rain as of Noah, {{continued}} through <b>this</b> <b>Tuesday,</b> and for days afterwards: but the Prussian hosts, hastening towards Glogau, marched still on. This Tuesday's march, for the rearward of the Army, 10,000 foot and 2,000 horse; march of ten hours long, from Weichau to the hamlet Milkau (where his Majesty sits busy and affable),--is {{thought to be}} the wettest on record. Waters all out, bridges down, the Country one wild lake of eddying mud. Up to the knee for many miles together; up to the middle for long spaces; sometimes even up to the chin or deeper, where your bridge was washed away. The Prussians marched through it, {{as if they had been}} slate or iron. Rank and file, nobody quitted his rank, nobody looked sour in the face; they took the pouring of the skies, and the red seas of terrestrial liquid, as matters that must be; cheered one another with jocosities, with choral snatches (tobacco, I consider, would not burn); and swashed unweariedly forward. Ten hours some of them were out, their march being twenty or twenty-five miles; ten to fifteen was the average distance come. Nor, singular to say, did any loss occur; except of ALMOST one poor Army-Chaplain, and altogether of one poor Soldier's Wife;--sank dangerously both of them, beyond redemption she, taking the wrong side of some bridge-parapet. Poor Soldier's Wife, she is not named to me at all; and has no history save this, and that [...] "she was of the regiment Bredow." [...] But I perceive she washed herself away in a World-Transaction; and there was one rough Bredower, who probably sat sad that night on getting to quarters. His Majesty surveyed the damp battalions on the morrow (21st), not without sympathy, not without satisfaction; allowed them a rest-day here at Milkau, to get dry and bright again; and gave them [...] "fifteen thalers a company," [...] which is about ninepence apiece, with some words of praise.

6000|$|Friedrich's obstinate rashness, <b>this</b> <b>Tuesday</b> Evening, has {{not wanted}} its {{abundant}} meed of blame,--rendered so emphatic by what befell on Saturday morning next. His somewhat too authoritative fixity; a certain radiancy of self-confidence, dangerous to a man; his sovereign contempt of Daun, as an inert dark mass, who durst undertake nothing: {{all this is}} undeniable, and worth our recognition in estimating Friedrich. One considerably extenuating circumstance does at last turn up,--in {{the shape of a}} new piece of blame to the erring Friedrich; his sudden anger, namely, against the meritorious General Retzow; his putting Retzow under arrest that Tuesday Evening: [...] "How, General Retzow? You have not taken hold of the Stromberg for me!" [...] That is the secret of Retzow: and on studying the ground you will find that the Stromberg, a blunt tabular Hill, of good height, detached, and towering well up over all that region, might have rendered Friedrich's position perfectly safe. [...] "Seize me the Stromberg to-morrow morning, the first thing!" [...] ordered Friedrich. And a Detachment went accordingly; but found Daun's people already there,--indisposed to go; nay determined not to go, and getting reinforced to unlimited amounts. So that the Stromberg was left standing, and remained Daun's; furnished with plenty of cannon by Daun. Retzow's arrest, Retzow being a steady favorite of Friedrich's, was only of a few hours: [...] "pardonable that oversight," [...] thinks Friedrich, though it came to cost him dear. For the rest, I find, Friedrich's keeping of this Camp, without the Stromberg, was intended to end, the third day hence: [...] "Saturday, 14th, then, since Friday proves impossible!" [...] Friedrich had settled. And it did end Saturday, 14th, though at an earlier HOUR, and with other results than had been expected. Keith said, [...] "The Austrians deserve to be hanged if they don't attack us here." [...] "We must hope they are more afraid of us than even of the gallows," [...] answered Friedrich. A very dangerous Camp; untenable without the Stromberg. Let us try to understand it, and Daun's position to it, in some slight degree.|$|E
6000|$|My dear Brothers--I am safe at Southampton--after having ridden {{three stages}} outside {{and the rest}} in for it began to be very cold. I {{did not know the}} Names of any of the Towns I passed through--all I {{can tell you is that}} {{sometimes}} I saw dusty Hedges--sometimes Ponds--then nothing--then a little Wood with trees look you like Launce's Sister [...] "as white as a Lily and as small as a Wand"--then came houses which died away into a few straggling Barns--then came hedge trees aforesaid again. As the Lamplight crept along the following things were discovered--"long heath broom furze"--Hurdles here and there half a Mile--Park palings when the Windows of a House were always discovered by reflection--One Nymph of Fountain--N.B. Stone--lopped Trees--Cow ruminating--ditto Donkey--Man and Woman going gingerly along--William seeing his Sisters over the Heath--John waiting with a Lanthorn for his Mistress--Barber's Pole--Doctor's Shop--However after having had my fill of these I popped my Head out just as it began to Dawn--N.B. <b>this</b> <b>Tuesday</b> Morn saw the Sun rise--of which I shall say nothing at present. I felt rather lonely this Morning at Breakfast so I went and unbox'd a Shakspeare--"There's my Comfort."[11] I went immediately after Breakfast to Southampton Water where I enquired for the Boat to the Isle of Wight as I intend seeing that place before I settle--it will go at 3, so shall I after having taken a Chop. I know nothing of this place but that it is long--tolerably broad--has bye streets--two or three Churches--a very respectable old Gate with two Lions to guard it. The Men and Women do not materially differ from those I have been in the Habit of seeing. I forgot to say that from dawn till half-past six I went through a most delightful Country--some open Down but for the most part thickly wooded. What surprised me most was an immense quantity of blooming Furze on each side the road cutting a most rural dash. The Southampton water when I saw it just now was no better than a low Water Water which did no more than answer my expectations--it will have mended its Manners by 3. From the Wharf are seen the shores on each side stretching to the Isle of Wight. You, Haydon, Reynolds, etc. have been pushing each other out of my Brain by turns. I have conned over every Head in Haydon's Picture--you must warn them not to be afraid should my Ghost visit them on Wednesday--tell Haydon to Kiss his Hand at Betty over the Way for me yea and to spy at her for me. I hope one of you will be competent to take part in a Trio while I am away--you need only aggravate your voices a little and mind not to speak Cues and all--when you have said Rum-ti-ti--you must not be rum any more or else another will take up the ti-ti alone and then he might be taken God shield us for little better than a Titmouse. By the by talking of Titmouse Remember me particularly to all my Friends--give my Love to the Miss Reynoldses and to Fanny who I hope you will soon see. Write to me soon about them all--and you George particularly how you get on with Wilkinson's plan. What could I have done without my Plaid?
