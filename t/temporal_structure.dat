30|$|Time is {{more than}} what a clock counts. Time, {{according}} to Clark (1985 : 36), “…is a socially constructed, organizing device by which one set, or trajectory of events {{is used as a}} point of reference for understanding, anticipating, and attempting to control other sets of events.” People can develop longer time horizons if they combine diverse <b>temporal</b> <b>structures</b> to guide, orient, and coordinate their ongoing activities (Bluedorn 2002). <b>Temporal</b> <b>structures</b> are “…expressed in terms of clocks or events, and are created and used by people to give rhythm and form to their everyday work practices” (Orlikowski and Yates 2002 : 685). Plural <b>temporal</b> <b>structures</b> enable people to understand, anticipate, and attempt to control a wider variety of events. The literature on time and organizing captures these diverse <b>temporal</b> <b>structures</b> in two broad categories: chronos or clock time (the serial time of succession measured by the chronometer) and kairos or event time (the subjective living time of invention or people’s sense that the time is right) (Garud et al. 2011; Orlikowski and Yates 2002).|$|R

40|$|International audiencePurpose: To {{define the}} {{relationship}} between the epileptogenic zone and the polymicrogyric area using intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in patients with structural epilepsy associated with regional infrasylvian polymicrogyria (PMG). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts, scalp, and intracranial video-EEG recordings, neuroimaging findings, and neuropsychological evaluations of four patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy related to PMG who consequently underwent resective surgery. Key Findings: High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed temporal lobe PMG in all cases, accompanied by hippocampal malrotation and closed lip schizencephaly in 3 / 4 cases, respectively. In intracranial recordings, interictal spike activity was localized within the PMG in only 2 / 4 and within the amygdala, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex in all cases. In the first patient, two epileptogenic networks coexisted: the prevailing network initially involved the mesial <b>temporal</b> <b>structures</b> with spread to the anterior PMG; the secondary network successively involved the anterior part of the PMG and later the mesial <b>temporal</b> <b>structures.</b> In the second patient, the epileptogenic network was limited to the mesial <b>temporal</b> <b>structures,</b> fully sparing the PMG. In the third patient, the epileptogenic network first involved the mesial <b>temporal</b> <b>structures</b> and later the PMG. Conversely, in the last case, part of the PMG harbored an epileptogenic network that propagated to the mesial <b>temporal</b> <b>structures.</b> Consistent with these findings a favorable outcome (Engel class I in three of four patients; Engel class II in one of four) at last follow-up was obtained by a resection involving parts of the PMG cortex in three of four and anteromesial <b>temporal</b> lobe <b>structures</b> in another three of four cases. Significance: Infrasylvian PMG displays a heterogeneous epileptogenicity and is occasionally and partially involved in the epileptogenic zone that commonly includes the mesial <b>temporal</b> <b>structures.</b> Our results highlight the intricate interrelations between the MRI-detectable lesion and the epileptogenic zone as delineated by intracranial recordings.

To apprehend time and its relationships to individuals and organizations, we conducted a 6 -month interpretive ethnographic study in an e-commerce company.

It is shown that <b>temporal</b> <b>structures</b> with unbounded input memory specified by simple Moore machines (MM) can be induced by recurrent spiking neuron networks (RSNN). The networks are able to discover pulse-coded representations of abstract information processing states coding potentially unbounded histories of processed inputs. ...|$|R

50|$|Temporal {{theories}} {{offer an}} alternative that appeals to the <b>temporal</b> <b>structure</b> of action potentials, mostly the phase-locking and mode-locking of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus. The precise way this <b>temporal</b> <b>structure</b> helps code for pitch at higher levels is still debated, but the processing seems {{to be based on}} an autocorrelation of action potentials in the auditory nerve. However, it has long been noted that a neural mechanism that may accomplish a delay—a necessary operation of a true autocorrelation—has not been found. At least one model shows that a temporal delay is unnecessary to produce an autocorrelation model of pitch perception, appealing to phase shifts between cochlear filters; however, earlier work has shown that certain sounds with a prominent peak in their autocorrelation function do not elicit a corresponding pitch percept, and that certain sounds without a peak in their autocorrelation function nevertheless elicit a pitch. To be a more complete model, autocorrelation must therefore apply to signals that represent the output of the cochlea, as via auditory-nerve interspike-interval histograms. Some theories of pitch perception hold that pitch has inherent octave ambiguities, and therefore is best decomposed into a pitch chroma, a periodic value around the octave, like the note names in western music—and a pitch height, which may be ambiguous, that indicates the octave the pitch is in.|$|E
