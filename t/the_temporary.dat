Among <b>the</b> forms of <b>temporary</b> employment have dominated: fixed-term employment contracts and temporary work agencies employment. [OECD]. Poland was located among the top of the countries with rapidly growing temporary employment and high unemployment. In 2003, Poland introduced regulations regarding <b>the</b> employment of <b>temporary</b> workers. There was a sharp increase in demand for <b>the</b> services of <b>temporary</b> work agencies. <b>The</b> number of <b>temporary</b> workers rose from 0. 23 % of total employment in 2003 to 3. 27 % in 2012.

5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{resulted in}} the creation of the Province of Manitoba (inclusive of Fort Garry) and a delay in establishing governance in the Territories. In 1870, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba formally entered the Canadian confederation. The two jurisdictions remained partially conjoined: under <b>the</b> <b>Temporary</b> Government Act, 1870. <b>The</b> <b>Temporary</b> North-West Council was appointed in 1872, mainly from members of the new Manitoba Legislative Assembly, with the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba serving as the leader of the territorial government. The Governor and Council were mandated to govern the Territories through the Manitoba Act and did so from outside of the Northwest Territories. Fort Garry served as the first seat of government for both jurisdictions.|$|E
