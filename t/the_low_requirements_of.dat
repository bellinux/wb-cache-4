An extension of the two-dimensional classification algorithm, named selective re-projection, is also proposed. Experiments showed that this approach confirmed to be an alternative to classical classification methods for text classification.

40|$|High {{performance}} computing (HPC) applications have parallel code sections that must scale to {{large numbers of}} cores, which makes them sensitive to serial regions. Current supercomputing systems with heterogeneous or asymmetric CMPs (ACMP) combine few high-performance big cores for serial regions, together with many low-power lean cores for throughput computing. <b>The</b> <b>low</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> HPC applications in the core front-end lead some designs, such as SMT and GPU cores, to share front-end structures including the instruction cache (I-cache). However, little work exists to analyze the benefit of sharing the I-cache among full cores, which seems compelling {{as a solution to}} reduce silicon area and power. This paper analyzes the performance, power and area impact of such a design on an ACMP with one high-performance core and multiple low-power cores. Having identified that multiple cores run the same code during parallel regions, the lean cores share the I-cache with the intent of benefiting from mutual prefetching, without increasing the average access latency. Our exploration of the multiple parameters finds the sweet spot on a wide interconnect to access the shared I-cache and the inclusion of a few line buffers to provide the required bandwidth and latency to sustain performance.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{probabilistic}} protocol (COKE) to allow two wireless communicating parties to commit over-the-air (OTA) on a shared secret, even {{in the presence of}} a globally eavesdropping adversary. The proposed solution leverages no crypto but just plaintext message exchange. Indeed, the security of the solution relies on the difficulty for the adversary to correctly identify, for each one-bit transmission, the sender of that bit—not its value, which is indeed exchanged in cleartext. Due to <b>the</b> <b>low</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> COKE (essentially, the capability to send a few wireless messages), it is particularly suited to resource constrained wireless devices (e. g. WNSs, wireless embedded systems), as well as for those scenarios where just energy saving is at premium, such as smartphones. For instance—under a security challenging setting—it is possible for the two parties to commit, with a probability greater than (1 − 2 − 48), on a 128 secret bits key exchanging as few as 1, 300 one-bit messages. Under less stressing conditions, establishing a 128 secret bits key with the same probability requires just as few as 300 one-bit messages. The security parameters (that is, secret-key length and its establishment probability) are adjustable: they can be agreed between the two parties for each key establishment session. A thorough analysis characterizing the security of the protocol, its robustness to packet loss, and energy consumption is provided. Finally, extensive simulations results support the quality and viability of the proposal. I...|$|E

40|$|The pull-in time (tpi) of electrostatically {{actuated}} parallel-plate microstructures {{enables the}} realization of a high-sensitivity accelerometer that uses time measurement as the transduction mechanism. The key feature is {{the existence of a}} metastable region that dominates pull-in behavior, thus making pull-in time very sensitive to external accelerations. Parallel-plate MEMS structures have been designed and fabricated using a SOI micromachining process (SOIMUMPS) for the implementation of the accelerometer. This paper presents the experimental characterization of the microdevices, validating the concept and the analytical models used. The accelerometer has a measured sensitivity of 0. 25 μs/μg and a bandwidth that {{is directly related to the}} pull-in time, BW = 1 / 2 tpi ≈ 50 Hz. These specifications place this sensor between the state of the art accelerometers found both in the literature and commercially. More importantly, the resolution of the measurement method used is very high, making the mechanical–thermal noise the only factor limiting the resolution. The in-depth noise analysis to the system supports these conclusions. The total measured noise floor of 400 μg (100 μs) is mainly due to the contribution of the environmental noise, due to lack of isolation of the experimental setup from the building vibrations (estimated mechanical thermal noise of 2. 8 μg/√Hz). <b>The</b> <b>low</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> the electronic readout circuit makes this an interesting approach for high-resolution accelerometers.

Measuring the maturity of PMS is an essential step to achieve its evolution to an ideal state that allows a better control of the results and to act consequently, improving management and decision making. Objective: To develop a bibliographic review to identify and characterize PMS maturity models, recognizing between them the most feasible models to apply in SMEs, in order to generate a contribution for the strengthening of such systems, facilitating effective and timely decision making in organizations. Methodology: The research question defined is: which existing PMS maturity model can be used by industrial SMEs? Google Scholar database was consulted for searching information, using certain search parameters. Based on a previous criteria definition, the selected models are compared. Finally, the conclusions about these models are elaborated.

40|$|The net uptake {{and output}} of plasma unesterified choline, glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine and lipid choline by organs of the {{conscious}} chronically catheterized sheep were measured. There was significant production of plasma unesterified choline by the upper- and lower-body regions and the alimentary tract and uptake by the liver, lungs and kidneys. The upper- and lower-body regions drained by the venae cavae provided the bulk (about 82 %) {{of the total}} body venous return of plasma unesterified choline. Production of plasma unesterified choline by the alimentary tract was approximately balanced by the plasma unesterified choline {{taken up by the}} liver, and was almost equal to the amount of choline secreted in the bile. There was a considerable amount of glycerophosphocholine in the liver and there was production of plasma glycerophosphocholine by the liver and uptake by the lungs and kidneys. Glycerophosphocholine was higher in the plasma of sheep than in that of rats. Plasma phosphocholine was produced by the alimentary tract and kidneys. There was production of plasma lipid choline by the upper- and lower-body regions drained by the venae cavae. The results suggest that the sheep synthesizes substantial amounts of choline in ectrahepatic tissues and has the capacity for extensive retention and recycling of bile choline.
