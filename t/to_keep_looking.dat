25|$|Although {{the school}} ship was left {{out from the}} Finnish Naval Act of 1927, the Finnish Navy decided <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>looking</b> for a {{suitable}} vessel and purchase it separately from the major fleet renewal program. Over the years, opinions both in favor and against a school ship had been presented, but it was generally agreed that such vessel would be in many ways beneficial for the Finnish Navy. Initially there was also disagreement about the type of the ship — some {{were in favor of}} a modern steam ship {{that could be used in}} the local waters while the others preferred a traditional sailing ship that would teach the cadets traditional seaman skills and bring them closer to merchant mariners. The latter was also recommended by foreign naval officials, and finally the Finnish Navy agreed on a sailing ship. This was further helped by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 that had brought the prices down, and the fact that windjammers had been largely replaced by steam ships.|$|E

500|$|Root came {{to realise}} {{that while the}} novel's {{narrative}} style allowed Anne's thoughts to come through, the film adaptation offered comparatively little dialogue. As a result, she [...] "had to cover pages and pages of the story without uttering anything, much of the time. I couldn't even think about technique, I just had <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>looking</b> at the [...] and then somehow radiate the feelings". Persuasion was shot in chronological order, which allowed Root to see [...] "what a difference [...] sense of unhappiness can create", as {{by the end of}} the film Anne is [...] "happier and looks better". Root considered the role to be much quieter than her experiences working with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which included her portrayal of Lady Macbeth. The Irish actor Ciarán Hinds, who depicted Frederick Wentworth, commented that Austen [...] "understands a man's heart and how delicate it can be sometimes". He also appreciated that, though Wentworth was a [...] "competent leader of men in his profession", he was [...] "socially inept" [...] in Anne's presence. Susan Fleetwood, the actress who played Lady Russell, had also worked with Michell on The Buddha of Suburbia. She died soon after filming; Persuasion was her last film role.|$|E

6000|$|Nor must I {{forget my}} boots, which were almost new when I left home. They {{had been my}} Sunday boots, and fitted me to a charm. I never had {{had a pair of}} boots that I liked better; I used to turn my toes out when I walked in them, unless it was night time, when no one could see me, and I had {{something}} else to think of; and I used <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>looking</b> at them during church; so that I lost {{a good deal of the}} sermon. In a word, they were a beautiful pair of boots. But all this only unfitted them the more for sea-service; as I soon discovered. They had very high heels, which were all the time tripping me in the rigging, and several times came near pitching me overboard; and the salt water made them shrink in such a manner, that they pinched me terribly about the instep; and I was obliged to gash them cruelly, which went to my very heart. The legs were quite long, coming a good way up toward my knees, and the edges were mounted with red morocco. The sailors used to call them my [...] "gaff- topsail-boots." [...] And sometimes they used to call me [...] "Boots," [...] and sometimes [...] "Buttons," [...] on account of the ornaments on my pantaloons and shooting-jacket.|$|E

60|$|But {{perhaps the}} best image {{of the absence of}} stale melancholy or wasted splendour, of the {{positive}} presence of what I have called temperate joy, in the Florentine impression and genius, is the bell-tower of Giotto, which rises beside the cathedral. No beholder of it will have forgotten how straight and slender it stands there, how strangely rich in the common street, plated with coloured marble patterns, and yet so far from simple or severe in design that we easily wonder how its author, the painter of exclusively and portentously grave little pictures, should have fashioned a building which in the way of elaborate elegance, of the true play of taste, leaves a jealous modern criticism nothing to miss. Nothing can be imagined at once more lightly and more pointedly fanciful; it might have been handed over to the city, as it stands, by some Oriental genie tired of too much detail. Yet for all that suggestion it seems of no particular time--not grey and hoary like a Gothic steeple, not cracked and despoiled like a Greek temple; its marbles shining so little less freshly than when they were laid together, and the sunset lighting up its cornice with such a friendly radiance, that you come at last to regard it simply as the graceful, indestructible soul of the place made visible. The Cathedral, externally, for all its solemn hugeness, strikes the same note of would-be reasoned elegance and cheer; it has conventional grandeur, of course, but a grandeur so frank and ingenuous even in its parti-pris. It has seen so much, and outlived so much, and served so many sad purposes, and yet remains in aspect so full of the fine Tuscan geniality, the feeling for life, one may almost say the feeling for amusement, that inspired it. Its vast many-coloured marble walls become at any rate, with this, the friendliest note of all Florence; there is an unfailing charm in walking past them while they lift their great acres of geometrical mosaic higher in the air than you have time or other occasion to look. You greet them from the deep street as you greet {{the side of a mountain}} when you move in the gorge--not twisting back your head <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>looking</b> at the top, but content with the minor accidents, the nestling hollows and soft cloud- shadows, the general protection of the valley.|$|E
