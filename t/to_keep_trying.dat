She reveals that Bob Harvey, a suspect in Luke's murder, died in the car crash in New Orleans. Reyes stresses her vision's importance, but Doggett dismisses it. Reyes goes to visit Jeb's sister, Katha, and learns {{he did not know}} Bob Harvey. While Reyes is there, Katha receives a call from Jeb, but tells him to call later. As Jeb leaves the phone booth, he kills a female motorist. Meanwhile, Doggett learns from Scully that she has suffered a placental abruption.

Pakis, however, is determined to search for her father, a quest which brings the two into conflict. Pakis regularly visits a local shaman, who conducts a ritual allowing Pakis to search for her father in a mirror's surface.

They agree {{to go to a}} movie, Plan 9 from Outer Space, but Ted does not realize Stella had brought her friends along with her, and it was not a date. At the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will still say no. Ted still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>trying.</b> Even though the first five sessions go well, Stella confirms her answer is still no. Ted decides that being nice to the receptionist, Abby (Britney Spears), would {{be a good way to}} let Stella see his good side, but instead, Abby starts to show interest in him. Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.|$|E

He graduated from West Springfield High School in 1974, having been voted [...] "Most Likely Not to Live Up to Potential" [...] by his classmates, and dropped out of Holyoke Community College after one day, undecided about {{what he wanted to}} do with his life. He took up work in the clothing department at Steiger's department store, as a janitor at the Baystate Medical Center and also as a driving instructor. He commented: [...] "I think if I had actually succeeded at college and gotten a degree in accounting or something, I might have given up too quickly on writing. Having no marketable job skills was a tremendous incentive <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>trying</b> to succeed as a writer." [...] He realized [...] "there probably wasn't going to be a career in riding around with my friends listening to Foghat," [...] so Scully decided he [...] "definitely wanted to break into comedy" [...] even though he [...] "really had no reason to believe [...] could succeed." [...] Regardless, he moved to Los Angeles, California in 1982.|$|E

500|$|Bartholomew JoJo [...] "Bart" [...] Simpson, {{voiced by}} Nancy Cartwright, is the eldest child and only {{son in the}} family—at age 10. Bart's most {{prominent}} character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness, disrespect for authority and sharp wit. During the first two seasons of The Simpsons, Bart was the show's main character. The name [...] "Bart" [...] is an anagram of the word [...] "brat". Groening conceived Bart as an extreme version of the typical misbehaving child character, merging all of the extreme traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn into one person. Groening's older brother Mark provided most of the inspiration for Bart. Bart's catchphrase [...] "Eat My Shorts" [...] was an ad-lib by Cartwright {{in one of the}} original table readings, harking back to an incident when she was at college. In 1998, Time magazine selected Bart as 46th of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, and the only fictional character to make the list. He had previously appeared {{on the cover of the}} December 31, 1990 edition. Bart is rebellious and frequently escapes without punishment, which lead some parents' groups and conservative spokespeople to believe he provided a poor role model for children. This prompted George H. W. Bush to rally, [...] "We're going <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>trying</b> to strengthen the American family. To make them more like the Waltons and less like the Simpsons." [...] Bart, and other Simpsons characters, have appeared in numerous television commercials for Nestlé's Butterfinger candy bars from 1990–2001, with the slogan [...] "Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger!" ...|$|E

2500|$|After rehearsals {{began on}} 5 December, Pasta balked at singing the Casta diva in act 1, {{now one of}} the most famous arias of the nineteenth century. She felt that it was [...] "ill adapted to her vocal abilities", but Bellini was able to persuade her <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>trying</b> for a week, after which she adapted to it and confessed her earlier error. [...] At the opening night, the opera was {{received}} with what Weinstock describes as [...] "chill indifference". To Florimo on the night of the premiere, Bellini wrote [...] "Fiasco! Fiasco! Solemn fiasco!" [...] and proceeded to tell him of the indifference of the audience and how it affected him.|$|E

Henry replied that Bell had [...] "the germ of a great invention". When Bell {{said that he did}} not have the necessary knowledge, Henry replied, [...] "Get it!" [...] That declaration greatly encouraged Bell <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>trying,</b> even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments, nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas. However, a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and Thomas A. Watson, an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of Charles Williams, changed all that.|$|E

2500|$|The new Old Ebbitt Grill {{improved}} its menu. It reopened at {{the same}} location on October 13, 1970. The mahogany bar was slightly lowered, new HVAC installed, and a general $130,000 refurbishment completed. Clyde's and Old Ebbitt Grill shared the same menus, which lowered costs and led to improved training for kitchen staff. In June 1974, a Washington Post food review declared Old Ebbitt's fare to be [...] "American, plain, and not bad". By 1977, Washington Post food critic Donald Dresden was praising the restaurants bacon cheeseburgers and innovative menu items: [...] "Imitators {{are still trying to}} top Clyde's and the Ebbitt's bacon cheeseburgers and the disc-shaped deep-fried potatoes that come with—but they'll have <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>trying</b> still." [...] The new owners retained Old Ebbitt's dark paneling, shelves of beer steins, mounted game trophies, and spittoons, which it had long showcased. The decor was made more whimsical, however, leading Washington Post architectural critic Wolf Von Eckardt to declare in 1978 that the Grill was [...] "one of the most charming rendezvous on the Eastern Seaboard". The restaurant featured bare, unpolished wood flooring throughout, with a fern bar on the second floor. Washington Post reporter Pamela Kessler said in 1981, [...] "The restaurant feels like old Philadelphia, rather than a slicker, parvenu Washington".|$|E

But unable to speak English well, Sant'Angelo was lost in the vastness of Los Angeles and quit after 15 days.|$|R
2500|$|The show explores most of {{the main}} characters' {{connections}} to their families in great detail. Walt justifies his decision to cook crystal meth and become a criminal because of his desire to provide for his family. In the third season he tries to exit the business because it has driven Skyler to leave him. Gus convinces him to stay, telling him it is a man's job to provide for his family, {{even if he is}} unloved. In the final episode of the series, however, Walt finally admits to Skyler that the main motivation for his endeavors in the meth business was his own interest, in spite of secretly securing the 9.72 million dollars (which is all that he had managed to salvage) for her and the children. Jesse's loneliness in the early seasons of the show can be partly explained by his parents' decision to kick him out of their home due to his drug-related activities. This parental disconnect brings him closer to Jane, whose father berates her for her drug use. When Walt crosses paths with Jane's father, he refers to Jesse as his nephew and laments the fact that he can't get through to him. Jane's father responds by telling him <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>trying,</b> saying [...] "Family. You can't give up on them, ever. What else is there?" [...] Jane's subsequent death, which Walt purposefully did not prevent, is a major factor in her father causing the airline crash {{at the end of the}} second season.|$|E
2500|$|One {{suggested}} that a goal of interview preparation should be to present oneself as [...] "comfortable with spontaneous conversation" [...] {{and be able to}} talk about interests without sounding like the answers were prepared in advance, and suggested it was important to show intellectual passion and a love of learning with a deep excitement, and show [...] "social maturity" [...] with sensitivity, empathy for others unlike oneself, and concern for issues larger than personal career ambitions. An applicant should have an attitude that was not be what can the college offer but what can the student offer the college, and he or she should avoid asking questions about facts better answered elsewhere, and show an openness to new ideas, an ability to work cooperatively with others, ambition, and caring about others. Interviewees should be ready for sometimes provocative questions to test social sensitivity; if an interviewer asks a [...] "baiting or leading question", an applicant should respond by laughing while politely disagreeing with the perspective, and <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>trying</b> to enjoy the conversation with the interviewer. Another advisor {{suggested that}} students must be prepared to answer the question What is your biggest failure in an interview. Applicants should avoid sounding snide, annoyed, contemptuous, and avoid describing oneself as humiliated, bored, depressed, angry, shy, inhibited, anxious, frightened, and frustrated, and should be upbeat but avoid going for the hard sell. Another report suggested that shy or timid applicants were at a disadvantage. Another advisor {{suggested that a}} student try to find a common bond with the interviewer, and send a brief follow-up letter afterwards.|$|E

60|$|Let us fix the Lamarckian {{evolutionary}} process well in our minds. You are alive; {{and you want}} to be more alive. You want an extension of consciousness and of power. You want, consequently, additional organs, or additional uses of your existing organs: that is, additional habits. You get them because you want them badly enough <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>trying</b> for them until they come. Nobody knows how: nobody knows why: all we know is that the thing actually takes place. We relapse miserably from effort to effort until the old organ is modified or the new one created, when suddenly the impossible becomes possible and the habit is formed. The moment we form it we {{want to get rid of}} the consciousness of it so as to economize our consciousness for fresh conquests of life; as all consciousness means preoccupation and obstruction. If we had to think about breathing or digesting or circulating our blood we should have no attention to spare for anything else, as we find to our cost when anything goes wrong with these operations. We want to be unconscious of them just as we wanted to acquire them; and we finally win what we want. But we win unconsciousness of our habits at the cost of losing our control of them; and we also build one habit and its corresponding functional modification of our organs on another, and so become dependent on our old habits. Consequently we have to persist in them even when they hurt us. We cannot stop breathing to avoid an attack of asthma, or to escape drowning. We can lose a habit and discard an organ when we no longer need them, just as we acquired them; but this process is slow and broken by relapses; and relics of the organ and the habit long survive its utility. And if other and still indispensable habits and modifications have been built on the ones we wish to discard, we must provide a new foundation for them before we demolish the old one. This is also a slow process and a very curious one.|$|E
