5|$|The {{presence}} of outsiders such as <b>the</b> <b>Strangers</b> and the Particulars was a considerable annoyance to the Pilgrims. As early as 1623, a conflict broke {{out between the}} Pilgrims and <b>the</b> <b>Strangers</b> over the celebration of Christmas, a day of no particular significance to the Pilgrims. Furthermore, a group of Strangers founded the nearby settlement of Wessagussett and the Pilgrims were highly strained, both emotionally {{and in terms of}} resources, by their lack of discipline. They looked at the eventual failure of the Wessagussett settlement as Divine Providence against a sinful people.|$|E

60|$|Bowser {{stopped and}} looked at <b>the</b> <b>stranger</b> in sheer surprise. Then the {{hair on the back of}} his neck stood on end and he growled a deep, ugly growl. Still <b>the</b> <b>stranger</b> did not run. Bowser didn't know just what to make of it. Never before had he had such an experience. Could it be that <b>the</b> <b>stranger</b> was not afraid of him? Bowser walked around <b>the</b> <b>stranger,</b> {{growling}} fiercely. As he walked <b>the</b> <b>stranger</b> turned, so as always to face him. It was perplexing and very provoking. It really seemed as if <b>the</b> <b>stranger</b> had no fear of him.|$|R

5|$|At 06:00 on 26 April 1797, the 74-gun ship of {{the line}} HMS Irresistible under Captain George Martin and the 36-gun frigate HMS Emerald under Captain Velterers Cornewall Berkeley were sailing at the {{southern}} edge of Jervis' (now known as Earl St. Vincent) fleet. While cruising close to the Spanish coast two unknown ships were sighted. Martin immediately ordered his ships to give chase and <b>the</b> <b>strangers</b> fled with Martin's vessels in pursuit. The new arrivals were two Spanish 34-gun frigates, the Santa Elena and Ninfa, bound to Cádiz from Havana with a cargo of silver specie. The captains of these Spanish ships had unwittingly sailed into the midst of the blockade fleet the previous night, but had had a fortunate encounter with a Spanish fishing vessel which had warned them of the danger. Acting quickly, the captains off-loaded their treasure into the fishing boat with instructions to carry it safely into Cádiz.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Eragon's cousin Roran, is {{planning}} to marry Katrina, daughter of Sloan the butcher. While the village is at peace, they are unexpectedly attacked by Galbatorix's soldiers and the Ra'zac, <b>the</b> <b>strangers</b> who had killed Roran's father, Garrow. The village metalsmith, Horst, equips his sons along with Roran with equipment. Roran takes a hammer and attacks the soldiers. The Ra'zac {{and most of the}} soldiers escape, saying that they want information from Roran. The entire village then sets up defenses, and during a second invasion, the Ra'zac escape again. One night, Roran wakes up to find Katrina being attacked by the Ra'zac, who sneaked into the house. Roran then takes off the cloth around the Ra'zac's face and sees that they are monsters, not humans. A Ra'zac bites Roran, leaving a serious injury, and leave with Katrina captured. While Roran is chasing them, Sloan, the village butcher and Katrina's father, betrays the village and joins the Ra'zac. The Ra'zac escape with their steeds, the Lethrblaka, who were originally their parents.|$|E
5|$|Soleil's {{squadron}} departed Rochefort on {{the evening}} of 24 September, aiming to bypass Hood's squadron in the dark. However at 01:00 on 25 September, with the wind coming from the northeast, lookouts on HMS Monarch spotted sails to the east. Hood's squadron was spread out, tacking southeast towards the Chassiron Lighthouse at Saint-Denis-d'Oléron with HMS Centaur in the centre, HMS Revenge to the east (or windward) and Monarch to the west. HMS Mars was also close by, {{with the rest of the}} squadron spread out in the rear. Hood's immediate reaction was that the sails must belong to a squadron of French ships of the line, and ordered his ships to form a line of battle in anticipation. Even as the signal was raised however, lookouts on Monarch identified <b>the</b> <b>strangers</b> as frigates and Hood abandoned his previous orders and raised a new signal ordering a general chase, confident that his ships could destroy the convoy even without the power and defensive capability of a line of battle.|$|E

50|$|In Seymour's account, <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> {{had been}} a young, foreign woman with a tearful face and a pale complexion. The woman also seemed ill and troubled. <b>The</b> <b>Stranger's</b> male {{companion}} appeared inauthentic to the locals as her husband. True to form, the man quickly left after <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> was buried. <b>The</b> only person that <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> confided in was a local pastor.|$|R
5000|$|Set in 1882, {{the game}} opens by {{introducing}} the mysterious protagonist [...] "the Stranger," [...] who is playing cards with a fictionized version of Billy the Kid in an unknown {{town in the}} American West. <b>The</b> <b>Stranger</b> discovers that <b>The</b> Kid is cheating, and The Kid draws his gun and begins firing. Managing to wound the Kid by stabbing him with an ornate Plains Indian dagger, <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> manages {{to run out of}} the saloon and escape. In the early morning hours, <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> finds himself in the desert town of Diamondback, New Mexico, whose inhabitants treat him with suspicion. <b>The</b> <b>Stranger</b> discovered that there is a target range nearby, a general store, a saloon, a brothel, and a mining camp with a cockfighting ring (but the mining camp cannot be visited). The Mayor's daughter, Marie Macintosh, recognizes <b>the</b> <b>Stranger,</b> although she still does not mention <b>the</b> <b>Stranger's</b> real name. It is revealed that <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> apparently has some renown for fighting in the Comanche Wars. Ms. Macintosh says that she knows <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> was a comrade of J. E. B. Stuart, and that she knows <b>the</b> <b>Stranger</b> has killed many people. <b>The</b> <b>Stranger</b> remarks that although that is true, at least he is not a hypocrite.|$|R
5|$|The three member team is {{composed}} of Edward Tolby, his daughter, Silvia Tolby (of unspecified age, but vaguely described as an adolescent or young adult), and their mutual friend, Robert Penn. While {{en route to the}} valley, the team arrives in a small rural town by the name of Fairfax. Fairfax is littered with ancient, decaying gadgets; the last remnants of the era of governments and high tech society, which none of the locals know how to fix or reproduce. Excited by <b>the</b> <b>strangers,</b> the locals ask about the League. Tolby answers their questions in turn, ending with an explanation of the timeline of events which led up to the great revolt. The event is summarized as having begun with revolts in Europe which overthrow the national governments. After France exists for a month free of government, millions join the by then explicitly anarchist movement to disarm the nuclear powers. At each toppled government center, millions of records are burned and government integration robots are destroyed. These events result in the setting of the story; a world full of anachronistic high-technology, interspersed in a pre-industrialized, agrarian culture.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores a {{significant}} question, implicit in Kafka’s novel Metamorphosis, explicitly asked by Rorty: ‘Can I care about a stranger?’. Alphonso Lingis’s view is taken in {{to overcome a}} mainstream belief {{that there is a}} distinction between my community and <b>the</b> <b>stranger’s</b> community, or us community and the community of those who have noting in common. His view is thus beneficial to reveal the in-depth paradoxical meaning in the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>stranger</b> and me: I am <b>the</b> <b>stranger</b> and <b>the</b> <b>stranger</b> is me. Therefore, to care about <b>the</b> <b>stranger</b> is to care about myself...|$|R
25|$|Murdoch {{explores the}} city, where nobody realizes {{that it is}} always nighttime. At midnight, he watches as {{everyone}} except himself falls asleep as <b>the</b> <b>Strangers</b> stop time and physically rearrange the city as well as changing people's identities and memories.

Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Strangers</b> inject one of their men, Mr. Hand (Richard O'Brien), with memories intended for Murdoch in an attempt to predict his movements and track him down.|$|E
25|$|Schreber {{reveals that}} Murdoch is an anomaly who {{inadvertently}} awoke during one midnight process, when Schreber {{was in the}} middle of imprinting his latest identity as a murderer.

Frustrated, Murdoch and Bumstead break through the wall, revealing outer space on the other side. The men are confronted by <b>the</b> <b>Strangers,</b> including Mr. Hand, who holds Emma hostage. In the ensuing fight Bumstead and one of <b>the</b> <b>Strangers</b> fall through the hole, revealing the city as an enormous space habitat surrounded by a force field.|$|E
