5|$|What {{followed}} {{is unclear}} {{as there are}} several versions. Oesau was chased by 1st Lt. James Leslie Doyle, 1st Lt. Wilbur L. Jarvis III and 1st Lt. James C. Austin, of the 428th Fighter Squadron (474th FG, 9th AF). All three were experienced pilots and chased Oesau from 28,000 feet to <b>tree-top</b> level. In the ensuing 20 minute dogfight, Oesau defended skillfully, though his aircraft was damaged by gunfire. While attempting an emergency landing, his Gustav received a final burst of fire in the cockpit area and crashed into the ground 6 miles south west of St. Vith. His body was thrown clear of the aircraft some yards away.|$|E

5000|$|What {{can you say}} of a life so sequestered as mine except, 'She is born, is married, will die'; 'Story, God {{bless you}} I have none to tell.' I was born in Cambridge, Indiana, but have passed {{most of my life}} in Cincinnati, and have never been east of the Blue Ridge Mountains. As to my 'versing' that began soon after I was out of school. I think it was in 1872 I first sent my poems out to seek their fortune. -A. W. Brotherton Brotherton's first {{appearance}} in print was in 1872. Though her specialty was poetry, she wrote considerable prose in the form of essays, reviews and children's stories. Her work showed a wide range of feeling and a deep insight into varying phases of life. Writing only in the spare moments of a busy home life, she contributed at intervals to a variety of periodicals, including The Century Magazine, Scribner's Magazine, The Atlantic Monthly, St. Nicholas Magazine, Poet Lore, and The New York Independent, as well as various religious journals. She was the author of three published volumes: Beyond the Veil (poems, 1886); The Sailing of King Olaf, and Other Poems, (1887); and What the Wind Told the <b>Tree-Tops</b> (rose and verse for children, 1888). A number of her lyrics, among which are those entitled [...] "Rosenlied," [...] "The Song of Fleeting Love," [...] "The Fisher-Wife's Lullabye," [...] "Unawares," [...] "Boys, Keep the Colors Up," [...] "God Knows," [...] and [...] "June Roses," [...] were set to music, in the US and in England.|$|R
5|$|Page and MacLachlan flew to No. 96 Squadron RAF {{which was}} then flying de Havilland Mosquito night fighters. He {{requested}} his old gunner, Les Davies, who now piloted Mosquitos to join them. Davies accepted but MacLachlan was killed before he could take up the offer. MacLachlan and Page flew to Tangmere on 15 July. On his next mission on 18 July 1943 MacLachlan's Mustang FD442 was probably hit by ground fire when crossing the French coast near Dieppe. Page noticed MacLachlan's Mustang suddenly pull up sharply from their <b>tree-top</b> height by about 1,000 feet. He saw MacLachlan pull back the canopy but apparently {{changed his mind about}} bailing out as the aircraft leveled out and descended. The Mustang then headed towards a small field. MacLachaln touched down three-quarters the way across and the Mustang ploughed into an orchard at the field's edge which ripped off the wings. Page orbited the crash site several times and considered landing to rescue him but the space was too confined. Page dived at the wreck and took gun-camera footage but could see no signs of life and then headed home. The Operations Record was unable to determine the cause of the crash. MacLachlan made no radio broadcast. It was possibly the result of enemy small-arms fire or mechanical failure. On 30 July MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC.|$|E

The butterflies transparent greyish underside makes it difficult to distinguish in the shadows. During rain, it sits on leaves with the forewings drooped over the hindwings, concealing its bright upper colouration. The butterfly has a habit of hill-topping and visits flowers of diverse species.|$|E
25|$|Between 1955 and 2001 {{there were}} no {{reported}} sightings of elephant herds, and they {{are thought to have}} fallen victim to the war of independence. In December 2001 a herd of about 30, including 10 juveniles, was observed {{in the vicinity of the}} Gash River. The elephants seemed to have formed a symbiotic relationship with olive baboons, with the baboons using the water holes dug by the elephants, while the elephants use the <b>tree-top</b> baboons as an early warning system.|$|E
25|$|Very {{fast and}} strong flight. Flies at <b>tree-top</b> level until it chooses to descend {{if there is}} strong morning sunlight. When overcast, males are known to descend and sit on low vegetation, where its disruptive, dull {{underside}} colouration {{makes it difficult to}} distinguish. Will remain so still that they have even been caught by hand in such circumstances. Females are known to fly in overcast and rainy weather also. Males visit damp patches and also suck moisture from leaves. Females rarely visit flowers or damp patches. Can be attracted by baiting.|$|E
25|$|Many Allied fighter gun cameras often {{revealed}} that aircraft {{which had been}} claimed destroyed as '109's were often Arado Ar 96 trainers with a cadet pilot at the controls. To counter this non-combat flights were only {{to be carried out}} at dawn and dusk. The Luftwaffe expanded aircraft warning systems and devised radio signals to warn flights of intruders. If attacked, poorly armed aircraft were to dive down to <b>tree-top</b> level, and if necessary, the pilot was to belly land and take cover, as pilots were far more important than aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Collishaw's {{next two}} {{victories}} were properly witnessed {{by thousands of}} French troops. He was ferrying a new aircraft from Wing Headquarters when six enemies dived out of the clouds and attacked him. It was six to one, and the Germans {{had the advantage of}} height. Collishaw, like Barker and McKeever, was happiest when close to the ground in such a spot. He went down. At <b>tree-top</b> level the advantage of numbers meant much less. In two quick bursts, he sent two Albatroses crashing into the trees, after which the others flew off. The flight so impressed the French that they awarded him the Croix de Guerre.|$|E
25|$|The {{front lines}} were not {{continuous}} because the dense forest terrain meant that visibility {{was down to}} metres, so there was danger of ambush and sudden assault for both sides. Smoke from burning sections of the forest, set alight by shell fire, helped the Germans and hindered the Soviets because it shielded the Wehrmacht troops from aerial reconnaissance and attack. On the other hand, the smoke hindered many groups because, without a compass and no sun, {{it was difficult to}} judge which direction to go. The sandy soil precluded the digging of foxholes and {{there was no time to}} construct anything more elaborate, so there was little to no protection from wooden splinters created by artillery and tank HE shells which the Soviet forces deliberately aimed to explode at <b>tree-top</b> height.|$|E
25|$|Kashiide {{was born}} in February 1915 in the seacoast town of Kashiwazaki, Kariwa District, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. In February 1934, he {{enrolled}} as a cadet in the Imperial Japanese Army flying school in Tokorozawa, Saitama. He graduated in November 1935, then entered fighter pilot school at Akeno Army Flying School northeast of Ise, Mie. His first squadron assignment was the 1st Rentai, probably flying the Kawasaki Ki-10 biplane. Kashiide was posted to China in July 1938 with the 59th Sentai, flying the Nakajima Ki-27 Type 97 Nate fighter, but he saw little action in the Hankou area. In September 1939, he fought in the final Battles of Khalkhin Gol in Mongolia. During one sortie on 15 September, he fought against eight Polikarpov I-16s, downing two then breaking from the remaining six by flying away at <b>tree-top</b> altitude. He claimed a total of seven aerial victories in Mongolia to become a flying ace. His air unit was ordered back to Hankou.|$|E
500|$|MacLachlan was {{not content}} in his {{position}} and pestered his superiors for an operational posting after weeks of practicing air combat with RAF Army Cooperation Command. Reluctantly, AOC Fighter Command Trafford Leigh-Mallory gave him permission to carry out Ranger operations over [...] occupied France. Since his return MacLachlan had been devising tactics for long-range penetrations into enemy airspace, where Allied fighter aircraft had not operated before in daylight. He proposed {{to get through the}} Luftwaffe defence belt at low-altitude and consequently trained in low-level navigation by spending hours flying around England at <b>tree-top</b> height. With this in mind, he flew a sortie on the 8 June 1943. The poor weather combined with the sighting of two Fw 190s near Le Tréport forced him to turn for home. The rear-ward vision of the P-51B (or IA as the British referred to it), was limited. Flying alone where enemy aircraft could approach unseen was courting disaster and MacLachlan decided he needed assistance.|$|E

2500|$|On 10 February 1942, Alelyukhin {{was awarded}} the Order of Lenin. In March 1942, the {{regiment}} became the 9th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment for its actions. On 30 July, he was wounded by shrapnel {{in the back and}} arm. In late 1942, Alelyukhin and the regiment flew combat missions during the Battle of Stalingrad. He led six LaGG-3s in an attack on ten Bf 109s and shot down one on 10 August. Weeks later, Alelyukhin was flying alone and was attacked by four Bf 109s. He evaded a Bf 109 on his tail six times and escaped by diving to <b>tree-top</b> level. During this engagement, he was able to shoot down one of the Bf 109s. He {{was awarded the}} Order of the Red Star on 22 September. On 19 October, he was promoted to Senior lieutenant. The regiment was reequipped with Yakovlev Yak-1 fighters around this time. Alelyukhin became commander of the regiment's 1st [...] Squadron. He painted his squadron's spinners red, a practice soon adopted {{by the rest of the}} regiment. He then fought in the Battle of Rostov during early 1943.|$|E
2500|$|At 17:02 Smith {{reported}} D Company {{was running}} low on ammunition and required aerial resupply. With just three magazines carried by each rifleman, {{they were only}} lightly equipped prior to the battle. This was a standard load calculated on 1 RAR usage rates which had been enough during previous actions, but it proved insufficient for sustained fighting. Due to the thick vegetation the ammunition boxes {{would need to be}} dropped through the trees, and intending on moving his headquarters behind a low knoll, Smith nominated a point [...] west. This position would afford greater protection, while the helicopters {{would be less likely to}} attract ground fire. Yet with their casualties now unable to be moved, D Company would have to remain where it was. Townsend passed the ammunition demand to Headquarters 1 ATF. In response Jackson requested two UH-1B Iroquois from No. 9 Squadron RAAF to deliver it; however, the senior Air Force officer at Nui Dat, Group Captain Peter Raw, was not prepared to risk aircraft hovering at <b>tree-top</b> height in the heavy rain where they would be exposed to ground fire, citing Department of Air regulations. Relations between the Army and Air Force over the use of the helicopters had become increasingly bitter in the months prior, and were still tenuous despite recent improvements. Jackson requested American assistance, and when the US Army liaison officer responded more favourably, Raw felt no alternative than to accede to the original request, offering to effect the resupply instead. By coincidence two RAAF Iroquois were available at Nui Dat, having been used for the concert, and were committed to support D Company.|$|E
