5|$|The size of {{the market}} determines the {{incentive}} to invest irrespective {{of the nature of}} the economy. This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product. For example, if an automobile manufacturer is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in, he will naturally only invest in those countries where <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> high. He would prefer to invest in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E
5|$|The world {{production}} of scandium {{is in the}} order of 10 tonnes per year, in the form of scandium oxide. <b>The</b> <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> about 50% higher, and both the production and demand keep increasing. In 2003, only three mines produced scandium: the uranium and iron mines in Zhovti Vody in Ukraine, the rare-earth mines in Bayan Obo, China, and the apatite mines in the Kola peninsula, Russia; since then many other countries have built scandium-producing facilities. In each case scandium is a byproduct from the extraction of other elements and is sold as scandium oxide.|$|E

25|$|The driving factor {{behind this}} {{is related to}} how many {{restrictions}} DRM imposes on a legal buyer. An ideal DRM would be one which imposes zero restrictions on legal buyers but makes imposing restrictions on infringers. Even if an ideal DRM can be created and used, in certain cases, it can be shown that removing the DRM will result in less unauthorized copying. For the ideal DRM, the reason why profits can increase is because of <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> elastic. When {{there are more people}} legally buying and few people sharing the product, more profits are going to be made.|$|E
25|$|In the {{passenger}} airline case, capacity {{is regarded as}} fixed because changing what aircraft flies a certain service based on <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> {{the exception rather than}} the rule. When the aircraft departs, the unsold seats cannot generate any revenue and thus can be said to have perished, or have spoiled. Airlines use specialized software to monitor how seats are reserved and react accordingly. There are various inventory controls such as a nested inventory system. For example, airlines can offer discounts on low-demand flights, where the flight will likely not sell out. When there is excess demand, the seats can be sold at a higher price.|$|E

When <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> low on the CPU or it is running too hot the performance is throttled, but if the CPU has much to do and the chip's temperature is acceptable, performance is temporarily increased with clock speeds of up to 1GHz depending on the individual board and on which of the turbo settings is used.|$|E
25|$|Despite a huge population, the demand-supply gap {{for blood}} units {{persists}} in many healthcare {{facilities in the}} country. According to a 2012 report by the World Health Organization, only 9 million blood units are available annually, whereas <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> 12 million units. Due to substandard medical facilities and practices {{in many parts of}} the country, there have been cases of transmission of infective diseases like AIDS. Voluntary blood donation comprises about 70% of the blood demand, with the rest coming from replacement donors, whereas 62 nations in the world fulfill their blood demands through voluntary donations. A study conducted in 2011 reports that a mere 6% of women donate blood, mostly due to physiological problems and low hemoglobin count. Other hurdles in increasing voluntary blood donation include the fear of pain and weakness after the procedure, and illiteracy.|$|E
25|$|The female {{blue-footed booby}} lays {{two or three}} eggs. Eggs are laid about four to five days apart. Both male and female take turns {{incubating}} the eggs, while the non-sitting bird keeps watch. Since the blue-footed booby {{does not have a}} brooding patch, it uses its feet to keep the eggs warm. The incubation period is 41–45 days. Usually, one to two chicks are hatched from the two to three eggs originally laid. The male and female share parental responsibilities. The male will provide food for the young {{in the first part of}} their life because of his specialized diving. The female will take over when <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> higher. Chicks feed off the regurgitated fish in the adult's mouth. If the parent blue-footed booby does not have enough food for all of the chicks, it will only feed the biggest chick, ensuring that at least one will survive.|$|E

Water is drawn from Red Hills Lake and Chembarambakkam Lake, the primary water reservoirs of the city, and treated at water treatment plants located at Kilpauk, Puzhal, Chembarambakkam and supplied to the city through 27 water distribution stations. The city receives 530 mld of water from Krishna River through Telugu Ganga project, 180 mld {{of water from the}} Veeranam lake project and 100 mld of water from the Minjur desalination plant, the country's largest sea water desalination plant.

500|$|After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, {{spoke of}} plans to {{publicise}} Faryl in the US, saying [...] "America {{is going to}} be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. <b>The</b> <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> intense." [...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, it reminded me of the HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so I think my album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't think I would be able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but it is so difficult to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E

2500|$|Choline is in {{high demand}} during {{pregnancy}} as a substrate for building cellular membranes, (rapid fetal and mother tissue expansion), increased need for one-carbon moieties (a substrate for addition of methylation to DNA and other functions), raising choline stores in fetal and placental tissues, and for increased production of lipoproteins (proteins containing [...] "fat" [...] portions). In particular, there is interest in the impact of choline consumption on the brain. This stems from choline's use as a material for making cellular membranes, (particularly in making phosphatidylcholine). Human brain growth is most rapid during the third trimester of pregnancy {{and continues to be}} rapid to approximately five years of age. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> <b>is</b> high for sphingomyelin, which is made from phosphytidyl choline (and thus from choline), because this material is used to myelinate (insulate) nerve fibers. Choline is also in demand for the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which can influence the structure and organization of brain regions, neurogenesis, myelination, and synapse formation. Acetylcholine is even present in the placenta and may help control cell proliferation/differentiation (increases in cell number and changes of multiuse cells into dedicated cellular functions) and parturition.|$|E
