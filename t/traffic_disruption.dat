25|$|There {{were four}} bomb hoaxes in Tobermore during 2010 {{the most recent}} on 29 July 2010 and 19 August 2010, both found in {{the centre of the}} village causing a lot of <b>traffic</b> <b>disruption</b> and {{resulting}} in people being evacuated from their homes.|$|E
25|$|In May 2014, a U-2 {{was accused}} of {{inadvertently}} causing an air <b>traffic</b> <b>disruption</b> in the Western US due to an apparent ERAM software glitch. The USAF stated the U-2 did not cause the problem as it did not emit any electronic signals that could have scrambled the control center’s computers. The FAA later determined the cause to be a flight plan entry error that overwhelmed the air traffic system's memory capacity.|$|E
25|$|Construction of two modern bridges at Stratford and Kamerunga, in 1977 and 1980 respectively, helped {{alleviate}} serious <b>traffic</b> <b>disruption</b> between Cairns and the Northern Beaches {{during the}} wet season when the Barron River's lengthy Tableland catchment area is inundated. In 1979, the Cairns public library opened. The opening of Ruth's Women's Shelter second-hand book shop in November 1980 was a {{practical way to}} provide a vital independent community service. Staffed by volunteers, and relying {{on the sale of}} donated stock, the shelter provided funds for setting up and running a women and children's crises accommodation shelter.|$|E

25|$|Construction {{commenced}} on March 8, 2005. Three major {{construction sites}} had been established, at Malmö C, Triangeln and Holma/Hyllie. By {{the end of}} 2006, another construction site had been opened in Lockarp, where connecting tracks to Ystad and Trelleborg were being built. The underground station at Malmö C was built in a 0.8km long open trench which was then covered. To minimize <b>traffic</b> <b>disruption,</b> the extensive and time-consuming work was done in stages. In order to build Triangeln station, two 25 m deep vertical shafts were dug at {{the northern and southern}} part of the site, and the station was then milled out of the rock by a roadheader — a machine equipped with a rotating cutter head on a telescopic arm. The rock was then lined with concrete elements to finish the structure. Hyllie Station was built in an approximately 7 m deep shaft; the vault that covers the station is a distinct landmark in the Hyllie development area. The tunnel was mostly bored by two tunnel boring machines (TBMs). Underground drilling commenced in November 2006 and February 2007, respectively. On 25 March 2008, one of the TBMs achieved breakthrough at Malmö C, followed by the second TBM on April 21. Work was completed in December 2010, six months ahead of schedule.|$|E
2500|$|... 26 March 1997: the IRA {{carried out}} a double bomb attack on a {{mainline}} railway and signal box in Wilmslow, England. There was also a hoax bomb alert on the main Doncaster line. The attacks caused major and widespread railway and <b>traffic</b> <b>disruption.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Boho is also {{prone to}} regular {{flooding}}. One {{of the most}} recent events was in November 2009. With water in Lough Erne at its highest level since records began, the Sillees River, which flows through the parish, burst its banks causing <b>traffic</b> <b>disruption</b> for several days. The flooding affected Corr Bridge, Drumaraw, Muckenagh, Carran Lake, Samsonagh and Mullygarry. Killyhommon Primary School had to be closed as drivers [...] struggled to negotiate floods.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose is}} to test the {{hypothesis}} that the choice of strategy for preventive maintenance of rail infrastructure might affect the amount of serious disruptions in the train traffic. The relation between preventive maintenance and serious train <b>traffic</b> <b>disruptions</b> can be divided into two parts. On one hand it is the relation between the chosen strategy for preventive maintenance and the state of the rail infrastructure. On the other hand it is the relation between the state of the rail infrastructure and the amount of occurring train <b>traffic</b> <b>disruptions.</b> Either the sub relations can be analysed and quantified separately or one might try to perform an analysis without dividing the relation between preventive maintenance and serious train <b>traffic</b> <b>disruptions</b> into two parts. An operational definition of serious <b>disruption</b> in train <b>traffic</b> in this context is that faults or damages on the rail infrastructure cause such severe delays that the planned turnover of train vehicles cannot be maintained, cancelled train traffic or the closure of a railway. Several methods for quantifying serious train <b>traffic</b> <b>disruptions,</b> based on available train traffic data, are suggested. It is clear from these methods that faults or damages on the overhead contact line dominate increasingly as higher weight is put on the larger train delays, while the opposite applies to faults and damages on signal system. The result of a Delphi study is presented, where two scenarios are tested. The purpose of the study is to let experts on maintenance of rail infrastructure judge to what extent the decision of preventive maintenance strategy may affect the amount of occurring train <b>traffic</b> <b>disruptions.</b> The first scenario means that the necessary maintenance strategy in order two reach the target standard for the rail infrastructure is implemented. In the second scenario a maintenance strategy is implemented that is 50 percent more ambitious than the strategy of the first scenario...|$|R

2500|$|According to Radio Ecclesia, 13 {{people were}} arrested on August 11 for {{allegedly}} holding an unauthorized rally and causing <b>traffic</b> <b>disruption</b> while campaigning for UNITA in Rangel, near Luanda. On August 13, campaigning members of UNITA were attacked by over 100 MPLA supporters at Londuimbali in Huambo Province, according to UNITA official Alcides Sakala; {{he said that the}} MPLA supporters were armed with [...] "machetes, stones and sticks". The clash was reportedly broken up by police firing into the air.|$|E
2500|$|In early November 1886, he set {{his sights}} on Niagara Falls, {{apparently}} without immediate financial incentive, but with the hope of future returns. He visited Niagara Falls to find a site to jump from, rejecting the [...] "old bridge" [...] at Falls View, a wood and steel suspension bridge just below the rapids, before settling on the new Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge. This double-decker rail and carriage bridge was completed earlier that year, completely replacing an earlier suspension bridge on the same site, with minimal <b>traffic</b> <b>disruption.</b> That bridge had only seen one previous jump, by a Bellini in 1873, who performed a sort of bungee jump.|$|E
2500|$|The May 2015 indictment, citing text {{messages}} between Wildstein, Baroni and Kelly, {{contended that the}} lane closures were designed to have maximum impact upon motorists {{and the city of}} Fort Lee. The closures targeted the first day of school, and deliberately steered cars to the cash lane, so as to maximize <b>traffic</b> <b>disruption</b> in the surrounding areas. The New York Times reported that [...] "the three plotting like petulant and juvenile pranksters, using government resources, time and personnel to punish a public official whose sole offense was failing to endorse their political patron. The three were in constant contact, brazenly using government e-mails, their tone sometimes almost giddy. They even gave the increasingly desperate mayor of Fort Lee their own version of the silent treatment." ...|$|E
5000|$|In August 2010, Gosford City Council {{commenced}} stabilisation {{and reconstruction}} of sections of Mount Ettalong Road and Patonga Drive.

Consideration {{was given to the}} bus timetable and emergency vehicles.|$|R
50|$|In 1897-1898, {{the metal}} tube from 1860 was {{replaced}} by metal trusses, common at the time. To minimize <b>traffic</b> <b>disruptions,</b> the trusses were assembled around the tube, which permitted the tube to continue service to train traffic. The tube was then demolished. The stone piers from 1860, slightly altered in 1897, still testify to the excellent original engineering.|$|R
