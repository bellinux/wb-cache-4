"Black Zombie" [...] is an impassioned, self-reflective {{critique}} of problems afflicting the African-American community, including prejudice ("You believe when <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> ain't shit, we can't grow / All we are is dope dealers and gangstas and hoes"), economic insolvency ("What do we own? The skin {{on our backs}} / We rent and we ask for reparations, then they hit us with tax"), and dependency ("I'ma Colombia record slave / So get paid / Control your own destiny, you are a genius / Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie"). Its socially conscious lyrics deride media stereotypes of African Americans, inequality in the educational system, and black-on-black violence. According to writer Dax-Devlon Ross, the song foreshadowed the themes and [...] "world view" [...] of Nas' subsequent albums. [...] "Poppa Was a Playa" [...] features uncredited co-production by Kanye West, and discusses Nas' complicated relationship with his father, jazz musician Olu Dara, addressing his lusty, itinerant lifestyle throughout Nas' youth. Gabriel Alvarez of Complex calls it an [...] "honest dedication to his old man: a jazz player, a rolling stone" [...] and writes of the song, [...] "The love is there despite the man's faults. Nas crafts a full picture of the past, looking at the infidelity and fights from both parents' perspectives." ...|$|E

It reflects the idea of the colonizers giving (“gifting”) land to the Indians as though they weren’t theirs in the first place. Then they say that the Indians are so privileged, but what privileges do they have when they are constantly pre-judged for things like drinking and gambling? ...|$|E
2500|$|The 2010 {{order for}} 40 CS300s and 40 options from Republic Airways Holdings – then owner of {{exclusive}} A319/320 operator Frontier Airlines – pushed Airbus into the A320neo re-engine. Airbus COO-customers John Leahy initially avoided ignoring the CSeries and {{allowing it to}} grow as Boeing did with Airbus and aggressively competed against Bombardier. He thinks by [...] "pressing the Trump Administration for 300% tariffs, [...] forced them into our hands", and Boeing doesn’t care about the present cost to [...] "not to have competition, [...] an admission of a weak product line and a weak commercial organization that <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> just can’t afford that competition".|$|E

5000|$|Sayle {{became the}} leading {{performer}} at the Comic Strip. He appeared on The Comic Strip Album (1981) and recorded Cak! (1982). He {{also appeared in}} the stage show, film and comedy album of The Secret Policeman's Other Ball (1981-1982). Sayle's material covered {{a broad range of}} topics, but one of his favourite subjects remained politics. His angry persona, coupled with his vociferous delivery, gave immense bite to his material. A typical example of Sayle's humour was his attack on American phrases: [...] "If you travel to the States ... {{they have a lot of}} different words than like what we use. For instance: <b>they</b> <b>say</b> 'elevator', <b>we</b> <b>say</b> 'lift'; <b>they</b> <b>say</b> 'drapes', <b>we</b> <b>say</b> 'curtains'; <b>they</b> <b>say</b> 'president', <b>we</b> <b>say</b> 'seriously deranged git!" ...|$|R

So {{you can use the}} same source material in different contexts. If you're in a different place at a different time and in a different frame of mind you can use stuff that originally didn't go anywhere, and make something of it. So yeah, we keep everything, but, man, it's a lot of music and ideas lying on the backups these days. I'm guessing 10 per cent of what we start ends up as something presentable. We feel like a lot of things are interesting for 30 seconds or so, but then what? We could probably sell riffs to rock bands, sell hundreds of riffs or piano themes or whatever, but our main problem is to tie elements together—to 'bring it home,' as <b>they</b> <b>say.</b> <b>We</b> are quite selective." ...|$|E
60|$|Further, Mr. Leacock is all-British, being English {{by birth}} and Canadian by residence, I mention this for two reasons: firstly, because England and the Empire {{are very proud}} to claim him for their own, and, secondly, because I do not wish his {{nationality}} {{to be confused with}} that of his neighbours on the other side. For English and American humourists have not always seen eye to eye.
