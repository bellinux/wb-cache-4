5000|$|In German orthography, nouns {{and most}} <b>words</b> with <b>the</b> <b>syntactical</b> <b>function</b> of nouns are capitalised {{to make it}} easier for readers to {{determine}} the <b>function</b> of a <b>word</b> within a sentence ( [...] - [...] "On Friday I went shopping."; [...] - [...] "One day he finally showed up.") This convention is almost unique to German today (shared perhaps only by the closely related Luxembourgish language and several insular dialects of the North Frisian language), but it was historically common in other languages such as Danish (which abolished the capitalization of nouns in 1948) and English.|$|R

This system of cheironomy survives in some communities to the present day, notably in Italy. It is speculated that both the shapes {{and the names of}} some of the accents (e.g. tifcha, literally [...] "hand-breadth") may refer to the hand signals rather than to <b>the</b> <b>syntactical</b> <b>functions</b> or melodies denoted by them. Today in most communities there is no system of hand signals and the reader learns the melody of each reading in advance.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike the Indo-European languages, Etruscan noun endings {{were more}} agglutinative, with some nouns bearing {{two or three}} agglutinated suffixes. For example, where Latin would have {{distinct}} nominative plural and dative plural endings, Etruscan would suffix the case ending to a plural marker: Latin nominative singular fili-us, [...] "son", plural fili-i, dative plural fili-is, but Etruscan clan, clen-ar and clen-ar-aśi. [...] Moreover, Etruscan nouns could bear multiple suffixes from the case paradigm alone: that is, Etruscan exhibited Suffixaufnahme. Pallottino calls this phenomenon [...] "morphological redetermination", which he defines as [...] "the typical tendency ... to redetermine <b>the</b> <b>syntactical</b> <b>function</b> of <b>the</b> form by the superposition of suffices." [...] His example is Uni-al-θi, [...] "in the sanctuary of Juno", where -al is a genitive ending and -θi a locative.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the onomatopoeias and mimeses in Korean are analyzed. The {{question}} of a classification of onomatopoeia and mimeses as some part of speech is discussed after the definition of onomatopoeias and mimeses. In Korean, onomatopoeia and mimeses are mostly considered as adverbs, while in Czech as interjections. The last approach {{is to create a}} new part of speech of onomatopoeias and mimeses only. There are four specific conditions of Korean onomatopoeias and mimeses, which is a sound symbolism, reduplications, a specific word formation and typical <b>syntactical</b> <b>functions</b> and a limited compatibility. At least two of the conditions should meet to classify a word to be onomatopoeia or mimesis in Korean. Afterwards the question of quantity of onomatopoeia and mimeses in Korean is presented on an excerption from Korean and Czech dictionary. It was observed, that the quantity of Korean onomatopoeia and mimeses is based expecially on its variability. The main formal features of Korean onomatopoeias and mimeses are presented with several examples. The sound symbolism of vowels and consonants, the various kinds of reduplication, the word forming processes and <b>the</b> <b>syntactical</b> <b>functions</b> are discussed respectively. In the other part the question of distribution of onomatopoeias and mimeses in Korean compare to [...] ...|$|R
50|$|A related {{distinct}} syntactic {{feature is}} that a function can be defined to take as input the computed value of the expression on its left side. Also, a single additional argument does not require surrounding parentheses. The resulting infix notation blurs <b>the</b> <b>syntactical</b> difference between <b>functions</b> and operators. Such expressions seem conceptually as having a computed value flowing from left to the right.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are other}} special constructions that also {{take place in}} certain {{specific}} environments. For example, quantificatives and nouns can be in apposition to other nouns that independent subjects or objects: ʔuhkʔo'nisɛ'mǎn, ho't ʔaku'hpanʔuhkɛ'nì [...] "He assembled all (of) his people, it is sad" [...] < [...] "he assembled, it is said, his people, all." [...] Additionally, a possessive [...] can serve in <b>the</b> same <b>syntactical</b> <b>functions</b> that a noun can. For example, ta'čɔhak ʔu'rǐhč, hi'yuhɔ'nì [...] "The chief's house was (made of) grass" [...] (ta'čɔhaku [...] "the chief", possessor noun, + ʔu'rihči [...] "his house", alienably possessed noun, the combination serving as independent subject).|$|R

40|$|Japanese passive {{sentences}} {{have been}} separated only by function and category syntax, while {{the role of}} semantic received less attention. As a result, some issues still remain such as {{the existence of a}} passive sentence is one acceptable while others are not, even though <b>the</b> same <b>syntactical</b> <b>function</b> and category. This study tried to examine BJ passive sentences in terms of functionality, the category and also the role of passive sentences semantically pure (direct passive) are predicated BJ transitive verbs. The results of the data analysis is based on the function and structure of the purely passive category there are three kinds of structures (A, B, C), while based on semantic roles can be divided into eight types (I to VIII). Subject and complement the passive type. I must be filled by a noun animate each objective and agentive role; Type II - V, type VII, and VIII subjects filled by inanimate nouns and noun complement animate filled by the accepted determined by the semantic role and the type of verb; and passive type VI is both the subject and the complement to be filled by inanimate nouns...|$|R

40|$|A {{predicate}} of {{a passive}} sentence in Japanese can be filled in by a transitive,ditransitif, and intransitive verb. Passive sentences with intransitive verbs as the predicates commonly express oppositive meaning. Linguists commonly classify {{this type of}} passive sentence regarding only to its <b>syntactical</b> <b>function</b> and category. This study however investigates passive intransitive sentences regarding not only their <b>syntactical</b> <b>function</b> and category, but also their semantic construction. The study finds five types of syntactical construction of passive intransitive (I~V). Each type of the passive is distinguished by the semantic information of its modifiers...|$|R

40|$|As {{the title}} itself indicates, the {{objective}} of this thesis is non-finite verb forms in the Spanish language. We centered mainly on the issue of infinitive, both its formal and its semantic and syntactically functional aspect. The scope of work is relatively wide, though definitely not exhaustive. We opened the theoretical part with the basic characteristics of non-finite forms and general problems related to terminology. After that, we dealt with <b>syntactical</b> <b>functions</b> of <b>the</b> infinitive in the sentence, which we subsequently compared with the Czech language. In accordance with the thinking of Czech linguistic school, we explained the concept of halfpredicative clauses and we focused precisely on infinitive. It {{is an integral part of}} verbal periphrases, in which we considered both <b>the</b> <b>syntactical</b> structure and meaning. We regard the part dedicated to the use of infinitives to express temporal and modal meanings through the individual prepositions as the most important part of this work. It also represents the ground for language research in the practical part of the work, where we studied the frequency of the use of condensers in Spanish in combination with the prepositions al, a, de, con, their equivalents in Czech and the relationship of individual adverbial meanings of these infinitive relations.
