5|$|By solving Apollonius' problem {{repeatedly}} {{to find the}} inscribed circle, the interstices between mutually tangential circles can be filled arbitrarily finely, forming an Apollonian gasket, {{also known as a}} Leibniz packing or an Apollonian packing. This gasket is a fractal, being self-similar and having a dimension d that is not known exactly but is roughly 1.3, which is higher <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> regular (or rectifiable) curve (d = 1) but less <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plane (d = 2). The Apollonian gasket was first described by Gottfried Leibniz in the 17th century, and is a curved precursor of the 20th-century Sierpiński triangle. The Apollonian gasket also has deep connections to other fields of mathematics; for example, it is the limit set of Kleinian groups.|$|E
5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>A.</b> contortrix, and is {{rich with}} {{powerful}} cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, the bite can leave scars, and on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom {{does not cause}} systemic reactions in victims and does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).|$|E
5|$|An autocannon is {{a cannon}} {{with a larger}} caliber than a machine gun, but smaller <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> field gun. Autocannons have {{mechanisms}} to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a faster rate of fire than artillery, often approaching—and, {{in the case of}} Gatling guns, surpassing—that of a machine gun. The traditional minimum bore for autocannon—indeed, for all types of cannon, as autocannon are the lowest-caliber pieces—has remained 20mm, since World War II.|$|E
50|$|Also in 1983, Wozniak {{returned}} to Apple product development, desiring no more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> role <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> engineer and a motivational {{factor for the}} Apple workforce.|$|R

5|$|An {{elephant}} uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting {{its skin}} from ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular mud baths {{to protect it}} from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in the mathematical derivation below, the X-ray scattering {{is determined by the}} density of electrons within the crystal. Since the energy of an X-ray is much greater <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> valence electron, the scattering may be modeled as Thomson scattering, the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a free electron. This model is generally adopted to describe the polarization of the scattered radiation.|$|E
5|$|Bears, crocodiles, golden jackals, leopards {{and snakes}} {{are the main}} predators of the jungle cat. The golden jackal, particularly, can be a major {{competitor}} to the cat. When it encounters a threat, the jungle cat will vocalise before engaging in attack, producing sounds like small roars – a behavior uncommon for {{the other members of}} Felis. The meow of the jungle cat is also somewhat lower <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical domestic cat. The jungle cat can host parasites such as Haemaphysalis and Heterophyes species.|$|E

50|$|However, the {{velocity}} attained by SpaceShipOne prior to reentry {{is much lower}} <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> orbital spacecraft, and engineers, including Rutan, recognize that a feathered reentry technique is not suitable for return from orbit.|$|R
50|$|A Sulfate-Chloride bath {{operates}} at lower voltages than a Watts bath and provide <b>a</b> higher rate <b>of</b> deposition. Although internal stresses {{are higher than}} the Watts bath they are lower <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> all-chloride bath.|$|R
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E
5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this will increase the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E
5|$|During Copeland's training, {{he trained}} one weekday and all weekend. The school's {{practice}} ring was a 12-by-14-foot boxing ring with a harder mat <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical wrestling ring. The ceiling above it was low, with exposed pipes, preventing top-rope moves from being performed. Copeland later credited this environment with {{forcing him to}} drill and improve his technical mat-based wrestling. His classmates included Johnny Swinger, Joe E. Legend, and Rob Etcheverria (who later became notable for training wrestlers such as Gail Kim, Angelina Love, and Taylor Wilde).|$|E
30|$|In women {{presenting}} with pelvic endometriosis, {{the mechanism}} of the digestive symptoms could rather be the consequence of the irritation of the digestive tract by local inflammatory phenomena <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> actual infiltration by the disease.|$|R
30|$|Assumption 3 implies <b>that</b> {{productivity}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{environmentally friendly}} production process is smaller <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> environmentally unfriendly production process.

50|$|However, in {{an elastic}} {{material}} such as wood, friction may bind a narrow wedge {{more easily than}} a wide one. This is why the head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> splitting maul has a much wider angle <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> axe.|$|R
5|$|Early 21st-century research, however, {{suggested}} that Master James' role, and Savoyard influence more generally, {{may have been}} overstated. The stonework of the sites in North Wales is of much higher quality than that in North Italy, and key features – such as the gatehouses – are not seen in Savoyard. Research indicates that Master James also appears {{to have had a}} stronger project management function, rather than an architectural design role, {{in the development of the}} sites. Furthermore, in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built only after James had left the region, and would never have been seen by the architect. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the projects, rather <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single individual.|$|E
5|$|Infinite-dimensional unitary {{representations}} of the Lorentz group appear by restriction of the irreducible infinite-dimensional unitary {{representations of}} the Poincaré group acting on the Hilbert spaces of relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. But these are also of mathematical interest and of potential direct physical relevance in other roles <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mere restriction. There were speculative theories, (tensors and spinors have infinite counterparts in the expansors of Dirac and the expinors of Harish-Chandra) consistent with relativity and quantum mechanics, but they have found no proven physical application. Modern speculative theories potentially have similar ingredients per below.|$|E
5|$|Prakash Raj and Ashish Vidyarthi {{were cast}} as the film's primary antagonists. Raj played a mafia kingpin and Vidyarthi played a corrupt police officer, a villain's role he finds more fun to play <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hero. Sayaji Shinde and Nassar played the two other {{principal}} characters in the film. Jyothi Rana {{played the role of}} the mafia kingpin's moll, marking her debut in Telugu cinema. Isai and Subbaraju portrayed negative roles as well, with the former also making his debut in Telugu cinema. Ali played the role of a beggar and shared screen-space with Brahmanandam and Venu Madhav. Jagannadh added this trio to the film to provide situational humour. Master Bharath played the role of D'Cruz's brother. Mumaith Khan performed an item number in the film.|$|E

25|$|In {{concrete}} categories, {{a function}} {{that has a}} left inverse is injective. Thus in concrete categories, monomorphisms are often, but not always, injective. The condition <b>of</b> being <b>an</b> injection is stronger <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> being <b>a</b> monomorphism, but weaker <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> being <b>a</b> split monomorphism.|$|R
5|$|The {{basic form}} of the apothecaries' system is {{essentially}} {{a subset of the}} Roman weight system. An apothecaries' pound normally consisted of 12 ounces. (In France this was changed to 16 ounces, and in Spain the customary unit was the marco, a mark of 8 ounces.) In the south of Europe and in France, the scruple was generally divided into 24 grains, so that one ounce consisted of 576 grains. Nevertheless, the subdivision of an ounce was somewhat more uniform <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pound, and a common feature of all variants is that 12 ounces are roughly 100 drachms (96–128 drachms) and a grain is roughly the weight of a physical grain.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is graceful but skittish and often unpredictable. It is agile and can move quickly, it is shy and secretive by nature and, like most snakes, it avoids threats. In the wild, a black mamba seldom tolerates humans {{approaching}} {{more closely than}} about 40 meters. When confronted {{it is likely to}} gape in a threat display, exposing its black mouth and flicking its tongue. It also is likely to form a hood by spreading its neck-flap as cobras do. The mamba's hood however, is narrower <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical cobra. The threat display may be accompanied by audible hissing.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} of the Holy Roman Church {{up to the}} 11th {{century had}} strictly liturgical duties and generally took no part {{in the government of}} the Church. Cardinal bishops were equal to the other bishops, even if celebrating the rite of consecration of the new pope gave them considerable prestige, while the dignity of the cardinal priest or deacon was considered lower <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bishop.

5|$|The {{legend of}} Bishop Henry's life, or his Vita, was written {{at the end}} of the 13th century. It {{contains}} little concrete information about Henry. He is said to have been an English-born bishop in Uppsala at the time of King Eric the Saint of Sweden in the mid-12th century, ruling the peaceful kingdom with the king in heavenly co-existence. To tackle the perceived threat from the non-Christian Finns, Eric and Henry were forced to battle them. After they had conquered Finland, baptized the people and built many churches, the victorious king returned to Sweden while Henry (Henricus) remained with the Finns, more willing to live the life of a preacher <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high bishop.|$|E
