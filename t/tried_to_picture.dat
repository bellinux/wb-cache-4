500|$|Both legal teams, in {{planning}} their trial strategy, considered {{the implications of}} trying a white man based on the testimony {{of a black man}} in front of an early 1900s Georgia jury. Jeffrey Melnick, author of Black-Jewish Relations on Trial: Leo Frank and Jim Conley in the New South, writes that the defense <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> Conley as [...] "a new kind of African Americananarchic, degraded, and dangerous." [...] Dorsey, however, pictured Conley as [...] "a familiar type" [...] of [...] "old negro", like a minstrel or plantation worker. [...] Dorsey's strategy played on prejudices of the white 1900s Georgia observers, i.e., that a black man could not have been intelligent enough to make up a complicated story. The prosecution argued that Conley's statement explaining {{the immediate aftermath of the}} murder was true, that Frank was the murderer, and that Frank had dictated the murder notes to Conley in an effort to pin the crime on Newt Lee, the night watchman.|$|E
500|$|Plath's semi-autobiographical novel, {{which her}} mother wished to block, was {{published}} in 1963 and in the US in 1971. Describing the compilation of the book to her mother, she wrote, [...] "What I've done is to throw together events from my own life, fictionalising to add colour– it's a pot boiler really, but I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown.... I've <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> my world {{and the people in}} it as seen through the distorting lens of a bell jar". She described her novel as [...] "an autobiographical apprentice work which I had to write in order to free myself from the past". She dated a Yale senior named Dick Norton during her junior year. Norton, upon whom the character of Buddy in The Bell Jar is based, contracted tuberculosis and was treated at the Ray Brook Sanatorium near Saranac Lake. While visiting Norton, Plath broke her leg skiing, an incident that was fictionalized in the novel. Plath also used the novel to highlight the issue of women in the workforce during the 1950s. She strongly believed in their abilities to be writers and editors, while society forced them to fulfill secretarial roles.|$|E

60|$|It was, {{it seemed}} to me, the end. Not even on the occasion, some years earlier, when I had {{inadvertently}} become betrothed to Tuppy's frightful Cousin Honoria, had I experienced a deeper sense of being waist high in the gumbo and about to sink without trace. I wandered out into the garden, smoking a tortured gasper, with the iron well embedded in the soul. And I had fallen {{into a sort of}} trance, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> {{what it would be like}} having the Bassett on the premises for the rest of my life and at the same time, if you follow me, <b>trying</b> not <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> what it would be like, when I charged into something which might have been a tree, but was not--being, in point of fact, Jeeves.|$|R
60|$|Vague chills assailed me. I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> the eyes. Did {{they roll}} like dimes?

No sign of amazement at such an outrageous thing. Later the matter was amplified.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Chalk’s anxiety {{during the}} {{negotiations}} {{for the purchase}} of the Fair Emily kept him oscillating between Tredgold and Stobell until those gentlemen fled at his approach and instructed their retainers to make untruthful statements as to their whereabouts.

60|$|I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> {{to myself}} the mosque before the Christians laid their desecrating hands upon it. The floor was of {{coloured}} tiles, tiles such as {{may still be}} seen in the Alhambra of Granada and in the Alcazar at Seville. The columns are of marble, of porphyry and jasper; tradition says they came from Carthage, from pagan temples in France and Christian churches in Spain; they are slender and unadorned, they must have contrasted astonishingly with the roof of larch wood, all ablaze with gold and with vermilion.|$|E

60|$|Thus mused Godfrey, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> <b>to</b> himself what Isobel {{looked like}} when she had stood by his side on that long-past autumn eve, and only succeeded in remembering exactly what she looked {{like when she}} was kissing a rose with a certain knight in armour in a square garden, since for some perverse reason it was this picture that {{remained}} so painfully clear to his mind. Then he drifted off into speculations upon the general mystery of things of a sort that were common with him, and in these became oblivious of all else.|$|R
60|$|Peter <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> {{himself in}} a bright blue coat and laughed right out at the mere thought, and the others joined with him. Then Indigo flew {{up to the top}} of a tall tree not far away and began to sing. It was a lively song and Peter enjoyed it thoroughly. Mrs. Indigo took this {{opportunity}} to slip away unobserved, and when Peter looked around for Chewink, he too had disappeared. He had gone to tell Mrs. Chewink that he was quite safe and that she had nothing to worry about.|$|E
60|$|Ingleby did so, {{though the}} {{narrative}} was distinctly tame in its unvarnished conciseness {{until he came}} to his meeting with Esmond. He had no desire that Hetty should know what he had endured on her account, while it is, after all, difficult to make another person understand what one feels like when worn-out to the verge of exhaustion. Ingleby did not attempt it, but his tone changed a trifle as he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> the policeman floundering in the river. Leger laughed softly, but the firelight showed a little flash in Hetty's eyes.|$|E
60|$|Raging blizzards, snowslides, crevassed glaciers and {{rotten ice}} were things he knew; there were {{scars on his}} body he had got in {{stubborn}} fights. So far he had conquered; but he owned {{that he had had}} enough, and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> the Old Country his father talked about. Its woods were not primitive jungles, wrecked by gales and scorched by fires; men planted and tended them and the trees had room to grow. White farmsteads with gardens and orchards dotted the valleys; the narrow fields were rich with grass and corn. Then there were wonderful old houses, stored with treasures of art.|$|E
60|$|For {{how many}} hours she had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> this meeting in her mind, now imagining him tender and affectionate as she wished him to be, now cold or contemptuous or resentful; and in every case her heated brain had {{suggested}} the very words he would use to her; but for this careless tone, and the inexplicable look on his face, according so ill with his tone, she was quite unprepared, and for some time she could make no reply to his words.|$|R

60|$|As the red sun {{looked across}} the placid ocean through the tall, clean stems of the cocoanut trees, like a {{blooming}} whiskey bloat through the bars of a city prison, I went {{and stood in the}} edge of the water on the flat rock pressed by Captain Cook's feet when the blow was dealt which took away his life, and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> in my mind the doomed man struggling in the midst of the multitude of exasperated savages--the men in the ship crowding to the vessel's side and gazing in anxious dismay toward the shore--the--but I discovered that I could not do it.|$|E
6000|$|I {{tried to}} analyse her {{qualifications}} {{for the place}} she held in my heart. I had known women who had attracted me more physically, and women who had attracted me more mentally. I had known wiser women, handsomer women, more amiable women, {{but none of them}} had affected me like Audrey. The problem was inexplicable. Any idea that we might be affinities, soul-mates destined for each other from the beginning of time, was disposed of by the fact that my attraction for her was apparently in inverse ratio to hers for me. For possibly the millionth time {{in the past five years}} I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> in my mind the man Sheridan, that shadowy wooer to whom she had yielded so readily.

Then, again, it was only yesterday that it would have hurt him, Blanche's rubbing her feet; but now he gloried in Frona's permitting it, and his heart went out in a more kindly way to Blanche. Perhaps it was the elevation of the liquor, but he seemed to discover new virtues in her rugged face.|$|R
60|$|And {{now let me}} take up certain {{difficulties}} {{the student}} of Socialism encounters. He comes thus far perhaps with the Socialist argument, and then his imagination gets <b>to</b> work <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>picture</b> {{a world in which}} a moiety of the population, perhaps even the larger moiety, is employed by the State, and in which the whole population is educated by the State and insured of a decent and comfortable care and subsistence during youth and old age. He then begins to think of how all this vast organization is to be managed, and with that his real difficulties begin.|$|R
