In China, there are abundant resources of the ilmenite ore, along with the resources of high-grade titanic mineral rutile are decreasing worldwide, the rational exploitation and utilization of ilmenite ore become an inevitable trend. Hydrogen reduction of ilmenite was investigated. The gas used for reduction was the mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen (50 vol% H 2), and the reaction temperature was {{in the range of}} 923 ～ 1123 K. As shown in the experiment, the reduction degree increasing along with the temperature rising, the reaction degree can reach to 74 % in 1123 K after 40 min. The volume reaction model was employed to analyze the experimental data and the activation energy was 64. 36 kJ/mol which was calculated by date fitting. The activation energy of reduction reaction with carbon was more than that with hydrogen, so it was easier for hydrogen to reduce the ilmenite concentrate than carbon did. The mature fluidizing chlorination in China possessed the advantages of high production capacities, low slag quantity and environmentally benign characters. However, it is hard to resolve the agglomeration problem caused by titanium minerals with high content of MgO and CaO. The titanium-rich material with low content of MgO and CaO all over the world has accounted for 7 mass%, which can be suitable to fluidizing chlorination. A novel multi-stage series fluidized bed with potentially valuable application has been proposed to promote anti-agglomeration of material powders by strong shear force generated from interior turbulent. Previous works mainly focused on the prediction and identification of optimal process parameters by simulation and verification of anti-agglomeration effect by hot test on a small scale. In this work, investigation of application of prior research in industrial test was processed. The industrial test for production of TiCl 4 with multi-stage series fluidized bed has been carried out under the technological conditions identified by previous work.

All the implant material samples contained traceable amounts of Be, Cd, Co, up to a maximum of 0. 001 percent by weight [wt. %], Cr up to 0. 033 wt. %, Cu up to 0. 007 wt. %, Hf up to 0. 035 wt. %, Mn up to 0. 007 wt. %, Ni up to 0. 031 wt. %, and Pd up to 0. 001 wt. %.

40|$|Titanium {{has ever}} since its {{discovery}} been {{looked upon as}} a very promising material. It not only combines excellent mechanical properties (high strength, high failure strain) with an extremely good corrosion resistance, {{but it is also}} a biocompatible material. It has although always kept its stamp of a promising material. The fact that titanium and most of its alloys consist respectively completely or mainly of aphase with a hexagonal crystal structure, has not helped in improving this status. The inherent anisotropy and the associated significantly different behavior from the better known cubic materials like steel or aluminum have left room for a so far mainly unused possibility for material tuning. Indeed, whereas for another hexagonal metal like magnesium, research has made great progress in understanding and controlling the intricate relations between for example the more conventional slip systems andthe activation of twinning on a micro-scale level, and the stress-strain and failure behavior on the macroscopic level, the research on the influence of the microstructural texture on the macroscopic properties has,especially in the case of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium alloy, mostly been limited to the influence of heat treatments and their associated microstructural morphologies. The purpose of this work is to shed some more light on the active microscopic deformation mechanisms and their effect on the mechanical properties. The research has been limited to the workhorse of titanium materials, namely the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy and only considersdeformation at room temperature. Different mechanical tests were used to determine the mechanical response of the investigated Ti- 6 Al- 4 V material. The examined strain rate range corresponded to the quasi-static and the lower dynamic regime, where the high dynamic regime would correspondto shock wave loadings. The microstructural texture was however not varied, limiting it to a specific case, being a given equiaxed microstructure typical for Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. However, as part of this work was to investigate the influence of the crystallographic texture on the deformation behaviour, the influence of the initial texture was taken into account by varying the loading directions and conditions. The crystallographic texture evolution was measured both before and after deformation in order to try to understand the underlying fundamental mechanisms. This experimental knowledge was then put to use to fit a crystal plasticity model to mimic these mechanisms. After assessing the validity of the numerical framework in the specific crystal plasticity model being used in the framework of this research project, the results of the model were finally compared both on a qualitative and quantitative level with the experimental results in order to assess its accuracy and predictive capabilities.

50|$|The {{plant has}} an {{intricate}} design {{to carry out}} realization of Titanium alloy wrought products and fabrication of hardware. Work is being done actively to increase {{the capacity of the}} TSP for the proposed 10000 TPY. A memorandum of understanding has also been signed by the KMML with Steel Authority of India(SAIL) for a huge joint venture for preparing <b>titanium</b> <b>sponge</b> at large scale. India has the third largest reserves of Titanium containing minerals. India was also the sixth largest country by Titanium product in 2013. However, the high purity Titanium sponge(which has at least 99.7% Titanium) as raw material is still imported for aerospace applications from countries like Japan, Russia and China. VSSC realized the aerospace-grade alloy, having formula Ti6Al4V, at Mishra Dhatu Nigam (Midhani) in Hyderabad.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{technique of}} titanium production is via the Kroll process which involves chlorination of TiO2 ore {{in the presence}} of carbon and reacting the resulting TiCl4 with magnesium to produce <b>titanium</b> <b>sponge.</b> These processes take place at temperatures as high as 1040 °C. The sponge particle range in size from 45 to 180 µm, with particles ~150 µm termed ‘sponge fines’. These fines are irregularly shaped and porous with a sponge-like morphology. The fines are then blended with alloy additions; cold compacted into a green compact at up to 415 MPa then vacuum sintered at 1260 °C to produce a 99.5% dense component. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) can further increase the density of these parts and produce components more economically than cast or wrought parts, but the porosity present in the material degrades fatigue and fracture properties. The BE approach has been used to produce valves for the Toyota Altezza, golf club heads and softball bats. More recently, close to 100% dense Ti Grade 5 parts has been achieved using a hydrided powder along with 60:40 Al:V master alloy. The mechanical properties compare well with those exhibited by cast-and-wrought products. A cost estimate of less than $3.00 for a 0.320 g automotive connection link has been made.|$|E
