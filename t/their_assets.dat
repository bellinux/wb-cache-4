Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze {{was because she}} did not know exactly what he would say, and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed <b>their</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children.

5|$|In 1534, Cromwell {{initiated}} a Visitation of the Monasteries ostensibly {{to examine their}} character, but in fact, to value <b>their</b> <b>assets</b> {{with a view to}} expropriation. The Crown was undergoing financial difficulties, and the wealth of the church, in contrast to its political weakness, made appropriation of church property both tempting and feasible. Suppression of monasteries to raise funds was not unknown previously. Cromwell had done the same thing on the instructions of Cardinal Wolsey to raise funds for two proposed colleges at Ipswich and Oxford years before.|$|E

The leaders of the high-flying trusts were mainly prominent members of New York's financial and social circles. One {{of the most respected}} was Charles T. Barney, whose late father-in-law William Collins Whitney was a famous financier. Barney's Knickerbocker Trust Company was the third-largest trust in New York.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{began to}} address the problem from 1649 onwards, but it was slow to make a difference. Helen Small writes that, under George III (reigned 1760–1820), new {{legislation}} prevented debts of under 40shillings leading to jail (£ in 2014), but even the smallest debt would exceed that once lawyers' fees were added. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14days by taking an oath that <b>their</b> <b>assets</b> did not exceed £20, but if a creditor objected they had to stay inside. Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.|$|E
5|$|UBS France {{executive}} Patrick de Fayet {{was among}} three local branch executives being investigated. UBS wealth management bankers allegedly {{broke the law}} by enabling French taxpayers to hide <b>their</b> <b>assets</b> in UBS-controlled offshore assets to avoid paying taxes. The bankers undertook to direct their French clients' assets to UBS's Switzerland operation, rather than keep the money in France. UBS set aside approximately US$2 billion in expected liability for its currency rigging and French tax evasion cases.|$|E

40|$|First passage models, where {{corporate}} assets undergo correlated random {{walks and}} a company defaults if its assets fall below a threshold provide an attractive framework for modeling the default process. Typical one year default correlations are small, i. e., of order a few percent, but nonetheless including correlations is very important, for managing portfolio credit risk and pricing some credit derivatives (e. g. first to default baskets). In first passage models the exact {{dependence of the}} joint survival probability {{of more than two}} firms on <b>their</b> <b>asset</b> correlations is not known. We derive an expression for the dependence of the joint survival probability of $n$ firms on <b>their</b> <b>asset</b> correlations using first order perturbation theory in the correlations. It includes all terms that are linear in the correlations but neglects effects of quadratic and higher order. For constant time independent correlations we compare the first passage model expression for the joint survival probability with what a multivariate normal Copula function gives. As a practical application of our results we calculate the dependence of the five year joint survival probability for five basic industrials on <b>their</b> <b>asset</b> correlations. ...|$|R
5|$|His father, Niccolò Polo, a merchant, traded {{with the}} Near East, {{becoming}} wealthy and achieving great prestige. Niccolò {{and his brother}} Maffeo set off on a trading voyage before Marco's birth. In 1260, Niccolò and Maffeo, while residing in Constantinople, then {{the capital of the}} Latin Empire, foresaw a political change; they liquidated <b>their</b> <b>assets</b> into jewels and moved away. According to The Travels of Marco Polo, they passed through much of Asia, and met with Kublai Khan, a Mongol ruler and founder of the Yuan dynasty. Their decision to leave Constantinople proved timely. In 1261 Michael VIII Palaiologos, the ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, took Constantinople, promptly burned the Venetian quarter and re-established the Eastern Roman Empire. Captured Venetian citizens were blinded, while many of those who managed to escape perished aboard overloaded refugee ships fleeing to other Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Sledd {{and members}} of the faculty were {{actively}} involved in urging Florida's state government to combine the state's several small institutions of higher education. The university consolidation movement gained the political backing of newly elected Florida Governor Napoleon B. Broward, and in 1905 the Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act, which abolished the hodge-podge of state-supported colleges and consolidated <b>their</b> <b>assets</b> and programs into a new comprehensive university and land-grant college for white men, and a liberal arts college and normal school for white women. The Act mandated the merger of four separate institutions, including the existing University of Florida at Lake City, into the consolidated men's university—the new University of the State of Florida. By a vote of six to four, the new Board of Control charged with the governance of the consolidated institutions selected Gainesville as the location for the new men's state university.|$|E
5|$|WMATA's {{bus system}} is a {{successor}} to four privately owned bus companies. While WMATA's original compact provided only for rail service, by 1970 the need for reliable bus services to connect passengers to rail stations led to calls for authority to overhaul the entire bus system as well. The compact was amended in 1971, allowing the authority to operate buses and take over bus companies. After months of negotiation with Chalk failed to produce an agreed price, on January 14, 1973, WMATA condemned DC Transit and its sister company, the Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company and acquired <b>their</b> <b>assets</b> for $38.2 million. On February 4, it acquired Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Transit Company, which operated in Northern Virginia, and the WMA Transit Company of Prince George's County for $4.5 million. While AB and WMA Transit were in better financial condition than DC Transit, their owners {{did not wish to}} compete with a publicly owned bus system, and requested takeover.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of its}} race-centric {{functions}} during World War II, the SS {{oversaw the}} isolation and displacement of Jews from the populations of the conquered territories, seizing <b>their</b> <b>assets</b> and deporting them to concentration camps and ghettos, where they were used as slave labor or immediately killed. Chosen to implement the Final Solution for Jews and other groups deemed inferior or enemies of the state, the SS led the killing, torture, and enslavement of approximately 12 million people. Most victims were Jews or of Polish or other Slavic extraction. A significant number of victims were members of other racial or ethnic {{groups such as the}} Romani people. The SS was involved in killing people viewed as threats to race hygiene or NSDAP ideology, including the mentally or physically handicapped, homosexuals, and political dissidents. Members of trade unions and those perceived to be affiliated with groups that opposed the regime (religious, political, social, and otherwise), or those whose views were contradictory to the goals of the NSDAP government, were rounded up in large numbers; these included clergy of all faiths, Jehovah's Witnesses, Freemasons, Communists, and Rotary Club members. According to the judgments rendered at the Nuremberg trials as well as many war crimes investigations and trials conducted since then, the SS was responsible for the majority of Nazi war crimes. In particular, it was the primary organization which carried out the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran {{critically}} low {{on foreign}} reserves, leaving them {{forced to accept}} harsh terms from the IMF, and often to accept low prices for the forced sale of <b>their</b> <b>assets.</b> This shattered faith in free market thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep {{the value of their}} currencies low. This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies {{while at the same time}} building up foreign reserves so they would be better protected against further crises. No currency war resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy—in the short term it had some benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, but until about 2007, the consensus view among free market economists and policy makers like Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not a major reason for worry.|$|E
5|$|In 1536 Henry VIII, {{through a}} series of {{administrative}} and legal processes disbanded monasteries, priories, convents and friaries in England. He appropriated their income, disposed of <b>their</b> <b>assets,</b> and provided for their former members and functions. He was given the authority to do this in England and Wales by the Act of Supremacy, passed by Parliament in 1534, which made him Supreme Head of the Church in England, thus separating England from Papal authority, and by the First Suppression Act (1536) and the Second Suppression Act (1539). Roger Tormenton had been elected prior of Woodspring in 1525 and in 1534 he acknowledged the king's supremacy, having already sold a third of the prior's property to Thomas Horner of Mells Manor, but on 27 September 1536 the community was disbanded with revenues of £87 2s 11d. Some of the priory's treasures were distributed to nearby churches. In addition to the reliquary going to St Paul's in Kewstoke, the carved misericords went to St Martin's in Worle and the sculpted pulpit to the Church of St Lawrence in Wick St. Lawrence.|$|E

5|$|The {{top five}} {{conglomerates}} in Indonesia {{prior to the}} 1997 Asian financial crisis—the Salim Group, Astra International, the Sinar Mas Group, Gudang Garam, Sampoerna and the Lippo Group—were all owned by ethnic Chinese, with annual sales totaling Rp112 trillion (US$47 billion). When the crisis finally hit the country, the rupiah's plunge severely disrupted corporate operations. Numerous conglomerates lost a majority of <b>their</b> <b>assets</b> and collapsed. Over the next several years, other conglomerates struggled to repay international and domestic debts. Reforms introduced following 1998 were meant to steer the economy away from oligarchic arrangements established under the New Order; however, plans for reform proved too optimistic. When President B.J. Habibie announced in a 19 July 1998 interview with The Washington Post that Indonesia was not dependent on ethnic Chinese businessmen, the rupiah's value plunged 5 percent. This unexpected reaction prompted immediate changes in policies, and Habibie soon began enticing conglomerates for their support in the reform plans. Most were initially fearful of democratization, but the process of social demarginalization meant that the ethnic Chinese were regarded as equal members of society {{for the first time}} in the nation's history. Increased regional autonomy allowed surviving conglomerates to explore new opportunities in the outer provinces, and economic reforms created a freer market.|$|E
