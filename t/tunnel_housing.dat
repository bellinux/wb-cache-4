40|$|The {{accurate}} {{evaluation of}} heat transfer and film-cooling effectiveness plays {{a crucial role}} in the design of efficient turbomachines. Liquid crystal (LC) thermography is a reliable measurement tool to obtain detailed, full-field maps of surface temperature. In this paper, a steady-state LC technique was employed for measuring the film-cooling effectiveness of a turbine endwall. The experiments were performed in a blow-down type wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>housing</b> a large-scale high-pressure turbine blade cascade. The endwall regions immediately upstream and in a passage of the cascade featured discrete holes, arranged according to two different discrete-hole arrangements. Liquid crystal images and reconstructions of the adiabatic film-cooling effectiveness are provided for the Reynolds number (based on the chord length and the isentropic exit velocity) of 960000 and for the blowing ratios of 2. 5 and 3. Results for both discrete-hole configurations are presented and compared...|$|E

40|$|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratories has a need {{to review}} the costs of {{constructing}} the very long tunnels which would be required for housing the equipment for the proposed Very Large Hadron Collider (VLHC) project. Current tunneling costs are high, and the identification of potential means of significantly reducing them, and thereby helping to keep overall project costs within an acceptable budget, has assumed great importance. Fermilab has contracted with The Robbins Company to provide an up-to-date appraisal of tunneling technology, and to review the potential for substantially improving currently the state-of-practice performance and construction costs in particular. The Robbins Company was chosen for this task because of its long and successful experience in hard rock mechanical tunnel boring. In the past 40 years, Robbins has manufactured over 250 tunneling machines, the vast majority for hard rock applications. In addition to also supplying back-up equipment, Robbins has recently established a division dedicated to the manufacture of continuous conveying equipment for the efficient support of tunneling operations. The study extends beyond the tunnel boring machine (TBM) itself, and into the critical area of the logistics of {{the support of the}} machine as it advances, including manpower. It is restricted to proven methods using conventional technology, and its potential for incremental but meaningful improvement, rather than examining exotic and undeveloped means of rock excavation that have been proposed from time to time by the technical community. This is the first phase of what {{is expected to be a}} number of studies in increasing depth of technical detail, and as such has been restricted to the issues connected with the initial 34 kilometer circumference booster tunnel, and not the proposed 500 kilometer circumference <b>tunnel</b> <b>housing</b> the VLHC itself. The booster tunnel is entirely sited within low to medium strength limestone and dolomite formations, typical of the Chicago area. The rock is generally competent with widely spaced jointing, and slowdown of the operation for the installation of rock support is expected to be minimal. The tunneling system will have to be equipped with the necessary equipment for an efficient response to poor rock conditions however. Because the ground conditions are expected to be very favorable, a state-of-the-art TBM should have no difficulty in excavating at a high penetration rate of 10 meters per hour or more in rock of the average of the range of strengths stated to exist. Disc cutter changes will be few as the rock has very low abrasivity. However, experience has shown that overall tunneling rates are a relatively low percentage of the machine's penetration rate capability. Therefore the main focus of improvement is guaranteeing that the support systems, including mucking and advance of the utilities do not impede the operation. Improved mechanization of the support systems, along with automation where practicable to reduce manpower, is seen as the best means of raising the overall speed of the operation, and reducing its cost. The first phase of the study is mainly involved with establishing the baseline for current performance, and in identifying areas of improvement. It contains information on existing machine design concepts and provides data on many aspects of the mechanical tunneling process, including costs and labor requirements. While it contains suggestions for technical improvements of the various system, the time limitations of this phase have not permitted any detailed concept development. This should be a major part of the next phase...|$|E

40|$|Cowpea {{production}} is severely affected by environmental stress factors, particularly drought. More drought-tolerant crops are therefore urgently required for future improvement of food production in Mozambique. To increase high productivity and sustainability of cowpea {{there is a}} need to establish an active local breeding program, this should also include screening and characterisation of germplasm to select for more drought-tolerant cowpea landraces. This study has been therefore conducted in a temperature-controlled greenhouse at the University of Pretoria and in an open-sided <b>tunnel</b> <b>house</b> in Mozambique. The overall aim of the research work was to identify the most drought-tolerant cowpea landrace currently deposited in the Mozambican gene bank. Results of this study showed that tested Mozambican cowpea landraces have a different degree of drought tolerance with one Mozambican cowpea landrace, Timbawene moteado, better performing under drought conditions. In particular, plants of this landrace had more vigorous growth better overcoming a drought period with fast recovery and re-growth after drought exposure. Plants also maintained high rates of photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation when exposed to drought and used better assimilated carbon to generate biomass than the other tested cowpea landraces. Protein and chlorophyll degradation was further less affected and had only a slight increase in proteolytic activity under drought with the proline content significantly increasing under drought. In contrast, plants of the landrace Massava nhassenje were the most drought-sensitive plants with low water-use efficiency and low CO 2 assimilation as well as the lowest shoot biomass accumulation and high protease activity under drought. This study has overall demonstrated that the Mozambican cowpea germplasm deposited in the seed bank is diverse and contains characteristics that could be useful for a national breeding program. Shoot biomass, were thereby valuable traits which could be easily measured in Mozambique in a <b>tunnel</b> <b>house</b> experiment. This study might serve as a basis to screen a greater number of landraces to identify a greater number of landraces as useful additions in an active local cowpea breeding program.
