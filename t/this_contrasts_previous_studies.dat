In both conditions, they use limbs for thrust production. We attached animal-borne data loggers on green turtle and calculated the stroke frequency during swimming in water and crawling on land from surging acceleration.

Surface electromyographic activity was collected during the mini-squat for each instruction group and this was expressed as a percentage of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC).

Task-dependent asymmetries were not affected by the mode of target presentation and assessment of matching kinematics revealed differences in strategy for both the speed and smoothness of targeted movements.

The most stable conformation is similar to that found in related motors in that it has, overall, an anti-folded structure with the substituent at the stereogenic centre adopting an axial orientation. Photochemical cis/trans isomerisation at - 40 °C results in the formation of an isomer in a syn-folded conformation with the methyl group in an axial orientation. <b>This</b> <b>contrasts</b> with <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> on related molecular rotary motors. The conformation of the higher energy intermediate typically observed for this class of compound is the anti-folded conformation, in which the methyl group is in an equatorial orientation. This conformation is available through an energetically uphill upper half ring inversion of the observed photochemical product. However, this pathway competes with a second process that leads to the more stable anti-folded conformation in which the methyl group is oriented axially. It has been shown that the conformations and pathways available for second-generation molecular motors can be described by using similar overall geometries. Differences in the metastable high-energy species are attributable to the relative energy and position on the reaction coordinate of the transition states. Kinetic studies on these new molecular motors thus provide important insights into the conformational dynamics of the rotation cycle. ...|$|R

A single tau isoform is expressed in fetal human brain but six isoforms are expressed in adult human brain, with the fetal isoform corresponding to the shortest adult isoform.

In Alzheimer's disease, the six adult tau isoforms become hyperphosphorylated and form the paired helical filament (PHF), the major fibrous component of the neurofibrillary lesions. One way to identify phosphorylated sites in tau is to use antibodies that recognize phosphorylated residues within a specific amino acid sequence.

We use LandClim, a dynamic landscape vegetation model to simulate mountain forests under different temperature, soil and precipitation scenarios around Iffigsee (2065 m a. s. l.) a lake in the Northwestern Swiss Alps, and compare the model output with the paleobotanical records. The model clearly overestimates the upward shift of timberline in a climate scenario that applies chironomid-inferred July-temperature anomalies to all months. However, forest establishment at 9800 cal. BP at Iffigsee is successfully simulated with lower moisture availability and monthly temperatures corrected for stronger seasonality during the early Holocene. The model-data comparison reveals a contraction in the realized niche of Abies alba due to the prominent role of anthropogenic disturbance after ca. 5000 cal. BP, which has important implications for species distribution models (SDMs) that rely on equilibrium with climate and niche stability. Under future climate projections, LandClim indicates a rapid upward shift of mountain vegetation belts by ca. 500 m and treeline positions of ca. 2500 m a. s. l. by the end of this century.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Nectar spurs (tubular outgrowths of a floral organ which contain or give the {{appearance}} of containing nectar) are hypothesized to be a ‘key innovation’ which can lead to rapid speciation within a lineage, because they are involved in pollinator specificity. Despite the ecological importance of nectar spurs, relatively little is known about their development. We used a comparative approach to investigate variation in nectar spur length in a clade of eight Iberian toadflaxes. Methods Spur growth was measured at the macroscopic level over time in all eight species, and growth rate and growth duration compared. Evolution of growth rate was reconstructed across the phylogeny. Within the clade we then focused on Linaria becerrae and Linaria clementei, a pair of sister species which have extremely long and short spurs, respectively. Characterisation at a micromorphological level was performed across a range of key developmental stages to determine whether the difference in spur length is due to differential cell expansion or cell division. Key results We detected {{a significant difference in the}} evolved growth rates, while developmental timing of both the initiation and the end of spur growth remained similar. Cell number is 3 times higher in the long spurred Linaria becerrae compared to Linaria clementei, whereas cell length is only 1. 3 times greater. In addition, overall anisotropy of mature cells is not significantly different between the two species. Conclusions We found that changes in cell number and therefore in cell division largely explain evolution of spur length. <b>This</b> <b>contrasts</b> with <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> in Aquilegia which have found that variation in nectar spur length is due to directed cell expansion (anisotropy) over variable timeframes.

Various forms of bureaucratic friction resulted and several Civil Affairs approaches were used, before the model for the North West Europe campaign was agreed. Nevertheless, the organisation employed in Normandy was arguably the most extensive and best prepared of the war. However, it also had to deal with many different civilian problems and in trying military circumstances. Consequently, the battle is fertile ground for the examination of the extent and nature of the organisation’s operational utility. Using primary and secondary sources, this paper argues that Civil Affairs was militarily both useful and necessary. Furthermore, it was able to provide wider diplomatic and political benefits as well as serving core military needs. The research concludes by acknowledging that whilst mistakes were made, the various improvements made to Civil Affairs in preparation for, together with the lessons learnt during, Normandy stood the organisation in good stead for the significantly larger problems encountered later in the war.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{test for the}} {{existence}} of asset price bubbles in Latin America in the 19802001 period, focusing mainly on stock prices. Based on unit root and cointegration tests we cannot reject the hypothesis of bubbles. We arrive at the same conclusion using Froot and Obstfeld's intrinsic bubbles model. We identify periods of significant stock price overvaluation to examine empirical regularities of these bubble episodes in the region. We quantify the relative importance of different factors that determine the probability of bubble occurrence, focusing on the contrast between the country-specific variables and the common external factors. We included in the country-specific variables (a) both the level and the volatility of domestic credit growth, (b) the volatility of asset returns, (c) capital flows to each country, and (d) the terms of trade. As common external variables, we considered (a) the degree of asset overvaluation in the stock market and the real estate market in the U. S., and (b) the term spread of U. S. Treasury securities. To quantitatively assess the relative importance of each factor, we estimated a Logit model for a panel of five Latin American countries from 1985 to 2001. In general, we found that the marginal probabilities of both common and country-specific variables were roughly of the same order of magnitude. <b>This</b> <b>contrasts</b> with <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> that found that real asset returns in Latin America were dominated by local factors. Finally we explore the main channels through which asset prices affect real economic activity, with the most important being the balance-sheet effect and its impact on bank lending. We show how the allocation of bank lending across different sectors responded sensitively to real estate prices during the boom years in co [...] ...|$|R

The task of keeping 70, 000 international volunteers motivated over a long time frame, whilst not providing any financial incentive, was a huge risk and investment yet the response from athletes, media and the general public when the Games ended was that the Games Makers were the {{a vital part of the}} success of London 2012. This study shows how the initial stages of the volunteer programme suggest that even though the author was pre-selected, the generic training, primary knowledge exchange and pre-Games engagement were potential de-motivators. It was only once that the role-specific and venue training was undertaken, that the volunteer enthusiasm returned. This study follows a personal journey of one such volunteer. The paper modifies Bang and Chelladurai’s original motivational pull theory, by arguing through an auto-ethnographic study, that motivations will change over the timescale of the volunteer experience and involvement. It does <b>this</b> in <b>contrast</b> to <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> that have favoured quantitative methods, with data collected at one point in time as opposed to this study which captures motivation over a 24 month period...|$|R
40|$|The {{outcome of}} {{hybridization}} can be impacted by environmental conditions, which themselves {{can contribute to}} reproductive isolation between taxa. In crosses of genetically divergent populations, hybridization can have both negative and positive impacts on fitness, the balance between which might be tipped by changes in the environment. Genetically divergent populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus {{have been shown to}} differ in thermal tolerance at high temperatures along a latitudinal gradient. In this study, a series of crosses were made between pairs of genetically divergent populations of T. californicus, and the thermal tolerance of these hybrids was tested. In most cases, the first-generation hybrids had relatively high thermal tolerance and the second-generation hybrids were not generally reduced below the less-tolerant parental population for high temperature tolerance. <b>This</b> pattern <b>contrasts</b> with <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> from crosses of genetically divergent populations of this copepod, which often shows hybrid breakdown in these second-generation hybrids for other measures of fitness. These results suggest that high temperature stress could either increase the positive impacts of hybridization or decrease the negative impacts of hybridization resulting in lowered hybrid breakdown in these population crosses. Key words: heterosis, hybridization, outbreeding depression, postzygotic reproductive isolation, thermal adaptation The hybridization of genetically divergent lineages can resul...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis {{is the impact of}} {{business}} groups on company performance and the evolution of market structure in Russia. Business groups’ control of a large share of industry is a distinguishing and controversial characteristic of the Russian transition. This thesis contributes to the quantitative analysis of the economic impact of Russian business groups. The first chapter analyses the gap between control and ownership in Russian companies. We find {{a significant difference in the}} size and structure of the total gap compared to the component resulting from the use of pyramidal ownership structures. Our results suggest that standard estimators that account only for the pyramidal effect might be biased by the presence of endogeneity and measurement error problems. The second chapter examines the impact of business groups on company performance. In a majority of specifications, including the use of instrumental variables, we find that business groups have a consistently insignificant impact on the productivity growth of companies they control. <b>This</b> conclusion <b>contrasts</b> with <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> of the impact of Russian business groups on firm performance. The third chapter tests the applicability of Sutton’s sunk costs theory of market concentration to Russian industries. Our results are consistent with Sutton’s theoretical predictions that concentration in industries with endogenous sunk costs does not decrease with market size.

40|$|Crested {{penguins}} (genus Eudyptes) have {{a peculiar}} hatching pattern, with the first-laid egg (A-egg) hatching after the second-laid egg (B-egg) and chicks from A-eggs typically having {{a much lower}} survival probability. Maternal yolk androgens have been suggested {{to contribute to the}} competitive superiority of the B-chick in southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome, given their important role in mediating sibling competition in other species. We therefore increased the yolk androgen levels in freshly-laid eggs and examined the consequences for sibling competition - via effects on embryonic developmental times, chick growth and early survival. We placed one androgen-treated egg and one control egg into each foster nest, matching them for mass, laying date and laying order. The androgen treatment did not significantly affect embryonic developmental times or chick measurements at hatching. However, elevated yolk androgen levels benefitted chick growth in interaction with the number of siblings in a brood. Chicks from androgen-treated eggs had faster growth {{in the presence of a}} sibling than chicks from control eggs. Under these circumstances they also had a higher survival probability. Thus maternal androgens appear to reinforce the observed hatching pattern, facilitating brood reduction. <b>This</b> <b>contrasts</b> to most <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> in other species where yolk androgens have been shown to compensate for the negative consequences of delayed hatching within the brood hierarchy. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{highlights}} the importance of considering how seasonality of rainfall affects availability of resources and consequently species distributions within tropical ecosystems. The endangered northern bettong, Bettongia tropica Wakefield is thought to be restricted to habitats where seasonal availability of hypogeous fungi, their principal food resource, remains high. To test this hypothesis fungal abundance was quantified in the early wet, late wet, early dry and late dry seasons within known bettong habitat. A relationship was found between precipitation and fungal availability, with the abundance of hypogeous fungi being significantly lower in the late dry season. Fungal availability correlated strongly with the seasonal rainfall pattern determined from 74 -year monthly means. <b>This</b> <b>contrasts</b> with a <b>previous</b> <b>study</b> where mycophagy, measured by faecal analysis, remained high across seasons presumably because of aseasonal rainfall during that study period. Alloteropsis semialata R. Br. (cockatoo grass) use by bettongs increased significantly during the period of low fungal availability. This suggests that the importance of cockatoo grass as an alternative food resource during annual and extended dry periods has previously been underestimated. With the frequency and intensity of drought expected to increase with global climate change, these findings have significant implications for bettong management. The important and possibly equivalent dependence of B. tropica on both hypogeous fungi and A. semialata helps to explain their habitat preference and identifies this species as a true ecotonal specialist...|$|R
