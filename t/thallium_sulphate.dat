50|$|Recipe for Murder is a 52-minute Australian TV {{docudrama}} film {{released in}} May 2011. It recounts {{some of the}} history of a series of murders in post-World War II Sydney by women using <b>thallium</b> <b>sulphate</b> poisons. It was written and directed by Sonia Bible, produced by Susan Lambert and narrated by Dan Wyllie.|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, in {{the early}} 1950s, there was a notable spate of cases of murder or {{attempted}} murder by thallium poisoning. At this time, due to the chronic rat infestation problems in overcrowded inner-city suburbs (notably in Sydney), and thallium's effectiveness as a rat poison, it was still readily available over the counter in New South Wales, where <b>thallium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was marketed as a commercial rat bait, under the brand [...] "Thall-rat".|$|E
50|$|The active {{compound}} in this rat poison was <b>thallium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> imported from Germany. Its advantages as a rodenticide, {{that it was}} odorless and practically tasteless and swift acting, were also realised by amateur poisoners; it was also inexpensive, required no licence to purchase, gave symptoms similar to known diseases, and one gram was sufficient to despatch an unwanted spouse. Its one disadvantage in this application was {{that it did not}} degrade, and could easily be detected many years post mortem. After a spate of such murders in the 1950s, given due prominence in the Australian press, and the exhumation of more suspected victims, its ready sale was prohibited.|$|E
50|$|The {{crimes of}} three murderesses, Yvonne Fletcher, Caroline Grills and Veronica Monty are {{examined}} {{in the context of}} a wave of dozens of thallium poisonings that took place in Sydney in the period 1947-1953. The events are related to post-war poverty and social stresses, and to the ready availability of <b>thallium</b> <b>sulphate</b> rodenticides (rat poisons) which could be easily administered to humans in food and drink, being virtually tasteless and odourless. The three were convicted and imprisoned, but the documentary suggests that many more murders by other persons could have remained undetected. As a result of these events, the Australian states began to ban unrestricted availability of thallium in 1952.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the single-dose poison treatments of farm rat infestations, analysed by comparing the weights of the post-treatment census bait takes in covariance with the weights of the prebait takes, showed that treatments with 2 - 5 % zinc phosphide, 0 - 3 % <b>thallium</b> <b>sulphate</b> or 0 - 3 % gophacide were equally effective and significantly better than were treatments with 1 % zinc phosphide or 0 - 1 % <b>thallium</b> <b>sulphate.</b> The methodology and sensitivity of different analyses are also considered...|$|E
40|$|Shortly {{after the}} passage of the Federal Insecticide Act of 1910, mammal control specialists in the Bureau of Biological Survey began to {{consider}} a similar law to cover the chemicals with which they were concerned. Work on the project went slowly and spasmodically, but reached the point of having a Federal Rodenticide Act available for study and possible revision in 1928. At this time, the mammal control chemicals in use were limited to strychnine [...] alkaloid and sulphate-arsenic, barium carbonate, <b>thallium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> phosphorus, sodium and calcium cyanide, carbon disulphide, and red squill. Strychnine alkaloid was about the only predatory animal control agent, while the alkaloid and <b>thallium</b> <b>sulphate</b> dominated field rodent formulas, and calcium cyanide and carbon disulphide were the only burrow fumigants. That left strychnine sulphate, arsenic, barium carbonate, <b>thallium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> phosphorus, and red squill for rat and mouse control agents. This was not a long list, but it was long enough to have raised many problems...|$|E
40|$|Common {{methods for}} mole control are baiting with {{earthworms}} impregnated with <b>thallium</b> <b>sulphate</b> or strychnine, gassing with pellets developing phosphine, and trapping. Seasonal cycles in burrowing activity {{make it difficult}} to evaluate results of expensive control campaigns and may give a false impression of efficiency...|$|E
40|$|International audience"Monsmedite" was {{described}} {{half a century}} ago as a new potassium <b>thallium</b> <b>sulphate</b> mineral occurring in Baia Sprie, Romania. It was reported to occur as very dark green, morphologically cubic crystals with idealized formula Tl 2 O 3. K 2 O. 8 SO 3. 15 H 2 O. Many of the data published are close to those of usual voltaite, but the chemical composition and the measured density are clearly different. Up to now, all samples labelled "monsmedite" in mineral collections (including a co-type specimen of "monsmedite") proved to be usual voltaite with only very minor amounts of thallium. On this basis, and because the original "monsmedite" sample has gone lost, the Commission on New Minerals and Minerals Names of IMA decided to discredit "monsmedite" as a new mineral and to recommend that the name should be reserved for a possible find of a specimen that fulfills the description and chemical composition of "monsmedite"...|$|E
40|$|Thallium is a {{heavy metal}} whose salts are used in some rodent poisons and in the {{manufacture}} of optical lenses, semiconductors, scintillation counters, low temperature thermometers, and switching devices, green coloured fireworks, and imitation jewelery, and as chemical catalysts. In clinical practice thallium isotopes are used in cardiac scanning, but the use of thallium salts to treat scalp ringworm was abandoned earlier this century because of their toxicity. The sale of thallium in Britain is strictly licensed because of its toxicity and potential for use in murder, which is helped by the fact that thallous salts are colourless, tasteless, and odorless. The more water soluble salts (such as <b>thallium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> acetate, or carbonate) have higher toxicity, and although the toxic dose is variable most deaths occur after the ingestion of 10 - 15 mg/kg of soluble salt. Most cases of thallium toxicity occur after oral ingestion but severe toxicity has been reported after inhalation of contaminated dust from pyrite burners, in zinc and lead smelting, and {{in the manufacture of}} cadmium, after dermal absorption through protective rubber gloves, and after snorting what was thought to be cocaine. The elimination half time of thallium is between 1. 7 and 30 days depending on the time since, and chronicity of, ingestion. The elimination time phases are apparent and because of the long terminal elimination half time thallium may act as a cumulative poison. We present two cases of thallium poisoning with intent to kill...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to bring you up-to-date {{on the progress of}} various winter starling control projects conducted by our Bureau on feedlots in Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon. This report briefly covers the field work accomplished since that reported by the late Mr. H. Nelson Elliott in his paper delivered to the second meeting of your conference held in Anaheim, California, in March 1964. Prior to the winter of 1960 - 61 we experienced a tremendous build-up of starling populations in feedlot situations throughout the Pacific Northwest. The expanding livestock feeding industry was receiving great economic losses from starlings eating livestock feed and fouling additional feed and water. Conventional measures such as hazing and shooting were ineffective in protecting the feed yards. It was evident to this Bureau that means and measures had to be found to reduce starling numbers in feedlot situations. Due to starling build-ups an intensive experimental control project under field conditions was undertaken in Idaho in the winter of 1960 - 61. The experimental research was under the leadership of biologists of the Bureau 2 ̆ 7 s Denver Wildlife Research Center. The field operations were made possible through financial participation of the Idaho Cattle Feeders and the Idaho Department of Agriculture. Various control techniques were utilized and a summary of these is contained in Mr. H. Nelson Elliott 2 ̆ 7 s presentation to the Second Vertebrate Pest Control Conference. He also reported that the use of <b>thallium</b> <b>sulphate</b> baiting had reduced starling damage in feedlots, but the Bureau did not anticipate registration of thallium for bird control and that further emphasis would be placed on the development of more selective lethal agents...|$|E
