25|$|Graphite {{electrodes}} {{carry the}} electricity that melts scrap iron and steel, and sometimes direct-reduced iron (DRI), in electric arc furnaces, {{which are the}} vast majority of steel furnaces. They are made from petroleum coke after it is mixed with coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch.</b> They are then extruded and shaped, baked to carbonize the binder (pitch), and finally graphitized by heating it to temperatures approaching 3000°C, at which the carbon atoms arrange into graphite. They can vary in size up to 11feet long and 30 inches in diameter. An increasing proportion of global steel is made using electric arc furnaces, and the electric arc furnace itself is getting more efficient, making more steel per tonne of electrode. An estimate based on USGS data indicates that graphite electrode consumption was 197,000 tonnes in 2005.|$|E
500|$|Solar {{urticaria}} is an immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity {{that can}} be introduced through primary or secondary factors, or induced by exogenous photosensitization. Primary SU {{is believed to be}} a type I hypersensitivity (a mild to severe reaction to an antigen including anaphylaxis) in which an antigen, or substance provoking an immune response, is [...] "induced by UV or visible radiation." [...] Secondary SU can occur when a person comes into contact with chemicals such as <b>tar,</b> <b>pitch,</b> and dyes. People who use drugs such as benoxaprofen or patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria may also contract this secondary form. These items that cause this photosensitivity are exogenous photosensitizers because they are outside of the body and cause it to have a greater sensitivity to light.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{etymology}} of {{the nickname}} is unknown, but most folklore believe its roots {{come from the}} fact that <b>tar,</b> <b>pitch,</b> and turpentine created from the vast pine forests were some of North Carolina's most important exports early in the state's history. For a time after the American Civil War, the name Tar Heel was derogatory, but it was later reappropriated by the people of North Carolina. [...] Because the exact history of the term is unknown, a number of legends have developed to explain it. One such legend claims it to be a nickname given during the U.S. Civil War, because of the state's importance on the Confederate side, {{and the fact that the}} troops [...] "stuck to their ranks like they had tar on their heels". [...] The term [...] "Tar Heel" [...] gained popularity during the Civil War.|$|E

40|$|Activated carbon fibres (ACFs) {{have been}} {{successfully}} prepared with a remarkable development of porosity from four isotropic coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitches</b> and four isotropic petroleum pitches. Special care has been put to make the activation process at similar activation rate {{in order to have}} a better comparison of the different precursors used. The micropore volumes of petroleum pitches-derived ACFs are higher than those obtained from coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitches</b> under similar activation yields. The resultant ACFs present interesting textural properties: they are essentially microporous materials, with a high adsorption capacity which increases linearly with the burn-off. It has been observed, independently of the pitch precursor used, that the micropore volume is a function of the degree of activation, being, in all the cases, quite similar for a given activation degree if a comprehensive weight loss is considered (carbonization lost and degree of activation).

2500|$|The {{cultivated}} {{productions of}} the Mountain section are sweet corn, wheat, oats, barley, hay, tobacco, fruits and vegetables. [...] Cattle are also reared quite extensively for market, and {{large numbers of}} chickens are raised for market in the northwestern mountains and foothills. A prominent new industry in the mountains is the raising and selling of Christmas Trees. In the Piedmont region of central North Carolina are found all {{the products of the}} mountains, although over the southern half cotton appears as the staple product. [...] In the deep, loamy soils of the coastal region, cotton, corn, and oats are the staple crops, and truck farming (growing fruits and vegetables for northern markets), constitutes a flourishing industry. [...] Formerly longleaf pine forests produced <b>tar,</b> <b>pitch</b> and turpentine, and more recently lumber. Little old growth longleaf area is left; much has been replanted in loblolly pine, which is used for paper pulp, plywood, and lumber. Four of the grape varieties of America are native to North Carolina; the Catawba, Isabella, Lincoln, and Scuppernong.|$|E

"Something beyond that, let me hope, my good Master Tressilian," [...] {{replied the}} artist; [...] "and yet to say truth, our {{practice}} was of an adventurous description, and the pharmacy which I had acquired {{in my first}} studies {{for the benefit of}} horses was frequently applied to our human patients. But the seeds of all maladies are the same; and if turpentine, <b>tar,</b> <b>pitch,</b> and beef-suet, mingled with turmerick, gum-mastick, and one bead of garlick, can cure the horse that hath been grieved with a nail, I see not but what it may benefit the man that hath been pricked with a sword. But my master's practice, as well as his skill, went far beyond mine, and dealt in more dangerous concerns. He was not only a bold, adventurous practitioner in physic, but also, if your pleasure so chanced to be, an adept who read the stars, and expounded the fortunes of mankind, genethliacally, as he called it, or otherwise. He was a learned distiller of simples, and a profound chemist--made several efforts to fix mercury, and judged himself to have made a fair hit at the philosopher's stone. I have yet a programme of his on that subject, which, if your honour understandeth, I believe you have the better, not only of all who read, but also of him who wrote it." ...|$|E

25|$|Kiln roofs, {{where the}} kiln was external, were {{generally}} built of a timber frame {{and covered in}} either peg tiles or slate. Some oasts had conical kiln roofs built of brick, these were covered in <b>tar</b> or <b>pitch</b> to keep them weatherproof. A few oasts had square kilns with brick roofs, again covered in <b>tar</b> or <b>pitch.</b> The top of the roof was open, and carried a cowl or louvred vent.|$|R
50|$|The heating (dry distilling) of wood causes <b>tar</b> and <b>pitch</b> to drip {{away from}} the wood and leave behind charcoal. Birchbark is used to make birch-tar, a {{particularly}} fine tar. The terms <b>tar</b> and <b>pitch</b> are often used interchangeably. However, pitch is considered more solid, while tar is more liquid. Traditionally, pitch that was used for waterproofing buckets, barrels and small boats was drawn from pine. It is used to make Cutler's resin.|$|R
50|$|People can {{be exposed}} to coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitch</b> {{volatiles}} in the workplace by breathing them in, skin contact, or eye contact.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1 mg/m3 cyclohexane-extractable fraction over an 8-hour workday.

50|$|The {{corporation}} {{is divided into}} three business units: Carbon and Chemicals, Railroad Products and Services, and Performance Chemicals. The company specialises in manufacturing carbon chemicals from coal tar. The five main chemicals that are produced are coal pitch for steel and aluminum production, carbon black for rubber vulcanization, creosote for wood treatment, and naphthalene and phthalic anhydride for plastics and polyester. Kopper's coal <b>tar</b> <b>pitches</b> are essential to manufacturing carbon anodes for aluminum smelting. Koppers also has extensive operations making creosote treated wood products, especially railroad ties and switches. Utility poles, foundations, decking materials, and wooden panneling are also produced by the company.|$|R
