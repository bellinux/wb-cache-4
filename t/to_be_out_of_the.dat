5|$|Richard {{probably}} gave York to Geoffrey in {{the hope}} of forcing him to become a full priest, and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne. Richard also required Geoffrey to swear that he would remain outside England for three years during the time Richard expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country on crusade. The king subsequently released Geoffrey from the oath, the initial swearing of which was apparently another of Richard's efforts to keep Geoffrey's possible ambitions towards the English throne in check. But the cathedral chapter at York disputed Geoffrey's appointment, claiming that because the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, and some others of the chapter had not been present, the election was invalid. Walter's election to York was supported by Richard's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom a chronicler claimed hated Geoffrey as the product of one of her husband's affairs. Richard consequently retained his control over the estates of the archbishopric, and did not confirm the election until a council held at Pipewell on 16September. At that council Richard also appointed three men to offices within the diocese of York: he made Henry Marshal the dean; Burchard du Puiset, a relative of Hugh du Puiset, became treasurer; and Roger of London the abbot of Selby Abbey. Geoffrey objected to these appointments, and as a result his estates were confiscated by the king until he submitted and became a priest. The historians Ralph Turner and Richard Heiser speculate that Richard's strategy in making these appointments was to keep Geoffrey distracted by problems within his diocese, and thus unable to challenge for the English throne. The two historians also suggest that Richard may have been making an example of Geoffrey, in a demonstration that he could be harsh even with his own relatives.|$|E

25|$|Truffaut {{would often}} stay {{with friends and}} try <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house as much as possible. His best friend {{throughout}} his youth and until his death was Robert Lachenay, who was {{the inspiration for the}} character René Bigey in The 400 Blows and would work as an assistant on some of Truffaut's films. It was the cinema that offered him the greatest escape from an unsatisfying home life. He was eight years old when he saw his first movie, Abel Gance's Paradis Perdu (Paradise Lost) from 1939. It was there that his obsession began. He frequently played truant from school and would sneak into theaters because he didn't have enough money for admission. After being expelled from several schools, at the age of fourteen he decided to become self-taught. Two of his academic goals were to watch three movies a day and read three books a week.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a theory}} that vinyl records can audibly {{represent}} higher frequencies than compact discs. According to Red Book specifications, the compact disc has a frequency response of 20Hz up to 22,050Hz, and most CD players measure flat within {{a fraction of a}} decibel from at least 20Hz to 20kHz at full output. Turntable rumble obscures the low-end limit of vinyl but the upper end can be, with some cartridges, reasonably flat within a few decibels to 30kHz, with gentle roll-off. Carrier signals of Quad LPs popular in the 1970s were at 30kHz <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range of human hearing. The average human auditory system is sensitive to frequencies from 20Hz to a maximum of around 20,000Hz. The upper and lower frequency limits of human hearing vary per person. High frequency sensitivity decreases as a person ages, a process called presbycusis. By contrast, hearing damage from loud noise exposure typically makes it more difficult to hear lower frequencies, such as three kHz through six kHz.|$|E
25|$|At Backlash, the {{original}} main event match was between Chris Benoit and Shawn Michaels for the World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picture, as the annual WWE Draft took place eight days after WrestleMania {{and he was}} drafted to SmackDown. Almost immediately after the draft, the dethroned champion was traded back to Raw, and on March 29 he demanded that the intended match at Backlash be changed to Benoit and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff {{liked the idea of}} the match, but concluded with adding that he made a promise to Michaels for granting him a World title match at Backlash. To solve this, Bischoff booked a return Triple Threat match to serve as the main event for Backlash. Benoit emerged victorious by submission for the second consecutive pay-per-view, this time forcing Michaels to submit to a Sharpshooter. Benoit went on to hold the title until August 2004, losing it to Randy Orton at SummerSlam.|$|E

25|$|Grobbelaar's {{early days}} as No.1 were strewn with errors and the Reds {{struggled}} to obtain {{any sort of}} consistency, Grobbelaar {{taking a lot of}} the blame. By the end of the calendar year Liverpool were mid table in the league and looked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> running for title honours, especially as they had just lost to Manchester City 3–1 at Anfield in the Boxing Day fixture – a defeat which put John Bond's team top of the league. The New Year brought a new momentum as Bob Paisley began to get the best out of his players; they began the year in South Wales visiting the Vetch Field to play Swansea City in the FA Cup, Liverpool were in fine form and thumped their hosts 4–0. This set them on their way in the league and dropped just seven of the 50 available points overhauling the points gap that Ipswich Town had opened on them.|$|E
25|$|A one-year {{period of}} {{mourning}} {{for the late}} Chief ended on 13 May 2005, with the close {{of a series of}} ceremonies that started on the 9th. Those who had been observing mourning rituals symbolically changed from black clothes into their normal attire. (Members of the Mara family, however, said that they would continue to wear black for a further three months, until the period of mourning for his wife, Adi Lala, is over). Many thousands of people arrived in the chiefly village of Tubou on the island of Lakeba {{to take part in the}} vakataraisulu ritual, which lifted taboos in place for the Mara family and the people of the Lau Islands. Mara's son, Ratu Finau Mara, who is widely expected to be named his successor as Tui Nayau, or Paramount Chief of the Lau Islands, was expected to participate in the vakataraisulu at the request of elders from Tubou and Levuka, but for undisclosed reasons, remained in Suva. In 2004, he had attended his father's state funeral in Suva but not his private funeral in Lakeba.

25|$|On USC's next possession, Leinart {{drove his}} team into Texas territory, {{this time to}} the 25-yard line, before {{throwing}} an interception to Texas free safety Michael Griffin, who appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play but ran halfway across the field before making a leaping catch and barely staying in-bounds in the end zone. The turnover ended a second Trojans' drive with USC in scoring position. On the following Texas drive, Young connected with wide receiver Limas Sweed, who caught eight balls for 65yards on the day, for a key first down. Young then led his team with his legs, capping the drive by running 10yards before throwing a lateral pass to open running back Selvin Young, who ran for 12 more for the touchdown. The lateral, made after Young's knee had touched the ground, was not reviewed because of issues with the replay equipment. The game continued with a failed extra-point attempt by Texas, which, not knowing of the equipment issues, appeared to rush the kick to get the play off before the prior play could be reviewed. The NCAA football-officiating coordinator later asserted that Young's knee had been down, and expressed confusion about how the call had been handled.|$|E

25|$|With star players, Landry Jones, Ryan Broyles, and Travis Lewis {{coming back}} for the 2011 season, there were high {{expectations}} for Bob Stoops and his Sooner football team. Stoops hired former Sooners quarterback Josh Heupel as offensive coordinator to replace the departed Wilson. OU began the season ranked #1 in both the AP and Coaches polls. The Sooners became the first teams {{to reach the top}} ranking in the Associated Press poll 100 times since the poll began in 1936. Under Stoops, OU has been ranked No. 1 more weeks than they have not been ranked in the top 25. They were able to accomplish this feat without even stepping foot on the field, as they had their bye week this weekend. Their early season match-up with fellow top five team Florida State proved to test the Sooners, as they looked to prove that their #1 ranking was warranted. As the Sooners played well the first few weeks the Sooners were thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Title race with a heartbreaking loss to the unranked Texas Tech Red Raiders snapping a school-record 39game home win streak. However, the Sooners bounced back the following. few weeks to become ranked fifth in the country despite losing star receiver Ryan Broyles only to lose to Baylor {{for the first time in}} school history. They stayed in the hunt for a share of the conference title and a Fiesta Bowl appearance until losing to in-state rival Oklahoma State in the last game of the season. They finished the regular season 9–3 and went on to defeat Iowa 31-14 in the Insight Bowl.|$|E

Cope was much less well-off, having spent most of his money purchasing The American Naturalist, and had a hard time finding employment thanks to Marsh's allies in higher education and his own temperament. Cope began investing in gold and silver prospects in the West, and braved malarial mosquitos and harsh weather to search for fossils himself. Due to setbacks in mining and a lack of support from the federal government, Cope's financial situation steadily deteriorated, to the point that his fossil collection was his only significant asset. Marsh, meanwhile, alienated even his loyal assistants, including Williston, with his refusal to share his conclusions drawn from their findings, and his continually lax and infrequent payment schedule.|$|E

The British newspaper The Independent reported that Blair's visit to the United States was a coincidence, and not an attempt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom when the book was published. When Blair arrived for his first book signing at a leading bookshop on O'Connell Street, Dublin on 4 September, demonstrators heckled, jeered and threw eggs and shoes at him. One activist posed as a purchaser to attempt a citizen's arrest of Blair for war crimes. Protestors clashed with Irish police and tried to push over a security barrier outside the shop. The demonstrators—anti-war protestors and Irish republicans opposed to the peace process—called queuing customers [...] "traitors" [...] and [...] "West Brits".
