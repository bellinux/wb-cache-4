5|$|Rome {{typically}} employed four legions each year, each {{consisting of}} 4,000 foot soldiers and 200 cavalry. Perceiving the Carthaginian army {{as a real}} threat, {{for the first time}} ever the Senate introduced eight legions, each consisting of 5,000 foot soldiers and 300 cavalry, with allied troops numbering the same amount of foot soldiers but 900 cavalry per legion-- more than triple the legion numbers. Eight legions--some 40,000 Roman soldiers and an estimated 2,400 cavalry--formed <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> massive new army. However, some have suggested that the destruction of an army of 90,000 troops would be impossible. They argue that Rome probably had 48,000 troops and 6,000 cavalry against Hannibal's 35,000 troops and 10,000 cavalry. Livy quotes one source stating the Romans added only 10,000 men to their usual army. While no definitive number of Roman troops exists, all sources agree that the Carthaginians faced a considerably larger foe.|$|E
5|$|The Command was too {{expensive}} to maintain and cost cuts were made during the 1950s which caused a reduction in strength. By mid-1957 the Command had been cut to 82 aircraft. By mid-1958 it had shrunk to just 67. The Shackletons dominated <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> force, numbering 54 aircraft. The Neptune was cut from the service altogether, beginning on 31 August 1956. There was little operational action for the Command at this point. It airlifted British Army forces into Egypt during the Suez Crisis which was its major action during this period. The lack of funds and any active conventional military role saw the Command struggle to keep its front-line strength high. There was a brief alert in October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when all six squadrons it then possessed were put on high alert, but nothing came of the crisis, although the Shackleton squadrons at RAF Ballykelly were sent to Macrihanish as it was known that Ballykelly was on the Soviet IRBM target list.|$|E

The main objective of the game is to collect the correct circuits and return them to their respective locations before the starship reaches its destination. The circuits are variously shaped as cubes, pyramids, domes or cylinders.|$|E
5|$|The term anekāntavāda is {{not found}} in early texts {{considered}} canonical by Shwetambara tradition of Jainism (denied by Digambara tradition as canonical). However, traces of the doctrines are found in comments of Mahavira in these Shwetambara texts, where he states that the finite and infinite depends on one's perspective.

500|$|In October, Sir John Moore led {{the army}} into Spain, {{reaching}} {{as far as}} Salamanca. In December, they were reinforced by 10,000 troops from England, including the '1st Flank Brigade', which consisted of 1/52nd, 1/43rd and 1/95th and led by Robert Craufurd. Moore's army now totalled 25,000, but his advance was cut short by the news that Napoleon had defeated the Spanish, held Madrid, and was approaching with an army of 200,000. Moore turned his men, and retreated to Corunna, over mountain roads and through bitter winter weather. French cavalry pursued the British Army {{the length of the}} journey, and a Reserve Division was set up to provide rearguard protection for the British troops. <b>The</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> Reserve, commanded by Edward Paget, consisted of the 1/52nd and 1/95th battalions, who displayed none of the ill-discipline which plagued other regiments during the retreat, but [...] "made a stand at every defile and riverline, buying time {{for the rest of the}} army to get away." [...] Following the secondment of the 1/52nd and 1/95th to the Reserve, Craufurd's 1st Flank Brigade was reformed, and comprised the 1/43rd, 2/52nd and 2/95th. The 1st Flank Brigade deployed with the Reserve for a time, protecting the crossing of the river Esla near Benavente, before it separated from the Reserve and the main army and marched to Vigo, with over 4,000 other troops, for eventual transportation to England. The 1/52nd remained with the main army, which was caught by the French at Corunna. During the ensuing battle, in January 1809, Moore was killed; the army, including the 1/52nd, were evacuated to England.|$|E
