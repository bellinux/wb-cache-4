40|$|This article {{addresses}} large {{punitive damages}} awards that juries have granted to plaintiffs in recent cases against the tobacco industry, and demonstrates why such high awards are a warranted and necessary {{incentive for the}} companies to change their dangerous course of conduct. In State Farm v. Campbell, the United States Supreme Court announced that “few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages” will be constitutional. In a subsequent smoking and health case brought against Philip Morris, however, a state appeals court allowed a punitive damages award that was almost 97 times the compensatory damages award. This decision {{was based on a}} finding that Philip Morris’s conduct was particularly reprehensible. Furthermore, internal tobacco industry documents reveal that the industry knowingly has used its enormous wealth to make it exceedingly difficult for potential plaintiffs to find lawyers, and nearly impossible for those <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> maintain their cases. The industry thus has been able to evade large judgments against it and to maintain its “refuse to settle” policy. This article, therefore, proposes that when a smoking and health plaintiff is successful at trial, the tobacco industry should be subject to a high punitive damages award because: 1) the industry’s behavior is particularly reprehensible; 2) the industry has used its wealth to engage in litigation tactics that have allowed it to evade capture; and 3) a powerful financial sanction is needed to deter lethal misbehavior when the defendant makes billions of dollars addicting consumers to its deadly product...|$|E

At last the small and middle entrepreneur need a institution that give their loan capital. The institution is cooperation and wich one is BMT or syariah cooperation, Widiyanto (2000 : 96). Cooperation is a effort together to increase and to help economic funded. To help be support to give service based on “one for all and all for one”, Drs. M. Hatta in Sitio and Tamba (2001 : 17).

40|$|After {{the last}} European Union {{expansion}} the east European countries became {{members of the}} European Union. This meant that they would become apart of the Schengen agreement {{and that they would}} be able to travel, live and work anywhere in Europe. This came as a shock to the Scandinavian trade unions that were worried that work migration would escalate, and that it would lead to social dumping, which would make the working conditions worse for the native workers.. The Swedish labour market is build up by the principal of negotiations. The evolution of the labour laws comes from the rules and regulations of collective agreements. The Lex Britannia principal was made to regulate the working conditions for guest workers in Sweden, by making it possible for trade unions to take industrial action against foreign companies to make them sign a Swedish collective agreement. Even though Swedish labour law includes an obligation to maintain industrial peace it is not valid for foreign companies. In the Laval- case the European court of justice judge that the Lex Britannia principles is not consistent with EC- law and that the Swedish labour law violate the principles of free movement and the posting of workers directive. By comparing the Swedish labour laws and regulations on collective agreements, laws and regulations on remuneration to the Latvian labour laws and regulations on collective agreements and laws and regulations on remuneration, the study have shown that the countries have a lot in common at the same time they differ quite allot. The similarities may in many cases be an effect of the common EC- laws and regulations. The conclusion came to be <b>that</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> its history of forming and develop the rules and regulations of the Swedish labour market the Swedish trade unions have a strong position in the Swedish labour market. The Swedish labour market may therefore show tendencies of protectionism at the same time that the young labour market, the young labour laws and weak trade unions of Latvia shows tendencies of social dumping...|$|E
