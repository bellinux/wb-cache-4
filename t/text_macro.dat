40|$|BACKGROUND: Keyboard entry or {{correction}} of reports by radiologists and transcriptionists remains necessary in many settings despite advances in computerized speech recognition. PURPOSE: To develop and test a report entry system that implements an automated phrase completion feature based on language modeling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a special text editor that uses context {{to predict the}} full word or phrase being typed, updating the displayed prediction after each keystroke. At any point, pressing the tab key inserts the predicted phrase without having to type the phrase's remaining characters. Successive words of the phrase are predicted by a trigram language model trained {{on a set of}} general radiography reports consecutively generated by the first author. Phrase lengths are chosen to minimize the expected number of keystrokes as predicted by the language model. Performance was tested on 200 randomly selected reports outside of the training set. RESULTS: The language model was trained on 36, 843 reports containing 1. 48 million words. When applied to the 200 test reports, the phrase completion technique reduced the average number of keystrokes per report from 194 to 58, with the average reduction factor being 3. 3 (geometric mean; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 2 [...] 3. 5), a statistically significant reduction (P < 0. 00005). CONCLUSION: An algorithm for minimizing the expected number of keystrokes with userspecific language modeling significantly reduces the keystrokes required to generate a radiography report. Operation is highly and automatically customized to each user without the burden of creating and memorizing a complex system of <b>text</b> <b>macros.</b> Summary Statement Language modeling, a technology found in many computerized speech recognition systems, can also be us [...] ...|$|R

Three types of data were collected: screen captured writing sessions, instructor comments, and participant interviews. The data was analyzed through a grid based on Faigley and Witte 2 ̆ 7 s taxonomy grid of revision changes. This included three major categories: surface level, meaning preserving, and text base level changes. As in past studies on revision, {{the participants in this}} case study followed a similar trend. A majority of the changes were surface level changes, and the second most common change was meaning preserving substitutions. Out of 889 changes, only one change was made at the <b>text</b> base <b>macro</b> level. The participant interviews showed that students had a tacit understanding of the negotiation of meaning and used the knowledge they had acquired to revise, but expressed a frustration in not knowing how to resolve the dissonance other than through surface level changes. This research shows that the negotiation of dissonance between gist and intention at various levels of revision can provide a meta-cognitive framework for novice writers to articulate and execute meaning preserving and text base changes. ...|$|R
