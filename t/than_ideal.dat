5|$|In the United Kingdom, English wine {{producers}} have experimented with growing the variety in plastic tunnels which {{can create a}} greenhouse effect and protect the grapes from the less <b>than</b> <b>ideal</b> climate of the wine region. While the grape is permitted to be planted in some German wine regions (such as the Mosel), the vineyard sites best suited for ripening Cabernet are generally already occupied with Riesling; many producers are ill-inclined to uproot the popular German variety in favor of Cabernet Sauvignon. In the 1980s, inexpensive Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon was highly touted for its value and helped to establish that country's wine industry and garner it more international presence in the wine market. The grape is performing a similar function for many countries in Eastern Europe, including Turkey, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia, and Ukraine. It {{can be in the}} eastern Mediterranean wine regions of Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|Luftwaffe {{readiness}} {{was less}} <b>than</b> <b>ideal.</b> In August, 211 pilots had been killed, including 105 fighter pilots and 91 bomber pilots. Missing pilots amounted to 132 fighter and 94 bomber pilots alone, with a further respective loss of 47 and 28 wounded. The effect on operational ready crews was significant. Messerschmitt Bf 110 units had 60% of crews against authorised strength. For bomber units, it was 65%, while Bf 109 units had 81% of crews ready, a 5% {{increase from the}} 76% level {{in the first week}} of September. However, by 14 September, Bf 109 units possessed only 67% of crews against authorised aircraft. In Bf 110 units, it fell to just 46%, and in bomber units it dropped to 59%. One week later, the figures were 64, 52 and 52% respectively.|$|E

One large mirror ball being transported to the event fell onto the roadside, causing a degree of confusion as some people mistook it for a fallen satellite. World War II searchlights were installed, to illuminate the sky and surrounding architecture. Along with thousands in the surrounding streets and parks, 200,000people watched Jarre and guests such as guitarist Hank Marvin perform in less <b>than</b> <b>ideal</b> conditions. Inclement weather had threatened to break the stage from its moorings, putting paid to the original plan to float the stage across the Royal Victoria Dock.

5|$|The theater {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as contributing to}} the performing arts renaissance in Chicago, and has been favorably reviewed for its acoustics, sightlines, proscenium and for providing a home base for numerous performing organizations.

The design has been criticized for traffic flow problems, with an elevator bottleneck. However, the theater's prominent location and its underground design to preserve Millennium Park have been praised. Although there were complaints about high priced events in its early years, discounted ticket programs were introduced in the 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{catalyst}} for the severe weather outbreak came as a positively-tilted shortwave trough progressed across the central High Plains into the Great Plains and eventually through the western Great Lakes region. A weaker disturbance pushed from the Ozarks into the Northeastern United States, acting to strengthen southwesterly winds aloft across the risk area. At the surface, a weak {{area of low pressure}} initially centered over northeastern Kansas early on April9 progressed steadily northeast while intensifying, reaching the trisection of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois by late that evening. A cold front stemming from the low progressed eastward across the Mid-South, whereas an arching warm front slowly pushed northward across eastern Iowa and northern Illinois. Modest surface heating ahead of the cold front allowed mid-level Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values to reach 1,000–1,500 J/kg, and a mass of rich moisture transported northward from the Gulf of Mexico pushed dewpoints into the lower 60s °F across the Enhanced risk area. Winds at 850 mb (4,781ft) strengthened at or above 45mph (75km/h) below winds of 70mph (110km/h) at 700 mb (9,882ft), creating a favorable setup for sustained supercells. Although the overall directional component of low-level winds was expected to be less <b>than</b> <b>ideal</b> as a whole, a small area of southeasterly surface winds developed near the surface low in northern Illinois.|$|E

50|$|Intermolecular {{forces are}} repulsive at short {{distances}} and attractive at long distances (see the Lennard-Jones potential).

The attractive force draws molecules closer together and gives a real gas a tendency to occupy a smaller volume <b>than</b> an <b>ideal</b> gas.

5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier <b>than</b> <b>ideal</b> and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E
5|$|In 1326, however, Edward was deposed by an {{alliance}} of Isabella and her lover, Roger Mortimer. Edward was eventually captured by Isabella's forces and {{the custody of the}} king was assigned to Henry, Earl of Lancaster, who had backed Isabella's invasion. Henry, reoccupying most of the Lancaster lands, was made constable of Kenilworth and Edward was transported there in late 1326; Henry's legal title to the castle was finally confirmed the following year. Kenilworth was chosen for this purpose by Isabella probably both because it was a major fortification, and also because of the symbolism of its former owners' links to popular ideals of freedom and good government. Royal writs were issued in Edward's name by Isabella from Kenilworth until the next year. A deputation of leading barons led by Bishop Orleton was then sent to Kenilworth to first persuade Edward to resign and, when that failed, to inform him that he had been deposed as king. Edward formally resigned as king in the great hall of the castle on 21 January 1326. As the months went by, however, it became clear that Kenilworth was proving a less <b>than</b> <b>ideal</b> location to imprison Edward. The castle was in a prominent part of the Midlands, in an area that held several nobles who still supported Edward and were believed to be trying to rescue him. Henry's loyalty was also coming under question. In due course, Isabella and Mortimer had Edward moved by night to Berkeley Castle, where he died shortly afterwards. Isabella continued to use Kenilworth as a royal castle until her fall from power in 1330.|$|E
