While concerts on the tour were well-attended, it was plagued with several incidents, mostly attributed to drug abuse by band members. Their problems still not behind them, the group was signed to Geffen Records and began working on a comeback. Despite the band signing on to a new record company, the band's old label Columbia continued <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of Aerosmith's comeback, releasing the live companion albums Classics Live I and II and the collection Gems.|$|E

By {{the end of}} the war, the ships were equipped with air and surface-search radars and radar fire-control. When commissioned, the ships were equipped with the SC air-search radar. This radar would eventually get replaced by the SK and SK-2 air-search radar. The main battery directors were fitted with Mark 3 fire-control radar, which were replaced by the Mark 8 starting in 1942. This radar gave these ships a significant advantage over the Japanese, which for the most part relied on optical systems.|$|E

25|$|In 1847, {{two great}} {{literary}} {{figures of the}} Arab cultural renaissance, Butrus Al-Bustani and Nasif Al-Yaziji, founded the first literary society, Jam'iyyat al-Adab wal-'Ulum (The Literary and Scientific Society). Its members were exclusively Syrian Christians and Europeans {{living and working in}} diplomatic and missionary circles. However, ten years later, al-Jam'iyya al-'Ilmiyya al-Suriyya (The Syrian Scientific Society) was established, and attracted Western-educated Muslims and Druze as well as Christians. In 1917, the Tunisian literary figure, Hassan Hosni Abdel-Wahab wrote about the urgent need for educated Muslim young women to take charge of the future and to 'awaken the nationalist spirit', as without this, 'life would turn to nihilism and its consequences'. Only a few years later in the 1920s, Manwia Al-Wartani and Habiba al-Minshari, became the leaders of a dynamic women's movement in Tunisia. Like these Tunisian pioneers, women of the upper and middle classes across the increasingly imagined Arab world began <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of education, and many of them began to focus on writing and joined their male counterparts in contributing to the Arab Renaissance.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{communities}} in Maharashtra {{that have been}} trying to pass themselves off as depressed in order <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of the reservation. An issue of candidates of the Maratha caste (a non-backward caste) running for elections in wards reserved for OBC candidates got centre-stage attention in the 2007 civic polls after the Maharashtra state government amended the OBC list on 1 June 2004 to retain the Kunbis and include Kunbi-Marathas. In 2010, the independent corporator, Malan Bhintade, who claimed to be Kunbi-Maratha but was later found to be of Maratha caste, lost her membership of the Pune Municipal Corporation after it was established that she had submitted a false caste certificate, claiming to be Kunbi-Maratha in order to run for elections in wards reserved for OBC candidates. Subsequently, all candidates who lost to Kunbi-Maratha candidates registered complaints against their opponents by claiming falsification of certificates. A similar case of forgery was reported in 2003 when the former Shiv Sena corporator, Geeta Gore, was sent to jail for falsely claiming to be a Kunbi-Maratha. Gore won in elections from ward 18 of Andheri (west) by claiming {{to be a member of}} the Kunbi-Maratha caste.|$|E

500|$|After the Reformation the Humanist {{concern with}} {{education}} {{became part of}} a programme of godly education, with an attempt {{to establish a system}} of parish schools administered by the Church of Scotland (the [...] "Kirk"). A new university was established in Edinburgh and the existing universities underwent a series of reforms associated with Andrew Melville that revitalised them and brought them up to the standards of Humanist scholarship and methods of teaching of institutions elsewhere. In the seventeenth century there were attempts to organise and finance the system of parish schools and a successful expansion of the university system. By the early eighteenth century the network of parish schools was reasonably complete in the Lowlands, but limited in the Highlands where it was supplemented by Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Scotland began <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of its university system, with major early figures of the Enlightenment including Francis Hutcheson, Colin Maclaurin and David Hume.|$|E
500|$|The most criticized {{aspect of}} the Climax Series is the one-game {{advantage}} that is awarded to the regular-season champions for the Final Stage. When the rule was implemented the for the 2008 Climax Series, many players reacted negatively with some describing the rule as [...] "unfair", [...] "bad", [...] "bull" [...] and [...] "messed up". Former player and current manager Alex Ramírez, however, believed that the league champion deserves the advantage. The Japan Times columnist Jason Coskrey believes that the [...] "phantom win" [...] gives the pennant winner {{too much of an}} advantage. According to him, the First Stage bye plus all home games during the Final Stage should be advantage enough for the top-seeded team.

2500|$|Christian organisations {{have said}} that {{non-discrimination}} laws {{should not be allowed}} to limit freedom of religion, and have argued for new laws to enshrine a right to discriminate against same-sex couples. ACT Attorney-General, Simon Corbell has said, in the ACT, it will be, [...] "unlawful for those who provide goods, services and facilities in the wedding industry to discriminate against another person on the basis of their sexuality or their relationship status. This includes discrimination by refusing to provide or make available those goods, services or facilities." [...] Tim Wilson has argued that religious anti-discrimination exemptions should be included in same-sex marriage laws. Others though, such as Australian lawyer and associate director and research fellow in the Public Interest Law Centre at New York University School of Law, David Glasgow, have argued that the core of this religious freedom campaign is simply desiring [...] "the liberty to refuse service" [...] to particular customers. Glasgow contends that Australian anti-discrimination law includes sexual orientation and gender identity as protected attributes akin to race or religion [...] "because we recognise that those attributes should not impede a person's participation in civic life" [...] and that [...] "the law insists, rightly, that <b>to</b> <b>reap</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> of opening a business to the public, the business must be open on equal terms." [...] Some are concerned that allowing religious business owners and service providers to right to refuse to provide services related to same-sex weddings/ceremonies (i.e.: wedding cakes and/or flowers) might lead to further exemptions not related to same-sex marriages but rather anything to do with homosexuality. Others have lamented the fact that, increasingly, much of the religious-based opposition to same-sex marriage has lost touch with the secular reality governing Australian laws and legal principles.|$|E
