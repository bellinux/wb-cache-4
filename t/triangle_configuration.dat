We then compare our analytical estimates to a direct computation of the bispectrum from a set of 300 statistically independent temperature maps obtained from Nambu-Goto cosmic string simulations in a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. We find good agreement for the overall amplitude, the power law behaviour and angle dependency of the various <b>triangle</b> <b>configurations.</b> At l~ 500 the cosmic string GKS effect contributes approximately the same equilateral CMB bispectrum amplitude as an inflationary model with |fNL|~ 10 ^ 3, if the strings contribute about 10 % of {{the temperature}} power spectrum at l= 10.

In the GSR approach, the bispectrum arises from integrals of nearly the same function of the background slow-roll parameters as the power spectrum but with a stronger weight to the epoch before horizon crossing.

For the parameter forecast, we use the halo model approach in Kayo, Takada & Jain (2013) to model the non-Gaussian error covariances {{as well as the}} cross-covariance between the power spectrum and the bispectrum, including the halo sample variance or the nonlinear version of beat-coupling. We find that adding the bispectrum information leads to about 60 % improvement in the dark energy figure-of-merit compared to the lensing power spectrum tomography alone, for three redshift-bin tomography and a Subaru-type survey probing galaxies at typical redshift of zs~ 1. The improvement is equivalent to a 1. 6 larger survey area. Thus our results show that the bispectrum or more generally any three-point correlation based statistics carries complementary information on cosmological parameters to the power spectrum.
