Reviewer Neil McCormick praised her more personal {{songs on the}} album: [...] "It is when she turns her sharp tongue to her own affairs of the heart that Allen's growing adventurousness and lyrical confidence really pay off....But in particular 'Who'd Have Known' is a tender evocation of friendship turning to love, in which the detail is telling and Allen's vocal performance positively glows with easy affection. On such songs, Allen still sounds like a real person <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> most intimate details of her real life, only with better hooks." [...] McCormick also praised the lead single as [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "an ironic declaration of celebrity superficiality set to a pulsing, sleekly modern electro dance backing." ...|$|E

60|$|In one sense, at any rate, {{it is more}} {{valuable}} to read bad literature than good literature. Good literature may <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> mind of one man; but bad literature may <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> mind of many men. A good novel <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> truth about its hero; but a bad novel <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> truth about its author. It does much more than that, it <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> truth about its readers; and, oddly enough, it <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> this all <b>the</b> more the more cynical and immoral be the motive of its manufacture. The more dishonest a book is as a book the more honest it is as a public document. A sincere novel exhibits the simplicity of one particular man; an insincere novel exhibits the simplicity of mankind. The pedantic decisions and definable readjustments of man {{may be found in}} scrolls and statute books and scriptures; but men's basic assumptions and everlasting energies {{are to be found in}} penny dreadfuls and halfpenny novelettes. Thus a man, like many men of real culture in our day, might learn from good literature nothing except the power to appreciate good literature. But from bad literature he might learn to govern empires and look over the map of mankind.|$|R

6000|$|It is {{when dealing}} with the aspects of nature that Mr. Hugh Clifford is most convincing. He looks upon them lovingly, for the land is [...] "very dear to him," [...] and he records his {{cherished}} impressions so that the forest, the great flood, the jungle, the rapid river, and the menacing rock dwell {{in the memory of}} the reader long after the book is closed. He does not say anything, in so many words, of his affection for those who live amid the scenes he describes so well, but his humanity is large enough to pardon us if we suspect him of such a rare weakness. In his preface he expresses the regret at not having the gifts (whatever they may be) of the kailyard school, or--looking up to a very different plane--the genius of Mr. Barrie. He has, however, gifts of his own, and his genius has served his country and his fortunes in another direction.

6000|$|I must {{remind the}} readers {{again that the}} De Republica is a fragment: the first part is wanting.

Then he gives instances to show that the truly good citizen will not be deterred by the example of men who have suffered for their country, and among the number he names himself. But he soon introduces the form of dialogue which he afterward continues, and brings especially the younger Scipio and Lælius upon the scene. The lessons which are given to us are supposed to come from the virtue of the titular grandson of the greater Scipio who out-manoeuvred Hannibal. He continues to tell story after story out of the Roman chronicles, and at last assures us that that form of government is the best in which the monarchical element is tempered by the authority of the leading citizens, and kept alive by the voices of the people. Is it only because I am an Englishman that he seems to me to describe that form of government which was to come in England? ...|$|E

'Yes,' said Miss Pratt, 'but asceticism is not {{the root}} of the error, as Mr. Tryan was <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> other evening--it is the denial of the great {{doctrine}} of justification by faith. Much as I had reflected on all subjects {{in the course of my}} life, I am indebted to Mr. Tryan for opening my eyes to the full importance of that cardinal doctrine of the Reformation. From a child I had a deep sense of religion, but in my early days the Gospel light was obscured in the English Church, notwithstanding the possession of our incomparable Liturgy, than which I know no human composition more faultless and sublime. As I tell Eliza I was not blest as she is at the age of two-and-twenty, in knowing a clergyman who unites all that is great and admirable in intellect with the highest spiritual gifts. I am no contemptible judge of a man's acquirements, and I assure you I have tested Mr. Tryan's by questions which are a pretty severe touchstone.

6000|$|... [Second.] 'And in {{them the}} names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.' 'And in them their names.' This makes it {{manifest}} that by the foundations of this wall, we are to understand the doctrine of the twelve apostles of the Lord Christ, for their names are to it, or found engraved in the foundations. Thus it was with the doctrine which was the foundation of the Jewish church; the first pattern being delivered by the man Moses, his name was always so entailed to that doctrine, that at last it became common, and that by Divine allowance, to call that doctrine by the name of Moses himself. 'There is one that accuseth you,' saith Christ, 'even Moses in whom ye trust' (John 5:45). And again, 'For Moses of old hath in every city them that preach him' (Acts 15:21). The same liberty of speech doth the Holy Ghost here use in speaking of the foundations of this wall, which is the doctrine of the twelve. And in that he calleth the doctrine by the name of foundations, and leaveth it only with <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> names of the twelve apostles are engraven in it; he expects that men should be wise that read him, and that they should be skillful in the word of righteousness, if they come up clearly to the understanding of him.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is, it {{is three}} months since I left her palace."[306] But Dr. Warton should have remembered (what he too often forgets {{in his own}} verses) that, in spite of Dr. Johnson's dictum, poetry is not prose, and that verse only loses its {{advantage}} over the latter by invading its province.[307] Verse itself is an absurdity except {{as an expression of}} some higher movement of the mind, or as an expedient to lift other minds to the same ideal level. It is the cothurnus which gives language an heroic stature. I have said that one leading characteristic of Spenser's style was its spaciousness, that he habitually dilates rather than compresses. But his way of measuring time was perfectly natural in an age when everybody did not carry a dial in his poke as now. He is the last of the poets, who went (without affectation) by the great clock of the firmament. Dante, the miser of words, who goes by the same timepiece, is full of these roundabout ways of <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> hour. It {{had nothing to do with}} Spenser's stanza, and I for one should be sorry to lose these stately revolutions of the superne ruote.

A gentleman on the reading of the First Part, and there in the description of the bull-baiting, said, that Almanzor's playing at the bull was according to the standard of the Greek heroes, who, as Mr. Dryden had learnedly observed (Essay of Dramatic Poesy), were great beef-eaters. And why might not Almanzor as well as Ajax, or Don Quixote, worry mutton, or take a bull by the throat, since the author had elsewhere explained himself, by <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> heroes were more noble beasts of prey, in his Epistle to his 'Conquest of Granada,' distinguishing them into wild and tame; and in his play we have Almanzor shaking his chains, and frighting his keeper, broke loose, and tearing those that would reclaim his rage. To this he added, that his bulls excelled other heroes, as far as his own heroes surpassed his gods; that the champion bull was divested of flesh and blood, and made immortal by the poet, and bellowed after death; that the fantastic bull seemed fiercer than the true, and the dead bellowings in verse were louder than the living; concluding with a wish, that Mr. Dryden had the good luck to have varied that old verse quoted in his dramatic essay: ...|$|E

6000|$|Our {{government}} {{rests in}} public opinion. Whoever can change public opinion {{can change the}} government practically just so much. Public opinion, on any subject, always has a [...] "central idea," [...] from which all its minor thoughts radiate. That [...] "central idea" [...] in our political public opinion at the beginning was, and until recently has continued to be, [...] "the equality of men." [...] And although it has always submitted patiently to whatever of inequality {{there seemed to be}} as matter of actual necessity, its constant working has been a steady progress toward the practical equality of all men. The late Presidential election was a struggle by one party to discard that central idea and to substitute for it the opposite idea that slavery is right in the abstract, the workings of which as a central idea may be the perpetuity of human slavery and its extension to all countries and colors. Less than a year ago the Richmond Enquirer, an avowed advocate of slavery, regardless of color, in order to favor his views, invented the phrase [...] "State equality," [...] and now the President, in his message, adopts the Enquirer's catch-phrase, <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> people [...] "have asserted the constitutional equality of each and all of the States of the Union as States." [...] The President flatters himself that the new central idea is completely inaugurated; and so indeed it is, so far as the mere fact of a Presidential election can inaugurate it.

6000|$|Our host took {{pleasure}} in <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> {{names of the}} ponds, most of which we could see from his windows, and making us repeat them after him, {{to see if we}} had got them right. They were Gull Pond, the largest and a very handsome one, clear and deep, and more than a mile in circumference, Newcomb's, Swett's, Slough, Horse-Leech, Round, and Herring Ponds, all connected at high water, if I do not mistake. The coast-surveyors had come to him for their names, and he told them of one which they had not detected. He said that they were not so high as formerly. There was an earthquake about four years before he was born, which cracked the pans of the ponds, which were of iron, and caused them to settle. I did not remember to have read of this. Innumerable gulls used to resort to them; but the large gulls were now very scarce, for, as he said, the English robbed their nests far in the north, where they breed. He remembered well when gulls were taken in the gull-house, and when small birds were killed by means of a frying-pan and fire at night. His father once lost a valuable horse from this cause. A party from Wellfleet having lighted their fire for this purpose, one dark night, on Billingsgate Island, twenty horses which were pastured there, and this colt among them, being frightened by it, and endeavoring in the dark to cross the passage which separated them from the neighboring beach, and which was then fordable at low tide, were all swept out to sea and drowned. I ob-served that many horses were still turned out to pasture all summer on the islands and beaches in Wellfleet, Eastham, and Orleans, as a kind of common. He also described the killing of what he called [...] "wild hens" [...] here, after they had gone to roost in the woods, when he was a boy. Perhaps they were [...] "Prairie hens" [...] (pinnated grouse).|$|E
6000|$|The {{subject is}} of the simplest: a peasant paying the dower-money of his daughter. [...] "The father"--it is prudent of us to borrow Diderot's description--"is seated in the great chair of the house. Before him his {{son-in-law}} standing, and holding {{in his left hand}} the bag that contains the money. The betrothed, standing also, with one arm gently passed under the arm of her lover, the other grasped by her mother, who is seated. Between the mother and the bride, a younger sister standing, leaning on the bride and with an arm thrown round her shoulders. Behind this group, a child standing on tiptoes to see what is going on. To the extreme left in the background, and at a distance from the scene, two women-servants who are looking on. To the right a cupboard with its usual contents--all scrupulously clean.... A wooden staircase leading to the upper floor. In the foreground near the feet of the mother, a hen leading her young ones, to whom a little girl throws crumbs of bread; a basin full of water, and on the edge of it, one of the small chickens with its beak up in the air so as to let the water go down." [...] Diderot then proceeds to criticise the details, <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> very words that he hears the father addressing to the bridegroom, and as a touch of observation of nature, that while one of the old man's hands, of which we see the back, is tanned and brown, the other, of which we see the palm, is white. [...] "To the bride the painter has given a face full of charm, of seemliness, of reserve. She is dressed to perfection. That apron of white stuff could not be better; there is a trifle of luxury in her ornament; but then it is a wedding-day. You should note how true are the folds and creases in her dress, and in those of the rest. The charming girl is not quite straight; but there is a light and gentle inflexion in all her figure and her limbs that fills her with grace and truth. Indeed she is pretty and very pretty. If she had leaned more towards her lover, it would have been unbecoming; more to her mother and her father, and she would have been false. She has her arm half passed under that of her future husband, and the tips of her fingers rest softly on his hand; that is the only mark of tenderness that she gives him, and perhaps without knowing it herself: it is a delicate idea in the painter."[34] ...|$|E
