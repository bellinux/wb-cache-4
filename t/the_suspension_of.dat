One fork ran into a large workshop and the other led to a short platform, which was initially used for passengers. Following <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> passenger services it was converted into a coal dock.|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{to predict}} the thermal conductivity of nanofluids based on <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> rheology is proposed and experimentally validated by using four types <b>of</b> nanofluids; <b>the</b> <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> titania nanoparticles and titanate nanotubes in water and ethylene glycol liquids. Such a methodology lies in <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>suspension</b> rheological behaviour to determine the microstructure of nanofluids, which is then used for the thermal conductivity prediction...|$|R

5|$|In {{the seasons}} {{following}} the FA Cup triumph, {{the club was}} dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United. A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.|$|E
5|$|On 2 February 2009, {{banknotes}} of {{the fourth}} dollar (ZWL) were introduced to replace those of the third dollar at the ratio of one trillion (1012) to 1.

30|$|<b>The</b> {{colloidal}} <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> nanoparticles {{were obtained}} by the preformed polymer interfacial deposition method also called nanoprecipitation preformed polymer [60]. The components of the organic and aqueous phases were weighed, placed in individual beakers and subjected to sonication until complete dissolution (15  min). Then, the organic phase (500  μL) was poured into the aqueous phase (50  mL) and vortexed for 1  min. <b>The</b> <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> polymeric nanoparticles containing red propolis extract (NRPE) were submitted to the characterization assays.|$|R

5|$|On {{taking office}} Grant's first move was signing the Act to Strengthen the Public Credit, which the Republican Congress had just passed.

5|$|Such open {{display of}} anti-British {{feelings}} and humiliation prompted the Governor General {{of the time}} Richard Wellesley to recall Knox to India and unilaterally suspend the diplomatic ties. The Treaty of 1801 was also unilaterally annulled by the British on 24 January 1804. <b>The</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> diplomatic ties also gave the Governor General a pretext to allow the ex-King Rana Bahadur to return to Nepal unconditionally.|$|E
5|$|The University {{closed its}} doors during the Philippine Revolution of 1896 {{because of the}} ensuing disorder. It reopened though for the school year 1897–1898 when the rebels retreated to the provinces.

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August 25, and ultimately discontinued {{about three days}} later. Two cruise ships left Bermuda early to avoid the storm, and another two postponed their scheduled stops there. The threat of the storm, combined {{with a lack of}} passengers due to cruise ship diversions, resulted in <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> ferry service. Cristobal ultimately passed well to the northwest of the island, producing breezy conditions and heightened surf.|$|E

5|$|Adamle's {{decision}} {{to drop out}} was controversial because of rules that under normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating. The interruption of the war had forced <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> the rule to account for players' military service, however, and {{he was allowed to}} leave college. The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E
5|$|Although disbanded in 1919 {{following}} {{the end of}} hostilities, it was re-raised in 1921 in the Citizens Force (later known as the Militia) as a part-time infantry battalion based in Victoria. However, due to lack of funding {{following the}} Great Depression and a shortage of manpower following <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> the compulsory training scheme in 1929, the battalion was amalgamated with the 38th Battalion as the 7th/38th Battalion, although it was delinked again in 1936 when the Army was expanded due to rising tensions in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Although the 2012 Olympic men's {{basketball}} tournament was then {{more than a}} year away, qualifying tournaments in all five of FIBA's continental zones were to be held in the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2011 (the traditional basketball offseason throughout the world). The lockout resulted in <b>the</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> an agreement between the NBA and FIBA by which the NBA would take on most of the costs for insuring the value of its players' contracts in the event they were injured during international competition. As a result, national federations that wish to have NBA players on their squads must now provide full coverage instead of supplemental insurance.|$|E

5|$|Arrington helped {{establish}} the Mormon History Association in 1965 {{and served as}} its first president from 1966 to 1967.

Arrington formed the Mormon History Association in part to make a place where controversial material could be discussed. The association welcomed anyone {{with an interest in}} Mormon history. Wesley Johnson attended the inaugural meeting, and proposed that the association could publish Mormon studies articles in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, a publication he helped form. Johnson's proposal was accepted and members of the Mormon History Association submitted papers to Dialogue.|$|E
