2500|$|In just {{a three-year}} career, Lightfoot scored 2,201points, which through the 2010–11 season remain {{the most in}} Big Sky history. In each year, he {{averaged}} 20+ points per game for a career average of 23.1 – nearly four points per game better than the next closest player at Idaho. He was a three-time first team all-conference selection, two-time conference player of the year, and currently holds 13 different records in the Vandals' record book. Among them are the top three single season scoring averages and four of the top six single game scoring marks. His career scoring record is also more than 500points greater than the second closest player in school history. When asked if this mark will ever be topped, he responded, [...] "I think it will happen, as all records are made to be broken. I do not know when or how, but I think Rodney Stuckey was on pace to break it if he had stayed four years at [...] It {{will have to be}} a young kid who stays all four years. However, if you are scoring 20 points per game as a sophomore, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> might leave early and go to the [...] (NBA)." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have liked}} it so much," [...] {{answered}} Fan. [...] "I {{like to be}} with you so much, because"--she hesitated a little and <b>then</b> finished--"because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> like me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>Is</b> it so, <b>then?</b> But--Mr. Thurnall, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> said?--I {{am glad to}} {{make your}} acquaintance, sir. I have heard your name often: you are my friend Mellot's old friend, are you not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! You haven't yet!" [...] He {{dropped his}} voice mysteriously. [...] "Well, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{ought to know}} that there's {{something}} going on here." ...|$|E
6000|$|At length Larrinaga {{pushed back}} his chair. [...] "Time goes and my duties begin at sunrise. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{would like to}} make an early start?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Did he so in very deed? Nay, <b>then,</b> reverend father, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{had better}} comply with his demands--for Allan-a-Dale {{is the very}} man to abide by his word when he has so pledged it." [...] [43] ...|$|R
6000|$|Wisbech's manner became confidential. [...] "It's a {{fact that}} has counted against me now and <b>then.</b> Besides, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> noticed my accent--it's {{distinctly}} provincial, and not like yours or Derrick's--as soon as I told you I was a relative of his. You see, I know my station. In fact, I'm almost aggressively proud of it." [...] He spread out {{his hands in a}} forceful fashion. [...] "It's a useful one." ...|$|R
6000|$|The captain {{made a very}} odd, incomprehensible little bow; {{and after}} a moment's thought, said, 'Plainly speaking, <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> do {{get to the bottom}} of that lad; but there's no telling, and I never had any turn for those smooth chaps. If a fellow begins by being over-precise in what is of no consequence, ten to one but he ends by being {{reckless}} in all the rest.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's true, Jessie. And I {{only hope}} that I'll make good--and that too before I am very much older. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> already know what I am going to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you ought}} to see the Synod setting the table!" [...] she cried, {{bursting}} into the galley. [...] "They're getting things all wrong, but it doesn't matter, {{and they seem to}} be enjoying it. Now <b>then,</b> Mr. Litchfield, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have cut all the bread that can possibly be eaten!" ...|$|R
60|$|Pala. <b>Then,</b> madam, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> had best {{make that}} use of me; let me wait on you {{for two or three}} days together, and you shall hear all I have learnt of {{extraordinary}} in other countries; and one thing which I never saw 'till I came home, that is, a lady of a better voice, better face, and better wit, than any I have seen abroad. And, after this, if I should not declare myself most passionately in love with you, I should have less wit than yet <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} love I mean. You {{did not love}} me then. You could not have loved me,--though, perhaps, I thought I had {{deserved}} your love. But love will change, and memory will sometimes bring back old fancies when {{the world has been}} stern and hard. When we were very young <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> loved me. Do you remember seven years ago at Longbarns, when they parted us and sent me away, because--because we were so young? They did not tell us <b>then,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> knew. <b>I</b> know that I knew, and went nigh to swear that I would drown myself. You loved me then, Emily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When we are {{assured that}} this man's story is true, Sir Thomas, she must know it. That will {{probably}} be very soon,--in a day or two. Till <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> had better tell her nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the younger woman's retreat to view the sea through an opening of the walls, Pierston appealed to her mother in a whisper: 'Have you ever given her a hint of what my meaning is? No? <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> might, if you really have no objection.' ...|$|E
60|$|EDITH. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> shew great {{weakness}} of character; {{and instead of}} taking advantage of it I shall set you a better example.

5000|$|At the Treasury, {{he had a}} {{reputation}} as [...] "a strict Gladstonian at a time when Treasury attitudes were fast changing". In 1895, he commented that:responsible politicians on the Liberal side would be glad to see the area of indirect taxation widened, and would not undo what had been done in that way. On occasions of great emergency, when large demands are to be made on the people, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> must have a partial resort to indirect taxation; and on occasions when demands less large are to be made on the people, if those demands have a character of apparent permanence, <b>then</b> also, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> ought to call in the aid of indirect taxation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Carrie, [...] "don't <b>you</b> care, <b>then,</b> what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>you?</b> Still, in this case, I needn't ask you. Mrs. Custer told me that, too. That is why I felt I {{must ask}} you to forgive me for presuming to blame you. I want to be just, and I was in my wilfulness horribly far from being so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was {{thinking}} lately of George Herbert at Hereford, as I read the four sermons which Vaughan lately preached there, {{one on the}} Atonement, which I liked very much indeed. The Cathedral has been beautifully restored, has it not? <b>Then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>you</b> in York Minster on November 20, with that good text from Psalm xcvi. I read your letter on Tuesday; on which day our morning Psalms in Chapel are always chanted, xcv., xcvi., xcvii. The application seems very natural, but to work out those applications is difficult. The more I read sermons, and I read a good many, the more I wonder how men can write them! ...|$|R
60|$|We {{will work}} out one other Syllogism--a rather harder one than the last--and <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> may be safely left to play the Game by yourself, or (better) with any friend whom you can find, that is {{able and willing to}} take a share in the sport.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} liked it. But {{whether he would}} have persevered without it you must ask yourself. If he tells you {{that he would never}} have said another word to you only for this frock, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> ought to thank Sir Harry, and give him a kiss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What shall you do?" [...] said Nehushta drily. [...] "Well, if {{you like}} to give the noble Marcus a kiss, I shall not blame you overmuch or tell on you. But if you do not wish it, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would be a fool to put {{yourself}} to shame to save Caleb." ...|$|E
6000|$|Therewith Sir Tristram, having run his course, {{came back}} to where those two knights lay upon the ground, and he said, [...] "Fair Knights, will you have any more {{fighting}}?" [...] They said, [...] "No, we have had fighting enough." [...] Then Sir Tristram said: [...] "I pray you, tell me, are there any bigger knights at the court of King Arthur than you? If it is not so, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would take great shame to yourselves {{that you have been}} overthrown the one after the other by a single knight. For this day a knight of Cornwall hath assuredly matched you both to your great despite." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{come down}} with me," [...] {{continued}} the earl, [...] "and you'll find we'll make it all straight. I daresay you're right about not speaking to the girl just at present. But tell everything to the uncle, {{and then to the}} mother. And, above all things, never think that you're not good enough yourself. A man should never think that. My belief is that in life people will take you very much at your own reckoning. If you are made of dirt, like that fellow Crosbie, you'll be found out at last, no doubt. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are made of dirt." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kennedy was a Spiritualist who saw {{death as}} [...] "a freedom and an escape." [...] The film saw him fulfil his lifelong aim of flying in a glider, which {{led him to}} think of life beyond death - [...] "I think I'll be bored if the angels sit about on clouds {{plucking}} their harps all day. I'll be up there, getting them off their clouds, doing drops of 1,000 feet and <b>then</b> pulling up. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> need to spice things up a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{it would}} depend," [...] I answered, [...] "upon what the cattle and wives were like. If the cattle had {{red-water}} and would bring disease into your herd, or wild bulls that would gore you, and the wives were skinny old widows with evil tongues, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would look as do those men, Hans." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{trust the}} reader will bear with me through these {{alphabetical}} fluctuations. Many people, I know from colloquial experiences, do at about this stage fly into a passion. But if you will exercise self-control, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> will see my point that, according to the method of voting, almost any sort of result may be got out of an election except {{the production of a}} genuinely representative assembly.|$|E
6000|$|... "51. I am a {{poor boy}} {{and have no}} means to support my mother and two {{brothers}} who are suffering much for want of food. I get four rupees monthly from charity fund of this place, from which I send two rupees for their support, and keep two for my own support. Father, if I relate the unlucky circumstance under which we are placed, <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> {{will not be able}} to suppress the tender tear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Presently. O Rachel! I {{like the}} sound of your voice; I am glad Alick has got you. You suit him better than his wicked little sister ever did. You have been so kind to me to-night, Rachel; I never thought I should have loved you so well, when I quizzed you. I did use you ill <b>then,</b> Rachel, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> won Alick by it just by force of contrast,"--she was verging into the dreamy voice, and Rachel {{requested}} her to rest and be silent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you ever}} thought of the matter from the other point of view?" [...] she asked,--"thought about those poor people, for instance, who {{have to live in}} a corner of the world like this, always? All these things, which rest and soothe you here, are {{beautiful}} by sheer force of contrast. For a few days--a week or so, perhaps--the contemplation of them would be restful. You would lie about on the sands and in the sunshine and believe that you had found Paradise. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> would begin to get just a little discontented. The sun doesn't always shine here, you know, and when the sun doesn't shine, all the land is colorless. The sea is gray and ugly, the marshes are flat and dreary, the wind, even in the summer time, is cold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Without aid it is so. But {{suppose you}} had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, {{securing}} one end of it to this great hook in the wall. <b>Then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> if <b>you</b> were an active man, You might swarm up, wooden leg and all. You would depart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside, and get away {{in the way that}} he originally came. As a minor point it may be noted," [...] he continued, fingering the rope, [...] "that our wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional sailor. His hands were far from horny. My lens discloses more than one blood-mark, especially {{towards the end of the}} rope, from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand." ...|$|R
