2500|$|Rep. Mary Bono Mack of the United States Congress {{commented on}} the {{incident}}, [...] "How many times {{is this going to}} happen before Congress finally wakes up and takes action? This latest incident once again brings into sharp focus the need <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> protection legislation." [...] Senator Patrick Leahy said, [...] "Reports of another major data breach should give pause to American consumers who, now more than ever, share sensitive personal information in their online transactions and networking... Congress should make comprehensive data privacy and cybercrime legislation a top priority." [...] Marcus Carey, a security researcher for Rapid7, said that the hackers had penetrated the databases of LinkedIn in the preceding days. He expressed concerns that they may have had access to the website even after the attack. Michael Aronowitz, Vice President of Saveology said, [...] "Everyday hundreds of sites are hacked and personal information is obtained. Stealing login information from one account can easily be used to access other accounts, which can hold personal and financial information." [...] Security experts indicated that the stolen passwords were encrypted {{in a way that was}} fairly easy to decrypt, which was one of the reasons for the data breach. Katie Szpyrka, a long time user of LinkedIn from Illinois, United States, filed a $5 million lawsuit against LinkedIn, complaining that the company did not keep their promises to secure connections and databases. Erin O’Harra, a spokeswoman working for LinkedIn, when asked about the lawsuit, said that lawyers were looking to take advantage of that situation to again propose the bills SOPA and PIPA in the United States Congress. [...] An amended complaint was filed on Nov. 26, 2012 on behalf of Szpyrka and another premium LinkedIn user from Virginia, United States, named Khalilah Gilmore–Wright, as class representatives for all LinkedIn users who were affected by the breach. [...] The lawsuit sought injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as restitution and damages for the plaintiffs and members of the class.|$|E

50|$|POGL {{provides}} specialized {{objects that}} enhance Perl performance.POGL objects store data as typed C arrays, and <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> between APIs using C pointers - {{eliminating the need}} <b>to</b> copy/convert/cast when <b>passing</b> <b>data</b> between interfaces.|$|R
50|$|The format {{dates back}} to the early days of {{business}} computing and is widely used <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> between computers with different internal word sizes, data formatting needs, and so forth. For this reason, CSV files are common on all computer platforms.|$|E
5000|$|The UNI/O bus [...] is an {{asynchronous}} {{serial bus}} created by Microchip Technology for low speed communication in embedded systems. The bus uses a master/slave configuration, requiring one signal <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> between devices. The first devices supporting the UNI/O bus were released in May 2008.|$|E
50|$|Most {{operating}} systems offer primitives such as pipes, sockets or shared memory <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> among programs, but often {{the simplest way}} (especially for programs that follow the Unix philosophy) is to write data into a temporary file and inform the receiving program of {{the location of the}} temporary file.|$|E
30|$|The {{emulated}} primitives take fewer CPU cycles than a getppid system call, {{which takes}} 630 cycles on Linux 4.16. 10 where kernel page table isolation (KPTI) {{is turned on}} by default. It proves that the emulated primitives would be more efficient than system calls <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> word-sized <b>data</b> <b>to</b> kernel.|$|R
3000|$|In {{the third}} one, {{which is called}} three-tier, the network {{architecture}} consists {{of a set of}} stationary nodes that are used <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the <b>data</b> <b>to</b> a set of mobile nodes, which in turn forward the data to a set of base stations (ex. APs) as represented in Fig. 8 [...]...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{preferred}} to its predecessor, superframe, because {{it includes a}} cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and 4000 bit/s channel capacity for a data link channel (used <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> out-of-band <b>data</b> between equipment.) It requires less frequent synchronization than the earlier superframe format, and provides on-line, real-time [...] of circuit capability and operating condition.|$|R
5000|$|Wi-Fi uses {{contention}} access — all subscriber {{stations that}} wish <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> through a {{wireless access point}} (AP) are competing for the AP's attention on a random interrupt basis. This can cause subscriber stations distant from the AP to be repeatedly interrupted by closer stations, greatly reducing their throughput.|$|E
50|$|Genachowski led a {{successful}} effort <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> roaming rules so consumers {{have access to}} wireless Internet even in areas their provider does not cover. The rules passed on a 3‑2 vote in April 2011. The rules require Verizon and AT&T to enter into roaming agreements with smaller carriers {{in order to preserve}} industry competition.|$|E
50|$|Arrays {{are passed}} by reference, and this {{mechanism}} is an advertised {{feature of the}} language <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> back out of a subroutine - in contrast, array slices are copied before being passed, so that data modifications do not flow back into array ranges (after the subroutine exits), violating the principle of least surprise.|$|E

5000|$|Distributed Ruby (DRb) allows Ruby {{programs}} {{to communicate with}} each other on the same machine or over a network. DRb uses remote method invocation (RMI) <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> commands and <b>data</b> between processes.|$|R
50|$|The format allows {{meteorological}} {{data to be}} published for a grid of any defined size / resolution containing only those parameters specifically requested by users. Thus, {{it can be used}} <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> sets varying from coarse resolution, single-parameter data through to very high resolution, multi-parameter data depending upon specific data requirements and communications capabilities.|$|E
50|$|<b>To</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> {{through the}} {{repeater}} in a usable fashion from one segment to the next, the framing and data rate {{must be the}} same on each segment. This means that a repeater cannot connect an 802.3 segment (Ethernet) and an 802.5 segment (Token Ring) or a 10 Mbit/s segment to 100 Mbit/s Ethernet.|$|E
5000|$|... for Storage Area Networks (SAN) - aka [...] "LAN Free Storage Agent" [...] A {{modified}} version of the TSM Server itself, offering no local TSM Database. Configuration is purely for server-to-server library sharing. This allows the agent to write to tapes managed by the primary TSM server without having <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> over the network.|$|E
30|$|I thank Cassandra Göller for {{introducing}} me <b>to</b> the <b>PASS</b> <b>data.</b> Her excellent master thesis (Göller 2016) motivated this analysis. Bernhard Christoph, Mark Trappmann, and two anonymous reviewers provided helpful {{comments and suggestions}} for analysis. The Research Data Centre (FDZ) of the German Federal Employment Agency (BA) at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) provided the <b>PASS</b> <b>data</b> for the research project “Konsum und Lebensstandard – Eine Langfristanalyse der Einkommensverwendung in Deutschland” (AN 210 / 10 - 1), which {{was funded by the}} German Science Foundation.|$|R

30|$|As {{described}} in Section ‘A recontextualization mechanism’, earlier work explored several approaches <b>to</b> <b>passing</b> <b>data</b> between the hypervisor and the processes running inside the VM. The {{work in this}} paper retains the use of virtual devices as a transport mechanism, due to its native support in major hypervisors and operating systems, and {{does not depend on}} network access. This is a key feature, since network access is one of the primary things that contextualized settings can be used to enable. As previously mentioned, the core idea of our suggested approach is to dynamically generate customized ISO images which are made available to the running VM instance. As the ISO images can be freely changed (and re-mounted) during run-time, the context data can be updated at any point in the VM lifecycle.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to MapReduce, PACT uses a more generic data model of records (Pact Record) <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> between functions. The Pact Record {{can be thought}} of as a tuple with a free schema. The interpretation of the fields of a record is up to the user function. A Key/Value pair (as in MapReduce) is a special case of that record with only two fields (the key and the value).|$|E
5000|$|To enable {{developers}} to, in {{a controlled}} manner, circumvent the same-origin policy, a number on [...] "hacks" [...] such as using the fragment identifier or the [...] property have been used <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> between documents residing in different domains. With the HTML5 standard, a method was formalized for this: the [...] interface, which is only available on recent browsers. JSONP {{can also be used}} to enable Ajax-like calls to other domains.|$|E
50|$|Telephones are {{connected}} to the telephone exchange via a local loop, which is a physical pair of wires. The local loop was originally intended mostly for the transmission of speech, encompassing an audio frequency range of 300 to 3400 hertz (voiceband or commercial bandwidth). However, as long-distance trunks were gradually converted from analog to digital operation, the idea of being able <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> through the local loop (by utilizing frequencies above the voiceband) took hold, ultimately leading to DSL.|$|E
30|$|Certainly, {{the most}} common {{approach}} to connecting models and GIS has been through data conversion. People have been really resourceful and creative in writing custom programs <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> spatial <b>data</b> from GIS to a model, later covert the results back to display and further examined in GIS, using models such as AGNPS, HEC- 2, WASP 4, SHE and many others.|$|R
30|$|Another IAB {{project that}} aims <b>to</b> augment <b>PASS</b> <b>data</b> has started recently. The IAB plans to create mixed-method {{datasets}} by conducting semi-structured interviews with PASS respondents who are theoretically sampled {{with respect to}} research questions that cannot be fully answered by quantitative data. As a first step, these interviews will focus on recipients who overcome benefit receipt despite low model-predicted chances due to {{a high number of}} labour market impediments.|$|R
50|$|The station {{operated}} as {{a long-range}} surveillance radar station which provided information 24/7 {{to the air}} defense Direction Center at King Salmon AFS where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed {{and whether or not}} aircraft were friendly or hostile. An AN/FYQ-9 Semiautomatic Data Processing and Display System was installed and became operational in July 1965, eliminating the need <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> track <b>data</b> manually.|$|R
5000|$|The other goal of flow was {{to allow}} a service based view of the application. Any {{existing}} code is a service. Invoking functionality is akin to treating it as a [...] "black box" [...] requiring certain inputs (which are mapped from your available variables). The results of that operation are then treated as outputs of the [...] "black box". The concept of the [...] "pipeline" [...] is {{the means by which}} <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> to and get results back from invocation of services.|$|E
50|$|A key {{concept in}} the {{original}} Unix operating system {{was the idea of}} a pipe. A pipe was an abstraction that allowed data to be moved from program to program using the command line. Using pipes, users (or programmers) could link together multiple programs to complete tasks, feeding data through several small programs in turn. This contrasted with typical operating systems of the era, which required a single large program that could handle the entire task, or alternately, used files <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data,</b> which was resource expensive and time consuming.|$|E
5000|$|Access IS is an {{abbreviation}} of 'Access Interfacing Solutions'. [...] Originally Access Keyboards Limited, {{the company}} was renamed Access Ltd and adopted the brand name Access IS in October 2007 to reflect the broader product offering the company offered. The new logo device was intended to allude to the company's history in keyboard design by using {{the shape of a}} keyboard return key. The two interlocking shapes that make up the logo device was intended to represent the process of interfacing <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> between systems, or between media and host systems.|$|E
50|$|Unlike Mach's one-size-fits-all {{solution}} to IPC, Spring {{used a variety}} of methods <b>to</b> physically <b>pass</b> <b>data</b> between programs. One of these, the bulk-path, was basically identical to Mach's ports and messages, but in practice the bulk-path was the least common message type. For smaller messages Spring provided the vanilla-path, which directly copied the data from one space to another, something which proved to be faster than memory mapping in the real world for less than 5k of data.|$|R
5000|$|The current {{revision}} of the PHP manual mentions that the rationale behind magic quotes was to [...] "help prevent code written by beginners from being dangerous." [...] It was however originally introduced in PHP 2 as a php.h compile-time setting for msql, only escaping single quotes, [...] "making it easier <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> form <b>data</b> directly <b>to</b> msql queries". It originally {{was intended as a}} [...] "convenience feature, not as a security feature." ...|$|R
5|$|The HDMI {{standard}} {{was not designed}} <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> closed caption <b>data</b> (for example, subtitles) to the television for decoding. As such, any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to be viewed on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a DVD player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an HDTV has no way <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> Closed Captioning <b>data</b> so that the HDTV can decode it, {{as there is no}} line 21 VBI in that format.|$|R
