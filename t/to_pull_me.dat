500|$|When it {{was seen}} that NVA forces were pouring through the gap unimpeded, the no-fire zone was reduced at 10:00p.m. that night, but not before the action {{generated}} considerable debate. One ranking adviser commented, [...] "When viewed in relation to all {{the events of the}} day, a worse decision could not have been made." [...] The 3rd ARVN had lost most of its artillery in the first two days of the offensive, and in fact had surrendered two of their batteries intact to the NVA. Hambleton commented after the war, [...] "If the taxpayers and my neighbors knew what it cost <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>me</b> out of there, they'd probably shoot me." ...|$|E

This {{was the first time}} Cher appeared on the screen since Stuck on You (2003). Talking about the making of the film, Cher revealed, [...] "It’s harder to do things. I've beat my body up so badly, it's amazing it's still talking to me and listening to what I say. But I’ve got aches and pains everywhere." [...] The soundtrack was also revealed, with eight songs performed by Aguilera, and two songs by Cher: [...] "Welcome to Burlesque" [...] and [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me". During an interview with a California journal, Cher commented about [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me", [...] "That song, for me, had a lot of meaning. It reminded me that I have to kind of move over." [...] She also spoke about the track with the Fresno Bee, saying [...] "Not that I'm doing it gracefully, because you'd have <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>me</b> over kicking and screaming." [...] In the United States, the song was released to adult contemporary radio station on January 15, 2011 the first single from the soundtrack. In order to promote the song, several promotional remixes were made by Almighty, Dave Aude and StoneBridge. The remix EP, which contains uptempo dance versions of the track, was released onto iTunes Stores on November 24, 2010. The remix done by StoneBridge was released as a single on December 7, 2010. The song is also included in Cher's 25th studio album, Closer to the Truth (deluxe edition).|$|E
2500|$|Craig Marks of Billboard {{said that}} along with [...] "California Gurls", the songs [...] "are {{textbook}} summer singles whose ingenious pop hooks and zillion-dollar drum tracks are stamped with Perry's knack for a memorable line and frothy, gum-snapping persona." [...] As of January 2015, Billboard also named [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] as the second best song of 2010s (so far). James Montgomery of MTV commented that [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] showed a [...] "definite change of pace for Perry. While it's still as saccharine sweet as her previous hits, there's also a rather, well, mature quality to it (despite the title)." [...] Amos Barshad of New York said, [...] "Right now, it's feeling a bit too earnest, and not nearly as catchy as the follow-up single from Perry's first album ('Hot n Cold,' most definitely still a jam). That said, we are now mentally preparing ourselves for its ubiquity." [...] Alyssa Rosenberg of The Atlantic dismissed the lyrics as [...] "simply annoying and incoherent" [...] and added that [...] "the hook and chorus aren't nearly compelling enough <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>me</b> back into it." ...|$|E

This is a strong Republican deestric', and to git nominated on the Republican ticket {{is the same as}} an election. So what I want is the nomination. What do you say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course I am.

6000|$|... "It is {{what they}} say to me. They are always trying <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>me</b> to earth. 'Is it wholesome?' they say; 'nutritious?' I say to them, 'I do not know. I am an artist. I do not care. It is beautiful.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{the sort}} of line I use," [...] {{answered}} Hook, with satisfaction. [...] "I rather specialize in tackle, {{as a matter of}} fact. If he were strong enough to do that, he'd be strong enough <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>me</b> into the river." ...|$|E

60|$|I was stroke. I did my best. I {{feathered}} {{some two}} feet high, and I {{paused at the}} end of each stroke to let the blades drip before returning them, and I picked out a smooth bit of water to drop them into again each time. (Bow said, after a while, that he did not feel himself a sufficiently accomplished oarsman <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> with <b>me,</b> but that he would sit still, if I would allow him, and study my stroke. He said it interested him.) But, notwithstanding all this, and try as I would, I could not help an occasional flicker of water from going over those dresses.|$|R

500|$|The fourth game {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Destructoid criticized the fourth game for its excessively-loud jumpscares and the breathing mechanic being too difficult and confusing for players. Despite this, it was praised by one reviewer at GameZebo for its intense environment and creepy sounds and graphics, {{as well as}} its jumpscares. It was also given a mixed review by PC Gamer, who called it [...] "another rivet in the series' steel-clad design which immortalized its Let's Play legacy in a few short months" [...] and [...] "certainly the scariest of the four [...] ", but also criticized the gameplay, saying that [...] "the humdrum repetition of the same sequence over and over... is too much of a chore <b>to</b> fully <b>pull</b> <b>me</b> in", as well as criticizing the game's lack of the series's signature camera system.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I did not," [...] {{continued}} Bastin, [...] "since {{at present}} I {{have found no}} opportunity of saying a word in season.

[...] "Good-bye, little Weena," [...] I said, kissing her; and then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet for the {{climbing}} hooks.

Then she gave a most piteous cry, and running to <b>me,</b> she began <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> at <b>me</b> with her little hands. I think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed.
