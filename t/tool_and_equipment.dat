2500|$|Roush {{recognized}} Kvapil's talents, {{and helped}} return to Cup with Yates Racing in 2008. Kvapil drove the famous No. 28 Yates Ford Fusion. Prior {{to the start}} of the season, Kvapil and teammate David Gilliland did not have a full-time sponsorship on their Yates Racing Fords. While Gilliland's team found full-time sponsorship, Kvapil's team had to piece together sponsorship throughout the season. K Filters sponsored Kvapil's team for the Daytona 500. Two weeks later, Kvapil scored an eighth-place finish at Las Vegas Motor Speedway during the UAW-Dodge 400. [...] The finish at LVMS, which was in an unsponsored car, gave Kvapil his third Top 10 of his career. After the race, it was announced that Zaxby's would serve as a sponsorship for the No. 28 team in the Kobalt Tools 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, a race in which he finished 29th. With a one-race sponsorship deal with Northern <b>Tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>Equipment,</b> Kvapil finished sixth in the Aaron's 499 at Talladega. This gave him his career-best finish in the Sprint Cup Series. [...] Kvapil picked up another Top 10 finish in the Dodge Challenger 500 at Darlington. Despite the lack of sponsorship for the year, Kvapil collected another four Top 10 finishes, finisheing 23rd in the points standings. He also won the pole at the fall Talladega race, which turned out to be the last pole award for Yates Racing.|$|E
40|$|Due to low service {{quality of}} {{maintenance}} management, high maintenance cost becomes a common issue in building industry of Malaysia. Lack of preventive measure is the problem that resulting poor maintenance performance. So, condition-based maintenance is introduced to improve the maintenance performance. Monitoring <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> {{is seen as an}} important factor to ensure the efficiency of condition-based maintenance. So, this paper aims to determine the aspects of monitoring <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> to be concerned in building maintenance, as well as to establish the relationship between the aspects and maintenance cost performance. A quantitative approach is adopted and performed through questionnaire survey. Furthermore, descriptive analysis and correlation analysis are used to analyse the research data. The literature review determines three aspects of monitoring <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> to be considered in maintenance management. Furthermore, the research result demonstrates that the budget allocation for acquisition of monitoring <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment,</b> capability to operate the <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment,</b> as well as availability of the <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> are significantly correlated to the maintenance cost variance. The research recommends the maintenance management to convince the clients or organisation to acquire advanced monitoring <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> for implementation of condition-based maintenance. Besides that, provision of training is encouraged to ensure that the maintenance personnel are able to utilise the <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|R
