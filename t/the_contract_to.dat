Unfortunately, IS professional do not always pay close attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> or <b>to</b> its management and are often unaware of the legal implications of <b>the</b> <b>contracts</b> <b>to</b> which they are assenting. Legal advice can be sought during pre-contractual processes to help ensure that <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> meets <b>the</b> expectations of all the parties.
