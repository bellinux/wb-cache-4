5|$|In July 2011 Austrian pastafarian Niko Alm won <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> {{be shown}} in his driving license photo wearing a pasta {{strainer}} on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. He got the idea after reading that Austrian regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons. Some sources report that the colander {{in the form of}} pasta strainer, was recognised by Austrian authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011. This was denied by Austrian authorities, saying that religious motives were not the reason to grant the permission of wearing the headgear in a passport.|$|E
5|$|The unequal {{concentration}} of land ownership remained an emotional subject and was violently challenged in the 1880s through the Highland Land League. After {{the report of}} the Napier Commission of 1883, the government stepped in, passing the Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1886 to reduce rents, guarantee fixity of tenure, and break up large estates to provide crofts for the homeless. Explicit security was given for the Scottish smallholders; <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> bequeath tenancies to descendants and a Crofting Commission was created in 1886.|$|E

5|$|Under French law, both Sally and James {{could have}} petitioned for their freedom, as the 1789 revolutionary {{constitution}} in France abolished slavery in principle. Hemings had <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> remain in France {{as a free}} person; if she returned to Virginia with Jefferson, {{it would be as}} a slave. According to her son Madison's memoir, Hemings became pregnant by Jefferson in Paris. She was about 16 at the time. She agreed to return with him to the United States based on his promise to free their children when they reached the age of 21 years. Hemings' strong ties to her mother, siblings and extended family probably drew her back to Monticello.|$|E
5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He seeks <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{rejected}} the plaintiffs' argument that, by compulsorily acquiring a temple, the Government was limiting a person's right under Article 15(1) of the Constitution to profess, practice and propagate {{his or her}} religion, and that this in turn gave him or her <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> commence an action {{on the ground that}} where an individual's constitutional rights are affected, he or she has a sufficient interest to ensure that his or her rights are protected. The court ruling held that this land acquisition matter was not in any way related to religious freedom. Because the acquisition was not related to religious freedom, the High Court found that only the trustees who were the legal owners of the temple property had the requisite locus standi to institute proceedings if they deemed their rights to have been infringed.|$|E
