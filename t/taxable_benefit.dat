25|$|The {{exemption}} of employer-sponsored {{health benefits}} from federal income and payroll taxes distorts {{the health care}} market. The U.S. government, unlike some other countries, does not treat employer funded health care benefits as a <b>taxable</b> <b>benefit</b> in kind to the employee. The value of the lost tax revenue from a benefits in kind tax is an estimated $150billion a year.

50|$|Private {{healthcare}} {{has continued}} {{parallel to the}} NHS, paid for largely by private insurance, and is used by about 8% of the population (citation required), generally as an add-on to NHS services and mostly obtained by employer funded insurance schemes. That is a <b>taxable</b> <b>benefit</b> to the employee, the value imputed by the tax authorities as income to the beneficiary. Because NHS services are so comprehensive, there are many areas in which the private sector usually does not compete and private insurers almost always refuse to fund. Childbirth and perinatal services are good examples.|$|E

30|$|The QUAD agreements, however, had one {{critical}} flaw: they made provision for any government to terminate their involvement with one year’s notice. Moreover, {{agreement on the}} need to establish a strong pan-Canadian ECEC system did not extend across all parties. Thus when a Conservative government was elected in January 2006, one of its first acts was to announce the termination of its involvement. Reflecting its neo-liberal, social conservative ideology, the Conservative government created the so-called universal child care benefit — a <b>taxable</b> <b>benefit</b> of $ 100 a month for each child under six, which would cost the government $ 2.4 billion per annum. The pre-tax amount for parents falls well short of the over $ 500 monthly fee for children over 18 months. Moreover, the benefit offered the most to upper income families with a single breadwinner (Battle, Torjman, & Mendelson, 2006).|$|E

50|$|It {{emerged that}} Bourn {{travelled}} {{to and from}} his office in Victoria, London in a chauffeur driven vehicle at the taxpayers' expense. The financial cost of this is unknown due to it being funded directly from the consolidated fund and therefore not being included within the NAO's accounts.Additionally, the personal benefit to his wife of NAO-funded travel had not been fully accounted for. When Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs investigated these as <b>taxable</b> <b>benefits,</b> Bourn was found liable for 6 years of unpaid taxes - but the outstanding sum of about £100,000 (including a fine) was settled by the NAO out of taxpayers' money.

40|$|M. Comm. Fringe {{benefits}} {{in all its}} different understandings and debates is discussed in this research, {{in accordance with the}} Income Tax Act, Act 58 of 1962 (hereafter called the Act). The research is restricted to the provisions of the Act regarding fringe benefits as applied by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (hereafter called the Commissioner). The other forms of direct taxes in the Act is not dealt with and the only indirect tax that is discussed in this research is Value Added Tax (hereafter called VAT). To try and summarise the history of fringe {{benefits in}} a few paragraphs is virtually impossible. The following comments and statements by certain well-known tax consultants in a published tax magazine, are presented below in an attempt to achieve this: Fringe benefits phase-in " [...] . The taxation of fringe benefits is an emotional issue. And {{the manner in which the}} new regime for the taxation of these benefits has been introduced into our law has brought credit to no one. But the painfully protracted process has been instructive. It has been a Microcosm of the greater legislative process, and must have opened the eyes of many taxpayers. When the Seventh Schedule was introduced, there were four benefits to be phased in; the right of use of an asset (other than residential accommodation or a motor vehicle), the right of use of a motor vehicle, the occupation of residential accommodation and the granting of an interest-free or low-interest loan. When the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, having regard to the circumstances, is satisfied that a <b>taxable</b> <b>benefit</b> has been granted to an employee in substitution for remuneration that would normally have been payable to the employee in cash or with the sole or main object of providing the employee with the benefit of the phasing-in relief, the phasing-in relief will be unavailable [...] " (Stein, 1985 : 4) ...|$|E

40|$|Federal {{efforts are}} {{increasingly}} targeting surface water quality in urban watersheds throughout the U. S., {{as demonstrated by}} recent litigation between the EPA and the State of Florida. While the cost of achieving federal standards is ultimately borne by taxpayers, pollution abatement may generate diverse and wide-reaching <b>taxable</b> <b>benefits.</b> This study investigates the effects of enhanced water quality on property prices in urban housing markets. Hybrid specifications of hedonic price models employed in water quality and proximity valuation studies are estimated, and several hypotheses about the implicit value of water quality are tested. Findings indicate i) the value of increased water quality depends upon surface water size and declines rapidly as proximity to the waterfront diminishes, though the mean effect remains significant at several hundred meters; and ii) when housing density is considered, the aggregate benefits derived in the broader housing market may dominate those realized by waterfront homeowners.

30|$|Before {{looking at}} the redistributive effects of taxes and benefits, we {{consider}} the relative size of the tax benefit system and its components. We define {{the size of the}} tax benefit system as the sum of all tax-benefit components, i.e. all pensions, benefits, taxes, tax allowances, tax credits, social insurance contributions, employer contributions taken as a share of household disposable income 9. Using the aggregate sum of all tax and benefit components as an indicator of system size has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it can be roughly interpreted as system ‘reach’. The larger the share of taxes and benefits, the lower the share of original market incomes and thus the higher the potential for redistribution. On the other hand, the measure incorporates some churning. For example, including the sum of the tax (schedule), tax allowances and tax credits elements will yield considerably larger values of system size compared to including net taxes only, at least in some countries. Similarly, countries that offer higher <b>taxable</b> <b>benefits</b> will appear to have a larger tax-benefit size compared countries that offer lower non-taxable benefits, albeit the effect in disposable income may be exactly the same.|$|R

40|$|Single-employer, defined-benefit (DB) {{pension plans}} in Canada are in decline. Among the reasons: laws and {{regulations}} that foster under-funding of these plans by their sponsors (Laidler and Robson 2007). A {{case in point is}} the prohibition by the federal Income Tax Act (ITA) of sponsor contributions to such plans when their assets exceed recorded liabilities by 10 percent. 1 Recent volatility in asset prices and interest rates, and resulting volatility in DB plan balance sheets, highlights the desirability of raising — or even removing — this restriction. The 10 percent limit exists to prevent companies making pension contributions, which are tax deductible, to reduce <b>taxable</b> profits. The <b>benefit</b> of the limit is marginal at best, however, since (i) businesses will typically prefer to reinvest their earnings or pay them out as dividends, (ii) pension funds attract tax when distributed or withdrawn, and (iii) regulations prevent deliberate over-funding of designated plans.

50|$|The Benefit Financing Model is {{composed}} of two programs. Program One, the Projection Program, {{is based on the}} methodology of empirical econometric modeling. It uses regressions to derive mathematical relationships between key UI variables, and projects UI <b>benefits,</b> <b>taxable</b> wages, as well as workload variables on quarterly basis twelve years into the future. Program Two, the Financial Forecast Program, is based on the methodology of simulation modeling. It estimates Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) income by simulating the workings of the State's taxation system. Combined with the UTF outgo estimated by the Projection Program, the Financial Forecast Program is capable of projecting the dynamic flow of the Unemployment Trust Fund on quarterly basis under different economic and legislative scenarios. Furthermore, the Financial Forecast Program also assesses the adequacy level of the UTF under different scenarios and report solvency measures (such as Reserve Ratio, Average high cost multiple, etc.)on annual basis. If the trust fund should become insolvent and borrowing from the Federal Government is projected, the Program is able to assess loan interests, any reduced FUTA credits (also known as FUTA credit reduction), and other key loan variables. Lastly, the Projection Program can also be run independently to perform benefit cost estimation as well as workload forecasting.|$|R
