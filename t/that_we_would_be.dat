500|$|The paper {{maintains}} a strict profanity policy. A 2007 {{review of a}} concert by punk band Fucked Up, for example, completely avoided mention of the group's name. However, the Times has on occasion published unfiltered video content that includes profanity and slurs where it has determined that such video has news value. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, the Times did print the words [...] "fuck" [...] and [...] "pussy," [...] among others, when reporting on the vulgar statements made by Donald Trump in a 2005 recording. Times politics editor Carolyn Ryan said: [...] "It's a rare thing for us to use this language in our stories, even in quotes, and we discussed it at length," [...] ultimately deciding to publish it because of its news value and because [...] "o leave it out or simply describe it seemed awkward and less than forthright to us, especially given <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> running a video that showed our readers exactly what was said." ...|$|E
500|$|Co-showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman co-wrote the episode's teleplay, while Pinkner, Wyman, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman co-wrote the story. Executive producer Joe Chappelle served as director. A full season renewal of Fringe was announced on March 24, 2011. They {{had written the}} finale without knowing {{if there would be}} another season, but decided not to make any changes to the script even after hearing of its renewal. Pinkner explained that [...] "we wrote the episode, perhaps foolishly, assuming <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on for Season 4. We never for one second entertained that it {{would be the end of}} the series. So therefore, we didn't have to change a word!" [...] In an interview with the New York Post, Pinkner warned that events in the finale will [...] "unfurl in a very unexpected way for the characters and the audience". He also commented that the finale [...] "hopefully will make you sort of revisit and look at everything that's happened all year through a fresh pair of glasses".|$|E

500|$|The {{final three}} episodes {{of the season}} were [...] "linked in one {{continuous}} story arc," [...] and meant to seem like [...] "you're turning the last page of a chapter in a novel. And usually in a good novel, the last pages [...] compels you forward with {{a new understanding of}} what the subject matter is and you get deeper and you can’t wait to turn that page." [...] The crew wrote the finale before the season was officially renewed, but deigned to leave it unchanged once discovering that a fourth season had been approved. Pinkner explained that [...] "we wrote the episode, perhaps foolishly, assuming <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on for Season 4. We never for one second entertained that it {{would be the end of}} the series. So therefore, we didn't have to change a word!" [...] The finale was designed to establish the groundwork by [...] "open a new chapter" [...] for the new season, which included Peter having never existed. Its futuristic storyline was meant to [...] "inform the present of the show with some thematic elements," [...] establishing to viewers that [...] "our world is going to break down." ...|$|E
500|$|Production of Crash Bandicoot: Warped {{began on}} January 1998, with Naughty Dog given only ten {{and a half}} months and a budget of 2.2 million to {{complete}} the game. Crash Bandicoot - Time Line ] |publisher=Naughty Dog |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }} Programmers Andy Gavin, Stephen White and Greg Omi created three new gameplay engines for the game. Two of the three new engines were three-dimensional in nature and were created for the airplane and jet-ski levels; the third new engine was created for the motorcycle levels in the style of a driving simulator. The new engines combined make up a third of the game, while the other two-thirds of the game consist of the same engine used in the previous games. Jason Rubin explained that the [...] "classic" [...] engine and game style was preserved due {{to the success of the}} previous two games and went on to say that [...] "were we to abandon that style of gameplay, that would mean <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> abandoning a significant proportion of gamers out there." [...] An arbitrary plane z-buffer was created for the jet-ski and flooded Egyptian hallway levels of the game. To create a completely fluid feel for the water on these levels, an environment map that reflects the sky was fitted onto the surface of the water. A real shadow was given to the Crash character at the request of the Sony Computer Entertainment America producers, who were [...] "sick of that little discus that's following him around." [...] To create an [...] "arcade" [...] experience in the airplane levels and to differentiate them from flight simulators, the enemy planes were programmed to come out in front of the player and give the player ample time to shoot them before they turn around and shoot the player rather than come up behind the player and hit them from behind. The Relic system was introduced to give players a reason to return to the game after it has been completed.|$|E

40|$|One {{feature of}} vague predicates is that, {{as far as}} {{appearances}} go, they lack sharp application boundaries. I argue <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> able to locate boundaries even if vague predicates had sharp boundaries. I do so by developing an idealized cognitive model of a categorization faculty which has mobile and dynamic sortals (`classes', `concepts' or `categories') and formally prove {{that the degree of}} precision with which boundaries of such sortals can be located is inversely constrained by their flexibility. Given the literature, it is plausible <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are appropriately like the model. Hence, an inability to locate sharp boundaries is not necessarily because there are none; boundaries could be sharp and it <b>is</b> plausible <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> nevertheless <b>be</b> unable to locate them...|$|R

2500|$|He {{declined}} to reassess the alternative, objective test of entrapment proposed by Justice Owen Roberts in his Sorrells concurrence, {{that the focus}} should be on how the government acted rather than the defendant's state of mind. He believed that such a focus would unnecessarily burden prosecutors as {{they would not be}} able to raise predisposition in response to any defense attempt to examine police conduct; and that lower courts had ruled that juries should be allowed to consider entrapment, not judges as Roberts had proposed. [...] "To dispose of this case on the ground suggested would entail both overruling a leading decision of this Court and brushing aside the possibility <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> creating more problems than we would supposedly be solving," [...] he said in conclusion.|$|E
2500|$|A {{high-ranking}} IAF {{officer said}} on July 31 that the IDF had targeted the village since July 28, when it struck 10 targets there, {{and that the}} building that was hit on July 30 was chosen as a target after Israeli intelligence indicated that Hezbollah soldiers along with Katyusha rockets and launchers were hidden inside. [...] The IDF has claimed that the airstrike {{was in response to}} over 150 Katyusha rockets fired from the area of the village into Israel in a two-week period. The IDF also said that they believed the building to be empty. [...] "We warned the residents <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> attacking there," [...] a high-ranking IDF officer said, [...] "We work under the belief that the villages are empty and that whoever is there is affiliated with Hezbollah." [...] Amnesty accused Israel of assuming without grounds that its alleged warnings to civilians were acted upon, and firing indiscriminately at civilians remaining based on that assumption.|$|E
2500|$|Regardless of {{the danger}} they knew the al Qaeda would treat Roberts badly and {{time was running out}} for him. Despite intense ground fire, the six men {{successfully}} returned to Takur Ghar. Nevertheless, the battle continued and Sergeant Chapman was killed along with several enemy fighters. Surrounded by gunfire, the men on the ground called upon a Quick Reaction Force (QRF), designed for such emergencies. Those forces consisted of 23 men and two helicopters. The team included Tech Sergeant Miller. [...] "We were notified <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> launching in 45 minutes," [...] he recalled, [...] "and were going into [...] infested area." [...] Also on the team were Army Rangers. During Operation Enduring Freedom, Rangers and special operations formed {{the focal point of the}} U.S. ground campaign. [...] Because of communications failures, the Quick Reaction Force landed in the same spot as the previous helicopters and, like them, was greeted with gunfire. Miller's helicopter managed to land, and the QRF called in close air support. For the next five and a half hours, they battled with the enemy. Three Rangers died and others were wounded.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2011, Madonna held {{a private}} {{screening}} of the film's trailer at the Berlin Film Festival. The attendance included a Q session from Madonna and was intended to sell the film to distributors. The rights were acquired by Optimum Releasing for the UK market, The Weinstein Company for the US release and Village Roadshow for Australia and New Zealand. Weinstein promoted the film as Madonna's first full-length directorial venture, since her previous directed film, Filth and Wisdom, was considered a short film by them for its runtime of 81minutes. Madonna had hoped to premiere the film at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, but could not do so since she was still making finishing touches to the soundtrack and there were three weeks more of post-production to complete before the film {{was ready to be}} screened to an international audience. A representative for the film festival said that, [...] "hile the movie's distributors will attend the festival, they will preview select cuts to buyers at private screenings instead of showing the entire feature." [...] The Daily Mail columnist Baz Bamingboye reported <b>that</b> <b>W.E.</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> premiered at the 2011 Venice Film Festival, where it would be screened out of the competition. W.E. was shown at the festival on September 1, 2011, with Madonna attending the premiere, along with the principal cast. Other film festivals where W.E. was shown included the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival in the same month. Along with the film festivals, still images from W.E. were released in the September 2011 issue of Vanity Fair magazine.|$|E

[...] Third-place finisher di Grassi praised the track and the race weekend but acknowledged his team did not have the pace to stay with both Mahindra cars. However, he spoke of his enjoyment with his battle against Vergne and claimed his car was quicker in the second race: [...] "Yesterday we found some pace, which meant we could keep up a little bit with these guys, but we need to improve.
