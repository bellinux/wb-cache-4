25|$|As a {{child of}} imagination, Anne takes much joy in life and adapts quickly, {{thriving}} in the close-knit farming village. Her imagination and <b>talkativeness</b> soon brighten up Green Gables.|$|E
25|$|As {{a central}} nervous system depressant, ethanol {{is one of the}} most {{commonly}} consumed psychoactive drugs. It can lift mood, cause feelings of euphoria, decrease anxiety, and increase sociability and <b>talkativeness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ramakrishna was skilled {{with words}} {{and had an}} {{extraordinary}} style of preaching and instructing, which may have helped convey his ideas {{to even the most}} skeptical temple visitors. His speeches reportedly revealed a sense of joy and fun, but he was not at a loss when debating with intellectual philosophers. Philosopher Arindam Chakrabarti contrasted Ramakrishna's <b>talkativeness</b> with Buddha's legendary reticence, and compared his teaching style to that of Socrates.|$|E
25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Talk to a lot of different people at parties or Often feel uncomfortable around others. While some statement-based measures of extraversion/introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about <b>talkativeness</b> in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited to use outside America. For instance, statements like Keep in the background and Know how to captivate people are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand except in a literal sense.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{was one of}} {{the first}} people to define {{introversion}} and extraversion in a psychological context. In Jung’s Psychological Types, he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories, the introvert and the extravert. These two psychological types Jung compares to ancient archetypes, Apollo and Dionysus. The introvert is likened with Apollo, who shines light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception and action. Energetic and lively, the extrovert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits. Jungian introversion and extraversion is quite different from the modern idea of introversion and extroversion. Modern theories often stay true to behaviourist means of describing such a trait (sociability, <b>talkativeness,</b> assertiveness etc.) whereas Jungian introversion and extraversion is expressed as a perspective: introverts interpret the world subjectively, whereas extraverts interpret the world objectively.|$|E
25|$|Another {{common cause}} of {{psychotic}} symptoms is substance intoxication. These acute symptoms may resolve {{after a period of}} observation or limited psychopharmacological treatment. However the underlying issues, such as substance dependence or abuse, is difficult to treat in the emergency room, as it is a long term condition. Both acute alcohol intoxication as well as other forms of substance abuse can require psychiatric interventions. Acting as a depressant of the central nervous system, the early effects of alcohol are usually desired for and characterized by increased <b>talkativeness,</b> giddiness, and a loosening of social inhibitions. Besides considerations of impaired concentration, verbal and motor performance, insight, judgment and short term memory loss which could result in behavioral change causing injury or death, levels of alcohol below 60 milligrams per deciliter of blood are usually considered non-lethal. However, individuals at 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood are considered grossly intoxicated and concentration levels at 400 milligrams per deciliter of blood are lethal, causing complete anesthesia of the respiratory system. Beyond the dangerous behavioral changes that occur after the consumption of certain amounts of alcohol, idiosyncratic intoxication could occur in some individuals even after the consumption of relatively small amounts of alcohol. Episodes of this impairment usually consist of confusion, disorientation, delusions and visual hallucinations, increased aggressiveness, rage, agitation and violence. Chronic alcoholics may also suffer from alcoholic hallucinosis, wherein the cessation of prolonged drinking may trigger auditory hallucinations. Such episodes can last for a few hours or an entire week. Antipsychotics are often used to treat these symptoms.|$|E
500|$|Birds, too, may symbolise human {{attributes}} such as stupidity or <b>talkativeness.</b> People {{have been}} called [...] "birdbrain" [...] or [...] "cuckoo", among many other animal epithets. Birds feature prominently in often derogatory similes like [...] "noisy as a goose" [...] and metaphors including [...] "to parrot".|$|E
2500|$|Butler {{wrote that}} Genie rapidly became far more verbal {{and that the}} man she was dating, who {{moved in with her}} during Genie's stay and was a well known {{psychologist}} and retired University of Southern California professor, commented on Genie's <b>talkativeness.</b> She specifically claimed that she taught Genie to say [...] "yes" [...] to other people, to use negative word forms, and to express her anger through words or by hitting objects. Butler said Genie argued with her in late July and used negatives in her protestations, the first report of Genie using negatives in a sentence and of expressing disagreement in language. In an early August letter to Jay Shurley Butler wrote that Genie regularly used two-word sentences and sometimes produced three-word utterances, giving [...] "one black kitty" [...] as an example, containing two adjacent adjectives to describe nouns, and that in a recent conversation Genie extensively used negative words and sentences. Butler also reported that a few days prior, when she asked Genie why she threw her new pet goldfish outside, Genie explained, [...] "bad orange fish—no eat—bad fish", which would have been by far her longest utterance to that point.|$|E
60|$|Grace looked {{somewhat}} alarmed, being {{perhaps in}} some dread of immunities, and aware that Rachel's silence would {{in any one}} else have been <b>talkativeness.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>Talkativeness</b> had it. Dignity retired hurt. Speech {{came from}} him in a rush. When he brought off an {{excellent}} drive from the eighteenth tee, he seemed to forget everything.|$|E
60|$|My anxiety {{to examine}} the {{register}} did not dispose me to offer much encouragement to the old man's <b>talkativeness.</b> I agreed with him that nobody could help the untidiness of the vestry, and then suggested that we should proceed to our business without more delay.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{they have}} nothing to gain--everything is theirs already!' his {{companion}} rejoined, as if she took this speech quite literally. Her <b>talkativeness</b> was systematic--she fraternised as seriously as she might have played whist. 'They do as they like--they fill the house with people--they have carte blanche.' ...|$|E
60|$|In sum, Borabolla loved Jarl; and Jarl, {{pleased with}} this sociable monarch, {{for all his}} garrulity, esteemed him the most {{sensible}} old gentleman and king he had as yet seen in Mardi. For this reason, perhaps; that his <b>talkativeness</b> favored that silence in listeners, which was my Viking's delight in himself.|$|E
60|$|She {{strove to}} enliven the dinner by talking of Hiltonbury, and of Juliana's marriage, thus {{awakening}} Owen into life and <b>talkativeness</b> {{so much in}} his light ordinary humour, as to startle them both. Lucilla would have encouraged it as preferable to his gloom, but it was decidedly repressed by Robert.|$|E
60|$|When, with a {{sequence}} of shocking shots, he took the seventeenth hole in seven, {{he was in a}} parlous condition. His run of success had engendered within him a desire for conversation. He wanted, as it were, to flap his wings and crow. I could see Dignity wrestling with <b>Talkativeness.</b> I gave him the lead.|$|E
60|$|Under these circumstances, {{he offered}} the brethren his company in their ramblings about the town. This {{they thought it}} wise not to refuse, {{although}} they felt little confidence in the man, believing that {{it was he who}} had found out their story and true names and revealed them to Masouda, either through <b>talkativeness</b> or with a purpose.|$|E
60|$|At this point, the Doctor knocked, {{summoning}} Israel {{to his own}} apartment. Here, after a cup of weak tea, and {{a little}} toast, the two had a long, familiar talk together; during which, Israel was delighted with the unpretending <b>talkativeness,</b> serene insight, and benign amiability of the sage. But, for all this, he could hardly forgive him for the Cologne and Otard depredations.|$|E
60|$|This {{rigorous}} mode of treatment, I have observed, invariably brings {{persons in}} the lower class of life to their senses. It brought Louis to HIS senses. He was so obliging as to leave off grinning, and inform me that a Young Person was outside wanting to see me. He added (with the odious <b>talkativeness</b> of servants), that her name was Fanny.|$|E
6000|$|Kurt {{came in with}} {{a general}} air of {{ignoring}} Bert, but muttering to himself in English nevertheless. [...] "Stupendous!" [...] Bert heard him say. [...] "Here!" [...] he said, [...] "get off this locker." [...] And he proceeded to rout out two books and a case of maps. He spread them on the folding-table, and stood regarding them. For a time his Germanic discipline struggled with his English informality and his natural kindliness and <b>talkativeness,</b> and at last lost.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a short}} silence, apparently, while Mr Abel {{went through}} the {{prescribed}} form, and then the shaking of hands and shuffling of feet were renewed, and shortly afterwards there was a clinking of wine-glasses and a great <b>talkativeness</b> {{on the part of}} everybody. In about {{a quarter of an hour}} Mr Chuckster (with a pen behind his ear and his face inflamed with wine) appeared at the door, and condescending to address Kit by the jocose appellation of 'Young Snob,' informed him that the visitors were coming out.|$|E
6000|$|On {{re-entering}} {{his room}} {{the third or}} fourth morning after his advent at the Summit House, she noticed with some concern that there was a slight flush on his cheek and a certain exaltation which she at first thought presaged fever. But an examination of his pulse and temperature dispelled that fear, and his <b>talkativeness</b> and good spirits convinced her that it was only his youthful vigor at last overcoming his despondency. A few days later, this cheerfulness not being continued, Dr. Duchesne followed Miss Trotter into the hall. [...] "We must try to keep our patient from moping in his confinement, you know," [...] he began, with a slight smile, [...] "and he seems to be somewhat of an emotional nature, accustomed to be amused and--er--er--petted." ...|$|E
60|$|Yet {{whatever}} {{the value of}} taciturnity to a man among strangers, it is apt to express more than <b>talkativeness</b> when he dwells among friends. The countryman who is obliged to judge {{the time of day}} from changes in external nature sees a thousand successive tints and traits in the landscape which are never discerned by him who hears the regular chime of a clock, because they are never in request. In like manner do we use our eyes on our taciturn comrade. The infinitesimal movement of muscle, curve, hair, and wrinkle, which when accompanied by a voice goes unregarded, is watched and translated in the lack of it, till virtually the whole surrounding circle of familiars is charged with the reserved one's moods and meanings.|$|E
60|$|They drove {{along in}} silence, past the snow-powdered hedges of spruce, {{and under the}} arches of the forest roadways. They were late, and a great stillness was over all the land. David Bell never spoke. All his usual cheerful <b>talkativeness</b> had {{disappeared}} since the revival meetings had begun in Avonlea. From the first he had gone about as a man over whom some strange doom is impending, seemingly oblivious to all that might be said or thought of him in his own family or in the church. Mary Bell thought she would go {{out of her mind}} if her husband continued to act in this way. Her reflections were bitter and rebellious as they sped along through the glittering night of the winter's prime.|$|E
60|$|On {{his return}} to Fairoaks the next day, Major Pendennis did not say what had {{happened}} to him on the previous night, or allude to the company in which he had passed it. But he engaged Mr. Smirke to stop to dinner; and any person accustomed to watch his manner might have remarked that there was something constrained in his hilarity and <b>talkativeness,</b> and that he was unusually gracious and watchful in his communications with his nephew. He gave Pen an emphatic God-bless-you when the lad went to bed; and as they were about to part for the night, he seemed as if he was going to say something to Mrs. Pendennis, but he bethought him that if he spoke he might spoil her night's rest, and allowed her to sleep in peace.|$|E
60|$|Here, {{he got on}} glibly enough. Trumpery little {{scandals and}} quarrels in the town, some of {{them as much as}} a month old, {{appeared}} to recur to his memory readily. He chattered on, with something of the smooth gossiping fluency of former times. But there were moments, even in the full flow of his <b>talkativeness,</b> when he suddenly hesitated--looked at me for a moment with the vacant inquiry once more in his eyes--controlled himself--and went on again. I submitted patiently to my martyrdom (it is surely nothing less than martyrdom to a man of cosmopolitan sympathies, to absorb in silent resignation the news of a country town?) until the clock on the chimney-piece told me that my visit had been prolonged beyond half an hour. Having now some right to consider the sacrifice as complete, I rose to take leave. As we shook hands, Mr. Candy reverted to the birthday festival of his own accord.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In Africa!' said Albinia, well-nigh asleep, but Genevieve's laugh roused her again, {{partly because}} she thought it less mannerly than accorded with the girl's usual politeness. No mere sleep was allowed her; an astronomical passion seemed to have possessed the young lady, and she dashed into the tides, and {{the causes of the}} harvest-moon, and volcanoes, and thunderbolts, and Lord Rosse's telescope, forcing her tired friend to reply by direct appeals, till Albinia almost wished her in the moon herself; and was rejoiced when in the dim {{greyness}} of the early summer dawn, the carriage drew up at Madame Belmarche's house. As the light from the weary maid's candle flashed on Genevieve's face, it revealed such a glow of deep crimson on each brown cheek, that Albinia perceived that the excitement must have been almost fever, and went to bed speculating on the strange effects of a touch of gaiety on the hereditary French nature, startling her at once from her graceful propriety and humility of demeanour, into such extraordinary obtrusive <b>talkativeness.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{time went}} on Philip's {{deformity}} ceased to interest. It was accepted like one boy's red hair and another's unreasonable corpulence. But meanwhile he had grown horribly sensitive. He never ran if he could help it, because he knew it made his limp more conspicuous, and he adopted a peculiar walk. He stood still {{as much as he}} could, with his club-foot behind the other, so that it should not attract notice, and he was constantly on the look out for any reference to it. Because he could not join in the games which other boys played, their life remained strange to him; he only interested himself from the outside in their doings; and {{it seemed to him that}} there was a barrier between them and him. Sometimes they seemed to think that it was his fault if he could not play football, and he was unable to make them understand. He was left a good deal to himself. He had been inclined to <b>talkativeness,</b> but gradually he became silent. He began to think of the difference between himself and others.|$|E
60|$|The {{people have}} the same great merit which I had {{previously}} observed among their Cornish neighbours--the merit of good manners. We two strangers were so little stared at as we walked about, {{that it was almost}} like being on the Continent. The pilot who had taken us into Hugh Town harbour we found to be a fair specimen, as regarded his excessive <b>talkativeness</b> and the purity of his English, of the islanders generally. The longest tellers of very long stories, so far as my experience goes, {{are to be found in}} Scilly. Ask the people the commonest question, and their answer generally exhausts the whole subject before you can say another word. Their anxiety, whenever we had occasion to inquire our way, to guard us from the remotest chance of missing it, and the honest pride with which they told us all about local sights and marvels, formed a very pleasant trait in the general character. Wherever we went, we found the natural kindness and natural hospitality of the people always ready to welcome us.|$|E
6000|$|Valentine {{certainly}} did stare. He was standing up, {{leaning against the}} wall, and looking about him in a woefully dazed condition. Either his nap, or the alarming manner {{in which he had}} been awakened from it, had produced a decided change for the worst in him. As he slowly recovered what little sense he had left to make use of, all his <b>talkativeness</b> and cordiality seemed to desert him. He shook his head mournfully; refused to eat or drink anything; declared with sullen solemnity, that his digestion was [...] "a perfect wreck in consequence of his keeping drunken society;" [...] and insisted on going home directly, in spite of everything that Zack could say to him. The landlord, who had been brought from his shop below by the noise, and who thought it very desirable to take the first opportunity that offered of breaking up the party before any more grog was consumed, officiously ran down stairs, and called a cab--the result of this maneuver proving in the sequel to be what the tobacconist desired. The moment the sound of wheels was heard at the door, Mr. Blyth clamored peremptorily for his hat and coat; and, after some little demur, was at last helped into the cab in the most friendly and attentive manner by Mat himself.|$|E
60|$|So now {{as she lay}} {{waiting for}} him she dreamed of him and of all that he meant to her. She {{compared}} him with The Sheik, her father, and at thought of the stern, grizzled, old Arab she shuddered. Even the savage blacks had been less harsh to her than he. Not understanding their tongue she could not guess what purpose they had in keeping her a prisoner. She knew that man ate man, and she had expected to be eaten; {{but she had been}} with them for some time now and no harm had befallen her. She did not know that a runner had been dispatched to the distant village of The Sheik to barter with him for a ransom. She did not know, nor did Kovudoo, that the runner had never reached his destination--that he had fallen in with the safari of Jenssen and Malbihn and with the <b>talkativeness</b> of a native to other natives had unfolded his whole mission to the black servants of the two Swedes. These had not been long in retailing the matter to their masters, and the result was that when the runner left their camp to continue his journey he had scarce passed from sight before there came the report of a rifle and he rolled lifeless into the underbrush with a bullet in his back.|$|E

50|$|Like composure, extroversion is {{composed}} of four seemingly synonymous values. These are aggressiveness, boldness, <b>talkativeness</b> (i.e. talkative vs. silent), and voice (i.e., verbal vs. quiet).|$|E

50|$|Flunitrazepam {{may cause}} a {{paradoxical}} reaction in some individuals causing symptoms including anxiety, aggressiveness, agitation, confusion, disinhibition, loss of impulse control, <b>talkativeness,</b> violent behavior, and even convulsions.

50|$|Woodmore first {{realised}} {{his skills}} at rapid speech {{when he was}} seven years old. At school, he was asked by his form teacher to recite an 8-minute speech, as a punishment for his <b>talkativeness.</b> It took him only two minutes.|$|E
