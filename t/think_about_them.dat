The villains' physical appearances were also embellished to differentiate them from other characters, {{making it easier for}} a reader to follow the story and identify the villains, even in heated battle scenes. Kishimoto noted that making the villains [...] "flamboyant" [...] with a [...] "showy costume" [...] is [...] "one of my guiding principles", as well as making them [...] "more memorable".|$|E

Chadwick later said that he realised that [...] "a nuclear bomb was not only possible—it was inevitable. Sooner or later these ideas could not be peculiar to us.

Series creator Ryan Murphy explained: [...] "The theme of Regionals is celebrity judges. Sue is now a nationwide celebrity. And Olivia and Josh only like choirs that sing their songs, so that's funny. They {{wanted to do something}} that played against what people <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>them...</b> to play against type. So we gave them an opportunity.

On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E

On {{the basis of an}} extensive survey, the leadership experts James Kouzes and Barry Posner concluded that the most neglected thing in leadership evaluations is how the leader seeks feedback from the organization [27]. In other words, most leaders are not interested in listening to what the organization <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> While this may be in line with prevalent thinking, it is devastating to the organization itself and especially to the leader’s ability to understand his/her own level of development.|$|R
2500|$|Cherryh uses {{a writing}} {{technique}} she has variously labeled [...] "very tight limited third person", [...] "intense third person", and [...] "intense internal" [...] voice. In this approach, {{the only things}} the writer narrates are those that the viewpoint character specifically notices or thinks about. If a starship captain arrives at a space station, for example, the narration may not mention important features of the station with which the captain is already familiar, even though these things might {{be of interest to}} the reader, because the captain does not notice them or <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> due to their familiarity. This technique can offer a similar experience to that of reading the viewpoint character's mind—sometimes at great length—and thus it can resemble stream of consciousness narrative.|$|E

The computer-generated landscapes bring to mind, of course, virtual worlds, video games, special effects – that is, ways of producing unrealities.

It was better, he believed, just to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Plato expressed hostility to observation and experiment. He taught contempt for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge.
