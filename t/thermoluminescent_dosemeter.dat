40|$|This study {{investigated}} the dosimetric properties of the high sensitivity TLD (<b>Thermoluminescent</b> <b>Dosemeter)</b> of LiF:Mg,Cu, P and its applications in diagnostic radiology. A reproducible readout and annealing regime for this high sensitivity TLD {{was developed in the}} initial part of this study with the newly installed automatic TLD Reader system. Basic dosimetric characteristics of this T. L. dosemeter were then investigated. This paved the foundation for subsequent selected novel application studies in diagnostic radiology. This study exploits the favourable dosimetric properties of these T. L. dosemeters in some selected novel dosimetric applications in diagnostic radiology with an anthropomorphic phantom. The applications studied in radiological procedures included: dose reduction in lumbar spine radiography utilizing the "anode heel effect"; gonad dose variation with kVp in chest radiography; foetal dose comparison between computed tomography (CT) and computed radiography (CR) in X-ray pelvimetry; lens dose reduction with bismuth eye-shields in CT brain studies; foetal dose assessment of early pregnancy in common high risk radiological examinations. It is anticipated that the unique and favourable dosimetric performance of LiF:Mg,Cu,P T. L. phosphor will be exploited further in measurements of low level dose received by patients and staff in diagnostic radiological procedures such as paediatric X-ray examinations.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of thyroid collars on radiation dose during cone beam CT (CBCT) scanning. Methods: Average tissue-absorbed dose for a NewTom 9000 CBCT scanner (Quantitative Radiology, Verona, Italy) was measured using <b>thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeter</b> chips in a phantom. The scans were carried out with and without thyroid collars. Effective organ dose and total effective dose were derived using International Commission on Radiological Protection 2007 recommendations. Results: The effective organ doses for the thyroid gland and oesophagus were 31. 0 µSv and 2. 4 µSv, respectively, during CBCT scanning without a collar around the neck. When the thyroid collars were used loosely around the neck, no effective organ dose reduction was observed. When one thyroid collar was used tightly on the front of the neck, the effective organ dose for the thyroid gland and oesophagus were reduced to 15. 9 µSv (48. 7 % reduction) and 1. 4 µSv (41. 7 % reduction), respectively. Similar organ dose reduction (46. 5 % and 41. 7 %) was achieved when CBCT scanning was performed with two collars tightly on the front and back of the neck. However, the differences to the total effective dose were not significant among the scans with and without collars around the neck (p = 0. 775). Conclusions: Thyroid collars can effectively reduce the radiation dose to the thyroid and oesophagus if used appropriately...|$|E

This research aims {{to investigate the}} effect of tube potential variation on gonad doses to patients during posteroanterior (PA) chest radiography examinations. This study was carried out using a Toshiba general purpose X-ray unit and a Rando phantom. Dose measuring equipment included an ion chamber system, a dose-area product (DAP) meter and a <b>thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeter</b> (TLD) reader system with high sensitivity TLD pellets of LiF:Mg,Cu,P for low level gonad dose measurement. PA chest exposures of the phantom to produce a constant exit dose were made using a standard low tube potential (range 60 - 100 kVp) non-grid technique and a high tube potential (range 95 - 150 kVp) grid technique. Entrance surface doses (ESDs) and DAPs were {{also included in the}} measurements. Effective doses (EDs) were computed from ESD and DAP measurements using NRPB-SR 262 and Xdose software. Results show that with the low tube potential technique both ovary dose and testes dose increase with increasing tube potential; statistically significant correlations of r= 0. 994 (p= 0. 0006) and r= 0. 998 (p= 0. 001), respectively, were found. For both organs, doses increase at a rate of approximately 2 % per kVp. With the high tube potential technique there is insignificant correlation between gonad doses and tube potential. When comparing patient doses from typical exposures made at 70 kVp (low tube potential non-grid technique) with doses from exposures made at 120 kVp (high tube potential grid technique), the high tube potential technique delivers significantly higher values for ESD, and ovary, testes and effective doses by factors of 1. 7, 5. 2, 5. 5 and 2. 7, respectively.

40|$|Patient dose in {{diagnostic}} radiology is usually {{expressed in terms}} of organ dose and effective dose. The latter is used as a measure of the stochastic risk. Determinations of these doses are obtained by measurements (<b>Thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeters)</b> or by calculations (Monte Carlo simulation). Conversion factors for the calculation of effective dose from dose-area product (DAP) values are commonly used to determine radiation dose in conventional x-ray imaging to realize radiation risks for different investigations, and for different ages. The exposure can easily be estimated by converting the DAP into an effective dose. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the conversion factor in procedures by computing the ratio between effective dose and DAP for fluoroscopic cardiac procedures in adults and for conventional lung and urography examinations in children. <b>Thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeters</b> (TLD) were placed in an anthropomorphic phantom (Alderson Rando phantom) and child phantom (one year old) in order to measure the organ dose and compute the effective dose. A DAP meter was used to measure dose-area product. MC calculations of radiation transport in mathematical anthropomorphic phantoms were used to obtain the effective dose for the same conditions with DAP as input data. The deviation between the measured and calculated data was less than 10 %. The conversion factor for cardiac procedures varies between 0. 19 mSvGy- 1 cm- 2 and 0. 18 mSvGy- 1 cm- 2, for TLD respective MC. For paediatric simulation of a one year old phantom the average conversion factor for urography was 1. 34 mSvGy- 1 cm- 2 and 1, 48 mSvGy- 1 cm- 2 for TLD respective MC. This conversion factor will decrease to 1. 07 mSvGy- 1 cm- 2 using the TLD method, if the new ICRP (ICRP Publication 103) weighting factors were used to calculate the effective dose. For lung investigations, the conversion factor for children was 1. 75 mSvGy- 1 cm- 2 using TLD, while this value was 1. 62 mSvGy- 1 cm- 2 using MC simulation.

METHODS: An anthropomorphic phantom {{was filled with}} <b>thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeters</b> (TLD 100) and exposed with five different digital panoramic units during ten consecutive exposures. Four machines were equipped with a direct digital CCD (charge coupled device) system, whereas one of the units used storage phosphor plates (indirect digital technique).

A RANDO phantom was scanned using a 64 -slice CT scanner and three different thoracic protocols. <b>Thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeters</b> were positioned in six locations to record surface and absorbed breast and lung doses. Image quality was assessed quantitatively using region of interest measurements. Scanning was repeated using bismuth and barium vinyl in-plane shields to cover the breasts and the results were compared with standard and reduced dose protocols. Dose reductions were most evident in the breast, skin and anterior lung when shielding was used, with mean reductions of 34, 33 and 10 % for bismuth and 23, 18 and 11 % for barium, respectively. Bismuth was associated with significant increases in both noise and CT attenuation values for all the three protocols, especial-ly anteriorly and centrally. Barium shielding had a reduced impact on image quality. Reducing the overall tube current reduced doses in all the locations by 20 - 27 % with similar increases in noise as shielding, without impacting on attenuation values. Reducing the overall tube current best optimises dose with minimal image quality impact. In-plane shields increase noise and attenuation values, while reducing anterior organ doses primarily.

For the assessment of radiation quality factor based on the measured “average ” LET up to now the Q versus LET relation proposed in ICRP 26 was used. This relation is very similar to the LET-dependence of the HTR in LiF and therefore the obtained results are independent of the LET-spectrum of the radiation field. For the spectrum of space radiation, the differences of the mean quality factor according to ICRP 60 and ICRP 26, respectively, are neglectable. Using microdosimetric parameters and the Track Structure Theory, the analysis shows that data from particles with a wide LET-spectrum (e. g. stopping 10 MeV protons and 5 MeV alpha particles) fit into the LET-calibration curve, if the calculated dose averag...|$|R
40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) is {{the single}} biggest ionising radiation risk from anthropogenic exposure. Reducing unnecessary carcinogenic risks from this source requires the determination of organ and tissue absorbed doses to estimate detrimental stochastic effects. In addition, effective dose {{can be used to}} assess comparative risk between exposure situations and facilitate dose reduction through optimisation. Children are at the highest risk from radiation induced carcinogenesis and therefore dosimetry for paediatric CT recipients is essential in addressing the ionising radiation health risks of CT scanning. However, there is no well-defined method in the clinical environment for routinely and reliably performing paediatric CT organ dosimetry and there are numerous methods utilised for estimating paediatric CT effective dose. Therefore, in this study, eleven computational methods for organ dosimetry and/or effective dose calculation were investigated and compared with absorbed doses measured using <b>thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeters</b> placed in a physical anthropomorphic phantom representing a 10 year old child. Three common clinical paediatric CT protocols including brain, chest and abdomen/pelvis examinations were evaluated. Overall, computed absorbed doses to organs and tissues fully and directly irradiated demonstrated better agreement (within approximately 50 %) with the measured absorbed doses than absorbed doses to distributed organs or to those located {{on the periphery of the}} scan volume, which showed up to a 15 -fold dose variation. The disparities predominantly arose from differences in the phantoms used. While the ability to estimate CT dose is essential for risk assessment and radiation protection, identifying a simple, practical dosimetry method remains challenging...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{investigated}} the image quality of lumbar spine radiographs taken after recording technical and physical parameters. Two technical parameters were altered, tube voltage (70 kV and 90 kV for the anteroposterior (AP) projection and 77 kV and 95 kV for the lateral projection) and sensitivity of the film-screen system (sensitivity class 400 and 600). In total, 85 images {{were included in the}} study. Entrance surface dose (ESD) was measured using <b>thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeters.</b> The mean value of ESD for the different technique groups varied between 1. 9 mGy (90 kV, sensitivity class 400) and 4. 6 mGy (70 kV, sensitivity class 400) for the AP projection, and between 6. 4 mGy (95 kV, sensitivity class 600) and 20. 4 mGy (70 kV, sensitivity class 400) for the lateral projection. Image criteria given in the "European Guidelines on Quality Criteria for Radiographic Images" were used to assess image quality. Two evaluation methods have been employed. A straightforward scoring of fulfilled image criteria, and visual grading analysis using the structures defined in the image criteria. The latter method provided a sharper distinction between groups of images taken using different radiographic techniques. The average number of fulfilled image criteria for the AP projections varied between 0. 74 (90 kV, sensitivity class 400) and 0. 87 (70 kV, sensitivity class 400). For the lateral projection this number varied between 0. 79 (95 kV, sensitivity class 600) and 0. 84 (77 kV, sensitivity class 600). This study shows that image criteria are useful tools in clinical studies of image quality...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare the {{accuracy}} of cephalometric landmark identification using three-dimensional CT (3 D-CT) surface rendering with "high-dose" (200 mAs) and "low-dose" (35 mAs) CT protocols. The absorbed dose levels for radiosensitive organs in the maxillofacial region during the exposure for both 3 D-CT protocols were also measured. METHODS: The study population consisted of 15 human dry skulls examined with spiral 3 D-CT. 12 cephalometric anatomical landmarks at 7 sites were identified on the 3 D-CT surface renderings by 2 observers independently, twice each, using high-dose and low-dose protocols. In total, 1440 imaging measurements were made. <b>Thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeters</b> (TLDs) were placed at ten sites around the thyroid and submandibular glands and the eyes in an Alderson phantom for measuring the absorbed dose levels. RESULTS: The intraobserver mean distances between 3 D landmarks were smaller for all sites with the high-dose protocol (P = 0. 37). There was a significant difference among the observers (P = 0. 000004). Interobserver mean distances between 3 D landmarks were smaller for four of the seven sites with the low-dose protocol. However, the global interobserver mean distances between 3 D landmarks for all sites were smaller with the high-dose protocol (P = 0. 028). The low-dose protocol reduced the radiation dose to the thyroid by 6. 12, to the submandibular salivary glands by 5. 91 and to the eye by 5. 44, resulting in a global reduction factor of 5. 71. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy in the landmark's identification was maintained when the milliampere-second values were reduced from 200 mAs to 35 mAs. We recommend use of the low-dose protocol for clinical 3 D-CT cephalometric applications...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{measure the}} organ dose and {{calculate}} effective dose from CT attenuation correction (CTAC) acquisitions from four commonly used gamma camera single photon emission CT/CT systems. Methods: CTAC dosimetry {{data was collected}} using <b>thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeters</b> on GE Healthcare's Infinia™ Hawkeye™ (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) four- and single-slice systems, Siemens Symbia™ T 6 (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) and the Philips Precedence (Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Organ and effective dose from the administration of 99 mTc-tetrofosmin and 99 mTc-sestamibi were calculated using International Commission of Radiological Protection reports 80 and 106. Using these data, the lifetime biological risk was calculated. Results: The Siemens Symbia gave the lowest CTAC dose (1. 8 mSv) followed by the GE Infinia Hawkeye single- slice (1. 9 mSv), GE Infinia Hawkeye four-slice (2. 5 mSv) and Philips Precedence v. 3. 0. Doses were {{significantly lower than the}} calculated doses from radiopharmaceutical administration (11 and 14 mSv for 99 mTc-tetrofosmin and 99 mTc-sestamibi, respectively). Overall lifetime biological risks were lower, which suggests that using CTAC data posed minimal risk to the patient. Comparison of data for breast tissue demonstrated a higher risk than that from the radiopharmaceutical administration. Conclusion: CTAC doses were confirmed to be much lower than those from radiopharmaceutical administration. The localized nature of the CTAC exposure compared to the radiopharmaceutical biological distribution indicated dose and risk to the breast to be higher. Advances in knowledge: This research proved that CTAC is a comparatively low-dose acquisition. However, {{it has been shown that}} there is increased risk for breast tissue especially in the younger patients. As per legislation, justification is required and CTAC should only be used in situations that demonstrate sufficient net benefit...|$|R
40|$|Background: In interventional {{radiology}} the highest radiation doses are usually recorded {{for both the}} medical staff and the patients. Interventional procedures with X-rays are implemented {{in a number of}} medical specializations. This paper concerns the exposure of interventional teams performing orthopedic procedures under X-rays control. Material and Methods: Doses for interventional teams were measured in the 3 Łódź hospitals. <b>Thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeters</b> were applied to measure the following dose equivalents: Hp(3) for eye lens, Hp(0. 07) for palm skin, Hp(10) {{at the level of the}} neck without a protective shield (i. e., collar) and Hp(10) for the whole body on the front surface of the trunk (measured under the protective apron at the level of the chest). Results: Doses for the operator who performs surgery, assisting physicians and scrub nurse were measured during 95 procedures. The highest doses were received by the operator the dose for eyes per 1 procedure did not exceed 0. 1 mSv, the highest dose for hands was 1. 6 mSv and the highest recorded effective dose was 0. 02 mSv. Conclusions: On the basis of the results of measurements and their comparison with the values reported in the literature it may be concluded that the obtained results fall within the published reference range (for non-vascular procedures). This proves the compatibility of practice in the monitored Łódź hospitals with routine methodology applied in other interventional departments. The measurement results confirm that the usage of thermoluminescent dosimetry is fully adequate for the evaluation of exposure in {{interventional radiology}} and that the usage of at least 2 dosemeters for that staff is necessary.

40|$|A Nordic-Soviet {{programme}} {{was initiated}} in 1990 {{to evaluate the}} external and internal radiation exposure of the inhabitants of several villages in the Bryansk region of Russia. This area {{was one of the}} number of areas particularly affected by the nuclear accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986. Measurements were carried out yearly until 1998 and after that more irregularly; in 2000, 2006 and 2008 respectively. The effective dose estimates were based on individual <b>thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeters</b> and on in vivo measurements of the whole body content of (137) Cs (and (134) Cs during {{the first years of the}} programme). The decrease in total effective dose during the almost 2 decade follow-up was due to a continuous decrease in the dominating external exposure and a less decreasing but highly variable exposure from internal irradiation. In 2008, the observed average effective dose (i. e. the sum of external and internal exposure) from Chernobyl (137) Cs to the residents was estimated to be 0. 3 mSvy(- 1). This corresponds to 8 % of the estimated annual dose in 1990 and to 1 % of the estimated annual dose in 1986. As a mean for the population group and for the period of the present study (2006 - 2008), the average yearly effective dose from Chernobyl cesium was comparable to the absorbed dose obtained annually from external exposure to cosmic radiation plus internal exposure to naturally occurring radionuclides in the human body. Our data indicate that the effective dose from internal exposure is becoming increasingly important as the body burdens of Chernobyl (137) Cs are decreasing more slowly than the external exposure. However, over the years there have been large individual variations in both the external and internal effective doses, as well as differences between the villages investigated. These variations and differences are presented and discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the performance of metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) technology <b>dosemeters</b> with <b>thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeters</b> (TLDs) (TLD 100; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in the maxillofacial area. Methods: Organ and effective dose measurements were performed using 40 TLD and 20 MOSFET dosemeters that were alternately placed in 20 different locations in 1 anthropomorphic RANDO® head phantom (the Phantom Laboratory, Salem, NY). The phantom was exposed to four different CBCT default maxillofacial protocols using small (4 [*]×[*] 5 [*]cm) to full face (20 [*]×[*] 17 [*]cm) fields of view (FOVs). Results: The TLD effective doses ranged between 7. 0 and 158. 0 [*]µSv and the MOSFET doses between 6. 1 and 175. 0 [*]µSv. The MOSFET and TLD effective doses acquired using four different (FOV) protocols were as follows: face maxillofacial (FOV 20 [*]×[*] 17 [*]cm) (MOSFET, 83. 4 [*]µSv; TLD, 87. 6 [*]µSv; − 5 %); teeth, upper jaw (FOV, 8. 5 [*]×[*] 5. 0 [*]cm) (MOSFET, 6. 1 [*]µSv; TLD, 7. 0 [*]µSv; − 14 %); tooth, mandible and left molar (FOV, 4 [*]×[*] 5 [*]cm) (MOSFET, 10. 3 [*]µSv; TLD, 12. 3 [*]µSv; − 16 %) and teeth, both jaws (FOV, 10 [*]×[*] 10 [*]cm) (MOSFET, 175 [*]µSv; TLD, 158 [*]µSv; + 11 %). The largest variation in organ and effective dose was recorded in the small FOV protocols. Conclusions: Taking into account the uncertainties of both measurement methods and the results of the statistical analysis, the effective doses acquired using MOSFET dosemeters were found to be in good agreement with those obtained using TLD dosemeters. The MOSFET dosemeters constitute a feasible alternative for TLDs for the effective dose assessment of CBCT devices in the maxillofacial region...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Evaluation of {{absolute}} radiation exposure values for interventional radiologists (IRs) using a multiaxis interventional flat-panel C-arm cone beam CT (CBCT) system with three-dimensional laser guidance for biopsy in a triple-modality, abdominal phantom. Methods: In the phantom, eight lesions were punctured {{in two different}} angles (in-and out-of-plane) using CBCT. One C-arm CT scan was performed to plan the intervention and one for post-procedural evaluation. <b>Thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeters</b> (TLDs) were used for dose measurement {{at the level of}} the eye lens, umbilicus and ankles on a pole representing the IRs. All measurements were performed without any lead protection. In addition, the dose-area product (DAP) and air kerma at the skin entrance point was documented. Results: Mean radiation values of all TLDs were 190 mu Sv for CBCT (eye lens: 180 mu S, umbilicus: 230 mu Sv, ankle: 150 mu Sv) without a significant difference (p > 0. 005) between in-and out-of-plane biopsies. In terms of radiation exposure of the phantom, the mean DAP was not statistically significantly different (p > 0. 05) for in-and out-of-plane biopsies. Fluoroscopy showed a mean DAP of 7 or 6 mu Gym(2), respectively. C-arm CT showed a mean DAP of 5150 or 5130 mu Gym(2), respectively. Conclusion: In our setting, the radiation dose to the IR was distinctly high using CBCT. For dose reduction, it is advisable to pay attention to lead shielding, to increase the distance to the X-ray source and to leave the intervention suite for C-arm CT scans. Advances in knowledge: The results indicate that using modern navigation tools and CBCT can be accompanied with a relative high radiation dose for the IRs since detector angulation can make the use of proper lead shielding difficult...|$|R
40|$|In 1990, a joint Nordic-Russian {{project was}} {{initiated}} {{in order to}} make independent estimations of the effective dose to selected groups of inhabitants in a highly contaminated area around the city of Novozybkov In the western Bryansk region of Russia. The inhabitants were living in six villages with initial contamination levels of Cs- 137 between 0. 9 and 2. 7 MBq m(- 2). Some villages had been decontaminated, others not. Both school children and adults participated in the study. The external irradiation of 100 - 130 inhabitants was determined during 1 month in September-October each year from 1990 to 2000 (except 1999), using individual <b>thermoluminescent</b> <b>dosemeters.</b> The body burden of (137,) (CS) -C- 134 was determined by in vivo measurements in about 500 inhabitants annually from 1991 to 2000, and for a subgroup also with analysis of the (CS) -C- 137 concentration in urine. The mean effective dose (E) from external and internal irradiation due to Cs- 137,Cs- 134 deposition varied between 2. 5 and 1. 2 mSv per year between 1990 and 2000. The total mean E decreased, on average, by 9 % per year, while the mean external dose decreased by 16 % per year. The dose rate from internal radiation decreased more slowly than the dose rate from external radiation, and also showed an irregular time variation. The contribution from the internal dose to the total E was 30 - 50 %, depending on the village. Predictions for the long-term changes in the effective dose to people living in the areas are presented. The cumulated E for the 70 years following the accident was estimated to be about 90 mSv with the assumption that both internal and external dose decrease by 2 % per year after year 2000. The highest E during a life-time received by single individuals living in the area may amount to around 500 mSv considering the individual variations in E...|$|R
