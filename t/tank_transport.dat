25|$|The {{unit had}} moved to Hindon Airbase in July 1971, and was still {{operating}} Mystère IVAs. At {{the start of the}} war, the Cobras were moved to Sirsa and subsequently to Hindon/Halwara The first of the missions was undertaken on 5 December, two days after the formal declaration of war. Flying in interdiction against targets in the Christian Mandi area, the Cobras destroyed a fuel train in their first strike. Over the following days, the Cobras hit troop and armour concentrations and ammunition dumps in the Haveli Pattan and Fazilka Suleimanke area. In interdictions against secondary targets, the Cobras also hit and destroyed entire railway yards, <b>tank</b> <b>transport</b> train and rail bridges. The Cobras' role in these missions are judged {{to be one of the}} main reasons for the failure of the Pakistani Strike Corps to launch their attack on India.|$|E
60|$|The deadly gifts continue. There was {{a steady}} {{increase}} in the frightfulness and destructiveness of belligerence from 1914 up {{to the beginning of}} 1918, when shortage of material and energy checked the process; and since the armistice there has been an industrious development of military science. The next well-organized war, we are assured, will be far more swift and extensive in its destruction--more particularly of the civilian population. Armies will advance no longer along roads but extended in line, with heavy <b>tank</b> <b>transport</b> which will plough up the entire surface of the land they traverse; aerial bombing, with bombs each capable of destroying a small town, will be practicable a thousand miles beyond the military front, and the seas will be swept clear of shipping by mines and submarine activities. There will be no distinction between combatants and non-combatants, because every able-bodied citizen, male or female, is a potential producer of food and munitions; and probably the safest, and certainly the best supplied shelters in the universal cataclysm, will be the carefully buried, sandbagged, and camouflaged general-headquarters of the contending armies. There military gentlemen of limited outlook and high professional training will, in comparative security, achieve destruction beyond their understanding. The hard logic of war which gives victory always to the most energetic and destructive combatant, will turn warfare more and more from mere operations for loot or conquest or predominance into operations for the conclusive destruction of the antagonists. A relentless thrust towards strenuousness is a characteristic of belligerent conditions. War is war, and vehemence is in its nature. You must hit always as hard as you can. Offensive and counter-offensive methods continue to prevail over merely defensive ones. The victor in the next great war will be bombed from the air, starved, and depleted almost as much as the loser. His victory will be no easy one; it will be a triumph of the exhausted and dying over the dead.|$|E

It was the world's first cantilever wing four-engine heavy bomber. Despite obsolescence and being officially withdrawn from service in 1939, the TB-3 performed bomber and transport duties throughout much of World War II.

The empty weight was about 11.7 metric tons, and the total weight load was less than 22.7 tons. The vehicle was designed to transport the M3 Stuart light tank, which weighed almost 13 tons.|$|E

The factory also designed the 6x4 Contractor equipped with a Cummins 335 engine, Lipe clutch and Fuller semi-automatic gearbox, that went into production in 1964. Offered with a choice of Leyland 24 tonne or Scammell 30 and 40 tonne bogies, the Contractor was popular in the UK for 240+ ton GTW operation, overseas heavy haul, and with the military for <b>tank</b> <b>transport.</b>|$|E

This {{comprised}} a reserve of individuals rather than units, with civilian skills {{that could be}} transferred to military use. Reservists were required to undertake two weeks of military training per year and could be called up under the same conditions as the Regular Reserve regiments. As part of the Army Emergency Reserve the Royal Army Service Corps established ten transport columns and additional sub-units with other logistic roles. By 1962 this {{had been reduced to}} two; 101 <b>Tank</b> <b>Transport</b> Column and 104 Transport Column, plus sub-units. In 1965, when the Royal Corps of Transport (RCT) was formed, these columns where redesignated regiments.|$|E
50|$|The heavy tank {{company was}} taken over by the Red Army in February 1941. The tanks were in a very poor {{condition}} and hardly able to move by their own power. As the Red Army did not have <b>tank</b> <b>transport</b> platforms for the railway, the tanks were left behind in a warehouse near Tallinn, which was soon after forgotten. The tanks were relocated again in August the same year when they were used to cover the Soviet retreat from Tallinn. Mark Vs were dug into the soil along the Pirita River coastal line in order to create stationary gun platforms for the defence line. There are no records however of the usage or success of this plan, yet it is certain that it was tried out.|$|E

Occasionally, and single front axle and three rear (tridem) are seen, an example being the Oshkosh M1070 tank transporter. In such configurations, the front and rear axle usually steer. Other set ups include that of the ZIL-135.|$|R
50|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} disputed, since the wooden box protecting a lead pipe along the longitudinal {{axis of the}} hull found on the wreck suggest {{the existence of a}} bilge well (Oleson and Stein 2007). Previous ships involved in live fish <b>tank</b> <b>transport,</b> entitled navis vivariae, did not employ a hydraulic system, and for this reason the hypothesis proves especially questionable (Boetto 124). For example, one of the wrecks found in Claudius’s harbor at the modern Fiumicino Airport in Italy was a small fish craft dating somewhere around the 2nd century CE. Archaeologists discovered a fish-well {{in the middle of the}} ship that used the hole/plump system bored in the bottom of the boat to fill the tank (Boetto 2006). Other than the Grado wreck no other evidence exists of hydraulic systems being used in the fish industry.|$|E
50|$|In 1940 {{an initial}} order was placed with Mack for 90 heavy trucks in the 10-ton {{category}} under the designation NR-1. These trucks {{were similar to}} those provided to the British troops through the French order, but were not specifically equipped for <b>tank</b> <b>transport.</b> The NR-1 was a variant of a basic civilian version that was marketed in the 1930s by Mack; however with a solid grill to protect the radiator and headlamps, and an extra roof above the cab to prevent overheating. These vehicles were assigned to the Middle East and the Far East theatres. The trucks were powered by a six-cylinder Mack-Lanova ED engine which could deliver 131 HP at 2,000 rpm; driving a TR 12 Duplex transmission with five gears. The rear wheels, with tyre size 13.50-20, were the only with power, hence the 6x4 designation; the front wheels had a different tire size, namely 10.50-24,. The empty weight was just over 10 tons. The cost per vehicle was around $9,000.|$|E
5000|$|Tanks {{are highly}} mobile {{and able to}} travel over most types of terrain due to their {{continuous}} tracks and advanced suspension. The tracks disperse {{the weight of the}} vehicle over a large area, resulting in less ground pressure. A tank can travel at approximately 40 km/h across flat terrain and up to 70 km/h on roads, but due to the mechanical strain this places on the vehicle and the logistical strain on fuel delivery and tank maintenance, these must be considered [...] "burst" [...] speeds that invite mechanical failure of engine and transmission systems. Consequently, wheeled tank transporters and rail infrastructure is used wherever possible for long-distance <b>tank</b> <b>transport.</b> The limitations of long-range tank mobility can be viewed in sharp contrast to that of wheeled armoured fighting vehicles. The majority of blitzkrieg operations were conducted at the pedestrian pace of 5 km/h, and that was only achieved on the roads of France.|$|E
