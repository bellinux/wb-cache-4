This study addresses breeding success in a Barents Sea colony of common guillemots Uria aalge where trophic conditions vary according {{to changes in the}} northward transport of warm Atlantic Water. A drift model was used to simulate interannual variations in <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> Gadus morhua larvae along the Norwegian coast towards their nursery grounds in the Barents Sea. The results showed that the arrival of cod larvae from southern spawning grounds had a major effect on the size of common guillemot chicks at fledging. Furthermore, the fraction of larvae from the south was positively correlated to the inflow of Atlantic Water into the Barents Sea thus clearly demonstrating the mechanisms by which climate-driven bottom-up processes influence interannual variations in reproductive success in a marine top predator...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{hydrography}} and {{distributions of}} cod larvae on Georges Bank were surveyed during two research cruises in April and May 1993 {{in order to}} relate larval drift between cruises to the vernal intensification of the frontal component of the residual circulation. We observed the transport of two patches of cod larvae. One patch, which had maximum larval cod densities of 45 larvae 100 mm 3 in April, {{appeared to have been}} advected south about 75 km between surveys, while the other, which had maximum larval cod densities of 20 larvae 100 m- ’ in April, appeared to have been advected north-northeast about 25 km. Maximum larval densities in each patch sampled during the second cruise in May were 15 and 18 larvae 100 rnm 3, respectively, and mean growth in total length for larvae in the two patches was approximately 5. 5 mm and 4. 5 mm, respectively, between the two cruises. During the April cruise there was a large volume of anomalous cold, fresh water, of Scotian Shelf origin, which occupied much of the eastern third of Georges Bank. During May, relatively cold, fresh water appeared in a band from the Northeast Peak along the Southern Flank, between Georges Bank water {{on the top of the}} Bank, and upper Slope Water offshore. The distribution of cold, fresh water suggests its participation in the general clockwise circulation around the Bank.

40|$|Coupled {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) physical oceanographic modelling {{and field}} sampling programmes {{were carried out}} in May 1988 and August 1991 to investigate the potential drift of larval cod (Gadus morhua L.) in the Bornholm Basin of the Baltic Sea. The goals were to predict the <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> larvae, thus aiding the identification of physical processes influencing larval retention/dispersal. Numerical simulations were performed using a 3 -D eddy-resolving baroclinic model based on the Bryan–Cox–Semtner code adapted for the Baltic Sea. Within the Bornholm Basin, the model was initialized with ground truth data of physical parameters obtained on the research cruises, and all simulations were forced with actual wind data. Outside the basin, generalized hydrographic features of the Baltic Sea were utilized by incorporation of simulated hydrographic fields from previous model runs typical for the time periods considered. Larval drift was simulated either by incorporation of passive drifters, or as the initial horizontal distribution of larvae implemented into the model. Drift model simulations of larval transport agreed relatively well with field observations. The influence of variations in the vertical distribution on a smaller scale, i. e. vertical deviations of ± 6 m from the observed mean centre of mass, on the drift was examined, revealing {{no significant differences in}} the drift of larvae depending on their vertical distribution. The different wind forcing during the investigated time periods was linked to a retention situation in May 1988 and to a dispersal situation in August 1991. Finally, observed spatial distribution patterns of 1 -group cod based on Baltic Young Fish Surveys (BYFS) were compared with their predicted transport in the larval phase and examined with respect to recruitment...|$|E

40|$|For {{the early}} life stages of fish, the {{dispersal}} and retention are important factors regarding {{present and future}} survivorship, growth and reproduction. The main objective of this thesis is to analyse fish egg and larval transport in two different marine systems, the Kattegat and the North Atlantic. The focus is on two different species, namely Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) eggs in the Kattegat-Öresund-Belt area and European eel (Anguilla anguilla) leptocephalus larvae in the North Atlantic. The stock of cod in the Kattegat has been severely depleted due to fishery and is presently classified as exhibiting reduced reproductive capacity. It is, therefore, of interest to update information on cod spawning activity and get {{an understanding of the}} dispersal of eggs. As to evaluate spawning, data were analysed from dedicated egg surveys in the Kattegat between 2004 and 2006. Genetically identified cod eggs confirmed that cod were spawning in the studied area during the sampling period. The estimated daily egg production was high in the south-eastern part of the surveyed area (~ 20 eggs m- 2 d- 1) while it was low (0 – 5 eggs m- 2 d- 1) in the central and northern part. This emphasises the importance of the southernmost spawning area in the Kattegat, close to the Öresund. A process oriented model was used to investigate <b>transport</b> <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> eggs and early larvae in relation to egg density as well as how the interannual variation of retention and dispersal is related to the meteorological forcing. The model results clearly indicated that transport is highly dependent on the egg density; lighter eggs are transported northwards, whereas heavier eggs are retained to a larger extent or are transported southwards. An optimum of retention is defined in the density range 1023 - 1026 kg m- 3. Combining the model results of the amount of retention, distribution and sedimentation with observations of vertical distribution of cod-like eggs in the range 1017 - 1022 kg m- 3, suggests that gadoid eggs are mainly retained in the southern Kattegat, but also simultaneously dispersed northwards. Further investigation showed that interannual variation of retention, transport and sedimentation are highly correlated to the changes of local wind forcing. Strong westerly winds induce southward transport and high sedimentation while weak variable winds tend to retain eggs in the spawning area. The results of this study provide a starting point for future studies of spawning and life history characteristics of the Kattegat cod, and also in studies designed to entangle the stock complex in the Kattegat-Öresund-Belt area. Climatic variation affecting the ocean conditions for passive drift of eel larvae is one of the factors suspected {{to be related to the}} decline of eel recruitment. A simple Lagrangian model was used to simulate the passive drift of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) leptocephalus larvae from the spawning area in the Sargasso Sea to the European shelf (20 °W). The simulation utilised the velocity data from a reanalysis of ocean climate, the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA 2. 1. 6), for the period from 1958 to 2008. The period which was modelled covers the time of a regime shift in eel recruitment in the 1980 s. The average drift time and latitudinal distribution of the arrival of larvae (particles in the model) was explored for a range of constant depth levels and instantaneous mortalities. The model showed that the proportion of eel larvae carried by the North-east Atlantic current to northern latitudes of arrival was greater before 1970 whereas there was an increase in amount of eel larvae being entrained into the southbound current branches in later part of simulation. The overall success of drift from the spawning area to the eastern Atlantic clearly contradicts that this could explain the dramatic recruitment decline...|$|E
40|$|The three banks Sveinsgrunnen, Malangsgrunnen and Nordvestbanken, which lie off {{the coast}} of {{northern}} Norway, are separated by troughs. Synoptic hydrographic surveys and data from satellite-tracked buoys drogued in the mixed layer, show that the botton topography strongly influences the distribution of water masses and current pattern. Coastal water above the banks circulates in a clockwise direction, while Atlantic water intruding in the troughs circulates in a anticlockwise direction. This circulation pattern influences the <b>transport</b> and spreading <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> eggs from the spawning grounds which are sited between the banks and the coastline. The eggs are, for the most part, distributed throughout the Coastal water on the banks, while only small numbers are found in the Atlantic water in the troughs. The circulation in the investigated area probably favours mixing of the Coastal and Atlantic water masses. Moderately stratified concitions occur in the period from June to September. During this period, the influence of the bottom topography seems to be less pronounced. However, Atlantic water does flow into the trough Malangsdjupet during stratified conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new algorithm for solar energy forecasting from {{a sequence of}} Cloud Optical Depth (COD) images. The algorithm {{is based on the}} following simple observation: the dynamics of clouds represented by COD images resembles the motion (<b>transport)</b> <b>of</b> a density in a fluid flow. This suggests that, to forecast the motion <b>of</b> <b>COD</b> images, it is sufficient to forecast the flow. The latter, in turn, can be accomplished by fitting a parametric model of the fluid flow to the COD images observed in the past. Namely, the learning phase of the algorithm is composed of the following steps: (i) given a sequence <b>of</b> <b>COD</b> images, the snapshots of the optical flow are estimated from two consecutive COD images; (ii) these snapshots are then assimilated into a Navier-Stokes Equation (NSE), i. e. an initial velocity field for NSE is selected so that the corresponding NSE' solution is {{as close as possible to}} the optical flow snapshots. The prediction phase consists of utilizing a linear transport equation, which describes the propagation <b>of</b> <b>COD</b> images in the fluid flow predicted by NSE, to estimate the future motion <b>of</b> the <b>COD</b> images. The algorithm has been tested on COD images provided by two geostationary operational environmental satellites from NOAA serving the west-hemisphere.

Each of these species is modeled as conventional single specie models, where the specie interactions {{are related to the}} climate, and taken care of as mortality (predation) and food (growth) related to availability of prey. The model is coded and implemented by use of the dynamic simulation tool "Powersim' 7 Studio 7 ", and the parameters are determined by tuning against relevant data from the period 1982 to 2005. The model simulates reasonably well the observed coherence between climate, fish stocks and catches in the actual period. The capeliu is the most important feed for the cod. The most important specie interactions conceming the yield <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> is the influence of immature herring on the recruitment of capelin and the predation <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> <b>of</b> mature capelin and its own cod fry. Strong age groups of herring reduce the recruitment of capelin which reduce the growth <b>of</b> <b>cod</b> and delays the maturation <b>of</b> <b>cod.</b> Declining availability <b>of</b> capelin increases the cannibalism <b>of</b> <b>cod,</b> depending on the volume of recruits {{and the size of the}} older age groups <b>of</b> <b>cod.</b> These relations, in combination with climate variability and changes, are determinant for the dynamics of the system.
