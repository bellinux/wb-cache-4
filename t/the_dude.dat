5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dude</b> is {{forcibly}} {{brought before}} Treehorn, who asks about {{the whereabouts of}} Bunny and says he wants the money she owes him. He drugs the Dude's White Russian cocktail, causing <b>The</b> <b>Dude</b> to have a dream sequence involving Maude and bowling. <b>The</b> <b>Dude</b> awakens in police custody, where he is verbally and physically assaulted by the Malibu police chief. During the cab ride home, <b>the</b> <b>Dude</b> gets thrown out after he asks the cab driver to change the radio station. A red sports car zooms past and the viewer sees that Bunny is driving, with all her toes intact.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dude</b> {{finds his}} {{bungalow}} completely trashed and is greeted by Maude, who seduces him. He figures that Treehorn drugged {{him so that}} his goons could look for the ransom money at the Dude's home. After Maude has sex with him, she says she hopes to conceive a child; <b>the</b> <b>Dude</b> protests being a father, but Maude tells him {{that he will not}} be involved in the child's upbringing. Maude also explains that her father has no money: her mother was the wealthy one and she left her money exclusively to the family charity. Having an epiphany, <b>the</b> <b>Dude</b> and Walter travel to the Lebowski estate, while <b>the</b> <b>Dude</b> explains: when Lebowski, who apparently hated his wife, heard of the kidnapping, he withdrew money from the foundation, kept it for himself, and gave <b>the</b> <b>Dude</b> a briefcase without any money in it, saying that it contained a million dollar ransom. The kidnapping was also a ruse: when Bunny took an unannounced trip, her friends (the nihilists) faked a kidnapping to be able to extort money from Lebowski. Walter and <b>the</b> <b>Dude</b> confront the Big Lebowski, who refuses to admit responsibility, but is thrown out of his wheelchair by Walter, who believes that he's faking his paralysis.|$|E
5|$|Days later, Lebowski {{contacts}} <b>the</b> <b>Dude</b> {{stating that}} Bunny has been kidnapped. Lebowski wants <b>the</b> <b>Dude</b> {{to deliver a}} briefcase containing a million-dollar ransom {{and see if he}} can recognize the culprits. Later, a different pair of thugs appear in the Dude's apartment, knock him unconscious, and take Lebowski's rug. When Bunny's kidnappers call to arrange delivery of the ransom, Walter instead gives the kidnappers a fake ransom, namely, a briefcase filled with dirty underwear. The kidnappers grab the fake ransom and leave. Later that night, the Dude's car is stolen, with the real ransom money briefcase still inside.|$|E

5|$|The affair {{apparently}} over, <b>the</b> <b>Dude</b> and his bowling teammates {{return to}} the bowling alley. As they leave, they are confronted {{in the parking lot}} by the nihilists, who have set the Dude's car on fire. They, once again, demand the ransom money. Even after <b>the</b> <b>Dude</b> and Walter explain they don't have the money, the nihilists try to rob them anyway. Walter violently beats all three, biting the ear off of one. However, in the excitement, Donny suffers a fatal heart attack.|$|E
5|$|The Dude's car {{is found}} by the police without the ransom money, and he reclaims it. Later, while {{cruising}} around in the car, <b>The</b> <b>Dude</b> finds the homework assignment {{of a high school}} student named Larry inside. Taking this to mean that Larry was the one who stole the car, Walter and <b>The</b> <b>Dude</b> go to his house, believing Larry has also stolen the money. When Larry refuses to respond to Walter and the Dude's threats, Walter wrecks a new sports car parked outside which they assume Larry bought with the money. However, a neighbor rushes outside, reveals himself as having just bought the car and angrily wrecks The Dude's car in revenge, thinking it to be Walter's.|$|E
5|$|An annual festival, Lebowski Fest, {{began in}} Louisville, Kentucky, United States in 2002 with 150 fans showing up, {{and has since}} {{expanded}} to several other cities. The festival's main event each year is a night of unlimited bowling with various contests including costume, trivia, hardest- and farthest-traveled contests. Held over a weekend, events typically include a pre-fest party with bands {{the night before the}} bowling event as well as a day-long outdoor party with bands, vendor booths and games. Various celebrities from the film have even attended some of the events, including Jeff Bridges who attended the Los Angeles event.

25|$|Between August 2007 and January 2008, Marasciulo {{had several}} tryout matches for WWE, using the ring name Greg Cardona. He was signed to a WWE {{contract}} and began wrestling in Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) under the ring name Greg Jackson. His name was later changed to Trent Barreta, then tweaked to Trent Beretta. He also competed under a mask as The Girl From Mexico {{in an attempt}} to become the first Queen of FCW, but was eliminated in the second round by Angela Fong. Beretta would soon form a tag team with Caylen Croft called <b>The</b> <b>Dude</b> Busters. Together, they would defeat Tyler Reks on May 30, 2009 to win the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship after Reks' tag team partner, Johnny Curtis, failed to appear. On July 23, Barreta and Croft lost the title to Justin Angel and Kris Logan. <b>The</b> <b>Dude</b> Busters reclaimed the title when Croft and Curt Hawkins, their new ally, defeated the Rotundos (Bo and Duke) on November 19. Barreta was officially recognized as a champion alongside Croft and Hawkins, and was allowed to defend the title alongside either Croft or Hawkins via the Freebird Rule. On January 14, 2010 at an FCW television taping, <b>the</b> <b>Dude</b> Busters lost the Florida Tag Team Championship to The Fortunate Sons (Brett DiBiase and Joe Hennig).|$|E
25|$|On November 19, 2010, Caylen Croft was {{released}} from his contract, effectively ending <b>The</b> <b>Dude</b> Busters and turning Barreta into a singles competitor. After becoming a singles competitor, Barreta would largely be involved in lower-card feuds. During this period, a majority of his matches would be on Superstars, and when he appeared on SmackDown, he would almost always lose, only garnering a single win when appearing on SmackDown during his tenure in WWE. Barreta would continue to feud with Hawkins, whose partner Archer had also been released together with Croft. Both wrestlers would exchange wins in various matches on Superstars. Barreta would then feud with Drew McIntyre, even managing to earn an upset victory over McIntyre on the January 14, 2011 episode of SmackDown, his first singles win on the SmackDown brand since the breakup of <b>The</b> <b>Dude</b> Busters.|$|E

25|$|On the December 1, 2009 {{episode of}} ECW on Syfy, Marasciulo, under the respelled name of Trent Barreta, and Caylen Croft debuted as villains, {{squashing}} a tag team. The duo would then feud with Goldust and Yoshi Tatsu, which {{culminated in a}} loss to Goldust and Tatsu in a match {{to determine the number}} one contenders to the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship on the February 9, 2010 episode of ECW. When the ECW brand ended in February 2010, its roster became free agents. Barreta and Croft signed with SmackDown, making their debut for the brand on February 19 in a losing effort against Cryme Tyme. Barreta and Croft would then feud with The Hart Dynasty, but could never manage a win against them. In April, they began using their Dude Busters name again, which they had seemingly dropped since debuting in ECW. <b>The</b> <b>Dude</b> Busters then turned into fan favorites when they entered into a feud with the Gatecrashers (Curt Hawkins and Vance Archer) in August. <b>The</b> <b>Dude</b> Busters then earned their first tag team victory since joining the SmackDown roster when they defeated the Gatecrashers on the August 26 episode of Superstars.|$|E

Marasciulo debuted on WWE's main roster in 2009 as Trent Barreta {{and was one}} half of <b>the</b> <b>Dude</b> Busters with Caylen Croft.
