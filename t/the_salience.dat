40|$|Both {{behavioral}} and neural measures of <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of faces are {{positively correlated with}} their physical attractiveness. Whether physical characteristics other than attractiveness contribute to <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of faces is not known, however. Research with male macaques recently showed that more dominant macaques' faces hold greater motivational salience. Here we investigated whether dominance also contributes to <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of faces in human participants. Principal component analysis of third-party ratings of faces for multiple traits revealed two orthogonal components. The first component ("valence") was highly correlated with rated trustworthiness and attractiveness. The second component ("dominance") was highly correlated with rated dominance and aggressiveness. Importantly, both components were positively and independently related to <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of faces, as assessed from responses on a standard key-press task.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an upsurge of {{interest}} in <b>the</b> notion of <b>salience</b> in linguistics and related disciplines. While in top-down salience, perceivers endogenously direct their attention to a certain stimulus, in <b>the</b> bottom-up <b>salience,</b> it is <b>the</b> stimulus itself which attracts attention. In prototypical cases of bottom-up <b>salience,</b> <b>the</b> stimulus stands out because it is incongruous with a given ground by virtue of intrinsic physical characteristics. But a stimulus may also cause surprise by virtue of deviating from a cognitive ground, e. g., when violating social or probabilistic expectations. This has prompted researchers {{to examine the relationship}} between expectations and <b>the</b> perceptual <b>salience</b> of linguistic stimuli in new ways. This e-book features contributions from different scientific frameworks. The reader will find commentaries, reviews, and original research articles on models of sociolinguistic and morphological <b>salience,</b> <b>the</b> role of attention, affect, and predictability, and on how salient items are processed, categorized and learned.

25|$|The {{identity}} fusion construct builds upon {{earlier work}} by emphasizing {{aspects of the}} relationship of people to groups that were de-emphasized within the social identity perspective (i.e., social identity theory and self-categorization theory). Like social identity theory, identity fusion theory rests on the distinction between the personal and social identities. However, the social identity approach assumes that there is a hydraulic relationship between personal and social identities. That is, the increases in <b>the</b> <b>salience</b> and influence of one identity diminishes <b>the</b> <b>salience</b> and influence of the other. One important implication of this assumption is that as the group identity becomes salient and apt to guide behavior, the personal identity becomes less salient and less likely to guide behavior. In contrast, the theory of identity fusion theory proposes that both the personal and social identities of a person can be salient and influential simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Oxytocin is {{typically}} remembered {{for the effect}} it has on prosocial behaviors, such as its role in facilitating trust and attachment between individuals. Consequently, oxytocin {{is often referred to}} as the “love hormone". However, oxytocin has a more complex role than solely enhancing prosocial behaviors. There is consensus that oxytocin modulates fear and anxiety; that is, it does not directly elicit fear or anxiety. Two dominant theories explain the role of oxytocin in fear and anxiety. One theory states that oxytocin increases approach/avoidance to certain social stimuli and the second theory states that oxytocin increases <b>the</b> <b>salience</b> of certain social stimuli, causing the animal or human to pay closer attention to socially relevant stimuli.|$|E

The result shows that with the increase of spatial familiarity, <b>the</b> landmark <b>salience</b> sensitivity is gradually reduced and the ascending order of attention degree to the attributes of <b>the</b> landmark <b>salience</b> is visual, semantic and structural salience.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{attractiveness of}} faces is {{positively correlated with}} both behavioral and neural measures of their motivational salience. Although previous work suggests that hormone levels modulate women's perceptions of others’ facial attractiveness, studies have not yet investigated whether hormone levels also modulate <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of facial characteristics. To address this issue, we investigated the relationships between within-subject changes in women's salivary hormone levels (estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol-to-progesterone ratio) and within-subject changes in <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of attractiveness and sexual dimorphism in male and female faces. <b>The</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of physically attractive faces in general and feminine female faces, but not masculine male faces, was greater in test sessions where women had high testosterone levels. Additionally, the reward value of sexually dimorphic faces in general and attractive female faces, but not attractive male faces, was greater in test sessions where women had high estradiol-to-progesterone ratios. These results provide the first evidence that <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of facial attractiveness and sexual dimorphism is modulated by within-woman changes in hormone levels...|$|R
25|$|To {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>salience</b> {{of religious}} beliefs in establishing group identity, {{researchers have also}} conducted studies looking at religion and prejudice. Some {{studies have shown that}} greater religious attitudes may be significant predictors of negative attitudes towards racial or social outgroups. These effects are often conceptualized under the framework of intergroup bias, where religious individuals favor members of their ingroup (ingroup favoritism) and exhibit disfavor towards members of their outgroup (outgroup derogation). Evidence supporting religious intergroup bias has been supported in multiple religious groups, including non-Christian groups, and is thought to reflect the role of group dynamics in religious identification. Many studies regarding religion and prejudice implement religious priming both in the laboratory and in naturalistic settings with evidence supporting the perpetuation of ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation in individuals who are high in religiosity.|$|E
25|$|The {{recollection}} of dreams is extremely unreliable, {{though it is}} a skill that can be trained. Dreams can usually be recalled if a person is awakened while dreaming. Women tend to have more frequent dream recall than men. Dreams that are difficult to recall may be characterized by relatively little affect, and factors such as salience, arousal, and interference play a role in dream recall. Often, a dream may be recalled upon viewing or hearing a random trigger or stimulus. <b>The</b> <b>salience</b> hypothesis proposes that dream content that is salient, that is, novel, intense, or unusual, is more easily remembered. There is considerable evidence that vivid, intense, or unusual dream content is more frequently recalled. A dream journal can be used to assist dream recall, for personal interest or psychotherapy purposes.|$|E
25|$|In {{line with}} <b>the</b> <b>salience</b> hypothesis, there is {{considerable}} evidence {{that people who have}} more vivid, intense or unusual dreams show better recall. There is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related to recall.

People who score high on measures of personality traits associated with creativity, imagination, and fantasy, such as openness to experience, daydreaming, fantasy proneness, absorption, and hypnotic susceptibility, tend to show more frequent dream recall. There is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of dreaming and waking experience. That is, people who report more bizarre experiences during the day, such as people high in schizotypy (psychosis proneness) have more frequent dream recall and also report more frequent nightmares.|$|E

40|$|My {{research}} utilizes {{a behavioral}} key-press task {{adapted from the}} classic bar-press technique employed in many rodent studies of reward to explore <b>the</b> incentive <b>salience</b> of beauty among humans. In Chapter 2, I replicate previous findings indicating that gender differences exist for <b>the</b> incentive <b>salience</b> of beauty. I extend past findings with regard to <b>the</b> incentive <b>salience</b> of heterosexual beauty by investigating the role of additional aspects of facial appearance. Here, I find that apparent health holds incentive salience. This may serve an adaptive function by driving motivation to seek out healthy potential mates while avoiding infectious individuals. In Chapter 3, I explore gender differences in <b>the</b> incentive <b>salience</b> of adult and infant faces. I show that women demonstrate greater motivation, overall, to view infant faces while {{both men and women}} differentiate between the high-cute and low-cute versions of infant faces, suggesting that infant cuteness may hold incentive salience {{for both men and women}} but that infants in general have higher incentive salience for women. In Chapters 4 and 5, I investigate individual differences and variation across the menstrual cycle for women viewing adult faces. Women's own attractiveness was found to influence motivation to view attractive individuals, especially same-sex individuals. Within-subject variations in motivation across the menstrual cycle were apparent for <b>the</b> incentive <b>salience</b> of same-sex beauty. Taken together, the results of these experiments suggest that <b>the</b> incentive <b>salience</b> of same-sex faces among women may be partially driven by intrasexual competition – a novel explanation for women’s motivation to view same-sex individuals. Overall my research has indicated that infant cuteness, adult attractiveness and apparent health influence the motivational value of faces, while individual differences also exist among women with respect to own attractiveness and fertility.

25|$|However, in cities, {{where the}} {{population}} {{tends to be}} much higher, informal interactions between ethnic groups might {{not be sufficient to}} prevent violence. This is because you need many more links to connect everyone and therefore it is much more difficult to form and strengthen inter-ethnic ties. In cities, formal inter-ethnic associations like trade unions, business associations and professional organizations are more effective in encouraging inter-ethnic interactions that could prevent ethnic violence in the future. These organizations force ethnic groups to come together based on shared economic interests that overcomes any pre-existing ethnic differences. For example, inter-ethnic business organizations serve to connect the business interests of different ethnic groups which would increase their desire to maintain ethnic harmony.

25|$|Nasally {{administered}} oxytocin {{has been}} reported to reduce fear, possibly by inhibiting the amygdala (which is thought to be responsible for fear responses). Indeed, studies in rodents have shown oxytocin can efficiently inhibit fear responses by activating an inhibitory circuit within the amygdala. Some researchers have argued oxytocin has a general enhancing effect on all social emotions, since intranasal administration of oxytocin also increases envy and Schadenfreude. Individuals who receive an intranasal dose of oxytocin identify facial expressions of disgust faster than individuals who do not receive oxytocin. Facial expressions of disgust are evolutionarily linked to the idea of contagion. Thus, oxytocin increases <b>the</b> <b>salience</b> of cues that imply contamination, which leads to a faster response because these cues are especially relevant for survival. In another study, after administration of oxytocin, individuals displayed an enhanced ability to recognize expressions of fear compared to the individuals who received the placebo. Oxytocin modulates fear responses by enhancing the maintenance of social memories. Rats that are genetically modified to have a surplus of oxytocin receptors display a greater fear response to a previously conditioned stressor. Oxytocin enhances the aversive social memory, leading the rat to display a greater fear response when the aversive stimulus is encountered again.|$|E
500|$|Within the brain, {{dopamine}} functions {{partly as}} a [...] "global reward signal", where an initial phasic dopamine response to a rewarding stimulus encodes information about <b>the</b> <b>salience,</b> value, and context of a reward. In the context of reward-related learning, dopamine also functions as a reward prediction error signal, that is, {{the degree to which}} the value of a reward is unexpected. According to this hypothesis of Wolfram Schultz, rewards that are expected do not produce a second phasic dopamine response in certain dopaminergic cells, but rewards that are unexpected, or greater than expected, produce a short-lasting increase in synaptic dopamine, whereas the omission of an expected reward actually causes dopamine release to drop below its background level. The [...] "prediction error" [...] hypothesis has drawn particular interest from computational neuroscientists, because an influential computational-learning method known as temporal difference learning makes heavy use of a signal that encodes prediction error. This confluence of theory and data has led to a fertile interaction between neuroscientists and computer scientists interested in machine learning.|$|E

40|$|Facial {{attractiveness}} is {{a particularly}} salient social cue that influences many important social outcomes. Using a standard key-press task to measure motivational salience of faces and an old/new memory task to measure memory for face photographs, this thesis investigated both within-woman and between-women variations in response to facial attractiveness. The results indicated that within-woman variables, such as fluctuations in hormone levels, influenced <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of facial attractiveness. However, the between-women variable, romantic relationship status, {{did not appear to}} modulate women’s responses to facial attractiveness. In addition to attractiveness, dominance also contributed to both <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> and memorability of faces. This latter result demonstrates that, although attractiveness is an important factor for <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of faces, other factors might also cause faces to hold motivational salience. In Chapter 2, I investigated the possible effects of women’s salivary hormone levels (estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol-to-progesterone ratio) on <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of facial attractiveness. Physically attractive faces generally hold greater motivational salience, replicating results from previous studies. Importantly, however, the effect of attractiveness on <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of faces was greater in test sessions where women had high testosterone levels. Additionally, <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of attractive female faces was greater in test sessions where women had high estradiol-to-progesterone ratios. While results from Chapter 2 suggested that <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of faces was generally positively correlated with their physical attractiveness, Chapter 3 explored whether physical characteristics other than attractiveness contributed to <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of faces. To address this issue, I first had the faces rated on multiple traits. Principal component analysis of third-party ratings of faces for these traits revealed two orthogonal components that were highly correlated with trustworthiness and dominance ratings respectively. Both components were positively and independently related to <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of faces. While Chapter 2 and 3 did not examine the between-woman differences in response to facial attractiveness, Chapter 4 examined whether women’s responses to facial attractiveness differed as a function of their romantic partnership status. As several researchers have proposed that partnership status influences women’s perception of attractiveness, in Chapter 4 I compared the effects of men’s attractiveness on partnered and unpartnered women’s performance on two response measures: memory for face photographs and <b>the</b> motivational <b>salience</b> of faces. Consistent with previous research, women’s memory was poorer for face photographs of more attractive men and more attractive men’s faces held greater motivational salience. However, in neither study were the effects of attractiveness modulated by women’s partnership status or partnered women’s reported commitment to or happiness with their romantic relationship. A key result from Chapter 4 was that more attractive faces were harder to remember. Building on this result, Chapter 5 investigated the different characteristics that contributed to the memorability of face photographs. While some work emphasizes relationships with typicality, familiarity, and memorability ratings, more recent work suggests that ratings of social traits, such as attractiveness, intelligence, and responsibility, predict the memorability of face photographs independently of typicality, familiarity, and memorability ratings. However, what components underlie these traits remains unknown, as well as whether these components relate to the actual memorability of face photographs. Principal component analysis of all these face ratings produced three orthogonal components that were highly correlated with trustworthiness, dominance, and memorability ratings, respectively. Importantly, each of these components also predicted the actual memorability of face photographs...|$|R
