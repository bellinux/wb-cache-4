50|$|The {{stereotype}} as {{a justification}} for violence does not help this issue, either, as <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> viewed as sexual objects. For instance, <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> often objectified in an offensive sexual manner and degraded through song lyrics or television shows. This reinforces the ideology that the violence and abuse of colored women is justified.|$|R

5|$|Interpretations {{of other}} {{features}} of Opabinia fossils differ.

5|$|After Applewhite's release, he {{traveled}} to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told their followers {{that they would be}} visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to believe that <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement, and American popular culture.|$|E

The remaining children of Sejanus, Capito Aelianus and Junilla, were executed in December of that year. According to ancient historians, {{because there was no}} precedent for the capital punishment of a virgin, Junilla was raped first, with the rope around her neck. <b>Their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> thrown down the Gemonian stairs. At the beginning of the following year, damnatio memoriae was also passed on Livilla.|$|E

About two-thirds of the bodies were identified. Of the remaining 150 unclaimed bodies, 121 were taken to the non-denominational Fairview Lawn Cemetery; 19 were buried in the Roman Catholic Mount Olivet Cemetery, and 10 were taken to the Jewish Baron de Hirsch Cemetery.

5|$|The Baćin {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 83 civilians just outside the village of Baćin, near Hrvatska Dubica, committed by Croatian Serb paramilitaries. The killings took place on 21 October 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence. Most of the civilians were Croats, but they also included two ethnic Serbs, taken from Hrvatska Dubica, Baćin and the nearby village of Cerovljani. The civilians {{were killed in the}} area of Krečane, at the very bank of the Una River, and <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> left unburied for two weeks. Most of them were subsequently bulldozed into a shallow mass grave, while a number of the bodies were thrown into the river.|$|E
5|$|The Umayyads were {{followed}} by the Abbasid dynasty which came to power {{with the help of}} Iranian Muslims. The persecution of Zoroastrians increased significantly under the Abbasids, temples and sacred-fire shrines were destroyed. Also during Abbasid rule, the status of Zoroastrians in Persian lands was reduced from zimmi (or dhimmi, people who were protected by the state and generally considered 'People of the Book') to 'kafirs' (non-believers). As a result, Zoroastrians were not granted the same rights and status as Jews and Christians. Iranian Muslims were welcomed to the court, but not Zoroastrians. Zoroastrians were denied access to bathhouses on the grounds that <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> polluted.|$|E

5|$|The attacks at Fort Blue Mounds {{were two}} {{separate}} incidents which occurred on June 6 and 20, 1832, {{as part of}} the Black Hawk War. In the first incident, area residents attributed the killing of a miner to a band of Ho-Chunk warriors, and concluded that more Ho-Chunk planned to join Black Hawk in his war against white settlers. The second incident occurred east of the fort as a Sauk raiding party, estimated by eyewitnesses to be as large as 100 warriors, attacked two militiamen who were investigating noises heard the night before. Two members of the militia stationed at Blue Mounds were killed in the attack, and both <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> badly mutilated.|$|E
5|$|As {{the force}} which {{was sent to}} {{reinforce}} and extract the reconnaissance platoon took further casualties, the total Croatian losses in the fighting and its immediate aftermath amounted to 20 killed. The fate of the reconnaissance platoon was not immediately known to Croatian authorities or relatives of the troops for months, adding fuel to an already volatile atmosphere {{in the city of}} Bjelovar, where the 105th Brigade was originally based. This tension erupted a week later, with the blockade and capture of the JNA barracks in Bjelovar. The JNA denied it had any knowledge on the fate of the Croatian soldiers. Details of their deaths became known in December 1991. Croatian forces recaptured Kusonje on 30 December in Operation Papuk-91, and <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> exhumed in January 1992. Along with the soldiers, the bodies of 23 civilians were also exhumed from a mass grave in the village of Rakov Potok. The soldiers were re-interred in Bjelovar on 5 February 1992. According to JNA intelligence reports, during the period from the exhumation to the re-interment, 32 Serb-owned houses in Bjelovar were demolished in retribution for the killings.|$|E

Offshore Odisha, rough seas caused two trawlers to collide, resulting in 18fatalities; <b>their</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>were</b> later found floating Dhamra Port in the Bhadrak district of Odisha. Two additional trawlers were reported missing. Nine fishing trawlers sank offshore West Bengal, with only 66fishermen accounted for.
