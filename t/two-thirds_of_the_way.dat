5|$|The Spy Who Loved Me is {{the ninth}} novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first {{published}} by Jonathan Cape on 16 April 1962. It {{is the shortest}} and most sexually explicit of Fleming's novels, {{as well as a}} clear departure from previous Bond novels in that the story is told in the first person by a young Canadian woman, Vivienne Michel. Bond himself does not appear until <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> through the book. Fleming wrote a prologue to the novel giving Michel credit as a co-author.|$|E
5|$|The incline {{from there}} is not visible because of tree growth and it is {{difficult}} to get access to it without unreasonable encroachment on private property, although the OS map shows a public footpath crossing the incline about <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> up. The remains of Brendon Hill station are Grade II listed. The remains of the summit winding house can be approached but are dangerous to enter: they are located just west of the junction of the B3224 and B3190 roads. A chapel built to attend to the spiritual needs of the miners and their families still stands at the junction.|$|E
5000|$|A break may be {{described}} as when the song takes a [...] "breather, drops down to some exciting percussion, and then comes storming back again" [...] and compared to a false ending. Breaks usually occur <b>two-thirds</b> to three-quarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> through a song. According to Peter van der Merwe a break [...] "occurs when the voice stops at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> a phrase and is answered by a snatch of accompaniment," [...] and originated from <b>the</b> bass runs <b>of</b> marches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Sousa school". In this case {{it would be a}} [...] "break" [...] from the vocal part. In bluegrass and other old time music, a break is [...] "when an instrument plays the melody to a song idiomatically, i.e. the back-up played on the banjo for a mandolin 'break' may differ from that played for a dobro 'break' in the same song".|$|R

5|$|Federer and Nadal are {{one behind}} Djokovic, and within three of {{matching}} this feat of winning all 15. Nadal has also achieved a Career Grand Slam and a Career Golden Slam, but {{has thus far}} fallen short of winning the tour finals, the Miami Open and Paris Masters. Federer has also achieved a Career Grand Slam, but is missing the Olympic Gold in singles, the Monte-Carlo Masters and Italian Open. Djokovic, as the only man to have won eight of the nine Masters events, is a Cincinnati title away from achieving what has been labelled the Career Golden Masters, as well as needing the Olympic Gold to complete his overall tally. Murray is <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the goal having won 11 of the 15 events.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1958, a B-47B Stratojet crashed {{while taking}} off from Loring, killing all four crewmembers on board. The plane belonged to a unit at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando, Florida. The plane was {{described}} as having reached <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> down the runway, when it veered sharply to the right, eventually crashing 400 feet north of the runway. On 25 November 1958, a KC-135 Stratotanker of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron crashed on takeoff roughly {{in the same area}} as the B-47 three days before. Two crewmembers were thrown to safety by the impact of the crash. The Air Force stated that after a four-hour mission, the crewmembers were practicing taking off and landing on the runway. On 18 November 1960, a KC-135 crashed upon landing at Loring, killing one and injuring sixteen others. The plane landed after a six-and-a-half-hour training mission, veered off {{to the left of the}} runway, and skidded three thousand feet while on fire. Surviving crewmembers were able to use the emergency chutes to evacuate the plane safely. On 9 May 1962, six crewmembers of a KC-135 were killed when their plane crashed during takeoff into a surrounding marsh, about fifteen hundred feet north of the runway. On 4 January 1965, four crewmembers were killed three miles north of Loring when their KC-135 crashed into the ground after takeoff. On 5 September 1969, a B-52 Stratofortress crashed approximately three miles north of the runway after taking off. Seven men were killed, including six crewmembers, during a Minimum Interval Takeoff drill. On 4 October 1989 a KC-135 crash killed all 4 crewmembers. The jet, which crashed about 2.4 miles off the TransCanada Highway in New Brunswick, was attempting to land at Loring.|$|E

These movable portions acted as large ailerons, or as Republic called them, tiperons. To keep {{the surface area}} in front and behind the pivot point somewhat similar, the split line was closer to the fuselage in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pivot. Large conventional flaps ran from the fuselage to the tiperons. Hard points for drop tanks were available at about [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> out from <b>the</b> wing root.|$|R

25|$|The Sovereign {{sometimes}} declares {{other days}} when the Union Flag is to fly at half-mast.

25|$|Another type of pass is the bounce pass. Here, the passer bounces {{the ball}} crisply about <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{from his own}} chest to the receiver. The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver. The bounce pass takes longer to {{complete}} than the chest pass, {{but it is also}} harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation). Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender.|$|E

25|$|Each {{season of}} America's Next Top Model has from 9–16 episodes and starts with 10–16 contestants. Contestants are judged weekly on their overall appearance, {{participation}} in challenges, and best shot from that week's photo shoot; each episode, one contestant is eliminated, though {{in rare cases}} a double elimination or non-elimination was given by consensus of the judging panel. Makeovers are administered to contestants {{early in the season}} (usually after the first or second elimination in the finals) and a trip to an international destination is scheduled about <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> through the season.|$|E

25|$|Terry Venables's role {{as coach}} of the Australian {{national}} team meant he was frequently absent from Portsmouth. Meanwhile, the team's results were poor. <b>Two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> through the 1997–98 season, he and manager Terry Fenwick left the club, with Portsmouth {{on the bottom of the}} table, and Venables selling his shareholding back to Martin Gregory, son of former chairman Jim Gregory. Alan Ball then returned as manager for the second time on 26 January 1998. Relegation to the third tier was avoided on the last day of the season – by 1 point.|$|E
25|$|Company {{commander}} 2d Lt. Timmermann led an under-strength {{squad of}} {{men from the}} 27 AIB onto {{the west side of}} the bridge, despite the risk that the bridge could be destroyed with them on it. Just as the Americans approached, Corporal Faust set off the secondary explosives. Both the Germans and the Americans watched the smoke and haze clear from the explosion and were shocked to see the bridge was still standing. Only the charge on the southeast pier, <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> across, had exploded, but the weak industrial explosive had failed to bring down the well-built steel bridge.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{remoteness}} {{from human}} habitation and its arid environment, the site remained largely untouched by humans or nature for two millennia. The Roman attack ramp still {{stands on the}} western side and can be climbed on foot. Many of the ancient buildings have been restored from their remains, as have the wall paintings of Herod's two main palaces, and the Roman-style bathhouses that he built. The synagogue, storehouses, and houses of the Jewish rebels have also been identified and restored. The meter-high circumvallation wall that the Romans built around Masada can be seen, together with 11 barracks for the Roman soldiers just outside this wall. Water cisterns <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> up the cliff drain the nearby wadis by an elaborate system of channels, which explains how the rebels managed to conserve enough water for such a long time.|$|E

25|$|The Woolnough {{design was}} used by Sentinel for their larger railway locomotives. It resembled most other three-drum designs, having almost-straight tubes. Its {{distinguishing}} feature was a firebrick wall <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> down the furnace. The furnace grate was on the longer side of this, with the combustion gases passing out through the tube bank, along inside a steel outer casing, then back within the shorter tube bank. Coiled tube superheaters {{were placed in the}} gas flow outside the tubes. The combustion gases thus passed through the tube bank twice, once outwards and then again inwards. A single central chimney exhausted from the centre of the far end, not as usual from outside the tubes. The relative temperature difference between gas passage through the two sections of the bank led to a circulation current that was upwards through the first, hotter, part of the bank and downwards through the further, less hot, bank. Circulation was also controlled by an internal weir plate within the upper water drum, so as to keep a depth of water above the ends of the hotter tubes, thus avoiding overheating of dry tubes.|$|E
500|$|In {{his writing}} Chatwin experimented with format. With In Patagonia, Clapp said Chatwin {{described}} the book's structure of 97 vignettes as [...] "Cubist." [...] "n other words," [...] she said, [...] "lots of small pictures tilting away and {{toward each other}} to create this strange original portrait of Patagonia." [...] The Songlines was another attempt by Chatwin to experiment with format. The book begins as a novel narrated {{by a man named}} Bruce but about <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> through it becomes a commonplace book filled with quotations, anecdotes, and summaries of others' research in an attempt to explore human restlessness. Some of Chatwin's critics did not think he succeeded in The Songlines with this approach, although others applauded his effort at trying an unconventional structure.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{felt that}} the special effects overshadowed other {{elements}} of the film. Canby stated that the film [...] "owes more to [...] than it does to the director, the writers or even the producer". Livingston felt that Trumbull and Dykstra's work on the film was not as impressive as on Star Wars and Close Encounters due to the limited amount of production time. Godfrey called the effects [...] "stunning", but conceded that they threatened to overpower the story <b>two-thirds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> into the film. Kroll, Martin, and Arnold agreed that the effects were not able to carry the film or gloss over its other deficiencies; [...] "I'm not sure that Trumbull & Co. have succeeded in pulling the philosophic chestnuts of Roddenberry and his co-writers out of the fire," [...] Arnold wrote.|$|E
