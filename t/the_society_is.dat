5|$|At first sight, Terahnee {{seems like}} a Utopia. Everyone lives in sumptuous palaces, and nobody goes hungry; in reality, <b>the</b> <b>society</b> <b>is</b> run by slave labor. After writing new Ages, the Terahnee people capture the {{inhabitants}} to use as slaves, considering themselves gods over their Ages. The Terahnee people are taught not to 'see' the slaves; only the servants interact with the lower orders. The Terahnee are suddenly stricken by a plague the D'ni brought with them; Atrus and his companions help the Age's slaves recover and create a new society before returning to D'ni and sealing up the path to Terahnee.|$|E
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>society</b> <b>is</b> matrilineal, {{it is not}} matriarchal. In past monarchies of the state, {{the son of the}} {{youngest}} sister of the king inherited the throne. Even now in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly or village councils or panchayats the representation of women in politics is minimal. As of 2013, in a Meghalaya Legislative Assembly of 60 members, there are only four women. In the male centric Dorbar Shnong, which is the basic political arm of the tribes, women are not permitted to hold office. However, women feel that they take better care of money matters than men and they enjoy economic freedom.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, enthusiasts for Delius's music who {{had gone}} to Bradford for the centenary festival formed the Delius Society; Fenby became its first president. With around 400 members, <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>is</b> {{independent}} from the Trust, but works closely with it. Its general objectives are the furtherance of knowledge of Delius's life and works, and the encouragement of performances and recordings. In 2004, as a stimulus for young musicians to study and perform Delius's music, the Society established an annual Delius Prize competition, with a prize of £1,000 to the winner. In June 1984, at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, the Delius Trust sponsored a commemorative production of A Village Romeo and Juliet by Opera North, to mark the 50th anniversary of Delius's death.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Society</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} as <b>the</b> Philosophical <b>Society</b> of Australasia on 27 June 1821.

5000|$|The Yonge Street Agricultural <b>Society</b> <b>was</b> {{founded in}} 1849. [...] They {{organised}} the first Richmond Hill spring fair, held on May 24, 1849.

5|$|It is well {{understood}} that, {{at the moment}} {{it is only a}} minimum, <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>is</b> always free to put in place the number of trains necessary to transport passengers who present themselves, that if it will satisfy this requirement, its proper interest is guaranteed, and, in giving greater public satisfaction, its infrastructure will be wisely used, instead of it travelling empty for part of the day to the detriment of its business. Being given the lower frequency of service on weekdays and Saturdays, except Thursdays (racing), we can perfectly accept the reduction to ten trips to those going from the racecourse to the forest, but, concerning the part of the journey from Trianon to the racecourse, it is imperative that the Chief Engineer (Lechelas) keeps the minimum to 30, otherwise there will be a kind of abandonment of the line, because for this small distance, it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures.|$|E
5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which <b>the</b> <b>society</b> <b>is</b> ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>society</b> <b>is</b> {{governed by}} its Council, which is chaired by the Society's President, {{according}} {{to a set of}} statutes and standing orders. The members of Council and the President are elected from and by its Fellows, the basic members of the society, who are themselves elected by existing Fellows. As of 2016, there are about 1,600 fellows, allowed to use the postnominal title FRS (Fellow of the Royal Society), with up to 52 new fellows appointed each year. There are also royal fellows, honorary fellows and foreign members, the last of which are allowed to use the postnominal title ForMemRS (Foreign Member of the Royal Society). The Royal Society President is Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, who took up the post on 30 November 2015.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundation}} of <b>the</b> <b>society</b> <b>was</b> made in 1965 by establishing the IEEE Quantum Electronics Council (QEC).

25|$|The main {{business}} of <b>the</b> <b>society</b> <b>is</b> the weekly debates held each Wednesday Night during term time. Chamber debating, including the debates (known as Public Business Meetings) with invited guest speakers for which <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>is</b> best known, {{tends to be}} less formalised (even if more formal) than competitive debates, and the manner of delivery is closer to public speaking, with audience engagement far more important.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Society</b> <b>is</b> a {{corporate}} {{member of the}} Co-operative Group, sourcing its food through the national buying programme, the Co-operative Retail Trading Group.|$|E
25|$|Another example {{involves}} the production possibilities frontier, which specifies what combinations {{of various types}} of goods can be produced by a society with certain amounts of various resources. The frontier specifies the trade-offs that <b>the</b> <b>society</b> <b>is</b> faced with — if <b>the</b> <b>society</b> <b>is</b> fully utilizing its resources, more of one good can be produced only {{at the expense of}} producing less of another good. A society must then use some process to choose among the possibilities on the frontier.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>society</b> <b>was</b> founded as <b>the</b> Bethel Historical <b>Society</b> on May 31, 1966 at {{a meeting}} at the Bethel Library Association.
