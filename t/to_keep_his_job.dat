He {{has no idea what}} to do and starts pressing buttons at random, somehow causing a nuclear meltdown even though there was no nuclear material inside the van. The NRC officials tell Mr. Burns that Homer's job requires college training in nuclear physics, and that he must go back to college <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job.</b> Homer is rejected by every college he applies to, but Mr. Burns helps him get into Springfield University.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{first season}} in the Second Division in 1954–55 brought them an 11th-place finish. During this season the club {{suffered}} the biggest defeat in its history, a 9–1 loss to Birmingham City. Although in the following season they improved to third place, {{it was not enough}} for Welsh <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> and he was sacked {{at the end of the}} season. His replacement was Phil Taylor, a former captain of the club and a member of the coaching staff. Taylor signed players such as Ronnie Moran, Alan A'Court and Jimmy Melia, who would become mainstays of the club for seasons to come, but was unable to guide Liverpool back to the First Division. The Liverpool board persisted with him, despite the club's loss to non-League side Worcester City in the third round of the FA Cup in January 1959. His tenure ended during the 1959–60 season; after a good start, their form began to tail off mid-season, and after a defeat to Huddersfield Town, Taylor resigned. The man who replaced him was Huddersfield's manager, Bill Shankly.|$|E

25|$|The cabinet was {{composed}} of four Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin allies, three Maga allies, and three allies of Apithy. Gabriel Lozes, appointed minister of finance; Theophile Paoletti, new minister of information and tourism; Edmond Doussou-Yovo, minister of education; and Karl Ahouansou, minister of communication, were all friends of Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin. Maga's colleagues in the cabinet were Pascal Chabi Kao, minister of finance; Albert Ouassa, minister of health; and Chabi Mama, minister of rural development; while Apithy friends were Ambroise Agboton, minister of labor; Joseph Keke, minister of economy and planning; and Michel Toko, minister of justice and guardian of the seals.

25|$|During {{the preseason}} of 2001, Eskimos head coach Don Matthews {{was fired in}} a famously messy separation, {{allegedly}} for health reasons, {{and was replaced by}} Tom Higgins. Higgins would later develop a reputation for changing quarterbacks frequently, and although the flashy Greene had been the starter in Edmonton for two years, his spotty arm was beginning to draw criticism from fans. The door was wide open for the two backups, Crowley and Maas, to show that they could take the reins from the faltering Greene. Crowley was strong and Greene fought valiantly <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> but by Week 7 it was Maas who had taken the starting quarterback spot that he would keep {{to the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|Strom wrote {{a weekly}} column for {{newspapers}} near Pottstown which provided a {{perspective of the}} life of an NBA referee. In the spring of 1979, Strom criticized Chicago Bulls team management, in particular president Jonathan Kovler, over the firing of head coach Larry Costello after 56 games. While this incident was occurring, shortly after, Strom was involved in a shoving match with a fan and security officer following a game played in Phoenix, Arizona. These incidents led to Strom being suspended the remainder of the 1979 NBA Playoffs and was required to apologize to Kovler. In order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> Strom assured the league {{that there would be no}} animosity directed towards the Bulls and decided to discontinue writing his weekly column.|$|E
50|$|Wright {{became a}} {{candidate}} in the 2004 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Peter Fitzgerald. He ran on a conservative platform of opposition to same-sex marriage and the criminalization of abortion. He was the only candidate from either major party not from northern region of the state. In a year notable for {{a record number of}} millionaire candidates, Wright had <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> day <b>job</b> during the primary campaign. A perpetual longshot throughout the campaign, he finished fifth of eight candidates, receiving 17,189 (2.3%) of 661,804 votes cast.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the First World War, there was a great demand for qualified coaches. Likewise, LeRoy Sprankle was quickly contacted by a high school in Carrollton, OH to coach its basketball team. Despite having to commute by train and lodge overnight twice a week in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> Canton <b>job,</b> Sprankle accepted the position out of his interest for helping boys. His success there warranted him an offer to coach in Tennessee at Kingsport High School (which was later renamed Dobyns-Bennett High School). In late 1921, he accepted the offer and became the head baseball, basketball, football, and track coach.|$|R

25|$|It {{was widely}} known that Griffin hoped <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> under President Barack Obama so that Constellation and NASA's other {{programs}} could maintain their steady progress. In {{a phone call}} {{on the day after}} the election, Senator Bill Nelson (D, FL) requested of Lori Garver, who led the incoming Obama Administration's Transition Team, that the Administration allow Griffin to remain as NASA Administrator to provide programmatic and management continuity. However, his resignation (required of and offered by all agency heads due to an incoming President) was accepted. In part, this was because of disagreements between Griffin and Garver over the state of Project Constellation. Griffin gave a farewell address to NASA on 16 January 2009, in which he praised NASA for its recovery from the Columbia disaster and urged employees to support the new administrator, whoever it may be. He left office the day President Obama was inaugurated.|$|E
25|$|After the 2008 season, turmoil emerged when A. J. Allmendinger and Reed Sorenson {{were signed}} to drive for the team, while Elliott Sadler was {{released}} from his ride in the 19 car and planned to sue the team <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job.</b> In {{the midst of a}} struggling economy, in January 2009 GEM merged with fellow Dodge team Petty Enterprises, which could no longer find sponsors for any of its cars, thus expanding the team to four cars. The organization was renamed Richard Petty Motorsports in the process. Ray Evernham was not involved in the merger negotiations, and both he and Richard Petty only maintained minority shares in the new team. Near the end of the season, the team announced its departure from the Dodge banner after being its flagship team since 2001. The team switched to Ford and would merge with Yates Racing, owned by Ford head engine builder Doug Yates, which had fielded several successful NASCAR drivers including Davey Allison, Ernie Irvan, Dale Jarrett, and Ricky Rudd.|$|E
25|$|The {{episode of}} History Detectives, which aired on July 2, 2014, {{reviewed}} the known evidence, thoroughly disputing the sabotage theory, and then {{focused on the}} question of why the steamboat was allowed to be crowded to several times its normal capacity before departure. The report blamed quartermaster Hatch, an individual with a long history of corruption and incompetence, who was able <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> due to political connections: he was the younger brother of Illinois politician Ozias M. Hatch, an advisor and close friend of President Lincoln. Throughout the war, Reuben Hatch had shown incompetence as a quartermaster and competence as a thief, bilking the government out of thousands of dollars. Although brought up on courts-martial charges, Hatch managed to get letters of recommendation from such noted authorities as President Abraham Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and General of the Army Ulysses S. Grant. The letters reside in the National Archives in Washington DC. After the disaster, Hatch refused three separate subpoenas to appear before Captain Speed's trial and give testimony. Hatch died in 1871, having escaped justice due to his numerous highly placed patrons—including two presidents.|$|E

50|$|Kramer was {{not able}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> {{starting}} <b>job</b> {{for the next three}} years, however, sharing duties with Peete and Andre Ware. In 1994, he {{signed as a free agent}} with the Chicago Bears, and spent the next five years with the club. In his two full seasons as a starter (1995 and 1997), he was highly productive and passed for over 3,000 yards. Kramer currently holds the Bears' single-season record for passing yards (3,838) and touchdown passes (29), and attempts in a single game with 60 on Nov 16, 1997. Kramer signed with the San Diego Chargers in the 1999 offseason, but retired midseason due to a neck injury. Though he also missed much of the 1996 season with a neck injury, the two injuries were unrelated.|$|R
25|$|Carpentier, who was 36 {{years old}} at the time, became the {{full-time}} driver for 2008, part of a unique rookie class stacked with open wheel veterans all trying to emulate the success found by Juan Pablo Montoya the previous year. This included IndyCar Series Champions Dario Franchitti and Sam Hornish, Jr., and CART and Formula One champion Jacques Villeneuve, as well as DEI development drivers Regan Smith and Aric Almirola. With Valvoline taking a backseat role in 2008 and Stanley Tools moving to the No. 19 car, GEM signed LifeLock for eight races, an identity security company making a large entrance investment into NASCAR. Charter Communications and Auto Value/Bumper to Bumper also sponsored several races. Carpentier won the pole at Loudon but otherwise struggled, as did his fellow open-wheel counterparts. He had no Top 10s, missed five races — including the Daytona 500 — and was out of the Top 35 in points when he was released after Kansas. Second-year driver A. J. Allmendinger replaced Carpentier, after being released from Red Bull Racing in favor of Scott Speed. In his five races for GEM, Allmendinger was impressive, posting three Top 15's and often outrunning his teammates. Allmendinger was initially rewarded with a full-time ride in the No. 19 car, replacing Elliott Sadler. This was derailed when Sadler intended to sue the team and Allmendinger <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> when Reed Sorenson was signed as a third driver, and when several sponsors threatened to leave the team in response to the recent moves.|$|E
