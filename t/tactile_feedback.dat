There are also benefits in using low-frequency haptic feedback in simple interaction tasks in 2 D environments. Our study aimed at finding out how <b>tactile</b> and force <b>feedback</b> could be used to improve interaction in a direct manipulation desktop application. According to the user study, the users found the additional <b>tactile</b> and force <b>feedback</b> effects helpful in the events that cannot be instantly visually verified, e. g., when objects were touched with the tool. Both the <b>tactile</b> and force <b>feedback</b> seemed to have potential although some redesigning for the effects must be done. ...|$|R

40|$|For {{cutaneous}} sense displays, {{the generation}} of tactile stimuli {{in response to the}} hand movements of the operators is associated with active touch and is considered {{to be one of the}} effective display methods, which inevitably causes delayed <b>tactile</b> <b>feedbacks</b> from <b>tactile</b> displays. The knowledge of the detection threshold of system latency between the hand movements and the stimuli is helpful in designing the tactile displays. In this study, the identification of the thresholds through psychophys-ical experiments of 13 participants revealed two types of the thresholds. One was the threshold at which the participants noticed the existence of latency. The other was the minimal time delay that could affect the subjective feelings of the participants while they were not conscious of the latency.

2500|$|Tactile memory {{representations}} {{are similar}} in nature to visual representations, although {{there is not enough}} data to reliably compare the strength of the two kinds of stimuli. One study suggests that there is a difference in mental processing level due to innate differences between visual and tactile stimuli representations. [...] In this study, subjects were presented with an object in both visual and tactile form (a subject is shown a sphere but cannot touch it, and later is given a similar sphere to only hold and not view). [...] Subjects had more trouble identifying size difference in visual fields than using <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback.</b> A suggestion for the lower level of size processing in visual fields is that it results from the high variance in viewed object size due to perspective and distance.|$|E
2500|$|Today, {{there are}} more than 25 million Botts' dots in use in California, though they have started falling out of favor.

In California, highway lanes may be marked either solely by Botts' dots, or dots placed over painted lines. [...] Four dots are used for broken lines on freeways, and broken lines on surface streets may use only three dots.

40|$|The {{intentional}} {{binding effect}} {{refers to a}} subjective compression over a temporal interval between the start point initialized by a voluntary action and the endpoint signaled by an external sensory (visual or audio) feedback. The present study aimed to {{explore the influence of}} <b>tactile</b> sensory <b>feedback</b> on this binding effect by comparing voluntary key-press actions with voluntary key-release actions. In experiment 1, each participant was instructed to report the perceived interval (in ms) between an action and the subsequent visual sensory feedback. In this task, either the action (key-press or key-release) was voluntarily performed by the participant or a kinematically identical movement was passively applied to the left index finger of the participant. In experiment 2, we explored whether the difference in the perception of time was affected by the direction of action. In experiment 3, we developed an apparatus in which two parallel laser beams were generated by a laser emission unit and detected by a laser receiver unit; this allowed the movement of the left index finger to be detected without it touching a keyboard (i. e., without any <b>tactile</b> sensory <b>feedback).</b> Convergent results from all of the experiments showed that the temporal binding effect was only observed when the action was both voluntary and involved physical contact with the key, suggesting that the combination of intention and <b>tactile</b> sensory <b>feedback,</b> as a form of top-down processing, likely distracted attention from temporal events and caused the different binding effects...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tactile</b> sensory <b>feedback</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in our daily life. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is widely accepted to produce artificial tactile sensation. To explore the underlying mechanism of tactile sensation under TENS, this paper presented a novel 3 D TENS computational model including an active Aβ tactile nerve fiber (TNF) model and a forearm finite element model with the fine-layered skin structure. The conduction velocity vs. fiber diameter and strength-duration relationships in this combined TENS model matched well with experimental data. Based on this validated TENS model, threshold current variation were further investigated under different stimulating electrode sizes with varied fiber diameters. The computational results showed that the threshold current intensity increased with electrode size, and larger nerve fibers were recruited at lower current intensities. These results were comparable to our psychophysical experimental data from six healthy subjects. This novel 3 D TENS model would further guide the floorplan of the surface electrodes, and the stimulating paradigms for <b>tactile</b> sensory <b>feedback...</b>|$|R

2500|$|With purely {{mechanical}} {{flight control}} systems, the aerodynamic {{forces on the}} control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot, allowing <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> of airspeed. With hydromechanical flight control systems, however, the load on the surfaces cannot be felt {{and there is a}} risk of overstressing the aircraft through excessive control surface movement. To overcome this problem, artificial feel systems can be used. For example, for the controls of the RAF's Avro Vulcan jet bomber and the RCAF's Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow supersonic interceptor (both 1950s-era designs), the required force feedback was achieved by a spring device. [...] The fulcrum of this device was moved in proportion to the square of the air speed (for the elevators) to give increased resistance at higher speeds. For the controls of the American Vought F-8 Crusader and the LTV A-7 Corsair II warplanes, a 'bob-weight' was used in the pitch axis of the control stick, giving force feedback that was proportional to the airplane's normal acceleration.|$|E
2500|$|A primary {{consideration}} for the game was the cost of entry to enjoy the new features of the game particularly in Pro mode; both {{the cost of the}} new keyboard and Pro guitars (ranging from $80 to 280) and the time investment to learn these aspects was considered high and may only cater to niche players. The Metro noted that if one does not purchase any of the additional hardware controllers, [...] "it's not much different to Rock Band 2". Goldstein commented that the amount of investment into the game will affect one's perception of the game's value: [...] "either something completely new and challenging or just more tracks to rock out to". Goldstein further noted that with the cost and time spent on the Pro guitar models, [...] "why not spend a little more and buy the real thing". Several reviewers commented that the buttoned Mustang Pro guitar is not as sturdy as other instruments and does not have the same tactile feel as a real guitar. Specifically, the reviewers noted that the width of the button impressions do not vary in width as real guitar strings would, and there is no <b>tactile</b> <b>feedback</b> as one would have with a fretboard. These reviewers suggested that players, if dedicated to the Pro guitar mode, to wait for the stringed Fender Squier which had more favorable reviews.|$|E

40|$|The Tactile Internet is at {{the core}} of the 5 G era, when the world will experience {{paradigm}} shift from content-delivery networks to service/labour-delivery ones. Systems that enable wireless communications of haptic data feature bi-directionality, high packet rate and resolution, large degrees of freedom, and above all, strict latency requirements in many applications, aggravating the shortage of wireless resources. Thus, more efficient haptic data reduction techniques are continuously summoned for. Previous studies  on haptic compression mostly resort to DPCM/ADPCM plus entropy coding and perception-based down-sampling for real-time scenarios, and model-based techniques such as DCT and LP for the rest. However, with few exceptions they always segregate tactile signals from kinaesthetic signals, employing only kinaesthetic feedbacks in real-time compression experiments. In addition, these techniques are not optimized for efficient performance at scale.  This thesis project proposes a novel multi-channel real-time haptic compression system aimed at teleoperation applications with both kinaesthetic and <b>tactile</b> <b>feedbacks.</b> It consists of a lossy compression layer featuring predictive coding and a lossless layer featuring channel reshuffle and group transmission. By using different quantizer designs in the lossy layer, it abates the need for entropy coding, and leave room for future perception-based data compression modules. The lossless layer exploits inter-channel sparsity for further data reduction. The system is evaluated on a tactile texture database published by University of Pennsylvania in MATLAB. The performance measurements are in both time and frequency domain, mostly objective, but include subjective considerations as well...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the work {{carried out on}} the development of a novel digit actuator system with <b>tactile</b> perception <b>feedback</b> to a user and demonstrated as a master-slave system. For the tactile surface of the digit, contrasting sensor elements of resistive strain gauges and optical fibre Bragg grating sensors were evaluated. A distributive tactile sensing system consisting of optimised neural networking schemes was developed, resulting in taxonomy of artificial touch. The device is suitable for use in minimal invasive surgical (MIS) procedures as a steerable tip and a digit constructed wholly from polymers makes it suitable for use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) environments enabling active monitoring of the patient during a procedure. To provide a realistic template of the work the research responded to the needs of two contrasting procedures: palpation of the prostate and endotracheal intubation in anaesthesia where the application of touch sense can significantly assist navigation. The performance of the approach was demonstrated with an experimental digit constructed for use in the laboratory in phantom trials.
