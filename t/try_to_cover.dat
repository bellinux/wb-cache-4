The danger this posed to the ship was readily apparent to the damage control crews but, whether through inadequate training, lack of practice (only three months had passed since the ship's commissioning) or general incompetence, their response to it proved fatally ineffectual. Efforts to pump out the damaged elevator well were bungled and no one thought to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> the increasingly lethal mixture with foam from the hangar's fire suppression system.|$|E
25|$|In early 2000, Helena lets Lucky (now Young) go and {{it becomes}} clear he has been brainwashed. Helena uses the Ice Princess diamond to make Lucky act violently and erases Lucky's {{memories}} of love for Elizabeth. Elizabeth fakes her death to help Nikolas (then Stephen Martines, credited as Coltin Scott) gain Helena's trust, and Lucky's visions of her and their love help him break Helena's control. They reunite, but {{he is unable to}} regain his feelings and in December 2001, Elizabeth stops their wedding when she realizes the truth. They struggle to start over, and Elizabeth breaks up with Lucky after she finds him kissing her sister Sarah Webber (then Sarah Laine). In August 2002, Lucky and Nikolas <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> up the death of Laura's stepfather Rick Webber (Chris Robinson) when they think Luke killed him. When Laura is told she killed Rick, she has a mental breakdown and has to be committed. Luke acts self-destructively and Nikolas takes control of Laura's treatment, causing tension between Luke and Lucky (now Vaughan). When Lucky's girlfriend Summer Halloway (Brittney Powell) is pushed off a cliff, he joins the police academy to help find evidence. Luke is unhappy that Lucky has become a cop, causing various rifts between them. In February 2004, Lucky almost dies during a fire at the Port Charles Hotel. When Nikolas (reprised by Christopher) is presumed dead in April, Lucky comforts Emily (now Natalia Livingston) and develops romantic feelings she does not return. Lucky is suspended for helping Nikolas when he presumably kills Helena. Lucky finds Helena, who shoots him, putting him into a coma. Luke unplugs his ventilator, causing him to breathe on his own. Meanwhile, Lucky and Elizabeth reconnect. Their financial struggles prompt Elizabeth to become a surrogate mother for Courtney (Alicia Leigh Willis) and Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher), upsetting Lucky, but Elizabeth miscarries in September 2005. They marry in October, and raises Liz's son Cameron as his own. Lucky almost dies in a train crash on the way to their honeymoon, and again during an encephalitis outbreak in February 2006. In April, he has a serious back injury while trying to save Elizabeth from Manny Ruiz (Robert LaSardo). Overcome by his injury, financial trouble and guilt over the death of his partner Jesse Beaudry (Matt Marraccini), Lucky becomes addicted to painkillers and has an affair with Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms). Elizabeth walks in on them, and sleeps with Jason Morgan, becoming pregnant. She lets Lucky believe he is the father to avoid him relapsing. Maxie fakes a pregnancy in an unsuccessful attempt to keep Lucky. Elizabeth divorces Lucky, but they remarry after he completes rehab. In May 2007, Elizabeth gives birth to Jacob Spencer. Her relationship with Jason makes Lucky jealous, and their marriage struggles. Lucky starts dating Jason's ex-girlfriend Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) as they divorce. In November 2007, Lucky discovers the truth about Jake, but agrees to the secret to protect him from Jason's dangerous lifestyle. Lucky and Sam break up.|$|E
500|$|Mission: Earth, Voyage to the Home Planet {{received}} a generally favorable reception in media coverage and book reviewers. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said, [...] "The authors convey the awe and wonderment of seeing Earth from {{space and the}} intricate delicacy of the Earth's ecology". The Dallas Morning News said, [...] "The astronaut's descriptions are vivid". A review in Booklist was more critical; it said, [...] "The authors <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> too much in so few pages, and the narrative, with several focal points, becomes simplified at times". School Library Journal wrote, [...] "It provides a unique look at a new method of research and an opportunity for youngsters to read one scientist's account of what it's like to engage in this exciting field of endeavor". The book was selected for inclusion in books Best Books for Children, and Adventuring With Books, or educating youths about history by using children's literature works.|$|E

500|$|A {{review of}} the book by Ilana Steinhorn in Booklist was more critical. Steinhorn said, [...] "The authors <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> too much in so few pages, and the narrative, with several focal points, becomes {{simplified}} at times...Still, the account is interesting, and the many high-quality, often breathtaking color photographs and radar images complement the text nicely". Elaine Fort Weischedel reviewed the book for School Library Journal, and recommended it for teaching specific subject matter. She wrote, [...] "Pollution patterns, shifting ocean currents, destruction of rain forests, and other environmental changes were the heart of Jones's project, and this book might be used more successfully to supplement the curriculum in those areas than in units on space flight per se". Weischedel said the book [...] "provides a unique look at a new method of research and an opportunity for youngsters to read one scientist's account of what it's like to engage in this exciting field of endeavor". Horn Book Review called the book [...] "a uniquely personal account", and said it [...] "features a crowded design, but the many color photographs throughout the text are fascinating".|$|E

"One covereth {{violence}} {{with his}} garment": or, [...] "and violence covereth his garment," [...] or, it might be, {{in the same}} sense, [...] "he covereth his garment with violence" [...] , so that it cannot be hid, nor washed away, nor removed, but envelopes him and his garment; and that, to his shame and punishment. It was, as it were, [...] "an outer garment of violence", as Asaph says in Psalm 73:6, [...] "violence covereth them as a garment;" [...] or David in Psalm 109:18, [...] "he clothed himself with cursing as with a garment." [...] It was like a garment with [...] "fretting leprosy," [...] unclean and making unclean, to be burned with fire. Leviticus 13:47-58. Contrariwise, the redeemed saints had Revelation 7:14 [...] "washed their robes and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb." [...] Having declared God's hatred of this their doing, he sums {{up in the same}} words, but more briefly; [...] "and this being so, ye shall take heed to your spirit, and not deal treacherously." [...] Maurer translates, [...] "And (Jehovah hateth him who) covereth his garment (that is, his wife, in Arabic idiom; compare Genesis 20:16, 'He is to thee a covering of thy eyes'; the husband was so to the wife, and the wife to the husband; also Deuteronomy 22:30; Ruth 3:9; Ezekiel 16:8) with injury." [...] The Hebrew favors [...] "garment," [...] being accusative of the thing covered (as in Psalm 73:6). Their [...] "violence" [...] is the putting away of their wives; the [...] "garment" [...] with which they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> it is the plea of Moses' permission (Deuteronomy 24:1; compare Matthew 19:6-9).|$|E
2500|$|Following {{persecution}} and mob action in Missouri, Illinois, and other states, and {{the assassination of}} their prophet Joseph Smith in 1844, Mormon leader Brigham Young was chosen by {{the leaders of the}} Latter Day Saints (LDS) church to lead the LDS settlers west. He chose to lead his people to the Salt Lake Valley in present-day Utah. In 1847 Young led a small, especially picked fast-moving group of men and women from their Winter Quarters encampments near Omaha, Nebraska, and their approximately 50 temporary settlements on the Missouri River in Iowa including Council Bluffs. About 2,200 LDS pioneers went that first year as they filtered in from Mississippi, Colorado, California, and several other states. The initial pioneers were charged with establishing farms, growing crops, building fences and herds, and establishing preliminary settlements to feed and support the many thousands of emigrants expected in the coming years. After ferrying across the Missouri River and establishing wagon trains near what became Omaha, the Mormons followed the northern bank of the Platte River in Nebraska to Fort Laramie in present-day Wyoming. They initially started out in 1848 with trains of several thousand emigrants, which were rapidly split into smaller groups to be more easily accommodated at the limited springs and acceptable camping places on the trail. Organized as a complete evacuation from their previous homes, farms, and cities in Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa, this group consisted of entire families with no one left behind. The much larger presence of women and children meant these wagon trains did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> as much ground in a single day as Oregon and California bound emigrants. Typically taking about 100 days to cover the [...] trip to Salt Lake City. (The Oregon and California emigrants typically averaged about [...] per day.) In Wyoming, the Mormon emigrants followed the main Oregon/California/Mormon Trail through Wyoming to Fort Bridger, where they split from the main trail and followed (and improved) the rough path known as Hastings Cutoff, used by the ill-fated Donner Party in 1846.|$|E
