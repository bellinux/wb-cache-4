5|$|Goebbels, however, used {{not only}} {{intimidation}} but also cajoling and generosity <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> goals. Ferdinand Marian requested compensation of 50,000 marks for {{taking on the}} role of Süß, an amount double anything he had received for previous roles. When asked to approve this amount, Goebbels did so citing the importance of the film and the need for a high-caliber cast to ensure its success.|$|E

50|$|Owain Glyndŵr was {{a prince}} {{descended from the}} Kings of Powys who led a revolt against English rule in Wales between 1400 and 1415. His forces even pushed into England and came close <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>his</b> goal of Welsh independence. He was called Y Mab Darogan in his own day but was {{ultimately}} defeated and subsequently disappeared.|$|R
50|$|Bull {{played only}} one {{game in the}} English top flight — coming on as a substitute, {{replacing}} Andy Thompson, for West Bromwich Albion in 1986 — {{the rest of his}} career was spent in the lower divisions. He came close <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>his</b> ambition of reaching the Premier League in 1995 and 1997, but Wolves lost in the play-offs both times.|$|R
5|$|On April 7, 2016, N'Diaye {{declared}} for the 2016 NBA draft, {{but did not}} hire an agent. While he departed UC Irvine, {{he vowed}} to continue his studies in order <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> dream of getting a college degree. He was later named to the Senegal national basketball team's preliminary squad for the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Manila.|$|E

Leslie harbors a strong crush on Mark due to a romantic encounter they had several years ago, but Mark does not return her feelings. Mark assists Leslie with her plan to turn the pit next to Ann's house into a park, despite believing that the plan has no chance of success.|$|E
5|$|The story also explores Balzac's {{conviction}} that a person's {{name is a}} powerful indicator {{of his or her}} destiny, an idea he drew from the work of Laurence Sterne. The title character, with his keen intellect, is based on Balzac's conception of himself: a visionary genius who fails <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> true potential because of less talented individuals with more social power.|$|E
5000|$|Wolfe has {{described}} Peace as his favorite {{of his own}} work, {{as it is the}} one where he came closest <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>his</b> original goals. Neil Gaiman, who has frequently praised the novel, said: [...] "Peace really was a gentle Midwestern memoir the first time I read it. It only became a horror novel on the second or the third reading." ...|$|R

50|$|With {{tremendous}} {{economic and}} political clout, Harada seems close <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>his</b> goals, and is ready to destroy anyone who stands in his way. The great irony is that Harada truly feels he was born to save the human race; in his own mind, he is {{the hero of the}} story. But, in his haste to eliminate any opposition to his grand scheme, Toyo Harada has lost his own humanity.|$|R
5|$|This new {{constructional}} technique allowed Gaudí <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> greatest architectural goal; {{to perfect}} and go beyond Gothic style. The hyperboloid vaults have their centre where Gothic vaults had their keystone, and the hyperboloid {{allows for a}} hole in this space to let natural light in. In the intersection between vaults, where Gothic vaults have ribs, the hyperboloid allows for holes as well, which Gaudí employed {{to give the impression}} of a starry sky.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} Rundstedt to Hitler in October 1943 {{regarding}} the weak defences in France {{led to the}} appointment of Rommel to oversee the construction of further fortifications along the expected invasion-front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg. Rommel was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands. Nazi Germany's tangled command structure {{made it difficult for}} Rommel <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> task. He was not allowed to give orders to the Organisation Todt, which was commanded by armaments minister Albert Speer, so in some places he had to assign soldiers to do construction work.|$|E
5|$|Bruix's {{orders were}} {{to combine the}} French and Spanish fleets and rescue Napoleon's army, {{stranded}} in Egypt following the Battle of the Nile, but the ships in Cádiz were prevented from joining their French allies by an opposing wind, and although the British offered their line-of-battle, it was declined and the Brest fleet instead stood out for the Straits of Gibraltar. Elphinstone followed as far as Cape Spartel before first returning {{to check on the}} fleet in Cádiz, then sailing to join Jervis at Gibraltar, arriving at 09:00 on 10May. Elphinstone made several further attempts to track down and bring the French to action, without success. Bruix was able to amass a powerful fleet of 59 ships but failed <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> ultimate goal and returned to Brest on 8August.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow states [...] "Kelly in 1951 was already long on <b>his</b> way <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>his</b> own sound. Influenced most by Bud Powell but also {{displaying}} {{some of the}} joy of Teddy Wilson's style along with his own chord voicings, Kelly gives listeners no hints on this enjoyable CD (which has two complete sessions plus three alternate takes) {{that he was still}} a teenager".|$|R
5000|$|On {{the opening}} day of the tournament, amateur player Adam Duffy {{defeated}} world number 9 and two-time UK Champion Ding Junhui 6-2, a result that was described as [...] "one of the biggest upsets in UK Championship history". In the sixth frame of his third-round match against Neil Robertson, Thailand's Thepchaiya Un-Nooh came close <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>his</b> first maximum break in professional competition, but missed the final black off the spot.|$|R
25|$|El-Yafi {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of the struggle to give women the right to vote, which he was able <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> with <b>his</b> cabinet in power in 1952.|$|R
5|$|Buffon {{transferred}} from Parma to Juventus on 3 July 2001 for €52million, along with former Parma teammate Lilian Thuram, and was handed the number 1 shirt {{as the starting}} goalkeeper, replacing Edwin van der Sar, who was sold to Fulham. Buffon later said {{that there had been}} an initial possibility for him to join Roma, but they signed Ivan Pelizzoli instead, and although negotiations were ongoing with Barcelona, he chose Juventus because his father convinced him he would be likely <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> ambition of winning the Scudetto. This transfer fee made Buffon Juventus's most expensive purchase ever, a record which was only broken in 2016 by the acquisition of Gonzalo Higuaín.|$|E
5|$|Central to {{the plot}} of the game are two main {{characters}}, Ramza Beoulve and Delita Heiral. The two characters are childhood friends, and while both are born of differing social classes; Ramza a noble and Delita a commoner, both disregarded this fact and grew up together believing in justice and honor, as taught by Ramza's father Balbanes. However, as the story progresses, the two characters faced many conflicts that changed their viewpoint on life; Delita seeks to manipulate the upper class <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> dreams, while Ramza believes in justice and honor regardless of name and class.|$|E
5|$|Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to {{the happy}} couple, plot and scheme {{endlessly}} {{to bring about}} the misery and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first a sympathetic character, {{but by the end of}} the novel she is presented as sharing a face with a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a rough sketch of the title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as much as to Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by Marie and unable to wield the might of the commandant, Corentin relies on trickery and deception <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> ruthless ends.|$|E
50|$|Joho's {{manifesto}} stipulated {{the tasks}} he intends <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> in <b>his</b> governorship. These include; fishing, tourism, manufacturing, health and sanitation, solid waste management, roads and housing, among others.|$|R
50|$|Intentional Dynamics: {{dynamics}} that unfold when the agent {{has only one}} intention (goal) and begins to act towards it, perceiving and acting. It is a trajectory towards the achievement of a solution or goal, the process of tuning one’s perception (attention). Each intention is meaningfully bounded, where the dynamics of that intention inform the agent {{of whether or not}} he is getting closer <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>his</b> goal. If the agent is not getting closer to his goal, he will take corrective action, and then continue forward. This is the agent’s intentional dynamics, and continues on until he <b>achieves</b> <b>his</b> goal.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the movie, Zinga {{picks up}} his career as a singer again and {{performs}} the song he sang a long time ago, [...] "Lonely Road" [...] on a stage decorated as his little island, referring <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>his</b> dream and the help he brought to his people, leading them to a better life.|$|R
5|$|During the 1993 {{run for the}} {{national}} title, Smith used a method that was introduced to him {{at a conference in}} Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what he would look like if he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals. Smith took a picture of the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, few Brazilians opposed {{slavery and}} even fewer openly {{condemned}} it. PedroII, who did not own slaves, {{was one of the}} few who did oppose slavery. Its abolition was a delicate subject. Slaves were used by everyone, from the richest to the poorest. PedroII wanted to end the practice gradually to soften the impact to the national economy. With no constitutional authority to directly intervene to abolish slavery, the Emperor would need to use all his skills to convince, influence and gather support among politicians <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> goal. His first open move occurred back in 1850, when he threatened to abdicate unless the General Assembly declared the Atlantic slave trade illegal.|$|E
5|$|Lambda is an {{advanced}} lifeform created on Fodra. His mistreatment by humans fueled his hatred towards them. During the party's childhood, he resides inside Richard {{after he was}} injured by Sophie and as a result, saved Richard's life. Seven years later, Lambda is reawakened when Richard receives a fatal wound. Lambda empowers Richard and manipulates him <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> goals of destroying humanity. After he is defeated by the party, Lambda is absorbed by Asbel who convinces him to give humans a chance. In Lineage and Legacies, he absorbs Fodra's consciousness to dissuade her hatred as Asbel did for him. He is voiced by Shigeru Nakahara and dubbed by Keith Silverstein.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a speech}} {{in front of his}} {{supporters}} following the election, BQ leader Gilles Duceppe claimed <b>to</b> have <b>achieved</b> <b>his</b> objectives, adding: [...] "without the Bloc Québécois tonight, Mr. Harper would have formed a majority government".|$|R
50|$|During the off-season, {{he visited}} {{places such as}} Australia, New Zealand, and various {{countries}} in Europe. He also spent time in Vail, Colorado tuning in his snowboarding skills. He worked for one winter for the Mammoth Mountain Ski Patrol. After football, he invested much of his football earnings in business ventures that were not very successful, including a line of sports clothing and a beach volleyball league. Dubose had aspirations of becoming a successful pro beach volleyball player and was on <b>his</b> way <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>his</b> goal.|$|R
5000|$|Skeletor (...) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} and the primary antagonist of the Masters of the Universe franchise created by Mattel. He is the archenemy of He-Man. Depicted as a muscular blue humanoid with a purple hood over his yellow bare-bone skull, Skeletor seeks to conquer Castle Grayskull so he can obtain its ancient secrets, which would make him unstoppable and enable him to conquer and rule the fictional world of Eternia. However, the incompetence of his henchmen is always an impediment <b>to</b> <b>achieving</b> <b>his</b> ambitions.|$|R
5|$|Late in World War II, Hitler charged Himmler {{with the}} command of the Army Group Upper Rhine and the Army Group Vistula; he failed <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> {{assigned}} objectives and Hitler replaced him in these posts. Realising {{that the war was}} lost, he attempted to open peace talks with the western Allies without Hitler's knowledge shortly before the war ended. Hearing of this, Hitler dismissed him from all his posts in April 1945 and ordered his arrest. Himmler attempted to go into hiding, but was detained and then arrested by British forces once his identity became known. While in British custody, he committed suicide on 23 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|Norman adopts the Green Goblin {{identity}} {{with the goal}} of becoming the leader of organized crime in the city, and intends to cement his position by defeating Spider-Man. Acting on his own as Green Goblin, or through his employment of other super-criminals such as the Headsman, he would harass Spider-Man many times, but fail <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> goal. Soon, Mendel Stromm returns from prison, and attempts to exact revenge on Osborn using an army of robots, but Norman is saved by Spider-Man, and Stromm apparently dies of a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Metternich’s {{diplomacy}} and statesmanship {{became the focus}} of praise in the twentieth century from more favourably inclined historians, particularly biographer Heinrich von Srbik. For example, particularly after WWII, historians were more likely to defend Metternich’s policies as reasonable attempts <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>his</b> goals, chiefly {{the balance of power in}} Europe. Sympathetic historians point out that Metternich correctly foresaw and worked to prevent Russian dominance in Europe, succeeding where his successors would fail 130 years later. As argued by Srbik, Metternich himself pursued legality, cooperation, and dialogue, and therefore helped ensure thirty years of peace, the “Age of Metternich”. Authors like Peter Viereck and Ernst B. Haas also give Metternich credit for his more liberal ideals, even if they weighed relatively little in his overall policies.|$|E
50|$|Terminal Values {{refer to}} {{desirable}} end-states of existence. These are the goals {{that a person}} would like <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> during <b>his</b> or her lifetime. These values vary among different groups of people in different cultures.|$|R
50|$|Vittorio Stanguellini {{tried very}} hard to gain a win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. However, with his limited resources, he never was able <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> this. <b>His</b> best finish was a fourth in class.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked what}} he wants <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> in <b>his</b> career, Ravales replied, [...] "I {{want to win the}} Best Actor Award." [...] He added that his goal in life is to have his own {{restaurant}} business someday.|$|R
