5|$|Jordan {{signed a}} {{military}} pact with Egypt just before Israel launched {{a preemptive strike}} on Egypt to begin the Six-Day War in June 1967, where Jordan and Syria joined the war. The Arab states were defeated and Jordan {{lost control of the}} West Bank to Israel. The War of Attrition with Israel followed, which included the 1968 Battle of Karameh where the combined forces of the Jordanian Armed Forces and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) repelled an Israeli attack on the Karameh camp on the Jordanian border with the West Bank. Despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> had limited involvement against the Israeli forces, the events at Karameh gained wide recognition and acclaim in the Arab world. As a result, the time period following the battle witnessed an upsurge of support for Palestinian paramilitary elements (the fedayeen) within Jordan from other Arab countries. The fedayeen activities soon became a threat to Jordan's rule of law. In September 1970, the Jordanian army targeted the fedayeen and the resultant fighting led to the expulsion of Palestinian fighters from various PLO groups into Lebanon, in a civil war that became known as Black September.|$|E

25|$|As the Armistice Demarcation Lines were {{technically}} not borders, the Arabs {{considered that}} Israel was restricted in its rights {{to develop the}} DMZ and exploitation of the water resources. Further that as {{a state of war}} still existed with the Arab nations, the Arab League was not hindered in their right to deny Israel the freedom of navigation through the Arab League waters. Also it was argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> had the right of return and that the Israeli use of abandoned property was therefore not legitimate.|$|E

25|$|On April 8, A major gunbattle broke out, {{damaging}} {{the facade of}} the church and causing a fire. Both sides claimed the shooting had begun from the other side. The IDF claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> had opened fire from a bell tower, wounding two Israel Border Police gendarmes in a nearby rooftop look-out. An IDF officer said the Israeli troops returned fire, and threw a smoke grenade, which started a blaze in a second-floor meeting hall overlooking the Basilica of St Catherine, adjacent to the Church of the Nativity. One Palestinian militant was killed.|$|E
25|$|At the December 1947 Cairo summit, under {{pressure}} by public opinion, the Arab leaders {{decided to create}} a military command that united all the heads of all the major Arab states, headed by Safwat. They still ignored his calls for financial and military aid, preferring to defer any decision {{until the end of}} the Mandate, but, nevertheless, decide to form the Arab Liberation Army, which would go into action in the following weeks. On the night of 20–21 January 1948, around 700 armed Syrians entered Palestine via Transjordan. In February 1948, Safwat reiterated his demands, but they fell on deaf ears: the Arab governments hoped <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> aided by the Arab Liberation Army, could manage on their own until the International community renounced the partition plan.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{violence}} of the second intifada and the political success of Hamas (a group dedicated to Israel's destruction) have convinced many Israelis that peace and negotiation are not possible and a two state system is not the answer. Hardliners believe that Israel should annex all Palestinian territory, or at least all minus the Gaza Strip. Israelis view the peace process as hindered and near impossible due to terrorism on the part of Palestinians and do not trust Palestinian leadership to maintain control. In fact, Pedahzur goes as {{far as to say that}} suicide terrorism succeeded where peace negotiations failed in encouraging withdrawal by Israelis from cities in the West Bank. A common theme throughout the peace process has been a feeling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> give too little in their peace offers.|$|E

25|$|There are {{divergent}} {{views on}} the peace process held by US officials, citizens and lobbying groups. All recent US Presidents have maintained a policy that Israel must give {{up some of the}} land that it conquered in the 1967 war in order to achieve peace; <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> must actively prevent terrorism; and that Israel has an unconditional right to exist. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush publicly supported {{the creation of a new}} Palestinian state out of most of the current Palestinian territories, based on the idea of self-determination for the Palestinian people, and President Obama has continued that policy. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thought that peace can only be achieved through direct, bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Obama outlined the pursuit of the two-state solution as American policy for achieving Palestinian aspirations, Israeli security, and a measure of stability in the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947—1949 (1988), Morris {{argues that the}} 700,000 Palestinians who fled their homes in 1947 left mostly due to Israeli {{military}} attacks; fear of impending attacks; and expulsions. He argues {{that there was no}} centralized expulsion policy as such, but expulsions were ordered by the Israeli high command as needed. This was a controversial position when Morris first wrote of it; the official position in Israel was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> had left voluntarily, or under pressure from Palestinian or other Arab leaders. At the same time, Morris documents atrocities by the Israelis, including cases of rape and torture. The book shows a map of 228 empty Palestinian villages, and attempts to explain why the villagers left. In 41 villages, he writes, the inhabitants were expelled by the IDF; in another 90, residents fled because of attacks on other villages; and in six, they left under instructions from local Palestinian authorities. He was unable to find out why another 46 villages were abandoned.|$|E
25|$|However, Israeli {{national}} security adviser Joseph Cohen revealed a 65-page document that chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat submitted to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on 9 March, three weeks before Israel was to release the final batch of Palestinian prisoners. In it, Erekat proposed a strategy for the PA during the final month of negotiations and after 29 April, when the talks were originally scheduled to end before their premature collapse. Erekat recommended applying to join various international conventions, informing the U.S. and Europe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> wouldn't extend the talks beyond 29 April, demanding that Israel nevertheless release the final batch of prisoners, intensifying efforts to reconcile with Hamas to thwart what he termed an Israeli effort to sever the West Bank from Gaza politically, and various other diplomatic and public relations moves. Cohen concludes that even while the Palestinians were talking with Washington {{about the possibility of}} extending the peace talks, they were actually planning to blow them up, and had been planning to do so even before Abbas met with U.S. President Barack Obama on 17 March.|$|E

2500|$|Hussein Ibish, a Senior Research Fellow at the American Task Force on Palestine, {{mentioned}} that the terminology that was usually used regarding the Palestinian United Nations application was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> seek recognition from the United Nations, which he claims is meaningless.

2500|$|Israel {{proposed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> {{be granted}} [...] "custodianship," [...] though not sovereignty, on the Temple Mount (Haram al-Sharif), with Israel retaining {{control over the}} Western Wall, a remnant of the ancient wall that surrounded the Temple Mount, the most sacred site in Judaism outside of the Temple Mount itself. Israeli negotiators also proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> be granted administration of, but not sovereignty over, the Muslim and Christian Quarters of the Old City, with the Jewish and Armenian Quarters remaining in Israeli hands. Palestinians would be granted administrative control over all Islamic and Christian holy sites, and {{would be allowed to}} raise the Palestinian flag over them. A passage linking northern Jerusalem to Islamic and Christian holy sites would be annexed by the Palestinian state. The Israeli team proposed annexing to Israeli Jerusalem settlements within the West Bank beyond the Green Line, such as Ma'ale Adumim, Givat Ze'ev, and Gush Etzion. Israel proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> merge certain outer Arab villages and small cities that had been annexed to Jerusalem just after 1967 (such as Abu Dis, al-Eizariya, 'Anata, A-Ram, and eastern Sawahre) to create the city of Al-Quds, which would serve as the capital of Palestine. The historically important Arab neighborhoods such as Sheikh Jarrah, Silwan and at-Tur would remain under Israeli sovereignty, while Palestinians would only have civilian autonomy. The Palestinians would exercise civil and administrative autonomy in the outer Arab neighborhoods. Israeli neighborhoods within East Jerusalem would remain under Israeli sovereignty. The holy places in the Old City would enjoy independent religious administration. In total, Israel demanded that Palestine's territory in East Jerusalem be reduced to eight sections including six small enclaves according to Palestine's delegation to the summit.|$|E
2500|$|..... the Arabs in Palestine {{were asked}} to stay and live as {{citizens}} in the Jewish state. Instead, they chose to leave, either because they were unwilling {{to live with the}} Jews, or because they expected an Arab military victory which would annihilate the Zionists.

Later, an additional claim was put forth, namely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> were ordered to leave, with radio broadcasts instructing them to quit their homes.|$|E

The Supreme Court held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority can be granted state immunity on an ad hoc basis when it is warranted by the circumstances. The Knesset responded to the willingness of the judges to engage in examination of the notion of 'statehood for the purpose of state immunity' by adopting a measure that makes it possible to grant sovereign immunity to a 'political entity that is not a state' as part of the 2008 Foreign States Immunity Law, Art. 20.|$|R
