5|$|A {{number of}} small fodder enemies attempt to hinder Crash in his journey, much of them {{appearing}} in the previous Crash of the Titans. The Ratnicians, who previously worked for Doctor Neo Cortex, have since gone feral and vegetarian, and now work for the minor antagonist Doctor N. Gin. The Brat Girls, who previously worked for Nina Cortex, have betrayed her and now run the Evil Public School and supervise the Ratcicles in the Ratcicle Kingdom. The Doom Monkeys make a return appearance as employees of Nitrus Brio in <b>the</b> <b>Sludge</b> Junkyard. Two new fodder enemies make their debut in the game: the Znu, a group of small, warty creatures that inhabit Mount Grimly, and the Slap-E's, hand-shaped robots that share Doctor Cortex's memories and personal problems.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} in a free-roaming format rarely seen in {{previous}} games, although the DS version is played as a 2-D beat 'em up {{as a means of}} utilising the handheld's hardware to its greatest capacity. The opening events of the game take place on Wumpa Island. Crash's house is accessible here, and can be used by the player to access skins, concept art, enemy bios and cutscenes. Surrounding environments consist of societies inhabited by friendly Titans, including the Ratcicle Kingdom, the Rhinoroller Desert and <b>the</b> <b>Sludge</b> Junkyard. Other areas include the Evil Public School, attended by the main antagonist's niece, and Mount Grimly, where the evil mask Uka Uka is held. The final events of the game take place in the Space Head, a space station recycled from junkyard parts that is operated by Doctor Neo Cortex.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Bernard uses Dr. Fred's family {{fortune of}} {{royalties}} from the Maniac Mansion TV series {{to purchase a}} real diamond, both Laverne and Hoagie manage to power their Chron-o-Johns, and the three are reunited in the present. Purple Tentacle arrives, hijacks a Chron-o-John and takes it to the previous day {{to prevent them from}} turning off <b>the</b> <b>sludge</b> machine; he is pursued by Green Tentacle in another pod.Laverne: Uh-oh!Green Tentacle: Don't worry guys! This time I know I can stop him!}} With only one Chron-o-John pod left, Bernard, Hoagie and Laverne use it to pursue the tentacles to the previous day, while Dr. Fred uselessly tries to warn them of using the pod together, referencing the film The Fly. Upon arriving, the trio exit the pod only to discover that they have been turned into a three-headed monster, their bodies merging into one during the transfer. Meanwhile, Purple Tentacle has used the time machine to bring countless versions of himself from different moments in time to the same day to prevent the Sludge-o-Matic from being deactivated. Bernard and his friends defeat the Purple Tentacles guarding the Sludge-o-Matic, turn off the machine and prevent the whole series of events from ever happening. Returning to the present, Dr. Fred discovers that the three have not been turned into a monster at all but have just gotten stuck in the same set of clothes; they are then ordered by Dr. Fred to get out of his house. The game ends with the credits rolling over a tentacle-shaped American flag, one of the more significant results of their tampering in history.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{specific}} methanogenic activity (SMA) {{tests were}} performed on textile sludge and food industry <b>sludge.</b> <b>The</b> textile <b>sludge</b> from an activated sludge was collected {{at the entrance of}} the secondary biologic clarifier and <b>the</b> food <b>sludge</b> was collected in a UASB reactor.

40|$|The work {{reported}} here involved <b>the</b> characterization of <b>sludges</b> produced at water treatment plants in Jaboticabal-SP using FeCl 3 as flocculant, and in Taquaritinga-SP and Manaus-AM using Al 2 (SO 4) 3 as flocculant. An evaluation was also {{made of the}} interaction of organic matter extracted from <b>the</b> <b>sludges</b> with different metal species. The results indicated that all <b>the</b> <b>sludges</b> produced at water treatment plants have an important agricultural potential and that their use depends {{on the characteristics of}} the raw water and the type of flocculant employed in conventional treatment. The humic substances extracted from <b>the</b> <b>sludges</b> showed different affinities for metal species, favoring eventual exchanges between potentially toxic metals and macro- and micronutrients.

40|$|Abstract Batch methanogenic {{toxicity}} and biodegradability of 2 -, 3 - and 4 -aminobenzoic acids (ABA) {{as well as}} 4 - and 5 -aminosalicylic acids (ASA) {{have been}} studied {{in the presence of}} two mesophilic (Shell and cattle) and one thermophilic <b>sludges.</b> <b>The</b> aminoaromatics tested practically did not inhibit methanogenesis up to concentrations of 3 – 7 g/l; moreover, some of them (2 -ABA, 4 -ABA and 5 -ASA) even exert a stimulating effect on aceticlastic activity of <b>the</b> <b>sludges.</b> Concerning biodegradability, 5 -ASA was completely mineralised by all <b>the</b> <b>sludges</b> tested; however, 4 -ASA was not degraded at all by any of <b>the</b> <b>sludges.</b> Both mesophilic sludges were able to perform a complete mineralization of 2 -ABA but this was not a case for <b>the</b> thermophilic <b>sludge.</b> 3 -ABA was not biodegraded only in the presence of <b>the</b> Shell <b>sludge.</b> On <b>the</b> contrary, 4 -ABA was quantitatively mineralised only by <b>the</b> Shell <b>sludge.</b> All <b>the</b> adapted <b>sludges</b> were able to mineralise the corresponding aminoaromatics in N-deprived media. Cross-acclimatisation trials showed that 2 -ABA-, 5 -ASA- and salicylic acid adapted sludges were unable to degrade any other aminoaromatics tested that manifest about a different nature of key bacteria responsible for primary decomposition of these substrates. The main possibility of continuous mineralization of 2 -ABA as a unique source of carbon and nitrogen has been demonstrated using mesophilic UASB reactor inoculated by adapted sludge...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{repeated}} application of {{two types of}} sewage sludge, domestic and industrial (petrochemical, PSS) sludges, into paddy fields over a 5 -year period on the soil properties and microbial ecology were studied and compared with conventional NPK fertilizer application. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen contents were significantly higher in <b>the</b> two <b>sludge</b> treatments than that in fertilized plots after 5 years. Soil concentrations of potentially toxic metals were low after 5 years of both <b>sludge</b> treatments, but <b>the</b> polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) showed differences between <b>the</b> two <b>sludge</b> types. Concentrations of high-molecular-weight PAHs were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in <b>the</b> petrochemical <b>sludge</b> treatment than <b>the</b> domestic <b>sludge</b> treatment or <b>the</b> fertilizer control, although the total concentrations of 16 types of PAH in <b>the</b> petrochemical <b>sludge</b> treatment were only slightly higher than in <b>the</b> domestic <b>sludge</b> treatment and <b>the</b> control. The biological toxicity of soil dimethyl sulfoxide extracts from <b>the</b> petrochemical <b>sludge</b> treatment was also significantly higher (p < 0. 05) than those from the fertilizer control and <b>the</b> domestic <b>sludge</b> treatment when evaluated using Photobacterium phosphoreum T 3.

40|$|Removal {{of seven}} active {{pharmaceutical}} substances (ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, clofibric acid, mefenamic acid, and gemfibrozil) {{was assessed by}} batch experiments, with suspended biofilm carriers and activated sludge from several full-scale wastewater treatment plants. A distinct difference between nitrifying activated sludge and suspended biofilm carrier removal of several pharmaceuticals was demonstrated. Biofilm carriers from full-scale nitrifying wastewater treatment plants, demonstrated considerably higher removal rates per unit biomass (i. e. suspended solids for <b>the</b> <b>sludges</b> and attached solids for the carriers) of diclofenac, ketoprofen, gemfibrozil, clofibric acid and mefenamic acid compared to <b>the</b> <b>sludges.</b> Among <b>the</b> target pharmaceuticals, only ibuprofen and naproxen showed similar removal rates per unit biomass for <b>the</b> <b>sludges</b> and biofilm carriers. In contrast to the pharmaceutical removal, the nitrification capacity per unit biomass was lower for the carriers than <b>the</b> <b>sludges,</b> which suggests that neither the nitrite nor the ammonia oxidizing bacteria are primarily responsible for the observed differences in pharmaceutical removal. The low ability of ammonia oxidizing bacteria to degrade or transform the target pharmaceuticals was further demonstrated by the limited pharmaceutical removal in an experiment with continuous nitritation and biofilm carriers from a partial nitritation/anammox sludge liquor treatment process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{enhancing}} {{effect of}} aerobic thermophilic (AT) bacteria {{on the production}} of biogas from anaerobi-cally digested sewage sludge (methanogenic sludge) was investigated. Sewage sludge (5 %, w/w) was incubated at 65 °C with shaking {{for a few months}} to prepare <b>the</b> AT seed <b>sludge.</b> AT sludge was prepared by incubation of <b>the</b> AT seed <b>sludge</b> (5 %, v/v) and sewage sludge (5 %, w/w) at 65 °C with shaking. The addition of this AT sludge (1. 2 % 0. 5 % of total volatile solids) to methanogenic <b>sludge</b> enhanced <b>the</b> production of biogas. The optimum volume of the addi-tion and the pretreatment temperature of <b>the</b> AT <b>sludge</b> for optimum biogas production were 5 % (v/v) and 65 °C. Batch-fed anaerobic digestion was covered with the addition of various AT <b>sludges.</b> <b>The</b> AT <b>sludge</b> prepared with <b>the</b> AT seed <b>sludge</b> improved <b>the</b> biogas production by 2. 2 times relative to that from <b>the</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> addition. <b>The</b> addi-tion of <b>sludge</b> without AT seed sludge weakly enhanced biogas production. An aerobic thermophilic bacterium (strain AT 1) was isolated from <b>the</b> AT seed <b>sludge.</b> Strain AT 1 grew well in a synthetic medium. The production of biogas from the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge was improved by the addition of 5 % (v/v) AT 1 bacterial culture compared with that from <b>the</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> addition. <b>The</b> addition of AT 1 culture reduced the volatile solids by 21 %, which was higher than the 12. 6 % achieved with <b>the</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> addition. <b>The</b> AT 1 bacterial culture enhanced the biogas production more than <b>the</b> AT seed <b>sludge.</b> <b>The</b> phy-logenetic analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene revealed that strain AT 1 is closely related to Geobacillus thermodenitrif-icans (100 % sequence similarity).

40|$|A pilot-scale {{submerged}} {{membrane bioreactor}} (SMBR) and two bench-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) reactors were operated on municipal primary effluent over {{a range of}} mean cell residence times (MCRTs) from 2 - 10 d. The reactors had different turbulence levels. The root mean square velocity gradient (G) of the SMBR was 632 s- 1; for the CAS reactors the G values were 72 s- 1 and 250 s- 1. <b>The</b> <b>sludges</b> from all systems were analyzed for particle size distribution (PSD), colloidal material, extracellular polymer substances (EPS) and filamentous microorganisms. Capillary suction time (CST) and time to filter (TTF) analyses were also performed. <b>The</b> SMBR <b>sludges</b> had <b>the</b> highest amount of small particles {{and higher levels of}} colloidal material than <b>the</b> CAS <b>sludges.</b> This was attributed to its higher G value and the use of a membrane for solids-liquid separation. <b>The</b> SMBR <b>sludge</b> contained <b>the</b> higher levels of total filamentous organisms attributable largely to its higher nocardioform level. This resulted from more efficient foam trapping by the SMBR. The normalized CST values of <b>the</b> SMBR <b>sludge</b> were lower than for <b>the</b> CAS <b>sludges.</b> This was attributed to its lower EPS content.
