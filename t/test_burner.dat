40|$|Abstract. A new burner {{configuration}} for {{a compact}} fuel-cell reformer with a high-temperature air combustion concept was studied. The burner was computationally {{designed for a}} 40 Nm 3 /hr hydrogen-generating reformer using natural gas-steam reforming method. In order to satisfy the primary requirements for designing a reformer burner (uniform distribution of temperature along the fuel processor walls and minimum heat losses from the reformer), {{the features of the}} present burner configuration included 1) a self-regenerative burner for an exhaust-gas-recirculation to apply for the high-temperature air combustion concept, and 2) an annular-type shield for protecting direct contact of flame with the processor walls. For the present design conditions, the predicted temperature distributions along the processor walls were found uniform within 100 K variation. Thus, the present burner configuration satisfied the requirement for reducing temperature gradients along the processor walls, and consequently demonstrated that the high-temperature air combustion concept could be applied to the practical fuel reformers for use of fuel cells. The predicted uniform temperature distributions along the processor walls were experimentally demonstrated for a <b>test</b> <b>burner...</b>|$|E

40|$|The United States Federal Aviation Administration {{makes use}} of threat-based fire test methods for the {{certification}} of aircraft cabin materials to enhance the level of safety {{in the event of}} an in-flight or post-crash fire on a transport airplane. The global nature of the aviation industry results in these test methods being performed at hundreds of laboratories around the world; in some cases testing identical materials at multiple labs but yielding different results. Maintenance of this standard for an elevated level of safety requires that the test methods be as well defined as possible, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of critical test method parameters. The tests have evolved from simple Bunsen burner material tests to larger, more complicated apparatuses, requiring greater understanding of the device for proper application.

Flow field data was collected for a series of bluff-body stabilized premixed and stratified methane/air flames at turbulent, globally lean conditions (phi = 0. 75) using high speed stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (HS-SPIV). In this paper, a modal analysis was performed to identify the large scale flow structures and their impact on the flame dynamics. The high speed PIV system was operated at 3 kHz to acquire a series of 4096 sequential flow field images both for reactive and non-reactive cases, sufficient to follow the large-scale spatial and temporal evolution of flame and flow dynamics. The POD analysis allows identification of vortical structures, created by the bluff body, and in the shear layers surrounding the stabilization point. In addition, the analysis reveals that dominant structures are a strong function of the mixture stratification in the flow field. The dominant energetic modes of reactive and non-reactive flows are very different, as the expansion of gases and the high temperatures alter the unstable modes and their survival in the flow...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that DGV and CH {{chemiluminescence}} measurements {{can be easily}} combined. By changing one interference filter, {{using one of the}} DGV cameras and the DGV optical probe for the visible spectral range CH chemiluminescence measurements are performed with the same optical set up. Even though the CH chemiluminescence intensity is more sensitive to the stoichiometry compared to OH chemiluminescence it gives a time and cost saving volumetric overview on the variation in time of the local heat formation. An application example demonstrates the capability of visualizing the overall flame structure to assure the correct flame symmetry before applying more cost-intensive techniques. Using a standard PC sound card, the microphone signal from the combustor and the camera trigger are recorded allowing a comparison of burner conditions in matters of combustion oscillation frequency, frequency stability and microphone signal amplitude stability over a time period. Probably as a consequence of an asymmetry in the gas supply the studied flame of the <b>test</b> <b>burner</b> showed an asymmetric heat formation and unstable oscillation frequencies. The flame asymmetry was verified also by OH chemiluminescence measurements. Due to the trigger instability it was impossible to realize phase resolved velocity measurements with the standard set up for DGV in flames. Nevertheless time averaged velocity measurements of the flow field were performed which showed in contrast to the chemiluminescence results highly symmetric velocity fields.

40|$|An {{investigation}} on the central-pilot {{stage of a}} Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery 4 th Generation DLE prototype <b>test</b> <b>burner</b> has been performed to understand the emission performance and operability. The core section, which is defined as RPL (Rich premixed lean) {{plays an important role}} for full burner combustion operation by stabilizing the main and pilot flames at different operating condition. Optimal fuel-air flow through the RPL is critical for multiple stages mixing and main flame anchoring. Heat and radical production from the central stage provides the ignition source and required heat for burning the main flame downstream of the RPL section. Surrounding the RPL outside wall cooling air has been blown through an annular passage. The cooling air protects the RPL wall from overheating and provides the oxygen source for the secondary combustion downstream of the RPL. At rich operation unburned hydrocarbon/radicals can pass the RPL and burns by the coflow air entrainment. To determine the flame stabilization and operability, an atmospheric pressure test has been accomplished using methane as a fuel. Primary flame zone can be identified by a thermocouple placed outside the RPL wall and secondary combustion zone at the exit has been examined by chemiluminescence imaging. Emission measurement and LBO (Lean blow out) limits have been determined for different equivalence ratios from 1. 8 to LBO limit. Co-flow air temperature was changed from 303 K to 573 K to evaluate the secondary combustion and RPL wall heat transfer effect on flame stability/emission. It is found that equivalence ratio has strong effect on the RPL flame stabilization (primary/secondary flame). Emissions/radical generation were also influenced by the chemical reaction inside the RPL. It can be noticed that coflow air temperature has a significant role on emission, LBO and flame stabilization for the central-pilot stage burner due to the heat loss from the flame zone and RPL wall. A chemical kinetic network (ChemkinTM) and CFD modelling approaches (Fluent) are employed to understand in detail the chemical kinetics, heat transfer effect and flow field inside the RPL (combustion and heat loss inside and emission capability). Experiment shows that the low CO and NOx levels can be achieved at lean and rich condition due to lower flame temperature. Present experimental results by changing equivalence ratio, residence time and co-flow temperature, creates a complete map for the RPL combustion, which is key input for full 4 th Generation DLE burner design...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional development goals like reliability, emission behaviour and energetic efficiency, the competition between the systems used for warming heating and drinking water is compelling the manufacturers of oil-fired heating systems to take increasingly into account product requirements such as adjustability, space requirements and operating noises, which {{have in the past}} been ignored. Above all, increasing importance is placed on reducing the lower power limit - which is at the moment around 15 kW for spray burners - against the background of a continuously falling need for heating energy. On the basis of these constraints, the pre-mixing surface burner for EL heating oil, developed as part of this work, provides a promising approach to a solution which links the possibility of metering minimal fuel mass flow rates with favourable emission behaviour, output dynamics and the virtually noiseless operation of this type of burner. To create the aerosol a superheated fuel jet is injected into the pre-mixing section of the burner via a closeable nozzle. As a result of the reduction in pressure at the nozzle outlet, vapour bubbles form with the injected jet, which is surrounded by air. The rapid growth of these vapour bubbles tears the liquid open. In addition, the kinetic forces of the internal turbulence and the sheer forces cause the liquid film to break up along the edges of the jet. In contrast to traditional methods of atomizing a liquid fuel much smaller drops are formed {{as a result of the}} overlaying of thermal and kinetic jet fragmentation. The injection device is designed as a volume-controlled metering system. A piston pump moves the fuel from a storage tank to the fuel heater. The injection nozzle is located at the outlet end of the fuel heater. Given a constant stroke volume the quantity of fuel which is injected is determined by the stroke frequency of the piston pump. Before the burner starts operating an electrical heating element heats the fuel to the required injection temperature. After the heater has operated for a brief period of time the hot reaction zone supplies the energy needed to heat up the fuel. The electrical heating element is either switched off, or activated at intervals in order to maintain a pre-set injection temperature. The fuel is heated under pressure in order to prevent the depositing of coke-like substances resulting from the liquid fuel phase. In order to provide a technical evaluation of the approach, a <b>test</b> <b>burner</b> with a power output of 2 - 10 kW was developed and examined on the basis of the following criteria: pollutant emission, flame stability, modulating operation, electrical energy requirement, noises and reliability. The results show that the nitrogen oxide emission and the surface burner noise level are considerably lower than those of conventional spray burners. (orig.)

40|$|Control of {{pollutants}} and emissions {{has become a}} major factor in the design of modern combustion systems. The “Liquid Hydrogen Fueled Aircraft - System Analysis” project funded in 2000 by the European Commission can be seen as such an initiative. Within the framework of this project, the Aachen University of Applied Sciences developed experimentally the “Micromix” hydrogen combustion principle and implemented it successfully in the Honeywell APU GTCP 36 - 300 gas turbine engine. Lowering the reaction temperature, eliminating hot spots from the reaction zone and keeping the time available for the formation of NOx to a minimum are the prime drivers towards NOx reduction. The “Micromix” hydrogen combustion principle meets those requirements by minimizing the flame temperature working at small equivalence ratios, improving the mixing by means of Jets In Cross-Flow and reducing the residence time in adopting a combustor geometry that provides a very large number of very small diffusion flames. In terms of pollutant emissions, compared to the unconverted APU, an essential reduction in emitted NOx was observed, stressing the potential of this innovative burning principle. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the “Micromix” hydrogen combustion principle with the ultimate goal of an improved prediction during the design process. Due to the complex interrelation of chemical kinetics and flow dynamics, the “Micromixing” was analyzed first. Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry was used to provide insight into the mixing process. A “simplified” set-up, that allowed to investigate the flow characteristics in great detail while retaining the same local characteristics of its “real” counterparts, was considered. The driving vortical structures were identified. To further investigate the physics involved and to extend the experimental results, numerical computations were carried out on the same “simplified” set-up as on a literature test case. In general, a number of physical issues were clarified. In particular, the interaction between the different vortical structures was looked into, and a kinematically consistent vortex model is proposed. After demonstrating the development of the mixing, the “cold flow” study was extended to a single injector. The double backward-facing step injector geometry was addressed experimentally and numerically. At design geometry, the flow appeared to behave single backward-facing like, with respect to the first gradation. In terms of varying step configurations, the flow was seen to be dependent on the periodic perturbation arising from the graded series of backward-facing steps. During the second part of the investigation, the “hot flow” was analyzed. Considering combustor similar operating conditions, a <b>test</b> <b>burner</b> was experimented on an atmospheric test rig. NOx emissions were traced by exhaust gas analysis for different working conditions. Particular flame patterns, such as a regular attached flame as well as lifted flames were observed. In parallel with the experimental work, numerical computations on a pair of opposite injectors, permitted to classify the combustion regime and the main factors involved in the NOx formation. Accordingly, NOx emission enhancing design changes are proposed. Finally, the demanding computational effort, worthy of acceptance for academic purposes, is found not agreeable as future design tool and improvements to speed up the design process are projected.

The propellant is often exposed to harsh environments during combustion such as extreme temperatures and high pressures. While the burning rates of AP/HTPB-based solid rocket propellants up to pressures of 2000 psi are well documented, relatively little data at higher pressures exists. Therefore, a new high-pressure, constant-volume strand burner facility has been installed and characterized at Texas A&M University to test pressures up to 10, 000 psi. The design is primarily based on the current <b>test</b> vessel, strand <b>burner</b> II or SB-II and includes a cylindrical main body, two endcaps, and a bolt which is used to hold the test specimen.

The manufacturer <b>tested</b> the <b>burner</b> at Gioia del Colle (Italy) and reported data when operating at maximum load. We exploited the power of STAR-CCM+ to investigate the process. At first we run a non-reacting simulation. Results showed a supercritical throttling of the fuel at the injection in the flue recirculation system. We loaded then the combustion, radiation and heat transfer modules of STAR-CCM+. We calculated the reacting flow solution. Flow features within the combustion chamber and the heat transfer at the walls were estimated. Our results show that STAR-CCM+ is capable to give {{a detailed description of the}} process...|$|R
40|$|A porous radiant <b>burner</b> <b>testing</b> {{facility}} {{consisting of}} a commercial deep-fat fryer, an FTIR based spectral radiance measurement system, a set of flue gas analysis components, and a fuel gas mixing station was constructed. The measurement capabilities of the system were tested using methane and the test results {{were found to be}} consistent with the literature. Following the validation of the measurement system, various gas mixtures were tested to study the effect of gas compositions have on burner performance. Results indicated that the emissions vary with fuel gas composition and air/fuel ratio. The maximum radiant efficiency of the burner was obtained close to air/fuel ratio of 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractJupiter Oxygen Corporation (JOC), in {{cooperation}} with the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), constructed a 15  MWth oxy-fuel <b>burner</b> <b>test</b> facility with Integrated Pollutant Removal (IPRTM) to test high flame temperature oxy-fuel combustion and advanced carbon capture. Combustion protocols include baseline air firing with natural gas, oxygen and natural gas firing with and without flue gas recirculation, and oxygen and pulverized coal firing with flue gas recirculation. Testing focuses on characterizing burner performance, determining heat transfer characteristics, optimizing CO 2 capture, and maximizing heat recovery, with an emphasis on data traceability to address retrofit of existing boilers by directly transforming burner systems to oxy-fuel firing...|$|R
