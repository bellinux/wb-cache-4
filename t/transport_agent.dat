5000|$|The technique, {{which was}} popularized by Schäfer, entails the {{reversible}} conversion of nonvolatile elements and chemical compounds into volatile derivatives. [...] The volatile derivative migrates throughout a sealed reactor, typically a sealed and evacuated glass tube heated in a tube furnace. Because the tube {{is under a}} temperature gradient, the volatile derivative reverts to the parent solid and the <b>transport</b> <b>agent</b> is released at the end opposite to which it originated (see next section). The <b>transport</b> <b>agent</b> is thus catalytic. The technique requires that the two ends of the tube (which contains the sample to be crystallized) be maintained at different temperatures. So-called two-zone tube furnaces are employed for this purpose. The method derives from the Van Arkel de Boer process which {{was used for the}} purification of titanium and vanadium and uses iodine as the <b>transport</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{current work}} {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} catalytically assisted self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) of the tantalum/carbon material system. The effects of controlled amounts of two gas-phase <b>transport</b> <b>agents</b> (carbon dioxide and vaporized iodine) were examined. The gas-phase <b>transport</b> <b>agents</b> resulted in burning velocities 2 to 4 times faster than burning velocities observed in comparable catalytically assisted and unassisted Ta/C SHS systems. The gas-phase <b>transport</b> <b>agents</b> clearly augment the combustion synthesis process. The burning velocities of the catalytically assisted, non-melting SHS systems {{were found to be}} strong functions of particle size, pressure and the amount of gas-transport agent present. The results are compared with previous studies of both catalytically assisted and unassisted Ta/C SHS, and discussed in the context of proposed transport mechanisms. © 2001 by The Combustion Institut...|$|R

5000|$|Transport {{reactions}} are classified {{according to the}} thermodynamics of the reaction between the solid and the <b>transporting</b> <b>agent.</b> When the reaction is exothermic, then the solid of interest is transported from the cooler end (which can be quite hot) of the reactor to a hot end, where the equilibrium constant is less favorable and the crystals grow. The reaction of molybdenum dioxide with the <b>transporting</b> <b>agent</b> iodine is an exothermic process, thus the MoO2 migrates from the cooler end (700 °C) to the hotter end (900 °C): ...|$|R

40|$|The grating {{formation}} {{speed in}} photorefractive polymers is greatly reduced by highly polar molecules incorporated by necessity in large concentrations to produce large diffraction efficiency and two-beam energy coupling gain. The random electric fields generated by these dipoles interfere with charge transport {{by increasing the}} width of the hopping site energy distribution and thus greatly reducing the carrier mobility and the photorefractive speed. We conducted transport studies of several model systems consisting of combinations of two polymer binders, six charge <b>transport</b> <b>agents</b> (four for holes and two for electrons), and varying concentrations of two highly polar electro-optic chromophores. The results confirm that carrier mobility is greatly reduced in the presence of polar molecules in accordance with the predictions of models of hopping transport in the presence of dipolar disorder. The randomly positioned and oriented dipoles increase {{the width of the}} hopping site energy distribution by an amount proportional to the square root of the dipole concentration and to the strength of the dipole moment. The results also show that <b>transport</b> <b>agents</b> with smaller dipole moments reduce the sensitivity to the dipolar effect. The photorefractive speed may therefore be increased by using <b>transport</b> <b>agents</b> with small dipole moments...|$|R
