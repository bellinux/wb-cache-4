Chairman of selectors David Graveney said Key was selected because of his [...] "outstanding form for Kent after attending the National Academy" [...] over the winter. Opening the batting with Michael Vaughan, Key made 17 runs in his only innings before being bowled by Ashish Nehra. Retained in the side for the third <b>Test,</b> <b>Key</b> managed scored 30 and 34 as England succumbed to an innings defeat. However, his performance was marred by him dropping three catches.

50|$|To rekey a lock {{you have}} to first remove the lock {{cylinder}} from any housing it rests in. The lock cylinder must be disassembled, and the plug removed. Use a plug follower to avoid dropping master-wafers, top pins and springs. The plug has cylindrical chambers spaced according to manufacturer specifications. Pins are contained in these chambers where they are pushed down by springs or raised by a key. Each cut sits under a chamber of its own, each pin sits on a cut of its own. Place the correct pins in each chamber, bringing {{the top of each}} new pin flush with the shear-line. Check the upper chambers using a master-follower for old unused master wafers and remove any. If any springs are noticeably weak or the lock was especially dirty replace the springs. If the old pins are rounded from use or otherwise show excessive wear replace springs. Reinsert the plug taking care not to drop top pins into any unused chamber. <b>Test</b> <b>key,</b> make slight adjustments if needed and reassemble.|$|E
