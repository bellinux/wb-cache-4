On 10 March 1199, Emeric forced Boleslaus, Bishop of Vác, who was a supporter of Andrew, to give him documents that proved the conspiracy against him. In the summer of that year, Emeric defeated Andrew's army near Lake Balaton, which made Andrew flee to Austria.

They had improved the accurate manufacture of die-cut screws in soft metal and solved the problem of thread-grinding on hardened work.|$|E

5|$|Hogg's mother Prudentia died in 1839. As a {{condition}} of his father's will, upon {{the death of his}} mother, Thomas Jefferson Hogg could purchase his brother's share of Norton House. He decided not to, because of the potential cost of maintaining the house and the hostility Jane could face there. Instead, he allowed his brother to buy his interest in the house, a decision that led to conflict between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers</b> regarding the price and timing of the sale.

5|$|It is {{not known}} whether the English pursuit was ordered by Harold {{or if it was}} spontaneous. Wace relates that Harold ordered his men to stay in their {{formations}} but no other account gives this detail. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the death of Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine occurring just before the fight around the hillock. This may mean that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers</b> led the pursuit. The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio relates a different story for the death of Gyrth, stating that the duke slew Harold's brother in combat, perhaps thinking that Gyrth was Harold. William of Poitiers states that the bodies of Gyrth and Leofwine were found near Harold's, implying that they died late in the battle. It is possible that if <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers</b> died early in the fighting their bodies were taken to Harold, thus accounting for their being found near his body after the battle. The military historian Peter Marren speculates that if Gyrth and Leofwine died early in the battle, that may have influenced Harold to stand and fight to the end.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} for assisting Zangi, the Abbasid authorities sought punitive measures against Ayyub.

The Abbasid court issued arrest warrants for both Ayyub and Shirkuh, but before the brothers could be arrested, they departed Tikrit for Mosul in 1138. When they arrived in Mosul, Zangi provided them with all the facilities they needed and he recruited <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>brothers</b> into his service. Ayyub was made commander of Ba'albek and Shirkuh entered the service of Zangi's son, Nur ad-Din. According to historian Abdul Ali, it was under the care and patronage of Zangi that the Ayyubid family rose to prominence.|$|E
