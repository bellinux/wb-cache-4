500|$|Reagan {{feels that}} Armageddon is {{inevitable}} and it's dangerous {{when you have a}} President who thinks that way since he's the one who can call for the pushing of the button. He sees himself in his personal drama, I think, increasingly as a religious leader and he has public lunches with some of these very powerful evangelists, Pat Robertson and The 700 Club for instance. In other words, you have the church stroking Reagan and saying [...] "Yes, yes, aren't they saying nasty <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> they must be communists. Therefore they threaten both you and me. Don't you think we should silence these communists from speaking?" ...|$|E
500|$|Flanagan {{promoted}} the Marngrook theory {{in his novel}} The Call (1996), an historical imagining into Wills' life, and argued in an essay addressed to Wills {{that he must have}} known Aboriginal games as it was in his nature to play: [...] "There's two <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> everybody seems to have agreed on—you'd drink with anyone and you'd play with anyone." [...] He quotes Lawton Wills Cooke, a descendent of Horace Wills (Tom's brother), who said a family story had been passed down about Tom playing Marngrook as a boy. Family historian T. S. Wills Cooke disputed that such a story existed, calling the Marngrook link [...] "a bridge too far" [...] and a politically correct attempt to rewrite hsitory. Despite a lack of hard evidence in its favour, the theory is often presented as factual. In Moyston, the self-proclaimed birthplace of Australian football, stands an AFL-endorsed monument, unveiled by historian Col Hutchinson, commemorating Wills' childhood in the area playing Marngrook.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, {{while he}} was {{traveling}} to Philadelphia from Pakistan, Gilani was arrested by police in Frankfurt, West Germany after two kilos of heroin were found hidden in a false bottom in his suitcase. Gilani quickly made a plea deal when his case was {{handed over to the}} U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, agreeing to surrender his partners in Philadelphia in exchange for a lighter sentence. Gilani's cooperation earned him four years in prison while his two associates were sentenced to eight and ten years. At his sentencing hearing, the judge made the following statement: [...] "It's up to you, Mr. Gilani, to do what you can with the rest of your life. You are still a young man. You can either take advantage of this opportunity. Your mother, your lawyer, people said some nice <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> but what you did, not only to yourself, but to perhaps thousands, hundreds of victims, heroin users in this country is a terrible thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{devotion to}} Lucille, {{or rather the}} singleness of your devotion to Lucille," [...] she remarked, [...] "is {{positively}} the most gauche <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> It is--absolutely callow!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] said Clovis, [...] "the {{moustache}} is {{the only}} <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> that seemed familiar to me. I felt certain that I had met it somewhere before." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "There is {{one good}} <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> Whenever <b>things</b> happen {{somewhere in the}} world, you'll run over there faster than the Western reporters. But the {{questions}} you ask...too simple! Sometimes naive!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Madjo joined Crawley Town on 28 June 2007, signing {{alongside}} Jon-Paul Pittman and Tyrone Thompson. He scored {{twice on}} his debut in Crawley's {{first game of}} the 2007–08 season, a 2–1 home win against Stevenage. The following week, Madjo scored again, this time in a 4–1 away loss at Salisbury City. In September 2007, Madjo scored in five consecutive fixtures, including a brace in a 5–3 home win against Woking. He also scored twice within the space of a week in October 2007, scoring in away fixtures against Kidderminster Harriers and Weymouth respectively. Madjo had scored 11 goals in 18 games, which prompted speculation regarding a move into the Football League. Madjo said [...] "It is nice to have people say good <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> but at the moment I'm not thinking about other clubs. All I think about is doing my job and doing my best for Crawley". On 21 November 2007, four days after earning a call up to the Cameroon squad, Madjo joined League One side Cheltenham Town on a one-month loan, with a view to a permanent move. On Madjo's departure, Crawley Town manager Steve Evans said [...] "As a manager, I'm extremely disappointed. As a club, we always knew this day would come. He's an exceptional talent and a model professional". Madjo made his Cheltenham debut on 25 November 2007, coming on as a 77th-minute substitute in Cheltenham's [...] "shock" [...] 1–0 home victory over Leeds United. He started his first game three weeks later, a 1–0 win against Luton Town. During his one-month loan spell, Madjo made five appearances for Cheltenham. Despite impressing Cheltenham manager Keith Downing, the club opted against buying the player on a permanent basis as a result of Downing having more funds at his disposal – [...] "Madjo had done nothing but impress all those at Cheltenham, but thanks to the extra money made available to Keith Downing, Cheltenham have set their requirements higher".|$|E

6000|$|... "It's awkward. If I'm to {{make the}} thing clear to you I've got to trust you. And I don't know a <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> I wish I had thought of that before I {{inserted}} the advertisement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't help it--you are. Oh, not disagreeably so, quite normally--that's the odd <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> Sometimes I {{believe that}} you were made for {{something}} different, {{that in spite of}} your success you have missed your 'metier.'" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's {{the pity}} of it," [...] he said. [...] "You're wasting the most {{important}} <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> your personality. You would do more good in a drawing- room, influencing the rulers, than you will ever do hiding behind a pen. It was the drawing-room that made the French Revolution." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's funny," [...] she retorted. [...] "You are little, and you're weak; as you are, you're {{not much}} account, anyhow.

6000|$|... "Russ, don't think me proud," [...] she faltered. [...] "I wouldn't {{care who}} you were if I could only--only respect you.
