50|$|The Tipsy B was {{a wooden}} framed machine, {{covered with a}} mixture of plywood and canvas. The wing was built around an I-section main spar at about one quarter chord and an {{auxiliary}} rear box spar. These spars were linked by a rigid diagonal pyramid bracing. Stressed plywood skin was used from the main spar forward, {{with the rest of the}} wing fabric covered over wooden ribs. The leading edge was almost straight, and the trailing edge straight but strongly forward swept except at the centre section. Differential ailerons were carried on the <b>tapering</b> <b>section,</b> so their hinge line was also strongly forward swept.The fuselage was based on four spruce longerons, flat sided and plywood covered apart from a rounded decking. The depth of the decking behind the cockpit depended on whether the seating was open or closed. The Tipsy B had an open cockpit, with almost side-by-side seating in the sense that the seats were slightly staggered fore and aft to minimise fuselage width, with the left hand seat 8 in (200 mm) further forward. The Tipsy Bc had the same seat arrangement, but enclosed under a Rhodoid (cellulose acetate) canopy, faired into the fuselage rearwards by a much deeper decking. Some Tipsy Bs had an asymmetric windscreen formed out of a single Rhodoid sheet, with its free edge further forward on the left to match the displaced seating, but symmetric screens became common. Both seats were equipped with controls. The control column was on the mid-line between the seats, with a horizontal extension that could be rotated over either position.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modified reverse tapering method {{to generate a}} polarized soft x ray in x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) with a higher photon power and a shorter undulator length than the simple linear reverse tapering method. In the proposed method, a few untapered planar undulators are added before the simple linear reverse <b>tapering</b> <b>section</b> of the undulator line. This simple modification prevents the frequency shift of the radiation that occurs when the simple linear reverse tapering method is applied to planar undulators. In the proposed method, the total length of planar undulators decreased {{in spite of the}} additional untapered undulators. When the modified reverse tapering method is used with four untapered planar undulators, the total length of the planar undulators is 64. 6  m. On the other hand, the required length of the planar undulators is 94. 6  m when the simple linear reverse tapering method is used. The proposed method gives us a way to generate a soft x-ray pulse (1. 24  keV) {{with a high degree of}} polarization (> 0. 99) and radiation power (> 30 [*][*]GW) at the new undulator line with a 10 -GeV electron beam in the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory X-ray Free-Electron Laser.

40|$|The current project {{consists}} on {{the design}} of a simplified commercial aircraft wing made of carbon fiber material. A real commercial aircraft is used as a model {{in order to create a}} wing model by using finite element modelling techniques through the use of ABAQUS software. The development of the wing model involves the creation of each of the structural members of the wing, the joint of them in order to create the final model, the creation of the mesh necessary for the analysis and the application of the loads to perform an analysis that accurately predicts the stresses and displacement that the wing withstands. Two different models are presented, one consisting on one <b>tapered</b> <b>section</b> wing and the second consisting on a wing with two <b>tapered</b> <b>sections.</b> These models are subjected to two different wing loads in cruise conditions, a simplified triangular load and a load that represents a real distribution of aerodynamic loads in the wing. In order to create the final wing model made of carbon fiber material, the wing is analyzed first by using the two different geometries presented and aluminum material. The wing model evolves from the one <b>tapered</b> <b>section</b> wing under triangular loads using aluminum material to the second model under real distribution loads using carbon fiber material. The models have been optimized to decrease the weight as much as possible by taking into account the design restrictions imposed.

40|$|Tapered diode lasers combine {{high output}} {{power and a}} beam quality near to the {{diffraction}} limit resulting in very high brightness. Therefore, they are finding use {{in a wide range}} of applications today, such as pumping of rare-earth-doped fibre amplifiers, tunable frequency doubling of diode lasers for blue-green outputs, and non linear spectroscopy. Due to increasing brightness and lifetime tapered lasers even become attractive for material processing and for telecom applications like pumping of Er-doped fiber amplifiers or raman amplifiers. In order to further enhance the brightness of tapered diode lasers the output power has to be increased while simultaneously the beam quality has to be kept near the diffraction limit. For this purpose we have grown low modal gain, single quantum well InGaAs/AlGaAs devices emitting at 976 nm by molecular beam epitaxy. The lateral design of the investigated laser diodes consist of a <b>tapered</b> <b>section</b> and a ridge-waveguide section. Since it has been shown by previous simulations and experiments that longer <b>tapered</b> <b>sections</b> allow higher output power with unchanged beam quality, we use <b>tapered</b> <b>section</b> lengths of 2000 µm, 3000 µm and 4000 µm.
