5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to travel here.|$|E

500|$|Between the {{publication}} of The Pothunters 1902 and that of Mike in 1909, Wodehouse wrote eight novels and co-wrote another two. The critic R.D.B. French writes that, of Wodehouse's work from this period, almost all that deserves to survive is the school fiction. Looking back in the 1950s Wodehouse viewed these as his apprentice years: [...] "I was practically in swaddling clothes and it is extremely creditable to me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to write at all." ...|$|E
500|$|The former {{president}} {{was quoted in}} 1957 as saying to then-House Majority Leader John McCormack, [...] "Had {{it not been for}} the fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to sell some property that my brother, sister, and I inherited from our mother, I would practically be on relief, but with the sale of that property I am not financially embarrassed." [...] The following year, Congress passed the Former Presidents Act, offering a $25,000 yearly pension to each {{former president}}, and it is likely that Truman's financial status played a role in the law's enactment. The one other living former president at the time, Herbert Hoover, also took the pension, even though he did not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing Truman.|$|E

In a 1975 interview he said: [...] "I'm proud <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to start with nothing, plan it and have it work as perfectly as it did... I sleep clearly every night." [...] "I knew when I got the assignment," [...] he told a reporter in 2005, [...] "it {{was going to be}} an emotional thing. We had feelings, but we had to put them in the background. We knew it was going to kill people right and left. But my one driving interest was to do the best job I could so that we could end the killing as quickly as possible." ...|$|E

30|$|Sport and {{physical}} activity behaviour were measured using the validated Short Questionnaire for Sport and Physical Activity (SQUASH), measuring self-reported work-related, domestic, leisure-time and sport-related physical activities in minutes per week (Wendel-Vos et al. 2003; De Hollander et al. 2012). Physical activity enjoyment was measured using a nine-item, five-point scale, translated and adapted from the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (Mullen et al. 2011). Statements were for example: ‘When I do exercise or sports, I enjoy it’, or ‘When I do exercise or sports, I feel bored’. Self-efficacy for physical activity behaviour was measured using a six-item, five-point scale (Bandura 2006). Statements were for example: ‘I <b>am</b> confident <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>able</b> to continue {{to participate in the}} physical activity program during the coming months’, and ‘I <b>am</b> confident <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>able</b> to continue to participate in the physical activity program when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> tired’.|$|R

Beginning on June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Knowles' official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and an insightful quote. On June 22, 2011, [...] "Start Over" [...] was the fourth song to be chosen. The quote found Knowles elaborating on what motivated her to record a song like [...] "Start Over": [...] "For {{the first time in}} my life I was able to travel the world, hear different influences, see different types of dance and choreography and taste different types of food. It was important <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to digest everything: It inspired purity, more heart and more love." ...|$|E
500|$|The show's {{crew and}} actors had {{a range of}} {{opinions}} about the show's finale, [...] "The Truth". Carter said of the finale, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up." [...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get us all in again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. It was {{nice to be able to}} – I'm just really happy <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to come back and finish it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Dandridge and Belafonte were singers, {{neither was}} capable of singing the operatic score, so Marilyn Horne and LeVern Hutcherson were hired to record their vocals, and soundtrack {{recording}} began on June 18. Horne later recalled, [...] "Even though I {{was at that time}} a very light lyric soprano, I did everything I possibly could to imitate the voice of Dorothy Dandridge. I spent many hours with her.

2500|$|The rape was {{revisited}} in 1998 when Luke and Laura's son, Lucky, {{finds out}} about the incident. This time, the writers scripted it as rape instead of a seduction. Lucky struggled {{to come to terms}} with the revelation while Luke and Laura dealt with the unresolved issues surrounding the rape. In a 2000 interview with Soap Opera Digest, Geary said, for the taping of the scenes, [...] "Alan Pultz, who had directed the rape originally, used his original notes and directed me that day to recall all of <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to finally put out what I think is Luke's definitive statement: that it was rape, it was ugly, he'd probably never recover."

I could barely function." [...] Later that year she reconsidered her words and went back into performing after being asked by friends to sing David Bowie's [...] "Life on Mars?"

[...] "In no way do I need to be ashamed of the fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to reveal new data from the bodies of the executed, facts that were unknown before and are now recognized by the whole world." [...] He denied, however, that the executed victims he had done his research on were political prisoners.

It felt compelled to put to rest [...] "spiteful false accusations" [...] by pointing out that Stieve had never set foot in a concentration camp, nor had he made any request to the prison administration that [...] "this or that should happen" [...] before the execution.

He became a devout non-denominational Christian. He is the uncle of the soprano, writer and composer Deborah , and the older brother of the late Aboriginal author/singer/songwriter Betty Little. In February 1939, about 200 to 300 members of the mission participated in the Cummeragunja walk-off – in protest at the low standard living conditions. The Little family moved to his father's tribal land (near Wallaga Lake) and lived for some years on the New South Wales south coast at Nowra and Moruya. Not long after moving, Frances died from a tetanus infection after cutting her finger on an oyster shell. At the age of 13 Little was given a guitar and within a year he was playing at local concerts. When 16 years old he travelled to Sydney to perform on a radio programme, Australia's Amateur Hour. In 1955 Little left home to live in Sydney and pursue a career in country music, he was influenced by Nat King Cole, Johnny Mathis and Jim Reeves. His mellow style earned him the nicknames of [...] "the Balladeer", [...] "Gentleman Jim" [...] and [...] "the Honey Voice".|$|E

[...] Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood commented [...] "Lucy's character Lisa was responsible for one of the biggest cliffhanger episodes in EastEnders, so it's a real treat to have her back on screen," [...] while a spokesperson for the show added [...] "Lisa Fowler was a major part of Phil's life– she knows him as well as anyone, so she won't be happy about him looking after his daughter. With their history, you know that this storyline {{is going to be an}} explosive episode in the Mitchells' history." [...] The episode was broadcast on 5 August 2010. Discussing her brief return, Benjamin said, [...] "What I liked about doing this storyline was that it did explain where Lisa had been. When I was watching it, I was thinking 'Where's her mother? Where is Lisa? It's just ridiculous'. But it does make sense. She is mentally unstable and she does have times like that and the little girl is old enough to make her own decisions and say, 'I want to live with my dad now'. So she had to let her go.
