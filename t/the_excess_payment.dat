40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The pricing of Medicare's part B-covered prescription drugs [...] largely drugs that cannot be administered by patients themselves [...] has been under scrutiny for years. Most of the part B drugs with the highest Medicare payments and billing volume fall into three categories: those that are billed for by physicians and typically provided in a physician office setting, those that are billed for by pharmacy suppliers and administered through a durable medical equipment (DME) item, {{and those that are}} also billed by pharmacy suppliers but are patient-administered and covered explicitly by statute. Studies show that Medicare sometimes pays physicians and other providers significantly more than their actual costs for the drugs. In September 2000, the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) [...] now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [...] took steps to reduce Medicare's payment for part B-covered drugs by authorizing Medicare carriers, the contractors that pay part B claims, to use prices obtained in the Justice Department investigations of providers' drug acquisition costs.

Medicare pays 95 percent of the average wholesale price (AWP), which, despite its name, may be neither an average nor what wholesalers charge. It is a price that manufacturers derive using their own criteria; there are no requirements or conventions that AWP reflect the price of any actual sale of drugs by a manufacturer. Manufacturers report AWPs to organizations that publish them in drug price compendia, and Medicare carriers that pay claims for part B drugs base providers' payments on the published AWPs.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the patterns of}} early repayment in multi-period credit transactions.

The relationship of this rule with the linear approximation of the exact value; redeemable debt is determined. The analysis of <b>the</b> maximum <b>excess</b> <b>payment</b> of interest on 78 rule. It has been shown how interest payment on 78 rule depended on the time of early repayment. Early repayment of debt is an agreement under which the borrower pays to the lender amount of money equal to the current balance (as of loan account). Then further regular payments cease and the contract terminates. However, the amount of outstanding debt is determined by the structure of prescription charges. So in the uniform schemes of repayment of consumer credit each payment contains the same part of principal amounts and the total interest. In case of early repayment the Bank loses a significant fraction of the expected interest payments. Therefore, in practice, often used so-called accelerated schemes of interest payments. One of them is 78 rule. Use the 78 rule is simple and straightforward. The name of the rule is due to the fact that the sum of the numbers 12 monthly payments is 78. In the schemes of consumer loan with a term of one year interest payment for the current month is equal to m/ 78 of the total amount of interest payments, where m is the number of remaining payments. The rule name is stored and in the more general case with an arbitrary number of payments. In general interest payment is determined by the relative weight of the total amount of interest in each payment. In uniform schemes it is constant. In accelerated with a particular speed decreases. Therefore, additional cash expenses by the 78 rule may be considered as additional penalties for early repayment of the debt. It this article is shown how this penalty depends on time before maturity. It is shown that the magnitude of these penalties in monetary terms reaches the maximum value when the loan is repaid early between half and two thirds of the total of the loan term...|$|R
