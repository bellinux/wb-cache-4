5|$|The jackalope {{is subject}} to many outlandish and largely tongue-in-cheek claims {{embedded}} in tall tales about its habits. Jackalopes {{are said to be}} so dangerous that hunters are advised to wear stovepipes on their legs <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> gored. Stores in Douglas sell jackalope milk, but The New York Times questions its authenticity on grounds that milking a jackalope is known to be fraught with risk. One of the ways to catch a jackalope is to entice it with whiskey, the jackalope's beverage of choice.|$|E

25|$|Bismarck's {{eight years}} in Frankfurt were marked by changes in his {{political}} opinions, detailed in the numerous lengthy memoranda, which he sent to his ministerial superiors in Berlin. No longer {{under the influence of}} his ultraconservative Prussian friends, Bismarck became less reactionary and more pragmatic. He became convinced that to countervail Austria's newly restored influence, Prussia would have to ally herself with other German states. As a result, he grew to be more accepting of the notion of a united German nation. He gradually came to believe that he and his fellow conservatives had {{to take the lead in}} the drive toward creating a unified nation in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> eclipsed. He also believed that the middle-class liberals wanted a unified Germany more than they wanted to break the grip of the traditional forces over society.|$|E
25|$|J.T. and Colleen meet in 2001 {{but they}} do not become {{involved}} until 2002 as he catches her doing drugs. He plans to use this information to hurt his nemesis and her uncle Billy Abbott (then played by David Tom), but changes his mind when she cries. They start up a friendship and Colleen develops a crush on him. She romantically pursues him by finding ways to bring them closer such as helping him study and getting tickets to see a concert. At first, J.T. only likes her as a kid sister. That slowly changes as he develops feelings for her. Colleen's family disapproves of their relationship despite J.T.'s insistence that they are only friends. John Abbott (Jerry Douglas) and Billy warn him to stay away from her. Her mother, Traci (Beth Maitland), decides to take her home to New York as a way of separating them. <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> separated from J.T., Colleen runs away and stays with J.T.'s friends, Raul Guittierez (David Lago) and Brittany Hodges (Lauren Woodland). This results in her being placed in juvenile detention while J.T. is brought up on charges. Traci offered to drop the charges against him if he convinced her daughter to come back to New York with her. He complies but stops her from leaving. Colleen's father, Brad Carlton (Don Diamont), convinces Traci to allow their daughter to stay with him and his wife and her sister Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). Despite staying in Genoa City, she is not allowed to see J.T. They begin secretly spending time with each other in the Abbott family playhouse.|$|E
500|$|While {{aboard the}} ship Greyhound, Newton gained notoriety for {{being one of}} the most profane men the captain had ever met. In a culture where sailors {{commonly}} used oaths and swore, Newton was admonished several times for not only using the worst words the captain had ever heard, but creating new ones to exceed the limits of verbal debauchery. In March 1748, while the Greyhound was in the North Atlantic, a violent storm came upon the ship that was so rough it swept overboard a crew member who was standing where Newton had been moments before. After hours of the crew emptying water from the ship and expecting to be capsized, Newton and another mate tied themselves to the ship's pump <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> washed overboard, working for several hours. After proposing the measure to the captain, Newton had turned and said, [...] "If this will not do, then Lord have mercy upon us!" [...] Newton rested briefly before returning to the deck to steer for the next eleven hours. During his time at the wheel he pondered his divine challenge.|$|E

2500|$|Critic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes {{reflecting}} {{pain and}} loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly {{songs such as}} [...] "Go! Go! Go!" [...] and [...] "Mean Woman Blues" [...] that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine braggadocio. In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> too consistently dark or grim.|$|E
2500|$|<b>To</b> <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> {{thrown into}} the river, the French {{committed}} an entire division to the street fight, in which the Ebelsberg castle loomed as the key position. After Masséna threw in a second division, the French finally ejected the Austrians from the castle. Unwilling to recapture the town, Hiller ordered his artillery to {{set fire to the}} place. In the blaze that followed, hundreds of wounded soldiers from both armies died. The battle and the heavy casualties were unnecessary because Hiller was already flanked out of position by a second French corps that crossed the Traun upstream.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the war was}} a major burden {{upon the}} colonists, one bright spot {{occurred}} in July 1690. As the colonies were being continuously harassed by French privateers, an expedition consisting of two sloops and 90 men {{under the command of}} Captain Thomas Paine went out from Newport to attack the enemy. [...] Paine approached five ships near Block Island, sent a few men ashore to prevent a French landing, then ran into shallow water <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> surrounded. [...] A late afternoon engagement ensued, lasting until nightfall, when the French withdrew, losing about half their men to casualties, while Paine's loss was one man killed and six wounded. [...] The brilliant exploit of Paine inspired the people of the colony with a naval spirit; this was the first victory for Rhode Island on the open sea. [...] French privateers, however, continued covering the seas, plundering the commerce of the colonists, and compelled a special session of the Assembly to adopt stringent measures for raising the tax levied but not yet collected.|$|E

2500|$|Curtis's {{final game}} for Michigan {{was to have}} been the season finale against Penn. [...] On November 10, 1906, one week before the Penn game, Curtis {{suffered}} a severely broken leg during a practice game. [...] Curtis had not planned to play in the game, but the varsity was playing [...] "listlessly" [...] and had been held to a 0–0 score by the scrubs. [...] Accordingly, Curtis put himself in the lineup at left end for the final three minutes in hopes of inspiring the team. [...] The injury occurred as Curtis carried the ball. [...] An end on the scrub team, Langley, fell trying <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> [...] "boxed out." [...] Curtis tripped on Langley and fell into a half somersault. [...] In an attempt to protect his ankle, Curtis gathered his leg under him while in the air. [...] The mass of players [...] "fell in a heap on poor Curtis. [...] 'Snap' went his left leg at a point between the knee and ankle. [...] The noise of the breaking of the bones could be heard distinctly in the bleachers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gigante {{was even}} more {{concerned}} about keeping law enforcement at bay than Lombardo had been. [...] His best-known tactic to confuse law enforcement was by pretending insanity. Gigante frequently walked down New York streets in a bathrobe, mumbling incoherently. Gigante succeeded in convincing court-appointed psychiatrists that his mental illness was worsening, and avoided several criminal prosecutions. The New York media soon nicknamed Gigante [...] "The Oddfather". Gigante reportedly operated from the Triangle Social Club in Greenwich Village in Manhattan. He never left his house during the day, fearing that the FBI would sneak in and plant a bug. [...] At night, he would sneak away from his house and conduct family business when FBI surveillance was more lax. Even then, he only whispered <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> picked up by wiretaps. [...] To avoid incrimination from undercover surveillance, Gigante decreed that any mobster who spoke his name would face severe punishment. [...] In the case of his own family, anyone who spoke his name would be killed on the spot. [...] When necessary, mobsters would either point to their chins or make a [...] "C" [...] with thumb and forefinger when referring to him. In this way, Gigante managed {{to stay on the}} streets while the city's other four bosses ended up getting long prison terms.|$|E
2500|$|During that weekend, Texarkana {{residents}} {{kept the}} police busy by flooding the station with reports of prowlers. One officer stated {{that nearly all}} of the alarms were the result of excitement, wild imagination and even near hysteria. Farmhouses and neighborhoods blazed with lights. Several businesses, including cafes, theaters and night clubs, lost many customers. One business reported a 20% drop. The evenings were hopping, but the streets were practically deserted when dawn approached. The city became a virtual ghost town. Because of the drop in business, liquor stores closed at 9:30 and posted a statement in the paper saying, [...] "We fully understand the state of mind in which Texarkana is now gripped. And we are selling no liquor to persons who already have been drinking. We do not wish to add further to the troubles of the police. Any person who drinks whiskey at this time to get drunk and wander about the streets of Texarkana is further complicating the works of the police and is placing himself in grave danger of being shot by people whose nerves are on edge from the recent murders." [...] Since citizens were so jittery and armed with guns, Texarkana was a very dangerous place. Officers had to turn their siren on when they drove up, get out and stand in their headlights and announce themselves <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> shot by a nervous homeowner. In order to go to someone's house, you had to call in advance and let them know to expect you. A fearful tavern proprietor had shot a customer in the foot who was in search of beer.|$|E
