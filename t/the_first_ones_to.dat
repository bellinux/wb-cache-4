5|$|Fox {{played and}} financed cricket and rugby in Somerset; he played cricket for Somerset County Cricket Club from 1877 to 1882, and {{remained}} as a vice-president {{of the club}} until his death. He founded Wellington Rugby Football Club in 1874, and was an administrator and captain of the Somerset Rugby Football Union. After retiring as a rugby player, he continued to take part as an umpire. In 1884 he started mountaineering, and within two years he was {{well known in the}} mountain climbing community, and a well-regarded alpine explorer. In 1888, he and William Frederick Donkin travelled to the Caucasus Mountains in the Russian Empire in a bid to be <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> climb Koshtan-Tau. The pair, along with their Swiss guides, died in an accident during the expedition.|$|E

25|$|While {{exploring}} Aura, Wes (Ángel Aranda) {{discovers the}} ruins of a spaceship {{a few miles from the}} Argos. Markary, Sanya (Norma Bengell) and Carter (Ivan Rassimov) investigate. Inside the ship, they discover large skeletal remains of the long dead crew and thus realize that they are not <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> have been drawn to the planet by the distress beacon. Markary and Sanya are temporarily trapped inside the ship, but manage to escape and return to the Argos. Carter inexplicably vanishes.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps the Fermi paradox itself—or {{the alien}} {{equivalent}} of it—is {{the reason for}} any civilization to avoid contact with other civilizations, even if no other obstacles existed. From any one civilization's point of view, it would be unlikely {{for them to be}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> make first contact. Therefore, according to this reasoning, it is likely that previous civilizations faced fatal problems with first contact and doing so should be avoided. So perhaps every civilization keeps quiet because of the possibility that there is a real reason for others to do so.|$|E

25|$|After {{completing}} service trials, and originally designated P-45, a {{first order}} for 80 aircraft was placed 10 August 1939; the designation reverted to P-39C before deliveries began. After assessing aerial combat conditions in Europe, {{it was evident}} that without armor or self-sealing tanks, the 20 production P-39Cs were not suitable for operational use. The remaining 60 machines in the order were built as P-39Ds with armor, self-sealing tanks and enhanced armament. These P-39Ds were the first Airacobras to enter into service with the Army Air Corps units and would be <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> see action.|$|E
25|$|DBB or the Dasmariñas Bagong Bayan was {{established}} in 1975 under the government of Pres. Ferdinand Marcos. At first, it occupies 234 hectares {{of land in the}} town and is 8 kilometers away from the town's Poblacion. This land was bought by the PHHC or the People Homesite Housing Corporation to the owners at two million and four hundred thousand pesos (P2,400,000) which then became the resettlement area for the less-privileged families living in the depressed areas of Metro Manila. The families of Eduardo Coronel, Rogelio Tomas, Ruben Alvarez, Manuel Rabang, Aurora Dela Cruz and Diosdado Alto were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> live here. Diosdado Alto, Rodolfo Urubia, Danilo Serrano, Maximo Esteban, Manuel Macuto and Francisco Gonzales became the first barangays leaders.|$|E
25|$|As the DB 601 E {{was not yet}} {{available}} in numbers, the pre-production F-0 (the only F variant to have a rectangular supercharger intake) and the first production series F-1/F-2 received the 1,175PS (1,159hp, 864kW) DB 601N engine driving a VDM 9-11207 propeller. The F-0/F-1 and F-2 only differed in their armament; the F-1 being fitted with one 20mm MG FF/M Motorkanone firing through the propeller hub, with 60 rounds. The F-1 first saw action in the Battle of Britain in October 1940 with JG 51. The most experienced fighter aces, like Werner Mölders, were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> fly the Bf 109 F-1s in combat in October 1940. A total of 208 F-1s were built between August 1940 and February 1941 by Messerschmitt Regensburg and the Wiener Neustädter Flugzeugwerke (WNF).|$|E

25|$|In 1919, Weed and McKibben, {{biomedical}} {{researchers at}} Johns Hopkins Medical School, were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> document {{the use and}} effect of osmotically active substances on brain mass. While studying transfer of salt solutions from blood to Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), they first noted that concentrated sodium chloride intravenous (IV) injection led to collapse of the thecal sac which prevented them from withdrawing CSF from the lumbar cistern. In order to further study the effect, they conducted lab experiments on anesthetized cats which underwent craniotomy. They observed changes to the convexity of cat's brain upon IV injection, specifically, they noted that Hypertonic Saline IV injection resulted in maximum shrinkage of the brain in 15-30 mins, while administration of hypotonic solutions resulted in protrusion and rupture of the brain tissue. By 1927, use of osmotic agents in IV delivery became official.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eastern}} part of Dasmariñas, we can find Barangay Burol which is 3 {{kilometers}} away from the city center. The complete name of barrio Burol is Pansol-Burol. Pansol is a Tagalog word meaning aqueduct, while Burol, also a native word, means mound. Even though there are no historical records about its establishment, {{it is safe to say}} that it was formed during the Spanish period due to the presence of ruins of old Spanish houses and sugarmills. The families of Quillao and Beltran are <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> settle in this place. This barangay became the hide-out of the Katipuneros/revolucionarios. During the Japanese occupation, there are some Dasmarineños who were killed in this place. They were Alfredo Purificacion, Pedro Calupad, Jose Yñota, Victor de Jesus and Angel Olaes. The Japanese soldiers also planted several cotton trees on the area. Now, this place is considered one of the richest barangay in Dasmariñas. Many schools and colleges can be found here such as the Southern Luzon College, International English Center, Asian Trinity School, and many others. Adjacent to the place is the Emilio Aguinaldo College. Numerous subdivisions and villages are also located here.|$|E
25|$|In late May and June 1945, {{when the}} Yugoslav army started {{emptying}} its prison camps in Slovenia, prisoners from the Teharje camp and the Stari Pisker prison were brought by trucks {{at night to}} the abandoned Barbara Pit mine in Huda Jama. Slovene Home Guard POWs that were singled out in Slovenj Gradec, Velenje, Kranj and Celje were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> arrive on {{the last week of}} May. NDH troops were brought on foot. Once arrived, groups of 5-6 prisoners with hands tied with wire were stripped, ordered to kneel above a mine shaft and shot in the head, or were hit with a mine hammer or a pickaxe. In some cases, groups of 20-30 prisoners were tossed into a mine shaft, followed with hand grenades to finish off the victims. A number of prisoners were thrown in alive. Once the shafts were filled with corpses, the remaining prisoners were sent in the direction of Zagorje in northwest Croatia where they were killed, while the bodies were covered with lime to speed up decomposition. The mine was then enclosed with 400 cubic meters of concrete and wooden barriers. Those still conscious tried to climb over each other to reach the hatch, but could not escape the sealed mine.|$|E

500|$|In Japan, a playable {{version of}} the game was showcased at Square's [...] "Millennium Event", a show held on January 29, 2000 in Yokohama.

The game was also showcased in the United States at the Electronic Entertainment Expo of Los Angeles, from May 11 to May 13 of the same year. This demonstration was not playable however, as focus groups were revising the game to improve upon the Japanese version. According to the American website GameSpot, the level of body details and shading was also refined. The European and North American versions of the game were eventually released ten months after the Japanese one.|$|E
500|$|Old Louisville {{features}} the {{largest collection of}} pedestrian-only streets of any U.S. neighborhood. Eleven such [...] "courts", where houses face each other across a grass median with sidewalks, {{were built in the}} neighborhood from 1891 to the 1920s. Most of the courts are centered off of 4th Street. Belgravia Court and Fountain Court were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> be built in 1891 and are the most well known. Later ones included Reeser and Kensington (1910), which were built with large Victorian styled apartments instead of single family homes; and Eutropia and Rose Courts, which were the last ones built in the 1920s and featured small, single story houses. Belgravia and St. James Court were completely rehabilitated {{as a part of the}} urban renewal that began in the 1960s. These developments are apparently unique to Louisville.|$|E
500|$|All six {{boats were}} in service with the 88th {{submarine}} flotilla of the JRM with Lora Naval Base being their homeport. At {{the start of}} the Croatian War of Independence all boats except Soča were relocated to Montenegro without participating in combat operations. Croatian forces captured Soča in drydock at the BSO where it was undergoing an overhaul. Soča underwent a modification program that improved its autonomy by installing a diesel generator. It was recommissioned, now with the Croatian Navy, in 1996 as [...] and remained in service until the early 2000s when it was declared redundant. The remaining boats entered service with the new SR Yugoslav Navy. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> be decommissioned sometime between 1997 and 2001 were Tisa and Una. In 2003 a decision was made that the ongoing major overhaul of Kupa would stop; the boat was decommissioned and broken up in 2008. It appears that the last Una-class boats in service with the SR Yugoslav Navy were Zeta and Vardar, both of them being decommissioned in 2005.|$|E
