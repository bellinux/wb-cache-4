25|$|The marine {{ecosystem}} is highly complex and natural fluctuations in species composition, abundance and distribution are a basic feature of its normal function. The extent of damage {{can therefore be}} difficult to detect against this background variability. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> damage and its importance is whether spill effects result in a downturn in breeding success, productivity, diversity and the overall functioning of the system. Spills {{are not the only}} pressure on marine habitats; chronic urban and industrial contamination or the exploitation of the resources they provide are also serious threats.|$|E
25|$|Horney {{believed}} these stimuli {{to be less}} important, {{except for}} influences during childhood.

For instance, a child might feel a lack of warmth and affection should a parent make fun of the child's feelings. The parent may also casually neglect to fulfill promises, which in turn could have a detrimental effect on the child's mental state.|$|E
25|$|Internal politics, {{diplomacy}} and leadership also key factors in military evolution. Some scholars maintain that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> African warfare {{lies in the}} political institutions and processes of the African landscape, where a massive number of small polities greatly outnumbered large empires or nations. The consolidation of these small polities into larger units sparked a growth in mass-recruited armies, a development that was more decisive overall than the appearance of gunpowder weapons. The Asante for example rose to power first through larger mass armies equipped with traditional bows, arrows and spears. Firearms were only to come later, after the crucial formative period. The key driver {{in the development of}} African military systems is thus the internal dynamics of particular indigenous states or kingdoms. The deployment of technology was ultimately shaped in this context.|$|E

25|$|Korelitz (1996) {{shows how}} American Jews {{during the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries {{abandoned}} a racial definition of Jewishness in favor of one that embraced ethnicity. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> this transition from a racial self-definition to a cultural or ethnic one {{can be found in}} the ‘’Menorah Journal’’ between 1915 and 1925. During this time contributors to the Menorah promoted a cultural, rather than a racial, religious, or other view of Jewishness as a means to define Jews in a world that threatened to overwhelm and absorb Jewish uniqueness. The journal represented the ideals of the menorah movement established by Horace M. Kallen and others to promote a revival in Jewish cultural identity and combat the idea of race as a means to define or identify peoples.|$|E
25|$|Thirty {{years ago}} there was neither real {{predictability}} nor qualitative understanding of the dominant mechanisms in emulsion polymerisation. Mechanisms had been ‘proved’ by comparing model predictions with experimental data. The data field was limited and the models had many adjustable parameters, or else fitting parameters had values that were subject to wide uncertainty: {{it was possible to}} choose values that could suit any model. It was not uncommon to find two papers claiming that quite different mechanisms were dominant in the same system, a result {{of not being able to}} isolate the individual steps. As a result of Gilbert’s work, all individual processes in emulsion polymerisation, one of the commonest ways of making everyday products, are now qualitatively and quantitatively understood. It is now possible to polymerise simple systems and to predict the molecular architecture that will be formed under chosen conditions, while for more complex conditions, trends can be semiquantitatively predicted and understood. The international scientific and technical community in this field now uses the mechanistic knowledge that he obtained as <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> current processes and creating new processes and products. His work has put this industrially important field on a rigorous scientific footing.|$|E

500|$|Decreased {{rates of}} {{homologous}} recombination cause inefficient DNA repair, {{which can also}} lead to cancer. [...] This is the case with BRCA1 and BRCA2, two similar tumor suppressor genes whose malfunctioning has been linked with considerably increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Cells missing BRCA1 and BRCA2 have a decreased rate of homologous recombination and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation, suggesting that decreased homologous recombination leads to increased susceptibility to cancer.

500|$|The first English-language work of {{literary}} criticism {{devoted to the}} series was Tintin and the Secret of Literature, written by the novelist Tom McCarthy and published in 2006. McCarthy compares Hergé's work with that of Aeschylus, Honoré de Balzac, Joseph Conrad, and Henry James and argues that the series contains <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> literature itself. McCarthy considered the Adventures of Tintin to be [...] "stupendously rich", containing [...] "a mastery of plot and symbol, theme and sub-text" [...] which, influenced by Tisseron's psychoanalytical readings of the work, he believed could be deciphered to reveal a series of recurring themes, ranging from bartering to implicit sexual intercourse that Hergé had featured throughout the series. Reviewing the book in The Telegraph, Toby Clements argued that McCarthy's work, and literary criticism of Hergé's comic strips in general, cut [...] "perilously close" [...] to simply feeding [...] "the appetite of those willing to cross the line between enthusiast and obsessive" [...] in the Tintinological community.|$|E

He felt that <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> Todd was his concern about his status and how others perceived him. He thought that Todd mistreated people because it made him feel better about himself and that he did not want to appear vulnerable, so his defense mechanisms [...] "spun out of control". Howarth, during an April 1994 Soap Opera Update interview, said that the only thing that he admired about Todd was his clothing style. His interviewer called Todd's early fashion sense [...] "grunge, Salvation Army like 'rags'," [...] and Howarth described Todd's later wardrobe as [...] "all Ralph Lauren" [...] and [...] "ouble R.L. 80 dollar pants and a 400-and-something-dollar jacket". St. John, as Todd's second portrayer, described the character as [...] "kind of both good and bad.
