Geopolitical aims of great forces and Serbian neighbours have been directed to continual decrease of that significance, by reducing and fragmentation of Serbian ethno-spatial potentials. That {{has been carried out}} multi-dimensionally in all Serbian areas, and especially in Kosovo and Metohija. After the war and the establishing of the protectorate in the year 1999, the process of systematic de-serbing of Kosovo and Metohija was continued in various ways, and accelerated. The epilogue is expected through the geopolitical act of official separation of Kosovo and Metohija from Serbia. This would happen in a similar way that was tested before (in Dayton-Paris agreement) - by "finished act" of forced territorialization and setting up the border lines. Geopolitical prognosis points to the expectation that the further operationalization of a hypothetical separation could have the following phases: further propaganda of the allegedly unavoidable independence of Kosovo and Metohija; further institutional distancing of Kosovo and Metohija from Serbia; Albanian military preparations; setting up of incidents as triggers of Albanian attacks; direct armed action of Albanians; extortion of Serbian agreement on losing Kosovo and Metohija, under the threat of hypothetical losing of larger territories...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the issue of Yugoslav {{ideology}} and its role in suppressing the Serbian Cyrillic script. There were two different approaches in the concept of Yugoslavism as developed on the grounds of Illyrism (Lj. Gaj) in the midnineteenth century: the Croatian and the Serbian ones. The Croatian Yugoslavism (J. J. Strossmayer) was of a pro-Catholic and anti-Serbian character language and writing, it was manifested through annulling of Serbian language in the domain of "Croatian state legislation" and supression, prohibition and persecution of Serbian Cyrillic script. On the other hand, Serbian approach to Yugoslavism (T. Pavlović, J. Subotić etc) was a tolerant one: the lingual diversity of the south Slavic peoples opposing the need for their co-operation. By the beginning of the 20 th century the Croatian variant of Yugoslavism (with its three-tribal nation concept) prevailed over the Serbian one and became the grounding ideology for the new, common state. Its lingual union basing on the domination of the eastern – ekavian – pronunciation variant (from the Serbian language) and Latin letters (from the Croatian) was disadvantageous to both spoken and written Serbian language: <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> <b>have</b> accepted Latin writing and the Croats have never accepted the so-called eastern pronunciation. The consequences have not for diminished the Serbian Cyrillic script with the decline of the Yugoslav ideology (which was first abandoned by the Croats) nor with the falling apart of the Yugoslav state...|$|E
40|$|The Balkans {{has been}} one of the regions with the highest risk of {{conflict}} since the last century and in the post-Cold War era. The inevitable coexistence of quantitatively small, various, and heterogeneous peoples in this geography establishes the basis forconflicts. It can be assumed that the conflicts between peoples are the result of boundaries neglecting the nationality principle,and in turn such conflicts contributed to division of the Balkans into small states. For this reason, fragmentation and theemergence of small states in a region is called “Balkanization” in international relations. Kosovo is a typical example of Balkanization. The root of the problem is that the principle of nationality was not taken intoaccount when the borders of Kosovo were drawn. In other words, the borders are drawn in accordance with considerations ofpower politics rather than idealpolitics. For this reason, Kosovo {{has been one}} of the most problematic regions in the world foralmost a century since the Serbian occupation of Kosovo in 1912, but especially since the Kosovo’s independence process startedafter the Cold War. What makes Kosovo a problem is its current ethnic make-up and legal status. When the process ofdisintegration of began in the 1980 s, it proved very difficult to convince Kosovar Albanians to maintain Kosovo’s status as aprovince of Serbia. Since then ethnic, linguistic and religious differences between Kosovar Albanians and the Serbs havecomplicated the Kosovo issue. The problems of whether Kosovo has a right to self-determination (including the problem ofwhether the constitution of former Yugoslavia provided Kosovo with the right to independence), or whether it is a part of Serbia(or former Yugoslavia) represent (and represented) the legal dimensions of the issue. Even though the main aspect of Albanian-Serbian conflict converges upon the struggle for the possession of Kosovo, sovereignty of Kosovo and other territorial issuescontains several other problems within. In sum, Kosovo issue is further complicated by several factors: a) Kosovo’s borders weredemarcated several times during the Ottoman rule, finally fixed in 1945. b) It has a mixed population of two millions,overwhelming majority are Albanians but consisting of Serbs, Turks, Bosnians, Ashkalies and Goranies. c) It is located astride a major transit root in the Balkans. d) As in the example of Turkish minority, ethnic minorities in Kosovo experience difficulties ineffectively exercising their constitutional rights. The Albanian and Serbian claims to Kosovo territory are based mainly on the concept of historical rights, which emphasizesthe argument of first arrival to the region. This issue of first arrival is more complicated than it looks at first, and it is almostimpossible to resolve, because the parties reject the counter arguments. But the historical analysis can help resolving theseconflicting claims. Concerning the question of “who arrived at Kosovo first?” Albanians claim that Illyrians who are the ancestorsof Albanians came to the region before the Serbians, meanwhile the Serbians claim that they belong to the region. Serbians are thefirst to arrive at the Balkans among the Slavic people in 5 th and 6 th centuries, but it took until 12 th century for them to spreadinto Kosovo region. The historical right argument is not valid in international law. However, if a community who claims certainright over a territory and continues its settlement in that region, the members of that community can put this argument forwardto establish traditional rights, which are implicitly accepted by the international community. It can be argued that this might be thesituation for the Kosovars. The both parties view Kosovo as their fatherland. They accuse each other of coming to the region afterwards and occupyingKosovo. For Albanians, the Serbians occupied Kosovo in 1912, while for Serbians, Kosovo is Albanianized through forcedmigration of Serbians out of Kosovo. There are points where the parties have strong points. The structure of population shows that the Kosovar Albanians are themajority in the region and the Albanian population is steadily increasing. On the other hand <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> <b>have</b> strong argumentsbased on the principles of international law, such as territorial integrity, state sovereignty, non-intervention in domestic affairs. Besides these general principles, the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 recognizes Kosovo as part of Yugoslavia, thereforeSerbia. But the Kosovar Albanians have always rejected Serbian interpretation of Resolution 1244, claiming that Kosovo was partof Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, not the republic of Serbia. With the independence of Kosovo on February 17, 2008 (which was supported by the United States, majority of theEuropean Union member states, Albania and Turkey), the UN, although it encouraged a change in the status of Kosovofollowing NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999) despite its contradiction with the principle of territorial sovereignty, remainedon the sidelines because of the Russian opposition and veto. Russia is the second country which opposes the Kosovo’sindependence after Serbia. Despite the declaration of independence, Kosovo problem remains unsolved. Several proposals towards a possible solutioncan be put forward: a) A focus on today rather than history is needed. b) For a peaceful coexistence of peoples they need to stopviewing each other as “the other. ” c) The parties need to give up on their so called historical rights, claims to historical fatherland,and they should stop accusing each other of being occupiers, and need to start viewing Kosovo as their common and sharedhomeland. d) Kosovar Serbs and Albanians should stop seeking Serbian or Albanian intervention in the affairs of Kosovo,especially in matters concerning inter community relations. e) Democratization appears to be the only way to overcomedifferences between peoples of Kosovo and to create conditions for peaceful coexistence. f) Economic development and theresultant increase in the level of prosperity will also help improving inter community relations. This article identifies the historical significance of the territory of Kosovo in the eyes of Kosovar Albanians and Serbs andsummarizes the claims for both parties. After the diagnosis of the problem, several tentative proposals for a possible solution areput forward...|$|E
