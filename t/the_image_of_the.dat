5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Anita Shapira, {{there is}} a gap, at times quite wide, between the 'facts established by historical research' and <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle as retained in collective memory.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, {{the capacity of the}} buildings, the nature of the space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and the contrast of vertical and horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> architecture in the surroundings. The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stations is revealing.|$|E

Cruickshank and Haefele (2001) defined ten <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good teacher. Different <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good teacher {{were found in}} the educational models, but not all aspects reflecting <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good teacher in the educational models were covered by the framework utilized and some images partially overlapped one another. Because <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> good teacher and child are related, they should be defined together as <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teacher-child interaction. Implications for future research are discussed...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aeolian harp was {{a popular}} image in turn of the 19th-century {{literature}} and collections were built around poems dedicated to the harps.

5|$|A well-educated landowning aristocrat, Edwards {{deliberately}} cultivated <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural leader. Thomas Ford {{writes that}} {{he continued to}} dress like an 18th-century gentleman long after such fashions {{had gone out of}} style, and that his public speaking was marked by showy eloquence. Edwards consciously positioned himself in the select class of men who dominated Kentucky and, later, Illinois politics. In 1803 in Russellville, Edwards married Elvira Lane, a relative from Maryland.|$|E
5|$|According to Watson, {{the most}} {{dominant}} element in the Rommel myth is Rommel the Superior Soldier, the second being Rommel the Common Man, {{and the last one}} Rommel the Martyr. Rosie Goldschmidt Waldeck, writing in 1943, also takes note of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general who fought with common soldiers, with an indelible youthfulness and apparent invulnerability.|$|E
5|$|Also {{introduced}} {{in this volume}} were Cutts the butcher (originally Sanzot from the French sans os ("without bones")) and the Bordurian chief of secret police Colonel Sponsz, whose name {{is derived from the}} Brussels dialect term for a sponge (éponge in French).

He is widely considered to have been responsible for the 1909 murder of Joseph Petrosino, head of the New York City police department's Italian Squad.

5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed eye relief), and at almost any angle, without distorting <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|E

A mardi gras is also held in the town with various street dancing, food, drinks and music. A similar Biniray Festival also occurs in Banton every 10 September in commemoration of the island's patron, San Nicolas de Tolentino. Other festivals include the Saginyogan Festival in Alcantara, the Sanrokan Festival in Banton, and the Talabukon Festival in Looc.|$|E

5|$|In Greek mythology, Auriga {{is often}} {{identified}} as the mythological Greek hero Erichthonius of Athens, the chthonic son of Hephaestus who was raised by the goddess Athena. Erichthonius was generally credited to be {{the inventor of the}} quadriga, the four-horse chariot, which he used in the battle against the usurper Amphictyon, the event that made Erichthonius the king of Athens. His chariot was created in <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun's chariot, the reason Zeus placed him in the heavens. The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him into the night sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} renewal, Eliot {{believed}} that suffering {{was needed for}} all of society before new life could begin. The original Little Gidding community was built for living on monastic lines, but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646. The church, {{the centre of the}} community, was restored in 1714 and again in 1853. The image of religious renewal is combined with <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> London air-raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world. This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit, Pentecost, communion with the dead, and the repetition of history. The theme is also internal to Eliot's own poems; <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rose garden at the end Little Gidding is the image that begins Burnt Norton and the journey is made circular. Also, the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family Reunion.|$|E
5|$|It {{was seen}} in Figure2 that Foucault placed the {{rotating}} mirror R {{as close as possible}} to lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates, an enlarged image of slit S sweeps across the face of the distant mirror M. The greater the distance RM, the more quickly that the image sweeps across mirror M and the less light is reflected back. Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20meters without <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slit becoming too dim to accurately measure.|$|E
