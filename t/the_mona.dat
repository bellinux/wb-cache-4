5|$|Centuries after Lisa's death, Mona Lisa {{became the}} world's most famous {{painting}} and {{took on a}} life separate from Lisa, the woman. Speculation by scholars and hobbyists made {{the work of art}} a globally recognized icon and an object of commercialization. In 2005, Lisa was definitively identified as the model for <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Lisa.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the qualities}} that make Leonardo's work unique are his {{innovative}} techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Lisa, the Last Supper, and the Virgin of the Rocks.|$|E
5|$|City of Death {{features}} the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and his companion Romana (Lalla Ward). Set mainly in Paris in 1979, the plot concerns a scheme by an alien, Scaroth, to steal <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Lisa to finance experiments in time {{travel in the}} hope of averting the accident that marooned him on Earth four hundred million years previously, which began the existence of life on the planet as well.|$|E

5|$|In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, {{the color}} of {{clothing}} showed a person's social rank and profession.

5|$|The largest {{terrestrial}} lizard of {{the archipelago}} of Puerto Rico is <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> ground iguana (Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri). A subspecies of the rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta), it is endemic to Mona Island, located in <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Passage between the main island of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Another Cyclura species of similar size, the Anegada ground iguana (Cyclura pinguis), once {{occurred in the}} archipelago but it became extirpated due to predation by dogs, cats, and humans, habitat destruction, and competition from goats and pigs, and is now restricted to Anegada. The most common lizard in Puerto Rico is the sharp-mouthed lizard (Anolis pulchellus). The Anolis lizards of Puerto Rico, and the Greater Antilles in general, represent an interesting case of adaptive radiation. Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles are {{more closely related to}} other species within the same island than to species of adjacent islands. Surprisingly, even though species divergence occurred independently on each island, the same set of ecomorphs (habitat specialists) have evolved on each island.|$|E
5|$|While in Paris, the Doctor and Romana {{sense the}} effects of time distortion. They observe the Countess Scarlioni using an alien device to scan the {{security}} systems housing Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa at the Louvre. The pair meet Inspector Duggan, who suspects the Countess {{to be involved in}} an ongoing art theft scheme with her husband, Count Scarlioni. Duggan joins the Doctor and Romana in investigating the Scarlioni mansion. There, they find equipment used by Dr. Kerensky to experiment in time, the source of the time distortions, as well as six exact copies of <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Lisa. The Doctor instructs Romana and Duggan to continue investigating here while he returns to the TARDIS to visit da Vinci, a good friend of his. After the Doctor leaves, the Count returns after successfully stealing <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Lisa, and captures Romana and Duggan. Learning that Romana is familiar with time, he kills Dr. Kerensky and forces Romana to continue the tests.|$|E

5|$|Among {{his famous}} {{drawings}} are the Vitruvian Man, {{a study of}} the proportions of the human body; the Head of an Angel, for The Virgin of the Rocks in the Louvre; a botanical study of Star of Bethlehem; and a large drawing (160×100cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist in the National Gallery, London. This drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading, in the manner of <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Lisa. It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to The Virgin and Child with St. Anne in the Louvre.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} {{approached}} Puerto Rico late on September21, the wind shear began to relent, allowing Georges to re-organize; however, its outflow {{was unable to}} fully redevelop due to its proximity to land. Around 2200UTC, the storm reattained Category 3 intensity and made landfall in Puerto Rico with winds of 115mph (185km/h) before weakening again. Hours later, the storm entered <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Passage and began to once again reorganize. As Georges approached the Dominican Republic, it unexpectedly developed a well-defined eye and began to intensify, attaining winds of 120mph (195km/h); satellite imagery suggested that Georges re-attained Category 4 intensity. It made landfall on the Dominican Republic at 1230UTC on September22 as a Category 3 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo was, and is, renowned {{primarily}} as a painter. Among his works, <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Lisa is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items {{as varied as the}} euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived. Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.|$|E

5|$|Major General Miles {{traveled}} {{aboard the}} USS Yale. While approaching <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Passage that separates Puerto Rico {{from the island}} of Hispaniola to the east, Miles opted to land his troops in the southern region of the island, choosing Guánica as his landing zone. Miles dispatched patrol boats to notify all other convoys of his decision and to order them to proceed to Guanica. Miles' decision to change the invasion site was based on his belief that the town of Fajardo would be fortified and he feared that Spanish coastal gun boats would disrupt a landing at Fajardo.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, {{small craft}} {{warnings}} were issued for the Dutch islands of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, despite predictions that Hazel would {{pass to the}} north; these warnings were canceled a day later. After the storm had turned northward, tropical cyclone warnings were posted for Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and the waters of <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Passage. Small craft near Jamaica were advised to head for port ahead of the storm. The U.S. Navy completed extensive preparations at its Guantanamo Bay base, ordering about 1,000 civilians into hardened, fortified Quonset huts, flying aircraft out of the storm's path, and positioning surface ships out at sea.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} habitats, mangroves, reefs and seagrasses, {{are found in}} Puerto Rico's ocean waters. A total of 677 fish species live in these habitats; 242 being reef species. Fish species found in Puerto Rican reefs are {{representative}} of the general Caribbean fauna. Common reef fishes include wrasses, damselfishes, white grunts (Haemulon plumieri), bluestriped grunts (Haemulon sciurus), queen parrotfish (Scarus vetula), and sharks (family Carcharhinidae). Sea breams (Archosargus rhomboidalis) and yellowfin mojarras (Gerres cinereus) are some of the species commonly found in mangrove habitats. Other species of interest include flatfishes, with 21 recorded species, and sharks, with more than 20 species. Oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks are common in <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Passage.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Jeanne {{remained}} over Puerto Rico {{for about}} eight hours, during which it maintained its eye feature and well-defined inner core of convection. It intensified over <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Passage, and attained hurricane status as it struck the eastern {{tip of the}} Dominican Republic on September 16. Continuing slowly west-northwestward near the coast, Jeanne quickly weakened to tropical storm status, and by 24hours after landfall its convection had deteriorated as the eye feature dissipated. Late on September 17, it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as a tropical depression, after having dropped torrential rainfall across Hispaniola. Catastrophic flooding and mudslides were experienced in Haiti, including in the coastal city of Gonaïves, and over 3,000deaths were reported in the country.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he belonged}} to a prestigious family, Cofresí was not wealthy. In 1818 he paid 17 maravedís in taxes, {{spending}} {{most of his time}} at sea and earning a low wage. According to historian Walter Cardona Bonet, Cofresí probably worked in a number of fishing corrals in Boquerón Bay. The corrals belonged to Cristóbal Pabón Dávila, a friend of municipal port captain José Mendoza. This connection is believed to have later protected Cofresí, since Mendoza was godfather to several of his brother Juan Francisco's children. The following year he first appeared on a government registry as a sailor, and there is no evidence linking him to any other jobs in Cabo Rojo. Although Cofresí's brothers were maritime merchants and sailed a boat, Avispa, he probably worked as an able fisherman. On December 28, 1819 Cofresí was registered on Ramona, ferrying goods between the southern municipalities. In addition, her frequent voyages to <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Passage and Cofresí's recognition by local residents indicate that he occasionally accompanied Avispa That year, Cofresí and Juana lived in Barrio del Pueblo and paid higher taxes than the previous year: five reales.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 5th, a {{hurricane}} was first observed about 65mi (110km) southeast of Christiansted in the Danish Virgin Islands. One meteorologist assessed the hurricane as being located near Antigua on September 3. Tracking steadily west-northwestward, it quickly moved ashore near Ponce, Puerto Rico with winds estimated at 80mph (130km/h). After crossing southwestern Puerto Rico, the hurricane emerged into <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Passage as a tropical storm. Late on September 5 it made landfall on eastern Dominican Republic; it quickly weakened over Hispaniola, dissipating on September 6 over the northwestern {{portion of the}} island. An assessment by scholar Michael Chenoweth in 2006 indicated this storm {{was the same as}} the next hurricane, with it continuing northwestward and ultimately reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Due to not being considered the same cyclone in the official hurricane database, this hurricane and the following hurricane are listed separately.|$|E

During the night of her birthday dinner at the Singing Sirloin, Marge is happy with the kids' presents of French perfume from Bart and a macaroni and glue card of her as <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Lisa from Lisa. However, she is offended by Homer's gift as it is another demonstration of his thoughtless gift giving history, which her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier had reminded her of earlier. To make matters worse, as he presents his 'gift', it bursts through its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake. Deeply resentful, Marge reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life, but the ball is also inscribed with his name.|$|E
5|$|In November {{a number}} of sailors aboard El Scipión took {{advantage}} of her officers' shore leave and mutinied, seizing control of the ship. The vessel, repurposed as a pirate ship, began operating in <b>the</b> <b>Mona</b> Passage and was later seen at Mayagüez before disappearing from the record. Cofresí was linked to El Scipión by pirate Jaime Márquez, who admitted under police questioning on Saint Thomas that boatswain Manuel Reyes Paz was a Cofresí associate. The confession hints that the ship was captured by Hispaniola authorities. Cofresí is recorded in the Dominican Republic, where his crew reportedly rested off Puerto Plata province. On one excursion, the pirates were intercepted by Spanish patrol boats {{off the coast of}} Samaná Province. With no apparent escape route, Cofresí is said to have ordered the vessel's sinking and it sailed into Bahía de Samaná before coming to rest near the town of Punta Gorda. This created a diversion, allowing him and his crew to escape in skiffs they rowed to shore and adjacent wetlands (where the larger Spanish ships could not follow). The remains of the ship, reportedly full of plunder, have not been found.|$|E
