5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lutheran</b> {{calendar}} is most {{similar to}} the calendar of The Episcopal Church and thus to the Anglican Calendar of Saints, though it also bears resemblance to the Roman Calendar of Saints because it commemorates {{many of the same}} individuals. However, <b>the</b> <b>Lutheran</b> calendar differs from both in two very significant ways, aside from its emphasis on commemorating persons important to <b>the</b> <b>Lutheran</b> tradition.|$|E

5|$|John Sigismund, {{originally}} Roman Catholic, {{converted to}} Lutheranism {{before the end}} of 1562. However, debates between Lutheran and Calvinist theologians continued. John Sigismund appointed his court physician, Giorgio Biandrata (who as an Anti-Trinitarian did not share either <b>the</b> <b>Lutheran</b> or the Calvinist view) to head a synod to reconcile <b>the</b> <b>Lutheran</b> and the Calvinist clergymen, but their differences proved insuperable in April 1564. The Diet acknowledged the existence of a separate Calvinist denomination in June. John Sigismund also adopted Calvinism and made Ferenc Dávid his court preacher.|$|E

5|$|The {{calendar}} for the ELCA {{is similar}} to many other Western Calendars in {{that it does not}} commemorate any persons from the Old Testament. The calendars of the Orthodox Churches have Old Testament individuals, and <b>the</b> <b>Lutheran</b> Church–Missouri Synod has done the same. At one point there was a proposal to include a day on the Episcopal Church calendar (which was taken into consideration by the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship in developing <b>the</b> <b>Lutheran</b> Book of Worship) for Old Testament saints following the octave of All Saints (November 8), but this idea was ultimately rejected as tokenism.|$|E

5|$|Von Neumann entered <b>the</b> <b>Lutheran</b> Fasori Evangelikus Gimnázium in 1911. This {{was one of}} {{the best}} schools in Budapest, part of a {{brilliant}} education system designed for the elite. Under the Hungarian system, children received all their education at the one gymnasium. Despite being run by <b>the</b> <b>Lutheran</b> Church, the majority of its pupils were Jewish. The school system produced a generation noted for intellectual achievement, that included Theodore von Kármán (b. 1881), George de Hevesy (b. 1885), Leó Szilárd (b. 1898), Dennis Gabor (b. 1900), Eugene Wigner (b. 1902), Edward Teller (b. 1908), and Paul Erdős (b. 1913). Collectively, they were sometimes known as Martians. Wigner was a year ahead of von Neumann at <b>the</b> <b>Lutheran</b> School. When asked why the Hungary of his generation had produced so many geniuses, Wigner, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, replied that von Neumann was the only genius.|$|E

5|$|Hebron Church, {{originally}} {{known as}} the Great Capon Church, was established by early German settlers in 1786 as a united German congregation of the Reformed and Lutheran denominations. The congregation was also {{known as the}} German Churches, since it served both denominations. In its earliest days, the church was served by pastors connected with congregations in the Shenandoah Valley. Streit incorporated the church into his circuit shortly after its founding, regularly traveling to the Cacapon River Valley for baptisms and weddings, but his ministry did not extend west of Cooper Mountain. According to the oldest extant church record, six people were confirmed in <b>the</b> <b>Lutheran</b> Synod and nine confirmed in the German Reformed Church in November 1786. On September 23, 1787, seven more people were confirmed in <b>the</b> <b>Lutheran</b> Synod; the church's enrollment then began to increase.|$|E

5|$|In the 1800s–1900s, <b>the</b> <b>Lutheran</b> State Church {{supported}} the Swedish government by opposing both emigration and preachers' efforts recommending sobriety.
