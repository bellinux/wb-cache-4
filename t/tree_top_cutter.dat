The method can ønd <b>tree</b> <b>tops</b> {{from a wide range}} of viewing angles including extreme ooe-nadir views, but a requirement has been that the number of trees was estimated in advance and that various parameters were well calibrated. A development in the template matching technique is presented, in which the variations in backdrop for imaged trees is handled by letting multiple template matchings icast votesj to determine the most likely positions of <b>tree</b> <b>tops.</b> The method requires less accurate parameter calibration and allows clear separation of ihigh qualityj <b>tree</b> <b>top</b> candidates from those less likely to correspond to actual trees, without the need for an a priori stem count estimate.

50|$|Parallax method 3-D is {{a survey}} {{technique}} {{for measuring the}} tree height indirectly by Michael Taylor. The parallax method involves finding two different views to the <b>tree's</b> <b>top,</b> the ground level differential and horizontal sweep angles between the top and the two views. These values {{can be used in}} an algebraic equation to determine the height of the <b>tree’s</b> <b>top</b> above the stations can be calculated. No direct measurement to the <b>tree's</b> trunk or <b>top</b> is taken in the parallax Method.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>Top</b> {{was founded}} by Bill Charbonneau, who {{purchased}} an apple processing plant in Selah, Washington after moving from southern California with his family. In the 1950s, Charbonneau developed a brand of apple juice. A contest held among his employees led to choosing the name [...] "Tree Top" [...] due to {{the perception that the}} highest quality fruit grows at the <b>tops</b> of <b>trees.</b> A handful of orchardists purchased <b>Tree</b> <b>Top</b> from Bill Charbonneau in 1960 and with the purchase, the growers bought the right to the first clear apple juice process developed and its facilities. In 2008, the cooperative had nearly 1,000 grower/owners in Washington, Oregon and Idaho and along with its subsidiary, Sabroso Company, produce the widest array of fruit-based products and ingredients available, including <b>Tree</b> <b>Top</b> apple juice, apple sauce, and fresh sliced apples.|$|R
