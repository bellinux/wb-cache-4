25|$|A {{condenser}} microphone, {{also called}} a capacitor microphone or electrostatic microphone, is a microphone containing a capacitor that has two plates with a voltage between them. In the condenser microphone, {{one of these}} plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing {{the distance between the}} two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a charge current occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs. A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external phantom power. The condenser microphone was invented in 1916 at Bell Laboratories by Edward Christopher 'E.C.' Wente, which became possible {{with the advent of the}} vacuum <b>tube</b> (<b>valve)</b> to act as an amplifier of the low signal output.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, the Marconi {{companies}} {{gained a}} reputation for being technically conservative, in particular by continuing to use inefficient spark-transmitter technology, which could be used only for radio-telegraph operations, long after it was apparent that the future of radio communication lay with continuous-wave transmissions which were more efficient and could be used for audio transmissions. Somewhat belatedly, the company did begin significant work with continuous-wave equipment beginning in 1915, after the introduction of the oscillating vacuum <b>tube</b> (<b>valve).</b> The New Street Works factory in Chelmsford was the location for the first entertainment radio broadcasts in the United Kingdom in 1920, employing a vacuum tube transmitter and featuring Dame Nellie Melba. In 1922, regular entertainment broadcasts commenced from the Marconi Research Centre at Great Baddow, forming the prelude to the BBC, and he spoke of the close association of aviation and wireless telephony in that same year at a private gathering with Florence Tyzack Parbury, and even spoke of interplanetary wireless communication.|$|E

[...] A {{deceptively simple}} design, the circuit {{provided}} {{a tap on}} the primary winding of the output transformer to provide feedback to the second grid, which improved the amplifier's linearity. [...] With the tap placed at the anode end of the primary winding, the <b>tube</b> (<b>valve)</b> is effectively connected as a triode, and if the tap was at the supply end, as a pure pentode. [...] Blumlein discovered that if the tap was {{placed at a distance}} 15–20% down from the supply end of the output transformer, the tube or valve would combine the positive features of both the triode and the pentode design.|$|E
2500|$|A crystal {{microphone}} or piezo microphone uses {{the phenomenon of}} piezoelectricity—the ability of some materials to produce a voltage when subjected to pressure—to convert vibrations into an electrical signal. An {{example of this is}} potassium sodium tartrate, which is a piezoelectric crystal that works as a transducer, both as a microphone and as a slimline loudspeaker component. Crystal microphones were once commonly supplied with vacuum <b>tube</b> (<b>valve)</b> equipment, such as domestic tape recorders. [...] Their high output impedance matched the high input impedance (typically about 10megohms) of the vacuum tube input stage well. They were difficult to match to early transistor equipment, and were quickly supplanted by dynamic microphones for a time, and later small electret condenser devices. The high impedance of the {{crystal microphone}} made it very susceptible to handling noise, both from the microphone itself and from the connecting cable.|$|E
