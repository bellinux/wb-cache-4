The square contains a large central area with roadways on three sides and a terrace to the north, in front of the National Gallery. The roads around the square form part of the A4, a major road running west of the City of London. The square was formerly surrounded by a one-way <b>traffic</b> <b>system,</b> but works completed in 2003 reduced the width of the roads and closed the northern side to traffic.|$|E
5|$|While {{the plan}} was {{approved}} by the city in 1972, it aroused keen opposition from preservationist, environmentalist, and religious groups. In response to the outcry, the city department of town planning submitted a scaled-back design calling for an above-ground <b>traffic</b> <b>system,</b> a pedestrian plaza fronting Jaffa Gate, the retention of facades along Mamilla and King Solomon Streets, and the demolition of historic buildings only {{in the heart of the}} Mamilla valley. Though Safdie incorporated these suggestions into a new plan submitted in 1976, opposition continued unabated by such bodies as the Jerusalem District Planning Commission, the Jerusalem Merchants Association, and the Council for a Beautiful Israel. Nevertheless, in the 1970s, the city spent NIS 130 million to move over 700 families out of Mamilla to the Neve Yaakov, Pisgat Ze'ev, Katamon, and Baka neighborhoods. Workshops and garages were relocated to Talpiot, where they formed the core of the nascent Talpiot industrial zone.|$|E

It also noted that although the air <b>traffic</b> <b>system</b> was satisfactory, not all of the procedures involved appeared to have been equally promulgated. It therefore came with a series of recommendations. Broadcast of the regional QFF should be done on time and as a priority. All clearances into a control zone should include the regional QFF and any local reading should not be given. Altimeter setting messages should be sent on their own and not included in other messages to avoid confusion. Air traffic procedures should be uniformly applicable to all users. Air traffic officers should be examined periodically. Ensure that there is no possibility of controllers confusing future regional QFF with the current QFF. RAF crews should be given more information on procedures in the Metropolitan Control Zone.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, many {{emerging}} {{problems with}} urban transporta-tion <b>system,</b> including <b>traffic</b> congestion, have been direct {{results of the}} steadily increasing number of commuters in urban areas. To address these problems, many research projects have studied the behaviors of urban <b>traffic</b> <b>systems,</b> and researchers have proposed new and innova-tive traffic control schemes. These studies require accurate and realistic software models for simulating behaviors of urban <b>traffic</b> <b>systems</b> since using a real traffic network as a testbed is often impractical. In this paper, we describe a novel software simulator for urban <b>traffic</b> <b>systems.</b> Our simulator has several desirable properties. First, it gives an accu-rate and realistic representation of important elements of urban traffic networks. Second, it is specially designed for game-theoretic model-ing of <b>traffic</b> <b>systems</b> {{in order to address}} potentially different research questions. Lastly, it has a flexible framework for generating customized network topologies and running customized simulations. In particular, our simulator is particularly useful for studying long term driver be-havior through the application of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. In this paper, we will first describe the urban traffic model used by our software simulator. Specifically, we will describe important com-ponents of real urban <b>traffic</b> <b>systems</b> and argue that the corresponding components of our model are reasonable and meaningful approxima-tions of their real counterparts. Secondly, we will describe the com-ponents of our model that allow game-theoretic modeling of urban <b>traffic</b> <b>systems</b> in order to address various research questions. Finally, we will demonstrate how our model is particularly useful for studying long-term driver behavior, especially during rush hour. 1...|$|R

If he stood wildly waving his hat for liberty {{in the middle of the}} road as Chunk Chutney picked itself out in ruby stars upon the sky, he would impede the excellent but extremely rigid <b>traffic</b> <b>system</b> of New York. If he fell on his knees before a sapphire splendour, and began saying an Ave Maria under a mistaken association, he would be conducted kindly but firmly by an Irish policeman to a more authentic shrine. But though the foreign simplicity might not long survive in New York, it is quite a mistake to suppose that such foreign simplicity cannot enter New York. He may be excluded for being illiterate, but he cannot be excluded for being ignorant, nor for being innocent. Least of all can he be excluded for being wiser in his innocence than the world in its knowledge. There is here indeed more than one distinction to be made. New York is a cosmopolitan city; but it is not a city of cosmopolitans. Most of the masses in New York have a nation, whether or no it be the nation to which New York belongs. Those who are Americanised are American, and very patriotically American. Those who are not thus nationalised are not in the least internationalised. They simply continue to be themselves; the Irish are Irish; the Jews are Jewish; and all sorts of other tribes carry on the traditions of remote European valleys almost untouched. In short, there is a sort of slender bridge between their old country and their new, which they either cross or do not cross, but which they seldom simply occupy. They are exiles or they are citizens; there is no moment when they are cosmopolitans. But very often the exiles bring with them not only rooted traditions, but rooted truths.|$|E
