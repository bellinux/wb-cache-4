5000|$|This can be {{understood}} as the breaking of all of the kink atom’s bonds to remove the atom from the surface and then reforming the adatom interactions.

5000|$|In {{order for}} a {{permanent}} defect to be produced from initially perfect crystal lattice, the kinetic energy that it receives [...] must be larger than <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> of a Frenkel pair. However, while the Frenkel pair formation energies in crystals are typically around 5-10 eV, the average threshold displacement energies are much higher, 20-50 eV. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the defect formation is a complex multi-body collision process (a small collision cascade) where the atom that receives a recoil energy can also bounce back, or kick another atom back to its lattice site. Hence, even the minimum threshold displacement energy is usually clearly higher than the Frenkel pair formation energy.|$|E

Background. This work {{is related}} to the {{theoretical}} calculation of <b>the</b> vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> in <b>the</b> context of finding an answer to two unsolved questions.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of temperature factor on the free <b>energy</b> of vacancy <b>formation</b> and its components in a number of metals within the quasi-harmonic approximation.

Results. It was shown, that <b>the</b> vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> substantially increases with temperature in all cases, which {{is related to}} the thermal lattice expansion. Such increase of <b>the</b> vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> is compensated by <b>the</b> vibrational vacancy <b>formation</b> entropy contribution. <b>The</b> latter appears to be strongly increasing with temperature in the case of Mo. Conclusions. However, a thermodynamic analysis shows that such increase of vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> in <b>the</b> process of calculation is largely underestimated. The latter is compensated by contribution from vibrating entropy of vacancy formation and strongly increases with temperature.
