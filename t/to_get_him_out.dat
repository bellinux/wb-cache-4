5|$|This {{remains the}} only nine-inning major league game where the teams {{combined}} for just one hit. The game's only run, scored by the Dodgers, was unearned. The Dodger run was scored without a recorded at bat—Lou Johnson walked, reached second on a sacrifice bunt, stole third, and scored when the throw <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> at third went wild.|$|E
5|$|Martha bumps into Jonah, who is {{now going}} {{by the name of}} Michael. Martha tries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of town, vandalises his van and {{verbally}} abuses him. She falls into a mine shaft with him and he saves her. They grow closer and later they start a relationship, which no one approves of. Martha looks after Jack while he is in a coma after he is shot. Jack reveals he still loves her, but he decides to stand by Sam. Martha realises she loves Jack as well as Michael. She and Michael leave town, but Martha returns days later to stop Jack and Sam's wedding, but she fails.|$|E
5|$|The prison {{became known}} {{around the world}} in the 19th century through the writing of the English novelist Charles Dickens, whose father was sent there in 1824, when Dickens was 12, for a debt to a baker. Forced as a result to leave school to work in a factory, Dickens based several of his {{characters}} on his experience, most notably Amy Dorrit, whose father is in the Marshalsea for debts so complex no one can fathom how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bilbo Baggins, the titular protagonist, is a respectable, {{reserved}} hobbit. During his adventure, Bilbo often {{refers to}} {{the contents of his}} larder at home and wishes he had more food. Until he finds a magic ring, he is more baggage than help. Gandalf, an itinerant wizard, introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves. During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at, only to appear again at key moments in the story. Thorin Oakenshield, the proud, pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain, makes many mistakes in his leadership, relying on Gandalf and Bilbo <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of trouble, but he proves himself a mighty warrior. Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin's grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure.|$|E
5|$|Headley's {{success for}} Dudley was watched keenly in Jamaica and {{commentators}} began {{to discuss his}} availability for the 1954 series against England. A public subscription to finance his travel to Jamaica, opened by the Daily Gleaner, raised over £1,000, and despite his reservations, Headley returned to Jamaica. Playing in a fund-raising match, he sustained a hand injury and playing for the Combined Parishes in a minor match against the MCC, a short ball from Fred Trueman struck Headley's arm. The latter injury {{kept him out of}} the first-class match between Jamaica and the MCC, but he played in the second where, although hampered by his injury, he scored 53 not out. The Test selectors had seen enough to include Headley in the team for the first Test. Reaction among critics was mixed, and Headley, nearing his 45th birthday, remains the oldest man as of 2015 to play a Test match for West Indies. Headley batted at number six, and it appeared that England, under the captaincy of Len Hutton, let Headley score an easy run to begin his innings, which Hutton later confirmed to be the case. However, Headley later argued that the run was given to ensure that he was batting {{at the beginning of the}} next over, so that England could try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> before he settled down.|$|E
5|$|While {{this style}} {{facilitated}} his solid defensive play, it inhibited {{him as a}} stroke player and made him susceptible to hand and arm injuries. Such injuries would be common throughout his career. One such injury almost required {{the tip of a}} broken finger to be amputated. He was occasionally vulnerable to left-arm bowlers, either due to his inability to adjust his line of stroke or because during his career there were few fast left-hand bowlers for him to practise against in the nets. Boycott himself disputes this. In spite of that, he was never vulnerable to any one particular bowler. Pace bowler Dennis Lillee was the most successful against him in Test matches, with seven dismissals. Gary Sobers also dismissed him seven times, but Lillee did so in fewer matches. Peter Lever, a Test colleague, discussed with Boycott his vulnerability when playing the hook stroke, which was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> on more than one occasion. Overall in Test cricket, 54% of Boycott's dismissals were by being caught, with lbw and bowled taking 14% and 16% respectively. Boycott was an occasional medium-pace inswing bowler. He was never a genuine all-rounder, but took seven wickets at Test level at an average of 54.57, often bowling wearing his cap turned back-to-front to assist his vision.|$|E

50|$|Louis Meyer came to {{the pits}} on lap 157, but had a {{disastrous}} seven-minute pit stop. The engine stalled and the crew worked diligently on the carburetor <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> back <b>out</b> on the track. By {{the time he got}} back in the race, he had fallen to third place. Ray Keech was now firmly in control with Kleopfer (driving for Moore) in second.|$|R
50|$|When a {{beautiful}} widowed mother, Ellen Heaven (Mia Sara) takes offence {{at the new}} teacher, she does all she can <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> thrown <b>out</b> of town. Torn between their responsibilities and their attraction to each other, passions are awoken and Charlie and Ellen fall in love. However, the two revengeful mob bosses have not forgotten Charlie and arrive in town to settle scores.|$|R
5|$|Victor and Nikki finally remarry in March 2013 {{just before}} she is {{diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis. At their wedding, an assassin attempts to shoot Victor, but Adam takes the bullet and nearly dies for his father. As a result, he offers Victor the position of co-CEO at Newman, and they begin working together. However, their partnership ends several months later when Victor discovers that Adam's silent partner used to take Newman private again was Jack. Victor fears that Adam and Jack have been scheming {{to take back the}} company for themselves without Victor. In retaliating, Victor, who now owns Chancellor Industries according to Katherine Chancellor's will, has all major Newman clients sign to Chancellor, as Victor leaves Newman worthless so he could build up Chancellor. Adam signs over his shares in Newman over to Victor, who plans to merge Chancellor Industries with Newman. Nikki then reveals she gave birth to another son decades earlier before she was with Victor, revealed to be Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton). A subsidiary of the newly merged conglomerate, named Bonaventure Industries, later produced an illegal speed drug that Summer Newman (Hunter King) ended up overdosing on. Jack reported Victor to the FDA and he and his company were put under investigation. Dylan's supposed father and Nikki's former lover Ian Ward (Ray Wise) then arrives in town and causes pandemonium, to which Victor tries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of town. It was later revealed that Victor had hired a lookalike to his granddaughter Cassie, named Mariah Copeland (Camryn Grimes), to haunt Sharon and learn a supposed secret she has. When his scheme is revealed, Nick and Sharon shun him and Nikki decides to move out for a while, but she and Victor later reunite. Victor and Nikki later learn that Ian is incapable of fathering children, leading to confusion. It is later revealed that Paul Williams (Doug Davidson), Nikki's ex-lover and longtime friend, is in fact Dylan's father, causing tension in Victor and Nikki's marriage, which continues when Victor goes to extensive lengths to awaken Phyllis (Gina Tognoni) from a coma in order to find out more information on Sharon's supposed secret. Nikki falls off the wagon and begins drinking again; she leaves Victor and refuses to take him back. Victor also sells Chancellor Industries back to Jill (Jess Walton), leaving the rest of the Newman family confused as to why he gave Chancellor up so easily.|$|E
25|$|Thorpe {{was born}} in Farnham, Surrey, in August 1969. Naturally right-handed, when he {{was six years old}} Thorpe changed his stance to make it harder for his two elder {{brothers}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> and because the boundary in his garden was shorter on the leg-side for a left-hander.|$|E
25|$|The {{variations}} {{in different types}} of delivery, as well as variations caused by directing the ball with differing line and length, are key weapons in a bowler's arsenal. Throughout an over, the bowler will choose a sequence of deliveries designed to attack the batsman's concentration and technique, in an effort <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
50|$|Vasu soon gains a {{position}} in the Devaswom board, and sides with the common people instead of Shivan during the meetings. Upon realizing that he could be a threat, Shekharan reveals Vasu's real motives in front of everyone <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> kicked <b>out.</b> On the flip side, he is allowed to stay as he repented his mistakes. Following these incidents, Shivan and Vasu's friendship goes through a rough phase.|$|R
60|$|When play {{time came}} the next day, Rollo ran after Nathan {{to show him}} his beetle and wedges, and <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go <b>out</b> and see <b>him</b> 'split' with them. Nathan trotted along after him, very much pleased.|$|R
5000|$|Dylan Everett as Marlon Parks, Indie's {{troublesome}} friend. He often {{relies on}} Abi <b>to</b> help <b>him</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of trouble. He is {{raised by a}} single mother who is never shown onscreen.|$|R
25|$|Bede {{implies that}} Oswiu {{decided to take}} further action because Wilfrid was away for longer than expected. It is unclear whether Oswiu {{changed his mind about}} Wilfrid, or whether he despaired of his return, or whether he never really {{intended}} him to become bishop but used this opportunity <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the country.|$|E
25|$|Bowlers {{aimed to}} bring the ball in to him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> since against outswing, 'he was the best', as Kapil Dev noted {{when asked about the}} best batsmen he had bowled to after he had become the highest wicket-taker in 1994. These {{attributes}} made him unconquerable on English wickets where medium-pace and finger-spin was the staple on soft, wickets with little bounce.|$|E
25|$|Tony Randall portrayed Poirot in The Alphabet Murders, a 1965 film {{also known}} as The ABC Murders. This was more a satire of Poirot than a {{straightforward}} adaptation, and was greatly changed from the original. Much of the story, set in modernistic times, was played for comedy, with Poirot investigating the murders while evading the attempts by Hastings (Robert Morley) and the police <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of England and back to Belgium.|$|E
50|$|On 28 August 1941 he {{fractured}} {{his neck}} {{as a result}} of a crash after a take off. However, this did not stop him flying, although it did require six ground crew <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> into and <b>out</b> of his aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Herbert Cowley would {{eventually}} be awarded the Pip, Squeak and Wilfred trio of medals for soldiers who served early in the First World War. He was also awarded the silver War Badge by 1916, a useful public symbol which showed others {{that he had been}} injured and demobilised. Cowley had got what was known as a 'Blighty' wound, serious enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> invalided <b>out</b> of the army but one that allowed him to live an active life.|$|R
50|$|A week later, Alex {{learns that}} John {{was in fact}} an MI6 double agent within Scorpia, and that his death at the hostage {{exchange}} had been faked, in order <b>to</b> both <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of Scorpia and allow him to retire from the spy world. Alex's parents had indeed {{been killed in a}} plane crash, arranged by Rothman once she learned of John's betrayal. As Alex leaves MI6's headquarters, he is shot by a Scorpia assassin in retaliation for his actions, his fate left uncertain.|$|R
25|$|Shortly after {{securing}} {{his position}} as caliph, al-Muntasir decided to send an army against the Byzantines. According to the historian al-Tabari, this decision was prompted by Ahmad ibn al-Khasib; the vizier had recently had a falling out with Wasif, and he sought to find an excuse <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the capital. Ahmad ultimately decided {{that the best way}} to accomplish this was to put him at the head of a military campaign. He was eventually able to convince the caliph to go along with the plan, and al-Muntasir ordered Wasif to head to the Byzantine frontier.|$|E
25|$|Dill was {{promoted}} field marshal on 18 November 1941, but {{by this time}} it was clear how poorly he and Churchill got on. Dill gained a reputation as unimaginative and obstructionist. Keen <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the way, Churchill at the end of 1941 had Dill advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) and posted him to Washington as his personal representative where he became Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission, then Senior British Representative on the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Dill showed a great flair as a diplomatic military presence. In 1943 alone he attended the Quebec Conference, the Casablanca Conference, the Tehran Conference and meetings in India, China and Brazil. He also served on the Combined Policy Committee set up by the British and United States governments under the Quebec Agreement to oversee the construction of the atomic bomb.|$|E
25|$|Rico later {{broke out}} of prison with help from Judge Griffin and killed a {{reporter}} who had been investigating the Judge program. Since he and Joe had the same DNA, Joe was wrongly convicted of the murder and given a life sentence. Griffin, Rico, and a scientist named Ilsa Hayden (Joan Chen) began working to reopen the cloning lab that created Rico and Joe. Griffin planned {{to create a new}} generation of Judges to enforce his views on the populace, but Rico wanted to create clones of himself to take over Mega-City One and killed Griffin <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the way. Once Joe returned to the city, Rico tried to persuade him to join the effort; when Joe refused, Rico tried to kill him. The two fought atop the Statue of Liberty, and Joe threw Rico over the edge to his death.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, Pamela Smart had {{her husband}} murdered {{by a student}} of hers. Though the student {{committed}} the murder, the courts ruled that Smart had been guilty of mariticide due to her influence on the young man and her convincing manner <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> carry <b>out</b> the act.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason for}} the {{conflict}} soon becomes clear to Ursula: he {{was having an affair}} with her aunt. However, when Florentine (Alida Valli) discovers her lover has no intention of making any commitment to her, she refuses to confirm Lambert's alibi to the police and forces him into becoming a fugitive. Ursula, always impulsive, runs off with him and together they seek a way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> safely <b>out</b> of the country. While evading the police, the lovers take refuge in the gorge known as El Chorro.|$|R
5000|$|Cash {{would go}} on to face being labeled [...] "the bad Samaritan," [...] and also the target of a {{campaign}} by students who attempted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> kicked <b>out</b> of UC Berkeley for not stopping the crime. Two local Los Angeles radio hosts, Tim Conway Jr. and Doug Steckler, subsequently held a rally to have Cash expelled from the University of California at Berkeley, but University officials stated that they had no basis to remove him since he was not convicted of any crime.|$|R
25|$|He was a {{tall and}} bulky person with a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now and then. He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so it was very difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> He was the most selfish batsman that I have ever seen.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Luca {{decides to}} walk The Path of the Dragon alone, believing he will meet Dracula at the end, who {{he plans to}} kill. Moriani writes his report refuting vampires, but the next morning, Luca is found shot dead, and Moriani decides take up Luca's plan. Amongst Calugarul's {{correspondence}} he finds evidence The Path begins where Tepes was held prisoner in Turkey, and so travels to the jail in the mountains, where he discovers prisoners were left as food for a creature living in the forest so she would spare the nearby villagers. Tepes, however, apparently escaped. Upon returning to Vladoviste, Moriani learns Ozana has been told by the Iron Guard <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the inn, and the villagers no longer {{want to speak to}} him. He calls Boczow to tell her he plans to walk The Path to kill whatever he finds at the end of it, and she advises he come see her.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} he also faced his first moral dilemma. After Owen was censured again after being fired, {{students}} were threatened with punishment for associating with him. However, Penn stood by the dean, thereby gaining a fine and reprimand from the university. The Admiral, despairing of the charges, pulled young Penn away from Oxford, hoping to distract him from the heretical influences of the university. The attempt had no effect and father and son struggled to understand each other. Back at school, the administration imposed stricter religious requirements including daily chapel attendance and required dress. Penn rebelled against enforced worship and was expelled. His father, in a rage, attacked young Penn with a cane and forced him from their home. Penn's mother made peace in the family, which allowed her son to return home but she quickly concluded that both her social standing and her husband's career were being threatened by their son's behaviour. So at age 18, young Penn was sent to Paris <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of view, improve his manners, and expose him to another culture.|$|E
5000|$|Williams team {{principal}}, Patrick Head, {{furious at}} {{what had just}} happened, went to Ferrari team principal Jean Todt to have strong words with him about the racing incident: [...] "We Williams will do everything <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> Schumacher thrown <b>out</b> of this race and no we will not tolerate it".|$|R
50|$|Into {{their lives}} comes Louise, {{a school bus}} driver who is falling for Floyd and trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come <b>out</b> of his stupor.

5000|$|As the {{commander}} in New York, Clinton was obligated to do {{a certain amount of}} entertaining. This he did, although he chafed at the costs involved. He was eventually joined by the Baddeleys. Mary Baddeley resumed her role as housekeeper, which he appreciated in part because of her excellent managerial skills. [...] She apparently rebuffed Clinton's romantic overtures until she discovered her husband had been cheating on her. Clinton procured a position in one of the Loyalist regiments for her husband, and tried without success <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> transferred <b>out</b> of New York.|$|R
