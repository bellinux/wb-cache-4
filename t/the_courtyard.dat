5|$|<b>The</b> <b>courtyard</b> is flanked on {{four sides}} by 32 khanas, or small study cloisters for {{religious}} scholars. The mosque's four 107 foot tall minarets {{are located in}} each corner of <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b>|$|E
5|$|The present main {{entrance}} to the mosque is the Bab al-Muzayinīn, which opens into the white marble-paved courtyard {{at the opposite end}} of the main prayer hall. To the northeast of the Bab al-Muzayinīn, <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> is flanked by the façade of the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya; the southwestern end of <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> leads to the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya. Directly across <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> from the {{entrance to the}} Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Bab al-Gindi (Gate of Qaytbay), built in 1495, above which stands the minaret of Qaytbay. Through this gate lies <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> of the prayer hall.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, {{following}} the disruption the group were experiencing, Shapira travelled to Europe once again. He hoped {{to secure the}} necessary firman, which would place <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> firmly in the Perushim's possession, and also to raise funds {{to cover the costs}} incurred trying to redeem <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b> His mission, however, was unsuccessful, as was a later mission attempted in 1829 by Zoref.|$|E
50|$|The {{three main}} wings {{surround}} two interior <b>courtyards,</b> <b>the</b> Greek <b>courtyard</b> and <b>the</b> Egyptian <b>courtyard.</b> <b>The</b> northern Egyptian <b>courtyard</b> {{was covered with}} a glass ceiling from the beginning, but <b>the</b> southern Greek <b>courtyard</b> was first covered with a glass ceiling between 1919 and 1923.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>courtyards</b> are <b>the</b> Kapellenhof (Chapel <b>Courtyard),</b> <b>the</b> large Apothekenhof (Apothecary <b>Courtyard)</b> behind <b>the</b> Festsaalbau, the Puderhöfchen (Small Powder <b>Courtyard),</b> <b>the</b> Küchenhof (Kitchen <b>Courtyard),</b> <b>the</b> Kabinettsgarten (Cabinet Garden), {{and then}} finally <b>the</b> Zierhöfchen (Decorative <b>Courtyard</b> or Comité Courtyard).|$|R

5|$|Still {{awaiting}} imperial {{permission to}} build in <b>the</b> <b>courtyard,</b> the Perushim wished to rely on an old firman given to the Jews in 1623, which stated {{that there could be}} no objection to them building in their own quarters. Having received a supporting document issued by the Qadi of Jerusalem in March 1824, it was possible for them begin rebuilding the dwellings in <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b> In practice, however, construction never materialised as they were unable to exercise their authority over the plot of land. This was apparently due to confrontation with the Arab squatters and the local government's disregard of the documents proving their ownership of <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>courtyards</b> within <b>the</b> Acropolis {{each had}} four sides, {{although}} they were not square. Although <b>the</b> <b>courtyards</b> were all on different vertical levels, this {{appears to have been}} a deliberate decision by planners, and the multi-level nature of the complex was intentionally maintained throughout its period of use, even though the architectural layout, floor levels, and access between courtyards changed over time. <b>The</b> <b>courtyards</b> were enclosed by a labyrinthine mass of multi-level architecture decorated with complex sculpture representing mythic and historical subjects, combined with hieroglyphic texts.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>courtyards</b> {{also contain}} {{a total of}} 14 minarets, and 3 fountains. From <b>the</b> <b>courtyards,</b> {{external}} hallways named after scholars lead to the inner areas of the mosque. They {{are referred to as}} Bast (Sanctuary), since they were meant to be a safeguard for the shrine areas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{practical}} detail {{inside the}} houses are rich: <b>the</b> <b>courtyards</b> supply ample light and air ( [...] pickles and papads were dried there [...] ) but leaving {{the rest of the}} house in deep and cool shadow. <b>The</b> <b>courtyards</b> have tiles placed exactly under the storm-water drain run right through the house, with stone stoppers carved exactly for their mouths. Large stone vats for water and wooden bins for firewood line <b>the</b> inner <b>courtyards.</b>|$|R
5|$|To {{the east}} of <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> lies the Keep. It was re-built in the 1830s, having {{previously}} lain in ruins. This area has the largest concentration of students living in the castle. To the south of <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> is the Gatehouse, built originally by Hugh de Puiset in the 12th century and re-developed in the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries. Around this are the college's more modern offices.|$|E
5|$|A new wing {{was added}} in early 1980 to provide {{additional}} space for the arts, with a large room for orchestra and music and another for studio art. Filling in the previously open east side of <b>the</b> <b>courtyard,</b> the design is nearly identical in design to the original school, built of red and white-washed brick with a cloister on <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> side. The Gatehouse, which was built in 1929 and had served as the headmaster's residence, was remodeled to house the early childhood program in 1988.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing through}} the massive gate, an {{expansive}} sandstone paved courtyard spreads over an area of 276,000 square feet, and which can accommodate 100,000 worshipers when functioning as an Idgah. <b>The</b> <b>courtyard</b> is enclosed by single-aisled arcades.|$|E

50|$|The Royal Alcázar of Madrid {{was based}} on a {{rectangular}} plan. Its interior, divided by two large courtyards, was organised asymmetrically (see image 3). <b>The</b> King's <b>Courtyard,</b> situated in <b>the</b> western part of what was the medieval castle, was smaller than <b>the</b> Queen's <b>Courtyard</b> on <b>the</b> opposite side. This <b>courtyard</b> divided <b>the</b> rooms built during the reign of Charles I. The Royal Chapel was erected between <b>the</b> <b>courtyards</b> under <b>the</b> orders of King John II of the Trastámara dynasty. For many years, <b>the</b> <b>courtyards</b> were open to the public and markets were held there, selling a variety of goods.|$|R
5|$|Directly across <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> {{from the}} {{entrance}} from the Bab al-Muzayinīn is the Bab al-Gindi (Gate of Qaytbay). Built in 1495, this gate leads {{to the court of}} the prayer hall.|$|E

5|$|Petry {{placed a}} {{tourniquet}} {{on his right}} arm. Roberts began to fire at the Taliban fighters, suppressing them in <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b> An additional fighter on {{the east end of}} <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> fired, fatally wounding Gathercole. Higgins and Robinson returned fire, killing that fighter. They were joined by Sergeant First Class Jerod Staidle, the platoon sergeant, and Specialist Gary Depriest, a medic. Directing the medic to treat Gathercole, Petry was assisted by Staide and Higgins to the casualty collection point.|$|E

5000|$|Nirengi Castle {{was built}} on a terraced area near {{the banks of the}} Asakura River. <b>The</b> main <b>courtyard</b> (hon-maru) was about 600 square meters.

5|$|Pits sunk within <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> of {{the acropolis}} {{revealed}} 5425 ceramic fragments, 22 fragments of zoomorphic figurines, together with stone and shell artefacts, animal bones and waste flint chips, all dated to the Terminal Classic.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>courtyard</b> {{is divided}} in three {{sections}} {{separated by a}} row of arches. The left section (as seen from the cathedral) belongs to the Communs wing, which housed the servants. The right section belongs to the stables wing. Left and right of the façade are exedras decorated with busts of Roman emperors. The entrance to the palace is through the left exedra. Facing <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> façade is a peristyle with five arches. The central arch, the highest and widest, faces {{the centre of the}} façade and opens on the palace's main gate.|$|E

5|$|The fort today {{includes}} a museum with an exhibition {{on the ground}} floor mainly concerned with environmental conservation. <b>The</b> <b>courtyard</b> is used by the local community for meetings, weddings and public performances.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey west range {{contains}} the main entrance, which enters <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> via an arched passage. Above the outside gate are spaces where armorial panels were once displayed. The windows on this front, {{larger than the}} original ones in the tower house, had iron grilles, and small gun holes beneath them. Beside the entrance was a kitchen, and above, a larger hall and drawing room. Only {{the western part of}} the three-storey north range was completed, although the Lindsays planned to complete <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b> This range had another kitchen, as well as private chambers within the round tower at the north-west corner. It was entered via a stair turret in <b>the</b> <b>courtyard,</b> fragments of which remain, including parts of an intricately carved door surround. Only the foundations of the east and south buildings remain, which probably contained a bakehouse and stables.|$|E
5|$|Two {{doors at}} the {{south-east}} and south-west corners of <b>the</b> <b>courtyard</b> led to a small hypostyle hall with four pairs of red granite pillars. Beyond were storage chambers and the inner sanctum with three (Ricke) or five (Lauer) statue niches where statues of the king would have been placed, facing the pyramid to the north. Contrary to other mortuary temples, the inner sanctum was thus separated from the pyramid by <b>the</b> <b>courtyard.</b> The only remains of the mortuary temple that are visible today are its basalt paving and the large granite blocks framing the outer door.|$|E
