5|$|In September 1960 Bukovsky entered Moscow University {{to study}} biology. There {{he and some}} friends decided to revive the {{informal}} Mayakovsky Square poetry readings which began after a statue to the poet was unveiled in central Moscow in 1958. They made contact with earlier participants of the readings such as Vladimir Osipov, the editor of Boomerang (1960), and Yuri Galanskov who issued the Phoenix (1961), <b>two</b> <b>examples</b> of literary samizdat.|$|E

Expressed another way, these Sudokus have the property that every 180 degree rotational pair of clues (a, b) follows the rule (a) + (b) = 10.|$|E
5|$|The Yakovlev Yak-19 (Russian: Як-19, USAF/DOD {{designation}} Type 7) was {{a prototype}} Soviet fighter built in late 1940s.

5|$|For its United States release, {{the film}} was {{originally}} scheduled to be released on November 25, 2015, but 20th Century Fox switched The Martian with Victor Frankenstein, so the former would be its first film for all audiences in the country's Autumn season (September–November). On the film's 3D screenings, RealD's chief Anthony Marcoly said 3D technology was proliferating from action-packed blockbuster films commonly released in the United States' summer season. Marcoly said the technology was being used in more immersive storytelling, citing The Martian and The Walk (released the same year) as <b>two</b> <b>examples.</b>|$|E
5|$|Little {{attempt was}} made during the 17th and 18th centuries to pump water, {{possibly}} because the coal-driven Newcomen steam engines would have been uneconomical. It is unclear why windmills were not employed, as {{they were on the}} Fens of East Anglia, but only <b>two</b> <b>examples</b> have been recorded on the Levels: one at Bleadon {{at the mouth of the}} River Axe, where a sea wall had been built, and the other at Common Moor north of Glastonbury, which was being drained following a private Act of Parliament in 1721. The first steam pumping station was Westonzoyland Pumping Station in 1830, followed by more effective ones from 1860. Automatic electric pumps are used today.|$|E

5|$|Many {{sequence}} alignment {{and protein}} structure alignment algorithms {{have been developed}} assuming linear data representations and as such {{are not able to}} detect circular permutations between proteins. <b>Two</b> <b>examples</b> of frequently used methods that have problems correctly aligning proteins related by circular permutation are dynamic programming and many hidden Markov models. As an alternative to these, a number of algorithms are built on top of non-linear approaches and are able to detect topology-independent similarities, or employ modifications allowing them to circumvent the limitations of dynamic programming. The table below is a collection of such methods.|$|E
5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift in gender representation in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other <b>two</b> <b>examples,</b> both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some other}} states, Delaware does not {{prohibit}} duplication between route numbers of different systems. There are <b>two</b> <b>examples</b> of duplication between U.S. and state routes within Delaware. US 9 exists in Sussex County while DE 9 {{is located in}} Kent and New Castle counties. US 202 passes through the Wilmington area in northern New Castle County, with DE 202 heading south from an interchange with I-95 and US 202 along Concord Avenue into the city of Wilmington. DE 202 is signed along a former alignment of US 202.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{toxicity}} of rhenium and its compounds because they are used in very small amounts. Soluble salts, such as the rhenium halides or perrhenates, could be hazardous due to elements other than rhenium or due to rhenium itself. Only a few compounds of rhenium have been tested for their acute toxicity; <b>two</b> <b>examples</b> are potassium perrhenate and rhenium trichloride, which were injected as a solution into rats. The perrhenate had an LD50 value of 2800mg/kg after seven days (this is very low toxicity, similar to that of table salt) and the rhenium trichloride showed LD50 of 280mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|Dietary {{regimes of}} lemurs include folivory, frugivory, and omnivory, with some being highly {{adaptable}} while others specialize on {{foods such as}} plant exudates (tree gum) and bamboo. In some cases, lemur feeding patterns directly benefit the native plant life. When lemurs exploit nectar, they may act as pollinators {{as long as the}} functional parts of the flower are not damaged. In fact, several unrelated Malagasy flowering plants demonstrate lemur-specific pollination traits, and studies indicate that some diurnal species, such as the red-bellied lemur and the ruffed lemurs, act as major pollinators. <b>Two</b> <b>examples</b> of plant species that rely on lemurs for pollination include traveller's palm (Ravenala madagascariensis) and a species of legume-like liana, Strongylodon cravieniae. Seed dispersal is another service lemurs provide. After passing through the lemur gut, tree and vine seeds exhibit lower mortality and germinate faster. Latrine behavior exhibited by some lemurs may help improve soil quality and facilitate seed dispersal. Because of their importance in maintaining a healthy forest, frugivorous lemurs may qualify as keystone mutualists.|$|E
5|$|MD363 {{begins at}} a dead end in the {{community}} of Wenona {{at the southern end of}} Deal Island. The state highway heads north, sharply curving before crossing Middle Creek. The road runs through another series of sharp curves through marshland before straightening out and passing St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church and the old post office building, <b>two</b> <b>examples</b> of buildings on the island preserved as part of the Deal Island Historic District. The route passes a boat ramp accessed from Ralph Abbott Road before a high-level bridge carries it over Upper Thorofare, a strait between Laws Cove and Tangier Sound. On the north side of the bridge, MD363 intersects MD363A, the northern approach to the previous bridge to Deal Island, before passing through the community of Chance, the site of Rock Creek Methodist Episcopal Church. After passing Haines Point Road, which leads to a large public boat ramp, the state highway continues northeast across the two branches of Rock Creek and through more marshland before entering Dames Quarter. MD363 traverses Dames Quarter Creek and passes through Deal Island Wildlife Management Area.|$|E
