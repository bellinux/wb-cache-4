5|$|After 1242 {{most of the}} {{territory}} between <b>the</b> <b>Danube</b> and the Black Sea {{was included in the}} area dominated by the Mongols. Although the Byzantine Empire reestablished control over <b>the</b> <b>Danube</b> Delta in the 1260s, it fell again under the direct rule of the Golden Horde sometime before 1337. By the end of the 13thcentury, flourishing communities of Genoese merchants had settled in the towns of Vicina, Chilia and Licostomo.|$|E
5|$|An {{alliance}} between the Iazyges and the Dacians led the Romans {{to focus more on}} <b>the</b> <b>Danube</b> than the Rhine. This is reflected by the placement of the Roman legions; During the time of Augustus's rule, there were eight legions stationed along the Rhine, four stationed in Mainz and another four in Cologne. Within a hundred years of Augustus' rule, however, Roman military resources had become centred along <b>the</b> <b>Danube</b> instead of the Rhine, with nine legions stationed along <b>the</b> <b>Danube</b> and only one at the Rhine. However, by the time of Marcus Aurelius, twelve legions were stationed along <b>the</b> <b>Danube.</b> The Romans also built a series of forts along the entire right bank of the Danubefrom Germany {{all the way to the}} Black Seaand in the provinces of Rhaetia, Noricum, and Pannonia the legions constructed bridge-head forts. Later, this system was expanded to the lower Danube, with the key castra of Poetovio, Brigetio, and Carnuntum. The Classis Pannonica and Classis Flavia Moesica were deployed to the right and lower Danube, respectively; however, they had to overcome the mass of whirlpools and cataracts of the Iron Gates.|$|E
5|$|Before long, the Ottoman {{garrison}} at Ruse also capitulated. Vlad gave asylum to {{more than}} 11,000 Bulgarians who had rebelled against the Ottomans, assisting them to cross <b>the</b> <b>Danube</b> into Wallachia. The Burgundian crusaders and the Wallachians approached Nicopolis, where a Hungarian army {{under the command of}} John Hunyadi joined them on 14 September. However, an early frost forced the crusaders to abandon the campaign in October, because they feared that <b>the</b> <b>Danube</b> would freeze over.|$|E

5|$|Childe {{continued}} {{writing and}} publishing books on archaeology, {{beginning with a}} series of works following on from The Dawn of European Civilisation and The Aryans by compiling and synthesising data from across Europe. First was The Most Ancient Near East (1928), which assembled information from across Mesopotamia and India, setting a background from which the spread of farming and other technologies into Europe could be understood. This was followed by <b>The</b> <b>Danube</b> in Prehistory (1929) which examined the archaeology along <b>the</b> <b>Danube</b> river, recognising it as the natural boundary dividing the Near East from Europe; Childe believed that it was via <b>the</b> <b>Danube</b> that new technologies travelled westward in prehistory. The book introduced the concept of an archaeological culture to Britain from Germany, revolutionising the theoretical approach of British archaeology.|$|E
