40|$|This study {{analyzes}} <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> substance {{management in}} three U. S. manufacturing sectors from 1991 to 2008. Decomposition analysis applying the logarithmic mean Divisia index {{is used to}} analyze changes in <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> substance emissions by the following five factors: cleaner production, end-of-pipe treatment, transfer for further management, mixing of intermediate materials, and production scale. Based on our results, the chemical manufacturing sector reduced <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> substance emissions mainly via end-of-pipe treatment. In the meantime, transfer for further management contributed to the reduction of <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> substance emissions in the fabricated metal industry. This occurred because the environmental business market expanded in the 1990 s, and the infrastructure for the recycling of metal and other wastes became more efficient. Cleaner production is the main contributor to <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> reduction in the electrical product industry. This implies that the electrical product industry is successful in developing a more environmentally friendly product design and production process. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{large number}} of species of {{families}} Saturniidae, Limacodidae and Megalopygidae have stinging caterpillars which have poisonous setae, also called urticating hairs, {{and in the case}} of Lonomia – a Brazilian saturniid genus – can kill a human due to its potent anticoagulant poison. Caterpillars of many taxa that have sequestered <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> from host plants or have sharp urticating hair or spines, display aposematic colouration and markings.|$|E

5|$|Butterfly larvae, caterpillars, {{have a hard}} (sclerotised) {{head with}} strong mandibles used for cutting their food, most often leaves. They have {{cylindrical}} bodies, with ten segments to the abdomen, generally with short prolegs on segments 3–6 and 10; the three pairs of true legs on the thorax have five segments each. Many are well camouflaged; others are aposematic with bright colours and bristly projections containing <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> obtained from their food plants. The pupa or chrysalis, unlike that of moths, is not wrapped in a cocoon.|$|E
5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems (EGS) actively inject {{water into}} wells {{to be heated}} and pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely flow in and out. The technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Drillers can employ directional drilling to expand {{the size of the}} reservoir.|$|E

5|$|The {{human and}} {{environmental}} {{costs of the}} Gold Rush were substantial. Native Americans, dependent on traditional hunting, gathering and agriculture, became the victims of starvation and disease, as gravel, silt and <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> from prospecting operations killed fish and destroyed habitats. The surge in the mining population also resulted in the disappearance of game and food gathering locales as gold camps and other settlements were built amidst them. Later farming spread to supply the settlers' camps, taking more land away from the Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|Some {{plants are}} thought to employ aposematism to warn herbivores of {{unpalatable}} chemicals or physical defences such as prickled leaves or thorns. Many insects, such as cinnabar moth caterpillars, acquire <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> from their host plants. Among mammals, skunks and zorillas advertise their foul-smelling chemical defences with sharply contrasting black-and-white patterns on their fur, while the similarly-patterned badger and honey badger advertise their sharp claws, powerful jaws, and aggressive natures. Some brightly coloured birds such as passerines with contrasting patterns may also be aposematic, at least in females; but since male birds are often brightly coloured through sexual selection, and their colouration is not correlated with edibility, {{it is unclear whether}} aposematism is significant.|$|E

5|$|Methods for {{controlling}} {{the spread of}} Armillaria root rot include physical removal of infected trees, stumps and large roots; fumigation of soil around infected hosts; and injection of fumigants directly into infected hosts. These methods are often not practical due to high cost, introduction of <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> that affect other organisms, or health and safety issues for the operator. Biological control is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by A.luteobubalina. In one study, thinning stumps of Eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with A.luteobubalina {{and one of the}} saprobic wood decay fungi Coriolus versicolor, Stereum hirsutum and Xylaria hypoxylon; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by A.luteobubalinea. These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests, where it was shown that the presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of A.luteobubalina on the stump base.|$|E
5|$|Other human {{impacts on}} the {{atmosphere}} include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers of {{the species}} Globitermes sulphureus commit suicide by autothysis– rupturing a large gland {{just beneath the surface}} of their cuticles. The thick, yellow fluid in the gland becomes very sticky on contact with the air, {{entangling}} ants or other insects which are trying to invade the nest. Another termite, Neocapriterme taracua, also engages in suicidal defence. Workers physically unable to use their mandibles while in a fight form a pouch full of chemicals, then deliberately rupture themselves, releasing <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> that paralyse and kill their enemies. The soldiers of the neotropical termite family Serritermitidae have a defence strategy which involves front gland autothysis, with the body rupturing between the head and abdomen. When soldiers guarding nest entrances are attacked by intruders, they engage in autothysis, creating a block that denies entry to any attacker.|$|E

5|$|An Associate Professor of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, Stafford L. Warren, was {{commissioned}} as a {{colonel in the}} United States Army Medical Corps, and appointed as chief of the MED's Medical Section and Groves' medical advisor. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos. The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, {{but also for the}} MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals,</b> using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below the rate of private industry.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety {{presented}} a challenge, because workers were handling a variety of <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals,</b> using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, {{not to mention the}} largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since it did not matter where accidents occurred, this included safety off the job, in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included in job training, and safety training courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic Safety Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road safety record than other towns of comparable size.|$|E
