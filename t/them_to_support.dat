5|$|Blyton {{felt she}} had a {{responsibility}} to provide her readers with a strong moral framework, so she encouraged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> worthy causes. In particular, through the clubs she set up or supported, she encouraged and organised them {{to raise funds for}} animal and paediatric charities. The story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled Enid, featuring Helena Bonham Carter in the title role and first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Four in 2009. There have also been several adaptations of her books for stage, screen and television.|$|E
5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better-known candidates.|$|E
5|$|Within MIT's new Laboratory for Nuclear Science, {{headed by}} Zacharias, Rossi was {{assigned}} to create a cosmic ray research group. He recruited four young scientists who had been at Los Alamos, including Sands, and two {{who had been in}} the Radiation Laboratory, as Ph.D. candidates. All were more mature than typical graduate students, with several years of wartime research experience. They were paid a stipend similar to that of a postdoctoral researcher, which enabled <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> families during their graduate studies. The laboratory was funded by the Office of Naval Research.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos left Constantinople for Adrianople, {{situated}} {{close to}} the Byzantine–Bulgarian border, in order to monitor the events and to exploit the situation in Bulgaria in his favour. The demise of Constantine Tikh {{came as a shock}} for the Byzantines. Initially, Michael VIII considered marrying his daughter to Ivaylo, but eventually decided that it would be more favourable to install a protégé of his own. His candidate was Ivan, son of former Emperor Mitso Asen, who had sought asylum in Byzantium and possessed estates in Asia Minor. Ivan promptly married Michael VIII's daughter Irene, pledged allegiance to Michael VIII and was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria as Ivan Asen III. The Byzantines sent gifts to the Bulgarian nobles to incite <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> Ivan Asen III and envoys were dispatched to Tarnovo to arrange for his recognition and the surrender of Empress Maria. In the meantime, Ivan Asen III marched north {{at the head of a}} Byzantine army while Ivaylo was besieging Tarnovo.|$|E

25|$|Wallace did {{not expect}} to win the {{election}} – his strategy was to prevent either major party candidate from winning a preliminary majority in the Electoral College. He had his electors pledge to vote not necessarily for him but rather for whomever he directed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> – his objective was not to move the election into the U.S. House of Representatives, but rather to give himself the bargaining power to determine the winner. Wallace's running mate was retired U.S. Air Force General Curtis LeMay.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his pontificate, Stephen was {{apprehensive}} about the expansionist {{plans of the}} Lombards. Placing his hope in the Franks, he attempted to mediate in the quarrels between Charlemagne and Carloman, which were only helping the Lombard’s cause in Italy. In 769, he helped them reconcile, and pressured <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the still infant Papal States, by reminding them of the support which their father had given the Papacy in the past. He also begged them to intercede on his behalf by entering into discussions with the Lombards.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} chapter, Wireman's father returns to a liberated Earth. The Invader {{garrison}} troops were ill-equipped {{to put down}} an organized revolt, and the colonists blockaded the Solar System to prevent relief troops from arriving. Wireman informs the colonial delegation that their treaty is worthless. He is now in charge and not about to make any concessions.

25|$|In Bombay, Peres plotted to {{liberate}} Goa from his opposer's. At first, he sought {{help from the}} British, as the British were allies of the Portuguese.

He spent the next five months preparing an expeditionary force to capture Goa. He recruited nearly three hundred men for the task. Rogério de Faria financed his mission.

25|$|In Valle de Etla, {{one group}} of {{indigenous}} residents has taken to collecting old tires found on the highway and have begun converting them into handcrafts. The craft idea began with Esteban Perada, originally from Santiago Suchilquitongo. Originally he used <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> washers and retaining walls and car bumpers. Getting creative, he {{found a way to}} convert a tire into a toucan design to hang flowerpots, painting it bright colors. Others liked it and requested the item for their gardens. Since then he and others have created other figures such as parrots, squirrels and more, selling enough to supplement family income.|$|E
25|$|Receiving news of {{the success}} along the {{northern}} set of Ottoman defenses, Brigadier General Fry attempted to convert his feint into a full assault on the Ottoman positions between the river and Suwada marsh. However, the Ottoman defenders put up a stiff resistance, and the attack by the 18th Brigade bogged down. Despite the enfilading fire from the gunboats along the river, Fry's forces could not break through the Ottoman defenders. Fry sent word requesting Delamain's help. Although still engaged in clearing out the Ottoman northern positions, he shifted his forces south, trying to bring <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> Fry's brigade.|$|E

These platoons were heavily used suppressing the protests and violence instigated by Konrad Henlein's Sudeten German Party (Sudetendeutsche Partei - SdP) and the Sudetendeutsche Freikorps (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by SS-instructors) between May and October 1938. They were also used to repel Hungarian and Polish border-crossers, sometimes up to a battalion in strength. They helped to screen the infantry when they had to evacuate southern Slovakia after the First Vienna Award on 2 November 1938.|$|E
25|$|Btrieve {{is not a}} {{relational}} database management system (RDBMS). Early descriptions of Btrieve {{referred to it as}} a record manager (though Pervasive initially used the term navigational database but later changed this to transactional database) because it only deals with the underlying record creation, data retrieval, record updating and data deletion primitives. It uses ISAM as its underlying indexing and storage mechanism. A key part of Pervasive's architecture is the use of a MicroKernel Database Engine, which allows different database backends to be modularised and integrated easily into their DBMS package, Pervasive.SQL. This has enabled <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> both their Btrieve navigational database engine and an SQL-based engine, Scalable SQL.|$|E
25|$|Bigelow {{was in a}} quandary. His {{troops and}} others were {{receiving}} fire from the San Juan Heights that was fortified by the Spanish defenders.
