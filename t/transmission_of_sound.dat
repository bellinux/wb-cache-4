5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{physical}} examination, {{breath sounds}} (heard with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side, partly because {{air in the}} pleural space dampens the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound.</b> Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations {{to the surface of}} the chest may be altered. Percussion of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant (like a booming drum), and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can both be noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the pneumothorax can show limited correlation with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim, and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small.|$|E

25|$|Bell {{believed}} the photophone was {{his most important}} invention. The device allowed for the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> on a beam of light. On April 1, 1880, and also described by plaque as occurring on June 3, Bell's assistant transmitted the world's first wireless telephone message to him on their newly invented form of telecommunication, the far advanced precursor to fiber-optic communications. The wireless call was sent from the Franklin School to the window of Bell's laboratory, some 213 meters away.|$|E

25|$|By 1879 Hubbard {{was able}} to {{interest}} Bell in improving upon the phonograph, and {{it was agreed that}} a laboratory should be created in Washington, D.C. Experiments were also to be conducted in telephone and other telecommunication technologies such as the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> by light, which resulted in the selenium-celled Photophone. Both the Hubbards and the Bells decided to move to the nation's capital, in part due to the numerous legal challenges to Bell's master telephone patent of 1876. Washington was additionally becoming a center of scientific and institutional organizations, which also facilitated Bell's research work.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{analytical}} calculation <b>of</b> {{the acoustic}} <b>transmission</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> propagating through a thin cylindrically curved piezoelectric membrane, which is rigidly clamped at its straight ends, is presented. The membrane is placed inside an acoustic tube {{and connected to}} an active electric shunt circuit that behaves as a negative capacitor. A properly adjusted shunt circuit has {{a significant impact on}} the effective elastic stiffness of the piezoelectric membrane and, hence, influences the membrane acoustic reflectivity and <b>transmission</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>sound.</b> Such a setup represents a noise control system based on the principles of the active elasticity control of piezoelectric materials. The non-uniform radial motion of the clamped membrane and its interaction with the acoustic field and the electric shunt circuit are analyzed. The main objective of the calculations, which are based on Donnell’s theory, is the determination of the effects of the membrane clamps on the flexural motion of the membrane and, therefore, effects on the acoustic <b>transmission</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>sound.</b> Approximative formulae for the amplitude of the membrane displacement and the acoustic <b>transmission</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> are expressed as well as the resonant frequencies of the uniform mode and flexural vibration modes...|$|R
25|$|Acoustic stethoscopes are {{familiar}} to most people, and operate on the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> from the chest piece, via air-filled hollow tubes, to the listener's ears. The chestpiece usually consists of two sides that can be placed against the patient for sensing sound; a diaphragm (plastic disc) or bell (hollow cup). If the diaphragm {{is placed on the}} patient, body sounds vibrate the diaphragm, creating acoustic pressure waves which travel up the tubing to the listener's ears. If the bell is placed on the patient, the vibrations of the skin directly produce acoustic pressure waves traveling up to the listener's ears. The bell transmits low frequency sounds, while the diaphragm transmits higher frequency sounds. This two-sided stethoscope was invented by Rappaport and Sprague {{in the early part of}} the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|Rankine's {{research}} {{during and}} immediately after the war also looked at ways to achieve the optical <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> a problem being worked on by other scientists and engineers in several countries.

Rankine's work in this area was mentioned in Popular Science in 1922, and has been described as an [...] "effective technique for the transmission of speech by sunlight".|$|E

With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate [...] "How are you, grandma?" [...] Indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a [...] "talking dog". These initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> using tuning forks to explore resonance.|$|E

2500|$|In 1879, Bell and {{his wife}} Mabel Hubbard, who had been deaf from early childhood, moved to Washington, D.C. The {{following}} year, the French government awarded Bell the Volta Prize of 50,000 francs (approximately US$ in current dollars) for {{the invention of the}} telephone. Bell used the money to establish a trust fund, the Volta Fund, and founded the Volta Laboratory Association, along with his cousin Chichester A. Bell and Sumner Tainter. The laboratory focused on research for the analysis, recording and <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound.</b> In 1887, the Volta Laboratory Association transferred the sound recording and phonograph invention patents they had been granted to the American Graphophone Company (later to evolve into Columbia Records).

6000|$|The first {{tower of}} which we hear as built upon the earth, was {{certainly}} built in a species of aspiration; but I do not suppose that any one here will {{think it was a}} religious one. [...] "Go to now. Let us build a tower whose top may reach unto heaven." [...] From that day to this, whenever men have become skillful architects at all, there has been a tendency in them to build high; not in any religious feeling, but in mere exuberance of spirit and power--as they dance or sing--with a certain mingling of vanity--like the feeling in which a child builds a tower of cards; and, in nobler instances, with also a strong sense of, and delight in the majesty, height, and strength of the building itself, such as we have in that of a lofty tree or a peaked mountain. Add to this instinct the frequent necessity of points of elevation for watch-towers, or of points of offense, as in towers built on the ramparts of cities, and, finally, the need of elevations for the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> as in the Turkish minaret and Christian belfry, and you have, I think, a sufficient explanation of the tower-building of the world in general. Look through your Bibles only, and collect the various expressions with reference to tower-building there, and you will have a very complete idea of the spirit in which it is for the most part undertaken. You begin with that of Babel; then you remember Gideon beating down the tower of Penuel, in order more completely to humble the pride of the men of the city; you remember the defense of the tower of Shechem against Abimelech, and the death of Abimelech by the casting of a stone from it by a woman's hand; you recollect the husbandman building a tower in his vineyard, and the beautiful expressions in Solomon's song,--"The tower of Lebanon, which looketh towards Damascus;" [...] "I am a wall, and my breasts like towers;"--you recollect the Psalmist's expressions of love and delight, [...] "Go ye round about Jerusalem; tell the towers thereof: mark ye well her bulwarks; consider her palaces, that ye may tell it to the generation following." [...] You see in all these cases how completely the tower is a subject of human pride, or delight, or defense, not in any wise associated with religious sentiment; the towers of Jerusalem being named in the same sentence, not with her temple, but with her bulwarks and palaces. And thus, when the tower is in reality connected with a place of worship, it was generally done to add to its magnificence, but not to add to its religious expression. And over the whole of the world, you have various species of elevated buildings, the Egyptian pyramid, the Indian and Chinese pagoda, the Turkish minaret, and the Christian belfry,--all of them raised either to make a show from a distance, or to cry from, or swing bells in, or hang them round, or for some other very human reason. Thus, when the good people of Beauvais were building their cathedral, that of Amiens, then just completed, had excited the admiration of all France; and the people of Beauvais, in their jealousy and determination to beat the people of Amiens, set to work to build a tower to their own cathedral as high as they possibly could. They built it so high that it tumbled down, and they were never able to finish their cathedral at all--it stands a wreck to this day. But you will not, I should think, imagine this to have been done in heavenward aspiration. Mind, however, I don't blame the people of Beauvais, except for their bad building. I think their desire to beat the citizens of Amiens a most amiable weakness, and only wish I could see the citizens of Edinburgh and Glasgow inflamed with the same emulation, building Gothic towers[7] instead of manufactory chimneys. Only do not confound a feeling which, though healthy and right, may be nearly analogous to that in which you play a cricket-match, with any feeling allied to your hope of heaven.|$|E
