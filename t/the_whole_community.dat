5|$|Sharks figure {{prominently}} in Hawaiian mythology. Stories tell {{of men with}} shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form. A common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. The beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. Hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods. Among a fishing people, {{the most popular of}} all aumakua, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. Kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. The body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe-struck family to the markings on the shark's body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved's body had been wrapped. Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{functions}} of the angakkuit can be understood in the light of this notion of secrecy versus publicity. The cause of illness was usually believed to be soul theft or a breach of some taboo (such as miscarriage).

Similar public rituals were used in the cases of taboo breaches that endangered <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>community</b> (bringing the wrath of mythical beings causing calamities).|$|E

Hubbard called the cathedral's presence among the many state government buildings nearby {{a reminder of the}} presence of God in human affairs and said it was for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>community,</b> not just Albany's Catholics. He called particular attention to the restored original colors, recalling how he had been disappointed with the building's gloomy interior on his first visit to it as a boy.

25|$|In Pakistan, {{the concept}} of Community-led total {{sanitation}} (CLTS) was first introduced as a pilot project in Mardan District in the North West Frontier Province in 2003 by UNICEF together with a local NGO IRSP (Integrated Regional Support Program). A main objective of the concept is to create open defecation free villages through behavioral change in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>community,</b> rather than to construct sanitation facilities for individual households. Since then, CLTS has spread rapidly {{in the whole country}} and became a main feature of the National Sanitation Policy, which provides financial rewards for defined outcomes. Development agencies began to link their funding and incentives to theopen defecation free status. For example, the Khushal Pakistan Fund has allocated about US$200 million (12 billion Pakistani rupees) to community infrastructure projects in open defecation free communities.|$|E
25|$|The Islamic worship {{practiced by}} one Muslim {{may differ from}} another's in minor details, which can affect the precise actions and words involved. Differences arise because of {{different}} interpretations of the Islamic legal sources by the different schools of law (madhhabs) in Sunni Islam, and by different legal traditions within Shia Islam. In the case of ritual worship these differences are generally minor, and should rarely cause dispute. Muslims believe that Muhammad practiced, taught, and disseminated the worship ritual in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>community</b> of Muslims and made it part of their life. The practice has, therefore, been concurrently and perpetually practiced by the community {{in each of the}} generations. The authority for the basic forms of the Salah is neither the hadiths nor the Qur'an, but rather the consensus of Muslims. Differences also occur due to optional (recommended rather than obligatory) articles of prayer procedure, for example, which verses of the Quran to recite. A 2015 Pew Research Center study found that women are two percent {{more likely than men to}} pray on a daily basis.|$|E

25|$|In the Zenú culture, {{women were}} {{the symbol of}} fertility, wisdom and respect. Female {{characters}} were frequently portrayed in clay {{and placed in the}} graves of the dead as a symbol of human and agricultural fertility. The presence of these statuettes in the grave symbolized conception and rebirth in the underworld, {{in the same way that}} seeds germinate and grow. During the funeral ceremony, which was attended by <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>community</b> with music and dance, a mound was built over the grave. On top of the mound a tree was planted, and golden bells were hung in the branches. The golden breastplates that important women and chiefs wore during ceremonies symbolized the pregnancy of women and the virility of men. The roundness of the mound, like the roundness of a breastplate, was an allusion to the place where pregnancy and birth took place. Thus, women possessed great social and political significance. When the Zenú culture was discovered by the Spaniards in the 16th century, the religious center of Finzenú at the river Sinú was led by Toto, a female chief who governed several nearby villages.|$|E
25|$|Golden {{is part of}} {{the network}} of the Regional Transportation District which {{provides}} bus and light rail service throughout the Denver metropolitan area. Its bus routes 16, GS, and SkyRide F (once a day) connect Golden with other points of the Denver metropolitan area and Boulder. The West Corridor (W line) of the FasTracks light rail line, which parallels 6th Avenue into Golden to its terminal at the Jefferson County Government Center, opened to the public April 26, 2013. This is a modern version of the historic trolley line that Golden interests spearheaded in the 1890s. At the same time the W Line opened, a Community Call-n-Ride bus launched in Golden offering flexible service along with regular stops within the city itself. The new bus system was designed to complement the light rail, extending the transit service into <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>community,</b> including the downtown corridor. Although passengers are no longer served by heavy rail, Golden continues to be served by railroad transportation for cargo, and has been continuously since 1870. These lines are owned by the BNSF railroad and serve business interests in the northeastern end of the city. Within the Coors Brewery grounds it becomes the brewery's own in-house railroad.|$|E
25|$|Arthur's lack of {{employment}} becomes {{a huge problem}} for him in 1986 when his daughter, Michelle, announces her engagement to Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt). Desperate to give his daughter a wedding that the family can be proud of, Arthur decides to take money from the Walford residents' Christmas Club savings scheme {{that he has been}} running. However, with Christmas fast approaching, Arthur realises that he will have to do something to explain the lack of money in the account to everyone that contributed. Arthur announces to the members that he has withdrawn the money, then stages a fake burglary at his house and tells the police that the Christmas Club money has been stolen. However, Arthur's attempts to make the robbery look legitimate fail, and the police soon realise that Arthur is the culprit. When questioned by the police, he confesses and after his arrest he becomes severely morose, withdrawn and depressed. This culminates in Arthur finally having a nervous breakdown on Christmas Day and smashing his living room in a violent rage. By early 1987, Arthur has become so despondent that he is admitted to hospital. He returns the following spring to stand trial for the theft of the Christmas Club money. Despite Arthur having <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>community</b> behind him, he is sent to prison for 28 days. After his release, he makes things worse by borrowing money from a loan shark.|$|E
50|$|In {{the liturgical}} {{reforms of the}} mid-20th century in the Roman Catholic Church {{following}} the Second Vatican Council, {{there was a significant}} shift in the funeral rites used by the Church.

25|$|The Jewish cemetery, as {{mentioned}} above, is {{situated on the}} old Fischerfeld. In 1349 the cemetery was enclosed within the city moat and walls, which were fortified with jetties. Beginning in 1424 the neighboring communities also buried their dead there; but this privilege was withdrawn by the magistrate in 1505. When Frankfurt was besieged during the interregnum in 1552, a garrison with cannon was stationed in the cemetery, and an attempt was even made to force the Jews to sink the tombstones and to level the ground; but against this they protested successfully (July 15, 1552). During the Fettmilch riots <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>community</b> spent the night of September 1, 1614, in the cemetery, prepared for death, and thought themselves fortunate when they were permitted {{to leave the city}} through the Fischerfeld gate on the following afternoon. In 1640 a dispute in regard to passage through the cemetery was decided in favor of the Jews. The community occasionally paid damages to Christians who were injured by the oxen (bekorim, the first-born that may not be used in accordance with Exodus xiii. 3) that grazed within the cemetery walls. In 1694 a neighboring garden was bought for the purpose of enlarging the cemetery. During the great fire of 1711 the Jews sought refuge withall their possessions among the tombs of the fathers. The communal baking ovens, which before the fire were behind the synagogue, were transferred to a new site acquired in 1694. The only building preserved from the flames was the hospital for the poor, near the cemetery; behind it, another hospital was built in 1715 to replace the one in the Judengasse that had been destroyed. A slaughterhouse for poultry and a fire station were erected between the ovens and the cemetery. The fire station existed down to 1882; the site of the ovens is now covered by the handsome building of the Sick Fund, and that of the Holzplatz and the garden by the Philanthropin schoolhouse. On the site of the two hospitals the Neue Gemeinde-Synagoge was built in 1882. The cemetery, covering more than , was closed in 1828; its epitaphs have been published by Dr. M. Horovitz.|$|E
