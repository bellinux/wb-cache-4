Search for <b>Tomorrow,</b> <b>for</b> instance, spent its last several months on CBS against {{the last half of}} One Life to Live. Its replacement, Capitol, did little better, and after its cancellation, CBS aligned As the World Turns against One Life to Live and Another World, a configuration that stayed in place until Another Worlds cancellation in 1999. The 1980s saw One Life to Live reach the height of its popularity, with an estimate of 9 million viewers early in the decade. The show typically ranked between the second and the fourth position in the 1980s.|$|E

500|$|The TV {{documentary}} [...] explored {{gay rights}} and homophobia in numerous {{countries in the}} world, including Russia. [...] In it, Fry interviews a lesbian couple who discuss their fears that simply being out to their 16-year-old daughter and her friends could be taken as breaking this law, due to the law's prohibition [...] "on anyone disseminating information about homosexuality to under 18s". [...] The LGBT news magazine The Advocate described the law as criminalising [...] "any positive discussion of LGBT people, identities, or issues in forums that might be accessible to minors. In practice, the law has given police broad license to interpret almost any mention of being LGBT [...] whether uttered, printed, or signified by waving a rainbow flag [...] as just cause to arrest LGBT people." [...] The US State Department in its 2013 report on human rights in Russia noted the clarification from Roskomnadzor (the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications) that the [...] "gay propaganda" [...] prohibited under the law includes materials which [...] "directly or indirectly approve {{of people who are}} in nontraditional sexual relationships." [...] One couple interviewed by Fry said: [...] "Of course we are afraid because we really don't know what's going to happen next in the country. ... You just don't know if they can incarcerate you <b>tomorrow</b> <b>for</b> something or not." [...] Fry also interviewed politician Vitaly Milonov, the original proponent of the law, whose attempts to defend it have been strongly criticised; Milonov responded branding Fry as [...] "sick" [...] for making a suicide attempt while filming the documentary in an interview in which he also compared homosexuality with bestiality.|$|E

2500|$|The {{hamburger}} {{was very}} popular among Americans during {{the postwar period}} following World War I, even in popular culture. An example of this was the prominent appearance of hamburgers in E. C. Segar's Thimble Theatre comic strip, which prominently featured a cartoon character named Popeye the Sailor who ate spinach to sustain his superhuman strength. Popeye's first appearance was as a supporting character on January 17, 1929 alongside many other characters. One of these characters was J. Wellington Wimpy (often shortened to just [...] "Wimpy"), a lover of hamburgers who was both polite and gluttonous. His signature phrase, [...] "I'll gladly pay you <b>tomorrow</b> <b>for</b> a hamburger today", became popular and widely known. During {{the height of his}} popularity in the 1930s, Wimpy introduced the hamburger to the youth of the time as a healthy food. It also resulted {{in the creation of a}} chain of fast food restaurants called Wimpy's in his honor, which sold hamburgers for ten cents. In a similar fashion, the fictional character Jughead Jones, who first appeared in Archie Comics in 1941, was passionate about food generally, and hamburgers specifically.|$|E
2500|$|Rheinschild {{was one of}} {{the most}} heavily {{recruited}} high school football players in the United States in 1904. [...] USC coach Harvey Holmes recruited him strenuously, and Rheinschild later said that Holmes had offered him $75 a month for his services. [...] At the time, USC was not a major football program, and Rheinschild reportedly wanted [...] "nothing but the big league stuff." [...] The University of Wisconsin made an offer to Rheinschild which he said was $25 higher than USC had offered. [...] Rheinschild recalled, [...] "Twelve hundred looked big to me, but I wanted a winner. [...] Wisconsin had been a joke for many seasons and I couldn't see it." [...] A former coach at Los Angeles High School, Shorty Roach, was a friend of Michigan coach Fielding H. Yost and a Michigan scout on the side. [...] Roach encouraged Rheinschild to consider Michigan, which had not lost a game since 1900. [...] A Wisconsin newspaper described the bidding contest between the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan for his services:"Walter Rheinschild, one of the best academic foot ball players in Southern California, is the object of spirited bidding by foot ball managers at Wisconsin and Michigan universities. Rheinschild was a star tackle on last year's local high school team. He weighs 190 pounds. He declares openly that Manager Baird of Michigan offered to pay all his expenses during the season and finally offered him remunerative employment. [...] Wisconsin, he says, offered him all traveling expenses and $60 a month for two hours work a day at the state capital. Rheinschild leaves <b>tomorrow</b> <b>for</b> the east. If Michigan equals Wisconsin's offer he will go to Ann Arbor, [...] if not, to Madison. At Kansas City he expects to receive Baird's highest offer." ...|$|E
