5|$|This was {{followed}} in 1936 by How to be a Detective. The early success of How <b>to</b> <b>Sleep</b> prompted MGM to rush two more short films featuring Benchley, How to Train a Dog, a spoof of dog-training techniques, and How to Behave, which lampooned etiquette norms. How <b>to</b> <b>Sleep</b> was named Best Short Subject at the 1935 Academy Awards, {{while the latter}} two shorts were not as well received.|$|E

50|$|New EEG fatigue {{detection}} software measures an individual's ability <b>to</b> resist <b>sleep.</b> Micro-sleep only occurs {{when an individual}} fails <b>to</b> resist <b>sleep,</b> it does not occur when an individual chooses to rest. Operators of heavy mobile equipment are accustomed to resist sleep; it comes natural and is almost a subconscious behaviour. However, when an individual's ability <b>to</b> resist <b>sleep</b> diminishes, {{there is a risk}} of a micro-sleep. The ability <b>to</b> resist <b>sleep</b> is therefore the most relevant safety measure for equipment operators. The underlying measurement behind the technology is brain activity. Electroencephalogram has been the gold standard in sleep and fatigue science. Being a more direct physiological measure, it provides improved accuracy by avoiding erroneous measurements related to the external environment.|$|R
5|$|Benchley {{returned}} to the cinema in 1937, cast in the revue Broadway Melody of 1938, and in his largest role to that point, the critically panned Live, Love and Learn. A short that Benchley completed for MGM, A Night at the Movies, was Benchley's greatest success since How <b>to</b> <b>Sleep,</b> and won him a contract for more short films that would be produced in New York. These films were produced more quickly than his previous efforts (while How <b>to</b> <b>Sleep</b> needed two days, the later short How to Vote needed less than twelve hours), and took their toll on Benchley. He still completed two shoots in one day (one of which was The Courtship of the Newt), but rested for a while following the 1937 schedule.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} <b>to</b> explore <b>sleep</b> disruption caused by technology use after sleep onset, using three quantitative measures that are regularly used <b>to</b> assess <b>sleep</b> disruption in OSA. Our aim was to determine the most robust measure of daytime impairment among college-aged technology users.

40|$|Power-management {{approaches}} {{have been widely}} studied {{in an attempt to}} conserve idling energy by allowing nodes to switch <b>to</b> a low-power <b>sleep</b> mode. However, due to the inherent inability of current approaches <b>to</b> match <b>sleep</b> schedules <b>to</b> different traffic patterns, energy is wasted switching needlessly from <b>sleep</b> <b>to</b> idle or large delays in traffic delivery are incurred due to being in the sleep state too long. In this paper, we explore such effects of various traffic patterns on current power management protocols. Our results show the importance of traffic information to obtain larger benefits from power management. While some proposals that exploit traffic information exist, they rely primarily on individual sender traffic patterns <b>to</b> develop <b>sleep</b> schedules, ignoring aggregate traffic observed by receivers. This deficiency motivates the design of a new power management protocol that use traffic information at the receivers <b>to</b> adapt <b>sleep</b> schedules...|$|R

30|$|In particular, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), {{which is}} the primary {{questionnaire}} used <b>to</b> assess <b>sleep</b> in athletes [12], has not been validated in an athlete population [13, 14], is difficult to score, lacks information specific to athletes, and shows poor concordance rates with the clinical assessment of a sleep medicine physician (SMP; [13]). Another tool, the Athlete Sleep Behavior Questionnaire (ASBQ), is used <b>to</b> identify maladaptive <b>sleep</b> behaviors in athletes [15]. The ASBQ shows promise <b>to</b> differentiate <b>sleep</b> behaviors between athletes and controls but is still in development to determine valid cut-points that are not based on the authorsâ€™ speculation.

5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E
5|$|Another novel {{aspect of}} the {{offensive}} used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle from El Paso, was the rotation of troops that the rebels employed. Rather than attacking en masse with the whole army, Villa and Orozco had their soldiers engage the enemy for a few hours, {{then go back to}} secure positions <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> while other rebels took their place. As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while the less numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless and ever vigilant.|$|E

Sudirman, ill at the time, sent Nasution to deal with the revolution; Sudirman also sent two other officers as peace feelers before the attacks. Although the revolutionary leader Muso was amenable to peace, Nasution and his soldiers had quashed the uprising by 30September.
