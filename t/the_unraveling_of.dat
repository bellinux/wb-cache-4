They said they had not received any ground fire or hostile reaction, but had been instructed nevertheless to report hostile reaction.|$|E

Police began to dig up a freshly filled-in ditch found on Powers' property, and the bodies of Asta Eicher, her children and Dorothy Lemke were uncovered. Evidence and autopsy results showed that the two girls and their mother were strangled to death while the young boy's head was beaten in with a hammer. Lemke was uncovered with a belt wrapped around her neck, with which she was strangled. Love letters were found in the trunk of Powers' automobile.

The spectral overlap and complexity of peaks were reduced by the blend of selective excitation and homo-decoupling.

500|$|Nasser {{had looked}} to a {{regime change in}} Yemen since 1957 and finally put his desires into {{practice}} in January 1962 by giving the Free Yemen Movement office space, financial support, and radio air time. [...] Anthony Nutting's biography of Gamal Abdel-Nasser identifies several factors that led the Egyptian President to send expeditionary forces to Yemen. These included <b>the</b> <b>unraveling</b> <b>of</b> the union with Syria in 1961, which dissolved his United Arab Republic (UAR), damaging his prestige. A quick decisive victory in Yemen could help him recover leadership of the Arab world.

Its presentation of a family harried and tortured by a sadistic matriarch is shot full of psychological conversation and almost entirely deficient in plot.

2500|$|Eminescu expert Dumitru Irimia groups Doina and LuceafƒÉrul into Eminescu's [...] "final effort". He {{proposes that}} Eminescu, sensing his [...] "mental equilibrium" [...] {{slipping}} away, concentrated on finishing up both works, which outline his universal and social queries. However, he dates the earliest recognizable drafts of Doina to 1878, and Eminescu's {{anger over the}} Berlin Treaty, which awarded the Budjak to Russia, noting parallels with the author's political columns, taken up by Timpul in the early 1880s. According to Perpessicius, while the poem's references to rail transport may correspond to <b>the</b> <b>unraveling</b> <b>of</b> the Strousberg Affair, Doina {{is the product of}} 1878, written [...] "a day after [...] cession , five years before the celebrations in Ia»ôi". He believes that Doina was in any event completed in December 1882, which was the original date set for the inauguration of Stephen's statue.|$|E
