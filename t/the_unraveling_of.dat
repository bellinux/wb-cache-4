25|$|<b>The</b> <b>unraveling</b> <b>of</b> {{the false}} {{intelligence}} reports began with 23-year-old Sergeant Lonnie D.

They said they had not received any ground fire or hostile reaction, but had been instructed nevertheless to report hostile reaction.|$|E

25|$|Police {{found the}} crime scene in four rooms located under Pierson's garage. Bloody clothing, hair, a burned bankbook and a small bloody {{footprint}} of a child were discovered.

Police began to dig up a freshly filled-in ditch found on Powers' property, and the bodies of Asta Eicher, her children and Dorothy Lemke were uncovered. Evidence and autopsy results showed that the two girls and their mother were strangled to death while the young boy's head was beaten in with a hammer. Lemke was uncovered with a belt wrapped around her neck, with which she was strangled. Love letters were found in the trunk of Powers' automobile.

Lindy West said that female rape victims will probably {{be less likely to}} report sexual assaults for fear of being questioned by [...] "some teenage 4Channer".

500|$|Nasser {{had looked}} to a {{regime change in}} Yemen since 1957 and finally put his desires into {{practice}} in January 1962 by giving the Free Yemen Movement office space, financial support, and radio air time. [...] Anthony Nutting's biography of Gamal Abdel-Nasser identifies several factors that led the Egyptian President to send expeditionary forces to Yemen. These included <b>the</b> <b>unraveling</b> <b>of</b> the union with Syria in 1961, which dissolved his United Arab Republic (UAR), damaging his prestige. A quick decisive victory in Yemen could help him recover leadership of the Arab world. Nasser also had his reputation as an anti-colonial force, setting his sights on ridding South Yemen, and its strategic port city of Aden, of British forces.|$|E

2500|$|Continental European {{scholars}} have also discussed {{the necessity of}} far-reaching banking reforms {{in light of the}} current crisis of confidence, recommending the adoption of binding regulations that would go further than Dodd–Frank—notably in France where SFAF and [...] banking experts have argued that, beyond national legislations, such rules should be adopted and implemented within the broader context of separation of powers in European Union law.

2500|$|Eminescu expert Dumitru Irimia groups Doina and Luceafărul into Eminescu's [...] "final effort". He {{proposes that}} Eminescu, sensing his [...] "mental equilibrium" [...] {{slipping}} away, concentrated on finishing up both works, which outline his universal and social queries. However, he dates the earliest recognizable drafts of Doina to 1878, and Eminescu's {{anger over the}} Berlin Treaty, which awarded the Budjak to Russia, noting parallels with the author's political columns, taken up by Timpul in the early 1880s. According to Perpessicius, while the poem's references to rail transport may correspond to <b>the</b> <b>unraveling</b> <b>of</b> the Strousberg Affair, Doina {{is the product of}} 1878, written [...] "a day after [...] cession , five years before the celebrations in Iași".
