Most of the multirotors MAV were originally developed for commercial and consumer use, but have been deployed by Chinese military and law enforcement agencies as trainers for more advanced and costly UAVs deployed in longer missions. In 2011, Walkera made famous the first commercially available 6-axis microcopter, called the Ladybird. This number one seller soon caught the attention of various manufacturers and copies of the Ladybird followed.|$|E

The main benefit of <b>the</b> compound <b>helicopter</b> is its ability to reach speeds that significantly surpass <b>the</b> conventional <b>helicopter.</b> However, it is possible that <b>the</b> compound <b>helicopter</b> design can provide additional benefits in terms of manoeuvrability. The paper features a conventional helicopter and a hybrid compound <b>helicopter.</b> <b>The</b> conventional <b>helicopter</b> features a standard helicopter design with a main rotor providing the propulsive and lifting forces, whereas a tail rotor, mounted {{at the rear of the}} aircraft provides the yaw control. <b>The</b> compound <b>helicopter</b> <b>configuration,</b> known as <b>the</b> hybrid compound <b>helicopter,</b> features both wing and thrust compounding.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{compound}} <b>helicopter</b> is a {{high speed}} design concept that is once again being explored due to the emerging requirements for rotorcraft to obtain speeds that significantly surpass <b>the</b> conventional <b>helicopter.</b> <b>The</b> speed of <b>the</b> conventional <b>helicopter</b> is limited by retreating blade stall, however the introduction of compounding delays the onset of this aerodynamic limitation until greater flight speeds. There are two common types of compounding known as lift and thrust compounding. Lift compounding, provided {{by the addition of}} a wing offloads the main rotor of its lifting responsibilities in high speed flight. Thrust compounding, provided by the addition of a propulsive source such as a propeller, provides additional axial force divorcing the main rotor of its propulsive duties at high speeds. The addition of compounding to <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> design can therefore increase the maximum speed of the aircraft. This increase in speed, provided that efficient hover capability is maintained, would make <b>the</b> compound <b>helicopter</b> suitable for various roles and missions in both military and civil markets. <b>The</b> compound <b>helicopter</b> is not a novel idea with many compound <b>helicopter</b> <b>configurations</b> flight tested in the 1960 's. Due to these test programmes, as well as other studies, there is some material relating to <b>the</b> compound <b>helicopter</b> in <b>the</b> literature. However, the majority of <b>the</b> compound <b>helicopter</b> work describes flight tests of experimental aircraft or focuses on the design of the aircraft configuration. There are no systematic studies of the flight dynamics of compound helicopters which have been published. This Thesis targets this gap in the literature. Consequently, the aim of this Thesis is to investigate the effects of compounding on <b>the</b> conventional <b>helicopter</b> and how this addition to <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> design influences <b>the</b> flight mechanics of this aircraft class. With the renewed interest in <b>the</b> compound <b>helicopter</b> design this work is both original and timely. To investigate the flight dynamics of this aircraft class, two mathematical models of compound <b>helicopter</b> <b>configurations</b> are developed and compared with a conventional <b>helicopter.</b> <b>The</b> first compound <b>helicopter</b> <b>configuration</b> features a coaxial rotor with a pusher propeller providing additional axial thrust, and is referred to as <b>the</b> coaxial compound <b>helicopter.</b> <b>The</b> second <b>configuration,</b> known as <b>the</b> hybrid compound <b>helicopter,</b> features two wings each with a tip mounted propeller providing thrust compounding. <b>The</b> conventional <b>helicopter</b> features a standard helicopter design with a main rotor providing the propulsive and lifting forces, whereas a tail rotor, mounted {{at the rear of the}} aircraft, provides the yaw control. Other authors have focused on design considerations and have quantified all of the benefits of compounding but to date, a comprehensive study of the effect of compounding on the flight dynamics of a helicopter has not been published. The strategy of the work is to take the three aircraft <b>configurations,</b> <b>the</b> two compound <b>helicopter</b> <b>configurations</b> and <b>the</b> conventional <b>helicopter,</b> and determine their flight mechanics characteristics. Subsequently, <b>the</b> compound <b>helicopter</b> results can be compared with the baseline configuration, thereby isolating the effects of compounding. The flight mechanics characteristics that are determined in this Thesis include: trim, performance, stability and manoeuvrability attributes of <b>the</b> three <b>helicopter</b> <b>configurations.</b> These attributes are assessed by calculating the control angles which result in a steady flight condition and by the use of numerical linearisation and inverse simulation algorithms. All of these flight mechanics characteristics were assessed with the results, in some aspects, reinforcing the potential of <b>the</b> compound <b>helicopter</b> as well as highlighting some possible difficulties that will have to be addressed in the design of a compound helicopter...|$|R

The configurations that we examined in our study include rotor systems of two different sizes equipped with two, three or four blades. Our results reveal that a helicopter with fewer blades accumulates less electric current even though the charge on each individual blade is higher. Further, the location of the charge build-up on the rotor disk depends strongly on the number of blades.

The vertical drag decreases rapidly as wheel height is reduced, and is zero at a wheel height of 6 feet. The vertical drag also decreases with forward speed, approaching zero at sixty knots.

These geometry variations included the distance between the rotor and wing, wing incidence angle, and configurations both with the rotor axis {{at the tip of the}} wing (tilt rotor configuration) and with the rotor axis at the center of <b>the</b> wing (compound <b>helicopter</b> <b>configuration).</b> A wing with boundary-layer control was also tested to evaluate the effect of leading and trailing edge upper surface blowing on the wing download. A computationally efficient, semi-empirical theory was developed to predict the download on the wing. Finally, correlations between the theoretical predictions and test data are presented...|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Sikorsky also {{continued}} his earlier work on vertical flight {{while living in}} Nichols, Connecticut. On February 14, 1929, he filed an application to patent a [...] "direct lift" [...] amphibian aircraft which used compressed air to power a direct lift [...] "propeller" [...] and two smaller propellers for thrust. On June 27, 1931, Sikorsky filed for a patent for another [...] "direct lift aircraft", and was awarded patent No. 1,994,488 on March 19, 1935. His design plans eventually culminated in the first (tethered) flight of the Vought-Sikorsky VS-300 on September 14, 1939, with the first free flight occurring eight months later on May 24, 1940. Sikorsky's success with the VS-300 led to the R-4, which became the world's first mass-produced helicopter, in 1942. Sikorsky's final VS-300 rotor configuration, comprising a single main rotor and a single antitorque tail rotor, {{has proven to be}} one of <b>the</b> most popular <b>helicopter</b> <b>configurations,</b> being used in most helicopters produced today.|$|R
