40|$|International audienceA {{line coding}} for high speed serial {{transmission}} {{is defined by}} two major characteristics: the maximum guaranteed run length (RL) which {{is the number of}} consecutive identical bits, and the running disparity (RD or DC-Balance) which is the difference between the number of 'zeroes' and 'ones' in a frame. Both should be bounded to a certain limit, RL to ensure reliable clock recovery and RD to limit baseline wander. Another important parameter is the overhead predictability. This parameter may be critical for applications that need a regular synchronization but for other applications, especially if the variable transfer rate is handled by the upper layer protocol, a statistical value of this parameter is good enough. In this paper, we propose two <b>programmable</b> <b>line</b> codings which bound RL and RD with fixed or variable overhead. The resulting overhead for the line coding we propose is shown to be the lowest among the existing methods, as much as to 10 times lower than well-known encoding methods. The fixed overhead line coding is based on a generalization of the polarity bit approach and can be dynamically adapted to link quality and the environment. First we propose a line coding which bounds the RL, and then we propose another one which bounds the RD. We end up by combining both methods to build a DC-balanced and Run Length limited line coding...|$|R

40|$|In thermal {{transformation}} {{processes for}} the production of metal parts of complex shape, shaping tools are frequently used. In die forging as an example, the tools are exposed to high mechanical and thermal loads and therefore subject to heavy wear. For fast feedback directly in the production process the accuracy to size of metal parts produced in such a way is at present frequently checked with groping measuring tools. This is unsatisfactory because of the complex forms, the broad product range and the thermal conditions. A 3 D – measurement system for highest possible flexibility and industrial environment, conceived for this application and based on a 3 D- sensor attached to an industrial robot for positioning is described here.

At the CHES 2011 conference, a new method of generating random numbers by inducing metastability using precise PDL and PI (proportional-Integral) control has been proposed. As the proposed TRNG could not achieve sufficient randomness on its own, a filtering scheme was used for higher entropy. Unfortunately, the intrinsic characteristics of filters made the throughput of the TRNG decrease by approximately 50 %. To preserve the original throughput and attain a high level of randomness, we present a simple solution that analyzes the probability of outputs and assign long time to metastable state.
