5|$|Historians {{have since}} {{connected}} {{the success of}} Save Our Children with the organization of conservative Christian participation in political processes. Although forceful Christian involvement had not taken a widespread role in politics in the United States since 1925, within two years the Reverend Jerry Falwell developed a coalition of conservative religious groups named <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority</b> that influenced the Republican Party to incorporate a social agenda in national politics. Homosexuality, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), abortion, and pornography were among the issues most central to the Moral Majority's priorities until it folded in 1989. For many gay people, the surprise at the outcome of all the campaigns in 1977 and 1978 instilled a new determination and consolidated activism and communities in many cities where the gay community had not been politically active.|$|E
5|$|McGovern did not mourn {{leaving the}} Senate. Although being {{rejected}} {{by his own}} state stung, intellectually he could accept that South Dakotans wanted a more conservative representative; he and Eleanor felt {{out of touch with}} the country and in some ways liberated by the loss. Nevertheless, he refused to believe that American liberalism was dead in the time of Reagan; remaining active in politics, in January 1981 he founded the political organization Americans for Common Sense. The group sought to rally liberals, encourage liberal thinking, and combat <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority</b> and other new Christian right forces. In 1982, he turned the group into a political action committee, which raised $1.2 million for liberal candidates in the 1982 U.S. Congressional elections. McGovern shut the committee down when he decided to run for president again.|$|E
25|$|Ed McAteer, a {{prominent}} member of Rogers' own congregation, was another {{figure in the}} Christian right who in 1979 co-founded <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority</b> with Jerry Falwell, Howard Phillips, and others. That same year, he established the Religious Roundtable, which in 1980 {{was active in the}} successful campaign to elect Ronald W. Reagan as the U.S. President.|$|E
50|$|The 1976 {{election}} of Jimmy Carter as President of the United States marked a milestone for evangelical Christians. For the first time, a self-professed evangelical Christian {{had been elected}} to the nation’s highest office, bringing the national awareness of evangelical Christianity to a new level. Despite commonality in religious identification, however, evangelical Christians in general and eventually <b>the</b> newly formed <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority</b> in particular would come to be disappointed with Carter’s policies. Carter did not share <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority’s</b> political imperative to unify personal and political positions and would instead support the positions of his own party, the Democratic Party. In particular, Carter did not actively oppose his party’s general pro-choice platform on abortion, nor did Carter work to bridge the church-state divide, both factors in <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority’s</b> decision to support Ronald Reagan’s candidacy in 1980.|$|R

25|$|Aside from LaRouche, some Democratic leaders {{during the}} 1980s did turn toward {{conservative}} views, albeit {{very different from}} the previous incarnations of southern Democrats. In 1988, Joe Lieberman defeated Republican U.S. Senate incumbent Lowell Weicker of Connecticut by running to the right of Weicker and receiving the endorsements of <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority</b> and the National Rifle Association. Colorado governor Richard Lamm, and former Minnesota Senator and Presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy both took up immigration reduction as an issue. Lamm wrote a novel, 1988, about a third party Presidential candidate and former Democrat running as a progressive conservative, and Lamm himself would go on to unsuccessfully seek the nomination of the Reform Party in 1996. McCarthy began to give speeches in the late 1980s naming the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Federal Election Commission as the three biggest threats to liberty in the United States.|$|E
25|$|As a Republican Party member, Baldwin was state {{chairman}} of <b>the</b> Florida <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority</b> in <b>the</b> 1980s. However, during the 2000 campaign of Republican George W.

Farris' close connection to conservative leaders like Jerry Falwell of <b>the</b> former <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority,</b> Pat Robertson of the Christian Coalition and Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum stirred deep-seated feelings about religion and politics. These concerns, inflamed by negative ads by Beyer to portray him even more radically, likely caused alienation of enough moderate voters to cause his defeat.|$|R
500|$|Falwell {{claimed that}} the {{grassroots}} efforts of the Moral Majority—registering millions of voters, informing the public, and using the media—had been {{a significant factor in}} the election of President Ronald Reagan. By 1982 they had a budget of $1 million and millions of volunteers. Around the same time, gay men were being stricken with AIDS, desperate for money for research and services. Spokesmen for <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority</b> connected it to God's will, asserting the general public needed protection from [...] "the gay plague", and warned, [...] "If homosexuals are not stopped they will infect the entire nation and America will be destroyed." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{airing of}} the report, the Community United Against Violence (CUAV), a San Francisco group {{dedicated}} to addressing anti-gay {{violence in the}} city, reported a 400% increase of reported violent incidents against LGBT people. This marked {{a reversal of the}} decrease in violence reports to that point in 1980. Right-wing groups used [...] "Gay Power, Gay Politics" [...] as a fundraising tool until CBS forced them to stop. <b>The</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority,</b> in its successful campaign to repeal a San Jose, California gay rights ordinance, used an image from the program along with the slogan [...] "Don't Let It Spread!" [...] on billboards. In 1985, a Houston group opposed to a proposed LGBT rights ordinance for the city used clips from the program in its commercials and voters overwhelmingly rejected the ordinance. Controversial psychologist Paul Cameron, on behalf of the right wing Family Research Institute, has used the 10% homicide figure to support his views on homosexuality, views which have been repudiated by a number of professional psychological and sociological associations.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s the Reverend Jerry Falwell moved from {{presiding}} over the megachurch Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Virginia and hosting the Old Time Gospel Hour, to being involved in politics. Falwell took credit for defeating the Dade County gay rights ordinance {{and the failure of}} the ERA in Florida. He developed a campaign called Clean Up America in 1977 that was a fundraising vehicle for his television show. Falwell sent letters asking for donations, which included questionnaires asking [...] "Do you approve of known practicing homosexuals teaching in public schools?" [...] that he promised would be sent to politicians; he distributed information about how to put together political groups to influence elections and lawmakers. In 1979 Falwell spearheaded a coalition of religious groups that included Catholics, fundamentalist Protestants, Mormons, and Orthodox Jews that he called <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority,</b> which developed a branch dedicated to political action. Falwell declared in 1965 that he had no business in politics, but justified his involvement and the inevitable mix of religion and government with evidence that the social problems of abortion, pornography, sexual immorality, and drugs were bringing the United States to a dangerous precipice where communism would prevail over Christianity.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} how {{the perception that}} separatist groups threaten <b>the</b> <b>majority’s</b> <b>moral</b> identity impacts <b>the</b> latter group’s support for reconciliation in separatist conflict. Two studies were conducted in Indonesia, where separatist conflict is rife. Javanese students (representing the nonseparatist majority) responded surveys regarding separatist conflicts in Aceh (Study 1, N = 679) or West Papua (Study 2, N = 500). As expected, perceived threat to <b>the</b> <b>majority’s</b> <b>moral</b> identity increased this particular group’s reconciliatory attitudes (Study 1), emotions, and behaviours (Study 2), through increased compensatory needs for social acceptance and restoration of moral image. These findings underline <b>the</b> importance of <b>moral</b> identity dynamics in separatist conflict. Moreover, they reveal that the majority, despite its dominant position, can experience morality threat from separatist groups which can foster positive attitudes towards the reconciliation process...|$|R

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority</b> {{became one}} of the largest {{political}} lobby groups for evangelical Christians in the United States during the 1980s. <b>The</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority</b> was promoted as being [...] "pro-life", [...] "pro-traditional family", [...] "pro-moral" [...] and [...] "pro-American" [...] and was credited with delivering two thirds of the white, evangelical Christian vote to Ronald Reagan during the 1980 presidential election. According to Jimmy Carter, [...] "that autumn [...] a group headed by Jerry Falwell purchased $10 million in commercials on southern radio and TV to brand me as a traitor to the South and no longer a Christian." [...] During his time as head of <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority,</b> Falwell consistently pushed for Republican candidates and for conservative politics. This led Billy Graham to criticize him for [...] "sermonizing" [...] about political issues that lacked a moral element, before adding, [...] "We did not always agree on everything, but I knew him to be a man of God. His accomplishments went beyond most clergy of his generation." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{foray into}} {{national}} politics {{appears to be}} a catalyst for this change; when he established <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority</b> which joined [...] "Bible Christians" [...] (Independent and conservative Southern Baptists) in a political alliance with Charismatics, Roman Catholics, Jews, Mormons and others he rejected the level of separation preached by most movement Fundamentalists. Bob Jones University declared <b>the</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>Majority</b> organization [...] "Satanic", holding that it was a step toward the apostate one-world church and government body as it would cross the line from a political alliance to a religious one between true Christians and the non-born-again, as forbidden by their interpretation of the Bible. David Cloud's Way of Life Literature also criticizes Falwell for associations with Catholics, Pentecostals and liberal Christians, tracing his alleged [...] "apostasy" [...] back to his role in the political Religious Right.|$|E
