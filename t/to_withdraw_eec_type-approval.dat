50|$|This {{means that}} even healthy banks are {{potentially}} vulnerable to panics, usually called bank runs. If a depositor expects all other depositors <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> their funds, {{then it is}} irrelevant whether the banks' long term loans {{are likely to be}} profitable; the only rational response for the depositor is to rush to take his or her deposits out before the other depositors remove theirs. In other words, the Diamond-Dybvig model views bank runs as a type of self-fulfilling prophecy: each depositor's incentive <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> funds depends on what they expect other depositors to do. If enough depositors expect other depositors <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> their funds, then they all have an incentive to rush to be the first in line <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> their funds.|$|R
