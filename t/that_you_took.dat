[...] He wrote {{that all of the}} character's subplots had emotion, even if they appeared slightly contrived. Ultimately he concluded that [...] "it felt okay to say goodbye because it was the right atmosphere." [...] James Poniewozik of Time {{wrote that the}} finale was [...] "touching, sweet, funny, messy, a little manipulative. And in the end, it worked." [...] He found that [...] "The stuff that was like latter-seasons Office", such as Andy and Dwight's antics, were [...] "all right" [...] but that [...] "the stuff that recalled the sweep of the whole series was wonderful." [...] Poniewozik was slightly critical of Pam and Jim's story, noting that {{in the grand scheme of}} the show it was successful, but that it makes slightly less sense when one examines it closely; however, he felt that even [...] "if the details don't add up, the emotions do". He concluded that the episode [...] "worked mostly as an epilogue" [...] and allowed the cast of the series to have their final moments.|$|E
