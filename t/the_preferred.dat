40|$|Several spacecrafts show an {{anomalous}} flyby. In {{a previous}} paper a non-prefered reference frame is studied moving uniformly relative to <b>the</b> <b>prefered</b> one. In this article the Doppler frequency residual is derived. <b>The</b> <b>prefered</b> reference frame {{is given by}} the isotropy of the CMB and the non-prefered one is the Earth. The resulting jump is much too small to explain the measured anomalous flybys of the different spacecrafts. Therefore, the transformations from <b>the</b> <b>prefered</b> frame to <b>the</b> non-prefered frame are replaced by the corresponding total differentials. A formula for the Doppler frequency residual is derived. It is applied to <b>the</b> <b>prefered</b> frame of <b>the</b> Earth and the non-prefered frame of the rotating Earth. The resulting Doppler residual depends on {{the direction of the}} velocity of the spacecraft and the position of the observer on the rotating Earth. It is similar to the experimental formula of Anderson et al. which is independent of the position of the observer. Comment: 7 pages, no figures, PD...|$|R
