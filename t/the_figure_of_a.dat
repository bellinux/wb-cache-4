5|$|Burial 7 was interred in a cist {{under the}} central {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). Although {{it had already been}} looted when it was {{discovered}} by archaeologists, the prior collapse of the ceiling of the summit shrine of the pyramid protected a section of the tomb from the looters. The remains were those of an adult male with an artificially deformed skull; he was laid out on his back with a north-south orientation with the head towards the north. The funerary offering included three polychrome ceramics; a tripod plate, a plate painted with <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dancer and a vessel bearing the images of human figures and a jaguar. Burial 7 was immediately above the cist of Burial 9.|$|E
5|$|East Worldham {{contains}} 10 Grade II listed buildings. St Mary's Church is of Transitional Norman {{architecture and}} is a Grade II* listed building. Notable features include triple lancet windows, a small pointed tower, three bells, and stained glass by Hardman & Co.. The chancel was restored in 1864, and in 1865, the nave was rebuilt. During the late restoration, a stone monument, like a coffin, was found under {{the floor of the}} church, which contained <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 13th-century lady. Magdalen College, Oxford is patron of the vicarage. A church school was built in 1864 upon a site donated by James Dutton, 3rd Baron Sherborne.|$|E
5|$|Stela 39 is {{a broken}} {{monument}} that was erected in the Lost World complex. The upper {{portion of the}} stela is missing but the lower portion shows the lower body and legs of Chak Tok Ich'aak, holding a flint axe in his left hand. He is trampling <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bound, richly dressed captive. The monument is dated to AD 376. The text {{on the back of}} the monument describes a bloodletting ritual to celebrate a Katun-ending. The stela also names Chak Tok Ich'aak I's father as K'inich Muwaan Jol.|$|E
50|$|Parallelism {{is another}} way to disambiguate <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> image. <b>The</b> {{orientation}} of the contours of different textures in an image can determine which objects are grouped together. Generally, parallel contours suggest membership to the same object or group of objects. Similarly, symmetry of the contours can also define <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> image.|$|R

5|$|The second {{cross is}} tall and slender, a free {{standing}} monolith pillar-cross, with a slender rounded shaft (changing to square above) and a free armed head formed by notching the shaft. It is carved with figures in traditional Welsh style. One figure in particular, which looks much like <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> saint, is inscribed low on the north face. The Cross of St Padarn is granophyre and has Celtic interlace in panels down one face. It is uncertainly dated between the ninth and eleventh century. Though not comparable with the great Irish high crosses, it shows sophisticated carving, and willingness to bring the stone from the Mawdddach estuary, Gwynedd.|$|E
5|$|The western face {{is divided}} into three sections. The {{uppermost}} section is almost completely weathered. The antiquarian Alexander Gordon, who described the stone in 1726 in his Itinerarium Septentrionale, records this panel as holding a crucifixion scene, with <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man at the right hand side and the left side completely defaced. Below this is a depiction of a centaur holding a bow, with the lowest panel having a symmetrical floral scroll design.|$|E
5|$|This story {{occurs as}} the war reaches its height. The South American Unification Army {{receives}} reports of a rogue sniper operating deep in the jungles of Patagonia, and sends a platoon {{under the command of}} Master Sergeant Murdock to neutralize the threat. However, the entire platoon is killed off one by one by the sniper, until only Murdock is left. All alone, Murdock catches a glimpse of this mysterious sniper through his binoculars—and is shocked to find that he gazes upon <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beautiful nun.|$|E

5|$|By the 5thcentury, the Romans had {{withdrawn}} from Britain, and the Angles and the Saxons settled. A heptarchy of new kingdoms began to emerge. One {{of the methods}} used by regional kings to solidify their authority over their territories {{was the use of}} ceremony and insignia. The tomb of an unknown king– evidence suggests it may be Rædwald of East Anglia– at Sutton Hoo provides insight into the regalia of a pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon king. Inside the early 7th-century tomb discovered in 1939 was found the ornate Sutton Hoo helmet, comprising an iron cap, a neck guard, and a face mask, decorated with images of animals and warriors in copper-alloy and set with garnets. He was also buried with a heavy whetstone sceptre, on top of which is an iron ring surmounted by <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stag; a decorated sword; and a ceremonial shield.|$|E
5|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura {{has explained}} that Vincent's character shifted {{from that of}} horror researcher, to detective, to chemist, and finally to <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> former Turk with a tragic past. Director Yoshinori Kitase {{was in charge of}} the cutscene in which Vincent joins the party, while scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote his backstory. Nojima had a great deal of trouble with Vincent's dialogue, as he very rarely speaks. In the original script of the game, Vincent was introduced in a similar fashion, but was a handsome, sarcastic personality. He would join Cloud's group after learning they were in pursuit of Hojo, but he had no knowledge of the results of the experimentation to which he was subjected. Additionally, he would be also privy to more information regarding Shinra's involvement with the creation of Sephiroth, and it is he who would explain to Cloud the story of Sephiroth's origins. When the game was still in development, Nomura and his staff considering removing Vincent and Yuffie Kisaragi altogether, as they did not have enough time to work them into the story properly. As a result, Vincent and Yuffie ultimately appeared as optional characters in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Cooperativa Obrera Mataronense (Mataró Workers' Cooperative) was Gaudí's {{first big}} project, {{on which he}} worked from 1878 to 1882, for Salvador Pagès i Anglada. The project, for the cooperative's head office in Mataró, {{comprised}} a factory, a worker's housing estate, a social centre and a services building, though only the factory and the services building were completed. In the factory roof Gaudí used the catenary arch {{for the first time}}, with a bolt assembly system devised by Philibert de l'Orme. He also used ceramic tile decoration {{for the first time in}} the services building. Gaudí laid out the site taking account of solar orientation, another signature of his works, and included landscaped areas. He even designed the Cooperative's banner, with <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bee, symbol of industriousness.|$|E

5|$|The book is {{illustrated}} with 82 monochrome plates and 17 maps or plans, all uncredited {{except for some}} use of Ordnance Survey maps, and so apparently the work of Hoskins himself. These are closely integrated into the text; for example, the text in chapter 1 {{is accompanied by a}} pair of diagrams showing how a holloway ('hollow way') could be formed by the digging of a 'double ditch', i.e. a pair of raised earth banks either side of a ditch to mark the boundary of two estates, and supported by a photograph (Plate 13) of a sunken lane in Devon, explained by Hoskins as a boundary, from probably the seventh century, between the Saxon estates of (royal) Silverton and Exeter Abbey. The photograph shows high hedgebanks in bright sunshine, dwarfing <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman in the middle distance.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} {{provided by}} Blake to Humphrey {{explains that the}} work depicts the resurrection. The top of the work depicts Christ on the Throne of Judgement with Heaven opened up across the painting. Behind Christ are the heads of infants which represent creation coming from Jesus. Christ is surrounded by the four Zoas and seven angels that have vials filled with God's wrath. An image of a tabernacle with a cross inside is depicted above Christ. An image of baptism is to Christ's right and the Last Supper is to Christ's left with both representing eternal life. Further to Christ's right is {{the resurrection of the}} just and to the left is the resurrection and subsequent fall of the wicked. Adam and Eve are below Christ, and Abraham and Moses are nearby. Below Moses is Satan wrapped by the Serpent and in the centre is the book of death. At the top is the book of life, and the Christian Church is <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman on top of the moon.|$|E
5|$|There are {{remnants}} {{of many of}} the items imported from and exported to the Roman empire, at Arikamedu. Imported items recovered from here include ceramics such as amphorae and sherds of Arretine ware, glass bowls, Roman lamps, a crystal gem and an object resembling a stylus. Artifacts that may have been meant for export include jewellery, worked ivory, textiles and perhaps leather or leather-related products. Similar looking ornaments have been recovered from Arikamedu and Palatine Hill in Rome, further confirming that this site was a leading trade center. The Pandyan port city Alagankulam has yielded a rouletted pottery ware that bears <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship on the shoulder portion. This figure is very similar to a finding reported from Ostia, an ancient port of the Romans. Wharf-like structures found at many port cities indicate that they might have been used as docks. Based on marine explorations of various port-sites, {{it has been suggested that}} stone anchors may have been used since as early as the 3rd century BCE.|$|E
50|$|Almost fifty {{specimens}} of daggers were found, {{and many of}} these had hilts with human <b>figures</b> built into <b>the</b> top of the sheath.

25|$|There are to {{be found}} in the {{principal}} museums of Europe many Egyptian examples: mummy cases of human beings with the face alone carved, animal mummy cases, sometimes boxes, with <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lizard, perhaps, carved in full Mummy relief standing on the lid. Sometimes the animal would be carved in the round and its hollowed body used as the case itself.|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century, {{the great}} cross {{was placed on}} a base that has no {{relation}} to it and both were put on the only stone with Norse carving, probably a gravestone. Within <b>a</b> border <b>of</b> interlace, there is <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> archer shooting an arrow at a stag. This may be a hunting scene, an incident from Viking heroic legend or a Christian symbol.|$|R
50|$|In 1866, Harper gave {{a moving}} speech before the National Women's Rights Convention, {{demanding}} {{equal rights for}} all, including Black women. During the Reconstruction Era, she worked in the South to review and report on living conditions of freedmen. This experience inspired her poems published in Sketches Of Southern Life (1872). She uses <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ex-slave, called Aunt Chloe, as a narrator in several of these.|$|R
25|$|The borough's {{coat of arms}} {{includes}} three silver mackerel, a Horn of Plenty overflowing with corn and fruit on a cloth of gold, and <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman, considered likely to be Hygieia, the ancient Greek goddess of health, holding a snake.
