5|$|The New York Times {{was criticized}} for the 13-month delay of the December 2005 story {{revealing}} the U.S. National Security Agency warrantless surveillance program. Ex-NSA officials blew the whistle on the program to journalists James Risen and Eric Lichtblau, who presented an investigative article to the newspaper in November 2004, weeks before America's presidential election.

5|$|In 1933–34 cricket {{returned}} to normality with {{the departure of}} Jardine's men. Woodfull scored 118 in a one-off match between his XI and Richardson's XI, which ended in a draw. He then scored 129 in the run-chase as The Rest of Australia narrowly defeated New South Wales by two wickets. Woodfull scored fifties in both interstate matches against New South Wales and added consecutive centuries for the national team against Tasmania before departing for his final tour of England. He ended the season with 818 runs at 62.92, returning to form after the tumult of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|E

5|$|Mills' signings for 2012–13 {{proved to}} be less {{influential}} than his signings <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer,</b> {{a number of new}} players being left out of the team with little playing time. York were in midtable for most {{of the first half of}} the season, and his signings in the winter transfer window had little impact on the team. Having been 14th in the table on 1 January 2013, York went on a run of 11 matches without a win, and this left the team four points above the relegation zone in 18th place. Mills was dismissed by York on 2 March 2013, an hour after the last of these matches, a 2–0 defeat at home to Bradford City.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 1993, Saint Joseph Academy {{high school}} senior Joey Fischer was shot dead outside his home in Rancho Viejo, an upscale {{community}} north of Brownsville, Texas. Dora Cisneros, {{the mother of his}} ex-girlfriend, was responsible for orchestrating Fischer's murder after he broke up with her daughter Cristina. Fischer and Cristina had broken up <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer,</b> but Cisneros became obsessed with their relationship and insisted that Fischer date her daughter again. After he refused a US$500 offer from Cisneros, she consulted María Mercedes Martínez, a fortune teller, to cast a spell on him.|$|E
5|$|The 1984 Summer Olympics, officially {{known as}} the Games of the XXIII Olympiad, were an {{international}} multi-sport event held in Los Angeles, California, United States, from 28 July to 12 August 1984. These Games had 6,829 athletes from 140 NOCs participating {{in a total of}} 221 events in 23 sports. Athletes from 47 NOCs won medals, of which 25 secured at least a gold medal. As a result, 93 NOCs were left without any medal. The host NOC, the United States, received 83 gold medals, breaking <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>Summer</b> Olympic record of 78 golds, set at the 1904 Summer Olympics.

5|$|Two {{years after}} his draft, Bertuzzi and the Islanders {{had not yet been}} agreed to a contract. With Bertuzzi {{eligible}} to re-enter the draft if the Islanders did not sign him by July 7, 1995, general manager Don Maloney made it apparent that he would use the team's second overall pick in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft to select him again if a contract could not be agreed upon by the required date. Moments before the midnight deadline, the Islanders were able to sign Bertuzzi to a four-year, US$4.6 million contract. His agent, Pat Morris, had reportedly wanted a similar deal to that of fellow Islanders prospect Brett Lindros – a five-year, $6.7 million contract signed <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Driberg {{had risen}} to {{responsible}} positions within the school (deputy head boy, head librarian, and chief sacristan, among others), his Lancing career ended suddenly {{in the autumn of}} 1923, when two boys complained about his sexual overtures. To avoid distressing the widowed Amy Driberg (John Driberg had died in 1919), the headmaster allowed him to remain in the school {{for the remainder of the}} term, stripped of his offices and segregated from all social contact with other boys. At the end of the term he was required to leave, on the pretext that he needed private tuition to pass his Oxford entrance examination which he had failed <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer.</b> Back in Crowborough, after several months' hard application under the guidance of his tutor, the future Lord Justice Pearson, Driberg won a classics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Following the relegation, Taylor became Director of Football, {{with former}} Watford midfielder Kenny Jackett as manager. After a mid-table finish in Division Two in 1996–97, Jackett was demoted to the {{position}} of assistant manager. Taylor returned as manager, and won the Second Division title in 1997–98 – Watford's second league title under his management. A second successive promotion followed in 1998–99, thanks to a 2–0 play-off final victory over Bolton Wanderers. Watford's first Premiership season started with an early victory over Liverpool, but Watford's form soon faded, and the club was relegated after finishing bottom. Graham Taylor retired {{at the end of the}} 2000–01 season, and was replaced by Gianluca Vialli. Wage bills at the club rose by £4million during Vialli's tenure, and the club finished 14th in the division in 2001–02. Vialli was sacked at the end of the season, following a dispute with the club's board over the wage bill. He was replaced by Ray Lewington, who had joined the club <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer</b> as Vialli's reserve team manager.|$|E

5|$|In January 1858, Stone {{staged a}} highly publicized protest that took the issue of {{taxation}} without representation across the nation. <b>The</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer</b> she and Blackwell had purchased a house in Orange, New Jersey, and when the first tax bill came, Stone returned it unpaid with the explanation that taxing women while denying {{them the right to}} vote was a violation of America’s founding principles. On January 22, 1858, the city auctioned some of her household goods to pay the tax and attendant court costs. The following month, Stone and Blackwell spoke on taxation without representation before two large meetings in Orange, and circulated petitions asking the New Jersey legislature for woman suffrage. Stone’s protest inspired other tax-paying women to action: some followed her example and refused to pay taxes, with one case reaching the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863, while others went to the polls to demand their right as tax-payers to vote.|$|E
5|$|In January 2002, {{chairman}} Doug Ellis {{once again}} appointed Graham Taylor as manager. Villa finished the 200102 season in eighth place, which {{was similar to}} most of their other Premiership finishes. Taylor quit as manager {{for the second time}} {{after the end of the}} 200203 season. Villa had just finished 16th in the Premiership, losing twice to arch rivals Birmingham City. David O'Leary, who had taken Leeds United to the semi-finals of the 200001 Champions League, was brought in as Taylor's replacement. O'Leary took the team to sixth in the table, with a 20 home defeat against Manchester United on the final day meaning that they narrowly missed out on a UEFA Cup place. In 200506, Villa slowly fell down the table and finished in 16th place. The poor placing came despite O'Leary having spent more than £13million <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer</b> on players such as Milan Baroš, Kevin Phillips and Wilfred Bouma.|$|E
5|$|In July 1945 {{was sent}} to the Far East. A group was created which was a {{collection}} of RAF forces that were to be used to recover Singapore from the Japanese. Cunningham and Rawnsley flew out to Rangoon via Malta, Cairo, Baghdad and Karachi. Soon after they arrived they learned of the atomic attacks against Japan. On 2 September 1945, Japan surrendered and the Second World War was over. Cunningham was offered a permanent commission in the RAF but he feared his career, if he stayed, would become mired in administration, policy-making staff courses and committees. It would mean flying would become a secondary occupation. He decided to return to de Havilland. The company had asked the RAF to release him <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer</b> but had been refused. He was formally de-mobilised in November 1945 and re-joined de Havilland on 1 December.|$|E

50|$|During {{the season}} 2001/2002 the team simply {{continued}} its impressive performances of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> two campaigns. <b>The</b> squad had experienced radical changes during <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summers</b> and Spanish players started covering most places. In 2001 the only spectacular transfer {{was the one}} of midfielder Sergio who cost the club a small fortune (almost €18 million). Other additions, like Djorovic, Amavisca and Héctor, only indicated that the squad already was competent enough to approach the new campaign.|$|R

5|$|On this occasion, both President Tarja Halonen, and the Prime Minister {{said that}} a review was necessary, with Vanhanen {{suggesting}} that {{the time had come}} to question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns, in particular automatic pistols (the kind used by Saari being a semi-automatic). He argued that Finland would only be bringing its laws into closer alignment with gun regulations the EU had set <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer.</b> Halonen and Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb said that the government would discuss a divergence in policy between gun control for hunting rifles and handguns. Hunting remains a highly popular sport in Finland, and the Finnish Shooting Sport Federation executive director Risto Aarrekivi said that if people wanted to commit a crime such as this, they would gain access to a handgun regardless of the law. However, he did concede that allowing beginners to buy real firearms as their first guns should be reconsidered.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the defeat}} {{ultimately}} fell on Alcibiades, and his enemies used {{the opportunity to}} attack him and have him removed from command, although some modern scholars believe that Alcibiades was unfairly blamed for Antiochus's mistake. Diodorus reports that, {{in addition to his}} mistake at Notium, Alcibiades was discharged on account of false accusations brought against him by his enemies. According to Anthony Andrewes, professor of ancient history, the extravagant hopes that his successes of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer</b> had created were a decisive element in his downfall. Consequently, Alcibiades condemned himself to exile. Never again returning to Athens, he sailed north to the castles in the Thracian Chersonese, which he had secured during his time in the Hellespont. The implications of the defeat were severe for Athens. Although the defeat had been minor, it occasioned the removal of not only Alcibiades but also his allies like Thrasybulus, Theramenes and Critias. These were likely the most capable commanders Athens had at the time, and their removal would help lead to the Athenian surrender only two years later, after their complete defeat at Aegospotami.|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of seven species of microcrustacea (3 Ostracoda, 2 Cladocera, and 2 Copepoda) was recorded from 30 small experimental pools {{in late winter}} and early summer throughout 1995 - 1998. All ponds were created in autumn 1994 and were the same size, shape, and age, distributed over a freshwater wetland in Northumberland, UK. The length of time during which each pond dried out in summer or linked to other ponds during floods was recorded. Logistic regression {{was used to test}} the hypotheses that summer dry phase and flood linkage provided significant explanation for {{the presence or absence of}} each species throughout the ponds. Late winter incidence was regressed against the length of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer's</b> dry phase and the length of time each pond was linked to other ponds by subsequent re-flooding. Summer incidence was regressed against the length of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer's</b> dry phase, length of time linked by subsequent re-flooding, macrophyte density, and incidence at the preceding late winter sample. Individual ponds were also identified as separate factors in regressions to quantify the effect of repeat-measures from the same ponds. For January samples, <b>the</b> length of <b>previous</b> <b>summer</b> dry phase was a significant predictor of incidence for four species, and linkage was significant for one species. In <b>summer,</b> <b>the</b> length of <b>previous</b> <b>summer</b> dry phase was a significant predictor of incidence for four species, linkage was significant for three species, and macrophyte density was significant for four species. In summer, two species showed significant relationships with specific ponds. The relationship between length of dry period and subsequent presence varied, and was negative or positive for different species. The results suggest that variation of a few major systematic environmental factors, such as dry phase, explains species presence and absence, but that individual species vary in response and that factors contingent on individual pond characteristics also affect distribution...|$|R

40|$|By definition, ice which survives {{the summer}} is {{classified}} as multiyear ice. Thus, multiyear ice concentration during the winter should be nearly equivalent to the ice concentration during <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer's</b> minima.

From SSM/I data, the NASA Team algorithm estimates the multiyear, first-year and total ice concentrations throughout the sea ice season using combinations of the polarization and spectral gradient ratios...|$|R
5|$|The 1924–25 season marked Nelson's {{return to}} the Football League Third Division North {{following}} their relegation from the Second Division {{at the end of}} the previous campaign. It was the club's fourth season in the Football League, having previously competed in the Central League. Former Scotland international defender David Wilson retired from his player-manager role in the summer of 1924 in order to take up the managerial post full-time. Thomas Jacques, who had played for Nelson during their inaugural season in the Football League, was hired as the assistant coach and groundsman. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer,</b> when Nelson had embarked on a pre-season tour of Spain, the team did not play any friendly matches during the build-up to the campaign. The club strip remained unchanged from the previous season; a blue jersey, white shorts and black socks with white and blue trim.|$|E
5|$|The Bal des Ardents (Ball of the Burning Men) or Bal des Sauvages (Ball of the Wild Men) was a {{masquerade}} ball held on 28January 1393 in Paris {{at which}} Charles VI of France {{performed in a}} dance with {{five members of the}} French nobility. Four of the dancers were killed in a fire caused by a torch brought in by a spectator, Charles's brother Louis, Duke of Orléans. Charles and another of the dancers survived. The ball was {{one of a number of}} events intended to entertain the young king, who <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer</b> had suffered an attack of insanity. The event undermined confidence in Charles's capacity to rule; Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility. The public's outrage forced the King and his brother Orléans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted regicide and sorcery, to offer penance for the event.|$|E
5|$|The British Admiralty's {{official}} report {{into the}} disaster condemned the defences at Scapa Flow, and censured Sir Wilfred French, Admiral Commanding Orkney and Shetland, for their unprepared state. French {{was placed on}} the retired list, despite having warned <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer</b> of Scapa Flow's deficient anti-submarine defences, and volunteering to bring a small ship or submarine himself past the blockships to prove his point. On Churchill's orders, the eastern approaches to Scapa Flow were sealed with concrete causeways linking Lamb Holm, Glimps Holm, Burray and South Ronaldsay to Mainland. Constructed largely by Italian prisoners of war, the Churchill Barriers, as they became known, were essentially complete by September 1944, though they were not opened officially until just after VE Day in May 1945. They now form part of the transport infrastructure of Orkney, carrying the A961 road between the islands.|$|E
25|$|Parts of Canada, mostly {{areas of}} provinces located {{close to the}} U.S. border (Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec) had been {{affected}} in waves by the persistent heat over the continent building from west to east {{during the month of}} July, which progressed into August 2006. Persistent heat and drought had plagued some of the same regions of the country during <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summers</b> of 2002, 2003, and 2005, although large, frequent storms brought above normal rainfall to many areas in Ontario and Quebec during those years.|$|R
25|$|Soon {{afterward}} John Hersey began {{discussions with}} William Shawn, an editor for The New Yorker, about a lengthy piece about <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>summer's</b> bombing.

The next May, 1946, Hersey traveled to Japan, where he spent three weeks doing research and interviewing survivors.
