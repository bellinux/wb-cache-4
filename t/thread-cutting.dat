5000|$|On 18th century {{innovation}} in lathe {{was the use}} of a [...] "master screw" [...] in the <b>thread-cutting</b> machine, which seems to have been of French origin.

These threads were on short sections of the arbor and by its use the different pitches required could be cut. While the exact manner of using this arbor was not described, its probable method of use will readily suggest itself to the mechanic, and was, no doubt, used at an earlier period, and in fact was what led up to the use of a lead screw or arbor with a multiplicity of different pitches.

The main and added conditions to synthesize the drives of spindles have been ascertained and have been formed. The functional dependences, which allow to control over the dynamic characteristics of drive of carriage with the use of worm gears, have been brought out by the purposeful choice of dimensions. The obtained methods have been used during the design of rotor to cut the internal and exterior threads, during the design of dynamic loads in the drive mambers of carriage of LNKV- 200 rotor conveyer line.

40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} {{in order to determine}} the effect of surface decarburization on the notch sensitivity and rate of fatigue crack propagation in 12 MoV stainless-steel sheet at room temperature. Three specimen configurations were utilized in the course of the investigation: standard tensile specimen, 9 -inch-wide specimens containing fatigue cracks or <b>thread-cut</b> notches of 0. 005 -inch radius, and 2 -inch-wide specimens containing fatigue cracks. The 12 MoV stainless-steel sheet in the normal condition was found to have an ultimate tensile strength of 251 ksi and to be extremely notch sensitive. The material in the decarburized condition was found to have an ultimate tensile strength of 210 ksi and to be considerably stronger than the normal material in the presence of fatigue cracks. Decarburization did not appear to have any significant influence on the rate of fatigue crack propagation in the 2 -inch-wide specimens at the stress levels considered. In addition to the tests, two methods for predicting residual static strength and their application to the material are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{model of}} the threading tool hardening on high-speed plasma heating has been presented {{as well as the}} mathematical description of the heating process. The reproduction of the model by means of computer simulation, based {{on the use of the}} finite elements method, including structural and physical parameters of the tool has been offered. The heat distribution in the heat-affected zone, and the relationship that makes it possible to determine the temperature at any point of the body, bringing the simulation results closer to the actual physical characteristics of the process have been shown. The analysis conducted in this article shows the prospects of using surface hardening methods to improve performance of <b>thread-cutting</b> tools. However, due to the complex profile of the working surface of the tools, application of any hardening method involves difficulties. On the strength of the above-said, with due regard to the established requirements for geometrical parameters of the <b>thread-cutting</b> tools and their loading conditions, as well as well-known recommendations for other types of tools, the technological processes for plasma processing of various types of <b>thread-cutting</b> tools have been developed. In developing the technology of plasma modification it is very important to select the optimum mode of heating, which ensures the formation of the modified zones of required size. This problem is solved by means of the analysis of thermal fields in the tool during plasma heating. The experience of using plasma hardening shows that the thermal cycle of heating and cooling materials can be controlled by varying such parameters as arc current and the speed of the plasma torch movement at a constant optimum level of the other parameters (plasma gas flow and the cooling water, the distance of the nozzle exit to the surface being machined...|$|E

The work purpose - {{development of a}} technique of definition of torques and forces of cutting at a threading of external threads by <b>thread-cutting</b> heads. It is shown that the total torque at a threading grooves consists of the moment of cutting and the moment of a friction of teeths on a calibrating part of combs. According to it the technique of determination of forces of cutting depending on a step of a cut carving, lengths of an intaking cone of combs, quantities of cutting and calibrating teeths is offered.

Although some specialist predatory mites have developed morphological protection to reduce the adverse effects of complex webs, little is known about their behavioral abilities to cope with the webs. In this study, we compared <b>thread-cutting</b> behavior of three specialist predatory mites, Phytoseiulus persimilis, Neoseiulus womersleyi and N. californicus, exhibited inside the complex web of T. urticae. No major difference was observed among them in the basic pattern of this behavior, using chelicerae and palps, and in the number of silken threads severed while moving inside the web.

40|$|The report {{deals with}} the subject of tapping and thread-forming {{operations}} performed, without auxiliary media, with compressed air {{as well as with}} minimum quantity lubrication, in the steel material X 90 CrMoV 18, 100 Cr 6 {{as well as in the}} aluminium alloy AlSi 9 Cu 3. A basic problem is the material build-up on the tools. The aluminium alloy can only be machined using minimum quantity lubrication. This type of lubrication is recommended for steel materials. Although these steel materials can be machined without auxiliary media or with compressed air, the result is moderate tool life periods and limited process efficiency. Geometry inspections performed on the <b>thread-cutting</b> tools show that large rake angles provide good chip flow and, as a result, reduced material build-up. In this respect TiN and TiCN coatings are superior to TiAlN coatings. (orig.)

40|$|Predatory mites, {{that are}} {{important}} natural enemies of Tetranychus spider mites, are less hindered by complex webs of the spider mites than are other predatory mites that are natural enemies of other pest herbivores. This can be partly explained by their chaetotaxy, a morphological protection against the webs. However, it has up to now been unclear whether the ability to penetrate complex webs {{is related to the}} ability of <b>thread-cutting</b> behavior to reduce the effects of the webs. The two predatory mites Neo-seiulus cucumeris and Typhlodromus vulgaris, that are natural enemies of other pest herbivores, were often entrapped by the sticky silken threads while moving within the complex web produced by the two-spotted spider mites Tetranychus urticae. Once captured, their movements and foraging activities were hindered until their escape from entrapment. In contrast, N. womersleyi and Phytoseiulus persimilis, {{that are important}} natural enemies of Tetranychus mites, were significantly less frequently entrapped by the web and for shorter periods. Furthermore, N. womersleyi and P. persimilis cut significantly more silken threads within the web than did N. cucumeris and T. vulgaris. The different behavioral activities exhibited by N. cucumeris and N. womersleyi could not be explained by their rearing conditions (i. e., past experience with complex webs). These results supported the hypothesis and might offer an ecological indicator for distinguishing potential important natural enemies of Tetranychus mites from less useful types.

30|$|Primary and {{auxiliary}} boxes. As {{shown in}} Fig.  2 a, the primary box {{is used to}} contain the experimental coal sample. The walls of the box body are 40 -mm-thick steel plate welded into a tight complete structure, with a cover plate thickness of 60  mm, and the design pressure is 6  MPa. The primary box’s length, width and height are 1600, 1200 and 1200  mm, respectively. The maximum experimental coal sample mass is about 1200  kg. The front and rear surfaces of the main box body contain 24 holes with different height distributions in three layers; 23 of these have a 14  mm diameter for conveying sensor cables and the remaining holes with 12  mm diameters are standard screw drills for gas injection. A special high-pressure hose {{is connected to the}} external side, and the hole’s internal side is connected with a cribriform ventilation device {{at the bottom of the}} primary box (Fig.  2 b). The cribriform ventilation device is designed as a cribriform pectinate strip. The height of the pectinate strip is 20  mm, and the upper surface of the strip contains well-distributed ventilation holes. In this way, plane-charging can be fulfilled to simulate natural gas sources. A <b>thread-cutting</b> coal drill pipe exists inside the box body, which is used to simulate the mining work face. Two auxiliary boxes are located on both sides of the primary box, where the coal cutting power transmission shaft is located. The side boxes are also used as a container for drilled coal. Two strip holes lie on both sides of the overlap of the primary and the auxiliary boxes, which provides a moving pathway for the coal drill pipe. To observe the coal drill pipe movement, a window is set at the sealing cover of one of the auxiliary boxes.|$|E
