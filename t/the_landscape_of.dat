5|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st century, <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> large {{leveraged}} buyout firms was changing. Several large and storied firms, including Hicks Muse Tate & Furst and Forstmann Little & Company were dragged down by heavy losses in the bursting of the telecom bubble. Although, KKR's track record since RJR Nabisco was mixed, losses on such investments as Regal Entertainment Group, Spalding, Flagstar and Primedia (previously K-III Communications) were offset by successes in Willis Group, Wise Foods, Inc., Wincor Nixdorf and MTU Aero Engines, among others.|$|E

In conclusion, the attributes of forest, hilly landform and architectural heritage have significant scenic value.

5|$|In England, motte-and-bailey {{earthworks}} {{were put}} to various uses over later years; in some cases, mottes were turned into garden features in the 18th century, or reused as military defences during the Second World War. Today, almost no mottes of motte-and-bailey castles remain in regular use in Europe, {{with one of the}} few exceptions being that at Windsor Castle, converted for the storage of royal documents. <b>The</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> northern Europe remains scattered with their earthworks, and many form popular tourist attractions as part of the European heritage industry.|$|E

5|$|The Rhondda Valley {{is located}} in the upland, or Blaenau, area of Glamorgan. <b>The</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> the Rhondda was formed by glacial action during the last ice age, as slow moving glaciers gouged out the deep valleys that exist today. With the retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000BC, the valleys were further {{modified}} by stream and river action. This left the two river valleys of the Rhondda with narrow, steep sided slopes which would dictate the layout of settlements from early to modern times.|$|E

5|$|In {{modern times}} the witches {{have become the}} {{inspiration}} for Pendle's tourism and heritage industries, with local shops selling a variety of witch-motif gifts. Burnley's Moorhouse's produces a beer called Pendle Witches Brew, {{and there is a}} Pendle Witch Trail running from Pendle Heritage Centre to Lancaster Castle, where the accused witches were held before their trial. The X43 bus route run by Burnley Bus Company has been branded The Witch Way, with some of the vehicles operating on it named after the witches in the trial. Pendle Hill, which dominates <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> the area, continues to be associated with witchcraft, and hosts a hilltop gathering every Halloween.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} times, massive ice sheets {{at least one}} {{kilometer}} thick ravaged <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> the state and sculpted its terrain. The Wisconsin glaciation left 12,000 years ago. These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the bedrock. This area {{is known as the}} Driftless Zone for its absence of glacial drift. Much of the remainder of the state outside the northeast has 50feet (15m) or more of glacial till left behind as the last glaciers retreated. Gigantic Lake Agassiz formed in the northwest 13,000 years ago. Its bed created the fertile Red River valley, and its outflow, glacial River Warren, carved the valley of the Minnesota River and the Upper Mississippi downstream from Fort Snelling. Minnesota is geologically quiet today; it experiences earthquakes infrequently, {{and most of them are}} minor.|$|E
5|$|Most of her {{commissions}} {{were carried}} out during the 12 years or so {{between the end of}} the First World War and the start of the Great Depression. She took on several major projects, including designing <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> the University of Delaware campus in 1919 at the recommendation of Sharp, who chaired the college's Buildings and Grounds Committee. From 1918 to 1952, Coffin was appointed the University of Delaware’s landscape architect, a position which required Coffin to unite the university’s two separate campuses (the former Delaware College to the north and the Delaware Women’s College to the south) into one cohesive design. This was a challenge since the linear mall design of each was out of alignment with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them via a circle instead of curving the straight paths (the university’s library faces this circle today) which rendered the misalignment unnoticeable to the pedestrian.|$|E

5|$|No traces {{have yet}} {{been found in}} Scotland of either a Neanderthal {{presence}} or of Homo sapiens during the Pleistocene interglacials. The first indications of humans occur only after the ice retreated in the 11th millennium BC and the current Flandrian interglacial began. Since that time <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> Orkney has been altered by both human and natural forces. Initially, sea levels were lower than at present due to the large volume of ice that remained. This meant that the Orkney islands may have been attached to the mainland, as was the present-day island of Great Britain to Continental Europe. Much of the North Sea basin was also dry land until after 4000 BC. This would have made travel to northern Scotland relatively easy for early human settlers. The subsequent isostatic rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task.|$|E

Since that time <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>of</b> Scotland has been altered dramatically by both human and natural forces. Initially, sea levels were lower than at present due to the large volume of ice that remained. This meant that the Orkney archipelago {{and many of the}} Inner Hebridean islands were attached to the mainland, as was the present-day island of Great Britain to Continental Europe. Much of the present-day North Sea was also dry land until after 4000 BC. Dogger Bank, for example was part of a large peninsula connected to the European continent. This would have made travel to western and northern Scotland relatively easy for early human settlers. The subsequent isostatic rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task and there are numerous raised beaches around Scotland's coastline.|$|E
