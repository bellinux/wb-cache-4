40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{recognition of the}} need for mental health consumers to be fully involved in mental health research; however, there is limited knowledge about mental health consumers 2 ̆ 7 experiences as researchers. This knowledge is important if genuine research partnerships with consumers are to be successfully developed. The research presented here aimed to use accounts by consumers of mental health services to develop an understanding of the experiential and psychological processes of consumers becoming researchers. To achieve this, two qualitative studies were conducted. The first study explored <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a consumer <b>of</b> mental health services, through a series of focus groups and interviews. Study 2 consisted of an exploration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> for mental health consumers, new to research, in becoming evaluation researchers. The themes resulting from an interpretative phenomenological analysis of consumers 2 ̆ 7 accounts in the two studies provide a rich and wholistic view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a consumer <b>of</b> mental health services, and their <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> becoming researchers. <b>The</b> results demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> becoming a researcher was complex, with challenges, benefits, personal change and a range of emotional reactions.
