50|$|The 1870 Bashforth <b>tables</b> were <b>to</b> 2800 ft/s. Mayevski, {{using his}} tables, {{supplemented}} by the Bashforth <b>tables</b> (<b>to</b> 6 restricted zones) and the Krupp tables. Mayevski conceived a 7th restricted zone and extended the Bashforth <b>tables</b> <b>to</b> 1100 m/s. Mayevski converted Bashforth's data from Imperial units of measure to metric units of measure (now in SI units of measure). In 1884, James Ingalls published his {{tables in the}} U.S. Army Artillery Circular M using the Mayevski tables. Ingalls extended Mayevski's ballistics <b>tables</b> <b>to</b> 5000 ft/s within an 8th restricted zone, but still with the same n value (1.55) as Mayevski's 7th restricted zone. Ingalls, converted Mayevski's results back to Imperial units. The British Royal Artillery results were {{very similar to those}} of Mayevski's and extended their <b>tables</b> <b>to</b> 5000 ft/s within the 8th restricted zone changing the n value from 1.55 to 1.67. These ballistic tables were published in 1909 and almost identical to those of Ingalls. In 1971 the Sierra Bullet company calculated their ballistic <b>tables</b> <b>to</b> 9 restricted zones but only within 4400 ft/s.|$|R
5|$|Although {{precursors}} to {{this table}} exist, its invention is generally credited to Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869.

5|$|At {{one point}} a {{proposal}} {{was on the}} <b>table</b> <b>to</b> protect the uranium in a reactor from corrosion by jacketing it with copper. The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where the uranium met the copper jacket. In practice, the uranium was canned in aluminum; this too was studied, as were alloys with tin, which was used to solder the cans. Tests were also carried out with alloys of uranium with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from uranium through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a chemical separation method, instead.|$|E
5|$|Central Coast Mariners Football Club is an Australian {{professional}} soccer club {{based in}} Gosford, on the Central Coast of New South Wales.

It was the first professional sports club from the Gosford region to compete in a national competition. Despite being considered one of the smallest-market clubs in the league, Central Coast Mariners has claimed one A-League Championship from four Grand Final appearances and topped the <b>table</b> <b>to</b> win the A-League Premiership twice.

5|$|Lasers did {{not exist}} in 1959 when the book was written, nor did {{high-power}} industrial lasers at the time the film was made, making them a novelty. In the novel, Goldfinger uses a circular saw to try to kill Bond, but the filmmakers changed it to a laser to make the film feel fresher. Hamilton immediately thought of giving the laser a place in the film's story as Goldfinger's weapon of choice. Ken Adam was advised on the laser's design by two Harvard scientists who helped design the water reactor in Dr No. The laser beam itself was an optical effect added in post-production. For close-ups where the flame cuts through metal, technician Bert Luxford heated the metal with a blowtorch from underneath the <b>table</b> <b>to</b> which Bond was strapped.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} known of these tells of a {{stranger}} who arrived at the club on a stormy night. Invited in, he joined the members in a card game. One player dropped his card on the floor and when he bent under the <b>table</b> <b>to</b> retrieve it noticed that the stranger had a cloven hoof. At this point the visitor disappeared in a ball of flame. This story, which is found in texts from at least the 1930s, is very similar to one associated with Loftus Hall, County Wexford. The Loftus family owned a hunting lodge – known as Dolly Mount – which was also to be found on Mount Pelier Hill.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium is an {{actinide}} {{which is}} positioned in the periodic <b>table</b> <b>to</b> {{the left of}} uranium {{and to the right}} of thorium, and many of its physical properties are intermediate between those two actinides. So, protactinium is more dense and rigid than thorium but is lighter than uranium, and its melting point is lower than that of thorium and higher than that of uranium. The thermal expansion, electrical and thermal conductivities of these three elements are comparable and are typical of post-transition metals. The estimated shear modulus of protactinium {{is similar to that of}} titanium. Protactinium is a metal with silvery-gray luster that is preserved for some time in air. Protactinium easily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and acids, but not with alkalis.|$|E
