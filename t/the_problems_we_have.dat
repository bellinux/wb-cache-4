5000|$|In 1990, {{after the}} {{dismantling}} of his country's communist government, Czechoslovakia's conservative finance minister, Václav Klaus, declared, [...] "We want a market economy without any adjectives.

We had our experience with this in the 1960s when we looked for a socialism with a human face.

The market is indivisible; it cannot be an instrument in the hands of central planners." [...] However, {{it should be noted that}} in historical context, the [...] "third way" [...] proposals of 1960s Czechoslovakia were better described as [...] "liberalized centrally-planned socialism" [...] rather than the [...] "socially-sensitive capitalism" [...] that Third Way policies tend to have been identified with in the West.|$|E
5000|$|... "Qahera", the {{feminine}} version of [...] "qaher", means conqueror, vanquisher, or triumphant; القاهرة (al-Qāhirah  or al-Qahera) is the Arabic {{for the city}} Cairo itself, where the story takes place. Mohamed named the character as such because of its powerful meanings and because of its direct reference to Egypt. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Mohamed said that the name struck her very fitting [...] "because it has so many powerful meanings: vanquisher, destroyer, omnipotent. It's a great name for a superhero, honestly, especially one who faces as many challenges as she does." [...] Mohamed was inspired to start creating Qahera out of frustration with misogyny, but stated that one [...] "can't critique Egyptian society without someone else trying to co-opt it and claiming they want to save you, or that {{you live in a}} backwards society." [...] Mohamed described the character Qahera as [...] "someone who was willing to take a stand against both <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> and people who try to impose their own views onto us."

5000|$|Groundbreaking {{took place}} in August 2002. Aliante celebrated its {{official}} grand opening on May 3, 2003. At that time, Kilduff estimated that the community would take approximately five years to be entirely built out, contingent on demand. Kilduff also believed that Aliante could rival the nearby Summerlin master-planned community. Aliante's first phase consisted of approximately 1,750 single-family detached homes, ranging from the mid-$100,000s to the upper-$200,000s. By the time of opening, the BLM was planning to auction the remaining 5595 acre {{over the next several}} years. Montandon said that Aliante's large number of expensive homes would help retain residents once they become financially successful, saying, [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> is that people move out of North Las Vegas when they have a little success." [...] Montandon also said that for the first few years, Aliante would likely cost more money than it could generate in taxes: [...] "Rooftops are a drain on resources, police, fire and parks. But then come the restaurants and grocery stores." [...] At that time, it was expected that Aliante's casino would not be built for years. Construction began on Aliante's first commercial office building in September 2004, with a scheduled completion date {{in the second quarter of}} 2005. At that time, Aliante's first shopping center, anchored by a Smith's grocery store, was set to finish construction by fall 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{proton therapy}} has been expensive. Goitein & Jermann's {{analysis}} had previously determined the relative cost of proton therapy is approximately 2.4 {{times that of}} X-ray therapies. However, newer, more compact proton beam sources can be {{four to five times}} cheaper and offer more accurate three-dimensional targeting. Thus the cost is expected to reduce as better proton technology becomes more widely available. A similar analysis by Lievens & Van den Bogaert determined that the cost of proton therapy is not unrealistic and should not be the reason for denying patients access to this technology. In some clinical situations, proton beam therapy is clearly superior to the alternatives. Another study in 2007 expressed concerns about the effectiveness of proton therapy for treating prostate cancer. Although, with the advent of new developments in proton beam technology, such as improved scanning techniques and more precise dose delivery ('pencil beam scanning'), this situation may change considerably. Amitabh Chandra, a health economist at Harvard University, has been quoted as saying that [...] "Proton-beam therapy is like the death star of American medical technology... It's a metaphor for all <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> in American medicine.” However, another study has shown that proton therapy in fact brings cost savings. The advent of second generation, and much less expensive, proton therapy equipment now being installed at various sites may change this picture significantly.|$|E
