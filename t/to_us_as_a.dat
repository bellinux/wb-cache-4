This universal Celtic concept comes down <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mere echo of its ancient self through centuries of the Christianization of Ireland.

500|$|The {{harm done}} by Formosa lies in this,— that the {{character}} is utterly false, false to human nature and false to London life. She is a wretch, abominable almost beyond conception, {{so as to be}} odious, if known, to the most odious. She is sharper as well as prostitute,—and is false to all with whom she comes in contact, to those whom she is supposed to love and to those who love her. Her peculiar profession is represented as causing her no personal remorse. And yet she is exhibited <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fine creature, a noble woman, one whom a man might be honoured by loving;—and at last she ends with a success! ... That which is vile and dirty, squalid and miserable,—that, of which we may say that were its horrors known such knowledge would deter more thoroughly than any ignorance,—is exhibited as a bright existence, full of danger indeed, but still open to all that is noble, and capable of final success.|$|E
500|$|Bono is {{credited}} as the album's sole lyricist. Thematically, the album juxtaposes antipathy towards the United States against the band's deep {{fascination with the}} country, its open spaces, freedoms, and ideals. Anger is directed particularly at the perceived greed of the Ronald Reagan administration and its foreign policy in Central America. Bono said, [...] "I started to see two Americas, the mythic America and the real America", hence the album's working title, The Two Americas. Having toured the US extensively in the past, the group were inspired by the country's geography. As such, the desert, rain, dust, and water appear as lyrical motifs throughout the record. In many cases, the desert {{is used as a}} metaphor for [...] "spiritual drought". One track that chiefly represents these themes is [...] "In God's Country", which critic Barbara Jaeger interpreted as addressing America's role as the [...] "promised land". Clayton explained the impact of the desert imagery: [...] "The desert was immensely inspirational <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mental image for this record. Most people would take the desert on face value and think it's some kind of barren place, which of course is true. But in the right frame of mind, it's also a very positive image, because you can actually do something with blank canvas, which is effectively what the desert is." ...|$|E

This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for [...] "liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art." [...] The medal was presented by Sir Hedley Atkins, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: [...] "Sir Victor Negus {{is perhaps the most}} distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member. He has always been known <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> great research worker and scientist, whose labours earned him the Lister Medal, a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense." [...] Atkins also paid tribute to Negus's wife, Lady Negus, who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat-of-arms. Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: [...] "I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and I feel I can now sit back and leave it to others to carry on. I {{would also like to thank}} you for inviting my wife to be here to-day; she has taken a great part in all I have done." ...|$|E

It is also perhaps a different union from that which the dove has with the Holy Spirit, and the flame with the angel, but it is also assuredly a sacramental union.|$|E

Rundstedt refused to go, because, he said, he hated listening to Hitler's monologues. This marked his effective abdication {{as a military}} leader: he was now only a figurehead, and apparently content to be so. After the war he disowned all responsibility for the offensive: [...] "If old von Moltke thought that I had planned that offensive he would have turned over in his grave." [...] Hitler arrived {{on the western front}} on 10 December to supervise the offensive, which was now set for 16 December. He gave orders directly to the army commanders, bypassing both Rundstedt and Model.

Something unique, both to the world and <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> band. We decided that If Not Now, When?, our seventh full length studio album, would be just that." [...] Prior to the album's release, bassist Ben Kenney discussed the writing process in relation to fan expectations, stating [...] "from my perspective, we only write music to satisfy ourselves. We love to play and we’ve been fortunate to have people follow us and have really great and successful records. But, for the most part it’s to entertain each other and write music that we like to play." [...] Discussing the band's stylistic change, Kenney noted, [...] "There’s no way we could have written this record a few years ago." ...|$|E

[...] Expectations were higher in 1964 with Michigan returning most of its starters from the 1963 season, including starting quarterback (Bob Timberlake), leading rusher (Mel Anthony), leading receiver (John Henderson), and leading kick returner (Jack Clancy). [...] When some reporters wrote that Michigan should win the Big Ten championship or finish {{in the top five}} nationally in 1964, head coach Bump Elliott sought to manage expectations. [...] Elliott stated:"Some people think we'll be a real good football team but I'll say that's not realistic at this time[...] [...] [...] I'm not saying there isn't reason for us to be highly optimistic. [...] We have 20 of our top 33 players back, and we'll have a veteran in every spot, two deep in some.
