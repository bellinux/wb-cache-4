25|$|Scientists have drilled {{only about}} 1.5km into the 6- to 7-kilometer-thick oceanic crust, so their {{understanding}} of oceanic crust comes largely from comparing ophiolite structure to seismic soundings of in situ oceanic crust. Oceanic crust has a layered velocity structure that implies a layered rock series similar to that listed above. In detail <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>with</b> many ophiolites exhibiting thinner accumulations of igneous rock than are inferred for oceanic crust. Another problem relating oceanic crust and ophiolites is that the thick gabbro layer of ophiolites calls for large magma chambers beneath mid-ocean ridges. Seismic sounding of mid-ocean ridges has revealed only a few magma chambers beneath ridges, and these are quite thin. A few deep drill holes into oceanic crust have intercepted gabbro, {{but it is not}} layered like ophiolite gabbro.|$|E
25|$|Many {{dictionaries}} {{suggest that}} the word chocolate comes from the Nahuatl chocolatl, based on an evolution from -tl to -te, however, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> this hypothesis. Firstly Coe argued that the word chocolatl {{does not appear in}} the Aztec cultural writings of the time. Similarly the word is not found in the work of Alonso de Molina, a lexicographer of the time, who wrote a book about the grammar of the Aztec language in 1555. It is also absent from Bernardino de Sahagún's encyclopedia and from the Huehuetlatolli ("The words of the ancients") a guide to moral conduct. In all these works the word cacahuatl (cocoa water) is used. In his periodic letters, Hernán Cortés refers to 'cocoa.' At an indeterminate time in the 16th century, the Spanish of New Spain began to use the word chocolatl.|$|E
25|$|The average water tariff {{reported}} in 2014 was KSh 60 or US$0.60 per m3. This figure {{is not very}} indicative because of significant regional variations and because in Kenya a progressive block tariff system is in place for household connections. This means {{that for the first}} 10 m3 a minimum charge is paid that corresponds to a low, highly subsidised tariff, while for the following blocks (up to 20, 50, 100 and 300 as well as above 300 m3) an increasingly higher tariff is being charged, with the tariff in the highest block being five times higher than in the lowest block. Where no meter is installed, a fixed monthly charge is applied. The rationale for this system is to promote water saving practices and to ensure that low-income households can afford to use an adequate amount of water. However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> this system, because households in low-income areas resell water or share a connection with other households and thus risk ending up paying a higher tariff.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} Clive Ruggles {{has argued}} that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> the selection of data in Thom's surveys. Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in refraction near the horizon. A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer whether there {{was likely to be}} an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer why people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: [...] "To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn’t inform the current interpretive questions." [...] Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.|$|E

500|$|The pale yellow, {{close-grained}} and satiny wood of ailanthus {{has been}} used in cabinet work. It is flexible and well suited to the manufacture of kitchen steamers, which are important in Chinese cuisine for cooking mantou, pastries and rice. Zhejiang Province in eastern China is most famous for producing these steamers. It is also considered a good source of firewood across much of its range as it moderately hard and heavy, yet readily available. The wood is also used to make charcoal for culinary purposes. [...] <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> using the wood as lumber, however. Because the trees exhibit rapid growth for the first few years, the trunk has uneven texture between the inner and outer wood, which can cause the wood to twist or crack during drying. Techniques have been developed for drying the wood so as to prevent this cracking, allowing it to be commercially harvested. Although the live tree tends to have very flexible wood, the wood is quite hard once properly dried.|$|E
500|$|Prescott's {{work has}} {{remained}} popular and influential {{to the present}} day, and his meticulous use of sources, bibliographical citations and critical notes was unprecedented among American historians. As {{the work of an}} amateur historian, the History of Ferdinand and Isabella was an outstanding achievement, and it arguably was the best English-language work on the subject published until then. The major problems with the work to the modern day historian are not related {{to the quality of the}} research or Prescott's understanding of the period, but rather that his focus is on the major political and military events as opposed to social and economic conditions. It has also been argued that Prescott partially subscribed to the Great Man theory. The Conquest of Mexico has endured more than any other of Prescott's work: it is regarded as his greatest literary accomplishment. However, modern scholarship agrees that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> Prescott's characterization of the conquest. David Levin has argued that the Conquest shows [...] "inadequate attention to detail" [...] and remains a broad and general account of events. In contrast to the Conquest of Mexico, the Conquest of Peru has received relatively little modern scholarly attention, perhaps due to some key similarities in style and structure. However, it is generally thought that the work was the authoritative account until the 20th century, and that Prescott used a broader range of source material than any previous writer on the subject. However, the archeological and anthropological aspects of both works have been heavily criticized by historians since the end of the 19th century. Prescott had never visited archeological sites in Mesoamerica and his understanding of Inca and Aztec culture was weak. In defense of Prescott, it has been argued that despite advances in archeological understanding, and a reconceptualization of the nature of pre-Columbian society, the works remain broadly historically accurate, and Prescott's elaborations on fact were due to a fundamental lack of source material. In contrast, Phillip the Second is considered essentially an inferior piece—it lacks the epic structure and literary merits of Prescott's other work, and the work has not received more critical attention than other contemporary accounts of the monarch's life.|$|E

2500|$|The {{author is}} unknown. In the 10th-century {{reference}} manuscript (Parisinus Graecus 2036), the heading reports [...] "Dionysius or Longinus", an ascription by the [...] medieval copyist that was misread as [...] "by Dionysius Longinus." [...] When the manuscript was {{being prepared for}} printed publication, the work was initially attributed to Cassius Longinus (c. 213–273 AD). Since the correct translation includes {{the possibility of an}} author named [...] "Dionysius", some have attributed the work to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a writer of the 1st century AD. There remains the possibility that the work belongs to neither Cassius Longinus nor Dionysius of Halicarnassus, but, rather, some unknown author writing under the Roman Empire, likely in the 1st century. The error does imply that when the codex was written, the trails of the real author were already lost. Neither author can be accepted as the actual writer of the treatise.
