The cytoplasmic kinase domain of EnvZ can be dissected into two independently function-ing domains, A and B, whose NMR solution structures have been indi-vidually determined. Here, we examined the <b>topological</b> <b>arrangement</b> of these two domains in the EnvZ dimer, a structure that is key to under-standing the mechanism underlying the autophosphorylation activity of the kinase. A series of cysteine substitution mutants were constructed to test the feasibility of chemical crosslinking between the two domains. These crosslinking data demonstrate that helix I of domain A of one sub-unit in the EnvZc dimer is in close proximity to domain B of the other sub-unit in the same dimer, while helix II of domain A of one subunit interacts with domain B of the same subunit in the EnvZc dimer.

40|$|Brain {{imaging and}} {{electrophysiological}} recording studies in humans have reported discrete cortical regions in posterior ventral temporal cortex that respond preferentially to faces, buildings, and letters. These findings suggest a category-specific anatomically segregated modular {{organization of the}} object vision pathway. Here we present data from a functional MRI study in which we found three distinct regions of ventral temporal cortex that responded preferentially to faces and two categories of other objects, namely houses and chairs, and had a highly consistent <b>topological</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Although the data {{could be interpreted as}} evidence for separate modules, we found that each category also evoked significant responses in the regions that responded maximally to other stimuli. Moreover, each category was associated with its own differential pattern of response across ventral temporal cortex. These results indicate that the representation of an object is not restricted to a region that responds maximally to that object, but rather is distributed across a broader expanse of cortex. We propose that the functional architecture of the ventral visual pathway is not a mosaic of category-specific modules but instead is a continuous representation of information about object form that has a highly consistent and orderly <b>topological</b> <b>arrangement...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis, is a {{textbook}} example of pheromone polymorphism. Males {{of the two}} strains (Z and E) prefer opposite ratios of the two pheromone components, Z 11 - and E 11 -tetradecenyl acetate, with a sex-linked factor underlying this difference in preference. The male antennal lobes of the two strains contain a pheromone sensitive macroglomerular complex (MGC) that is identical in morphology, but reversed in functional topology. However, hybrids prefer intermediate ratios. How a <b>topological</b> <b>arrangement</b> of two glomeruli can accommodate for an intermediate preference was unclear. Therefore we studied the neurophysiology of hybrids and paternal backcrosses to see which factors correlated with male behavior. Results Projection neuron (PN) recordings and stainings in hybrids and backcrosses show a dominance of the E-type MGC topology, notwithstanding their intermediate preference. Apparently, the <b>topological</b> <b>arrangement</b> of glomeruli does not directly dictate preference. However, two other factors did correlated very well with preference. First, volumetric measurements of MGC glomeruli demonstrate that, whereas in the parental strains the medial MGC glomerulus is more than 2 {{times larger than the}} lateral, in hybrids they are intermediate between the parents, i. e. equally sized. Paternal backcrosses showed that the volume ratio is sex-linked and co-dominant. Second, we measured the summed potential difference of the antennae in response to pheromone stimulation using electroantennogram recordings (EAG). Z-strain antennae responded 2. 5 times stronger to Z 11 than to E 11 - 14 :OAc, whereas in E-strain antennae the ratio was approximately equal. Hybrid responses were intermediate to the parents, and also here the antennal response of the paternal backcrosses followed a pattern similar to the behavioral phenotype. We found no differences in frequency and types of projection and local interneurons encountered between the two strains and their hybrids. Conclusions Male pheromone preference in the ECB strains serves as a strong prezygotic reproductive isolation mechanism, and has contributed to population divergence in the field. Our results demonstrate that male pheromone preference is not directly affected by the <b>topological</b> <b>arrangement</b> of olfactory glomeruli itself, but that male preference may instead be mediated by an antennal factor, which causes the MGC glomeruli to be differentially sized. We postulate that this factor affects readout of blend information from the MGC. The results are an illustration of how pheromone preference may be 'spelled out' in the ALs, and how evolution may modulate this. </p...|$|E

Early tRNA biosynthesis steps are shared among most tRNAs, while later ones are often individualized for specific tRNAs. In yeast, tRNA transcription and early processing occur coordinately in the nucleolus, requiring <b>topological</b> <b>arrangement</b> of ∼ 300 tRNA genes and early processing enzymes to this site; later processing events occur in the nucleoplasm or cytoplasm. tRNA nuclear export requires multiple exporters which function in parallel and the export process is coupled with other cellular events.
