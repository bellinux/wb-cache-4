5|$|Despite {{his failure}} to reach double figures at The Oval, Craig {{maintained}} his position in the playing XI on the tour of the Indian subcontinent en route to Australia in late 1956, playing Test matches against Pakistan and India. However, he failed to pass 40 in his five innings. He made a duck and 18 on a matting wicket in Australia's one-off Test against Pakistan in Karachi before playing in the First Test against India, scoring 40 in an innings win in Madras. He was dropped for the Second Test but returned to make 36 and 6 in the Third <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Calcutta as Australia took a 2–0 series win. The matches were {{the first time that}} Australia had played a <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Asia.|$|E
5|$|He took match {{figures of}} 5/48 in the Second <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> a drawn match. He batted {{for the first}} time, and {{remained}} unbeaten without scoring as Australia collapsed to be all out for 107 on sticky wicket. It {{was the only time}} that they conceded a first innings lead in the series, and persistent rain forced a draw.|$|E
5|$|His 1964–65 tour of {{the subcontinent}} {{on the way back}} to Australia was even worse, a far cry from his leading role in the {{previous}} tour to the subcontinent. After making 40 and 0 in the First Test win in Madras, he was unable to bat either innings in the Second <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Bombay after being hospitalised due to persistent vomiting, injury as Australia ceded their series lead. He missed the remainder of the series, the Third <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Calcutta and a one-off <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Pakistan. Upon his return home, he has a shortened domestic season before Australia left for the West Indies. In five domestic matches, he scored 357 runs at 59.50, including a 133 not against South Australia.|$|E

5|$|His career ended unhappily on Australia's {{first ever}} tour to the West Indies. He took match figures of 2/126 in the First <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Kingston, Jamaica in a high-scoring win. These {{were to be}} his last Test wickets as he took a total of 0/60 in the Second <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Trinidad. He was {{retained}} for the Third Test but injured himself early in the match while fielding and neither batted nor bowled. He was injured for the next month and missed the Fourth Test but returned for the Fifth. Early {{on the first day}} he suffered yet another knee injury as he changed direction while attempting to catch a Clyde Walcott pull shot. His teammates Alan Davidson and Peter Burge removed a bench from the dressing room wall and used it as an improvised stretcher to carry Johnston from the ground; his Test career ended without bowling or batting in either of his last two matches. His final Test wicket had been that of Glendon Gibbs in the second innings of the First <b>Test.</b> <b>In</b> six first-class matches for the tour, he managed only nine wickets at 51.00.|$|E

5|$|Karthik was {{retained}} for India’s next engagement, a two-Test home {{series against}} South Africa. In a high-scoring draw {{in which both}} teams passed 450 in the first innings, Karthik managed only a solitary run in the First <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Kanpur. In the Second <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Calcutta, he scored 46 to help extend India’s first innings lead to 106 runs, as the hosts completed an eight-wicket win.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{showed his}} {{versatility}} {{again in the}} First <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Brisbane, scoring an unbeaten 38 in the second innings to extend Australia's lead to 373. When South Africa attempted to chase the target, Lindwall took 5/60 to cut them down 96 runs short of victory. Lindwall was reunited with Miller when the latter returned from injury for the Second Test at Melbourne, and despite the old combination taking 12 wickets, with Lindwall taking match figures of 5/116, Australia fell 82 runs short and South Africa had its first Test win against Australia in 42 years. The teams moved to the home ground of Miller and Lindwall for the Third <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Sydney, and the local pair delivered, taking seven wickets between them to skittle the tourists for 173, with Lindwall taking 4/40. With Australia having taken a 270 first innings lead, Lindwall allowed Australia to seize the initiative, removing both openers in his first three overs, before ending with 4/72 to ensure an innings victory and a 2–1 series lead. The value of Lindwall and Miller were demonstrated during the final two Tests. At the Fourth <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Adelaide, both broke down mid-game and left Australia two bowlers short. Chasing 377, the South Africans managed {{to stave off the}} bowling and secure a draw. Both were absent for the Fifth <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Melbourne and South Africa capitalised, defeating the Australians by six wickets despite the home side having scored 520 in their first innings. The absence of Lindwall and Miller's new ball partnership allowed South Africa to fight back and draw the series 2–2, making it the first series that Australia had not won since 1938. Lindwall had taken 19 wickets at 20.16 in just three and a half Tests for the series, and Australia seemed unlikely to find replacements for their leading strike pair anytime soon; their eventual successors Richie Benaud and Alan Davidson were still to become regular internationals.|$|E
5|$|McCabe {{was unable}} to repeat his {{performances}} in the later Tests. He made 32 and a duck as Australia gained its only victory in the Second <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Melbourne, before managing only 57 runs {{in the next four}} innings as Australia suffered consecutive defeats. He scored 73 in the first innings of the Fifth <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Sydney as Australia compiled 435, but scored only four in a second innings collapse, leaving England with an eight-wicket victory. He had persisted with his strategy of standing his ground attacking the Bodyline bowling, but was unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|The Fifth Test of the 1948 Ashes series, held at The Oval in London, was {{the final}} <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> that cricket series between Australia and England. The match took place on 14–18August, with a rest day on 15August. Australia won the match by an innings and 149 runs to {{complete}} a 4–0 series win. It was the last <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> the career of Australian captain Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the best batsman {{in the history of}} the sport. Going into the match, if Australia batted only once, Bradman needed only four runs from his final innings to have a Test batting average of exactly 100, but he failed to score, bowled second ball for a duck by leg spinner Eric Hollies.|$|E
5|$|The Third Test was Johnston's first <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> {{front of}} his home crowd of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the first innings, he scored his first runs at Test level, adding five before being run out. He removed both of India's openers, Chandu Sarwate and Mankad, and ended with 2/33 as Australia took a 103-run first innings lead. In the second innings, he did the same, bowling both players, and ended with 4/44 as Australia won by 233 runs. Johnston missed the Fourth <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Adelaide due to injury but {{returned}} for the Fifth <b>Test</b> <b>in</b> Melbourne where he scored 23 not out and took match figures of 2/29 in another innings victory and Australia ended the summer with a 4–0 win. He headed the series averages with 16 wickets at 11.37. This ensured his selection for the 1948 tour of England as part of Bradman's Invincibles.
