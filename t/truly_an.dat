25|$|Although {{extension}} in quantitative parts follows upon a corporeal nature, nevertheless {{it is not}} {{the same}} for a body to be a substance and for it to be quantified. For of itself substance is indivisible, not indeed as a point is indivisible, but as that which falls outside the order of dimensions is indivisible. But quantity, which gives the substance extension, really differs from the substance and is <b>truly</b> <b>an</b> accident.|$|E

25|$|Subjectivity {{comes with}} {{consciousness}} {{of myself as}} a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be <b>truly</b> <b>an</b> individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.|$|E

The 3rd Company soldiers overran two platoons from the 1st Raiders, who were not expecting an attack from that direction, and the resulting hand-to-hand melee left 12 Marines and 59 Japanese dead. The remaining 3rd Company survivors were able to cross the river and reach friendly lines. According to Frank J. Guidone, a Marine participant in the engagement, [...] "The fight was hours of hell.

[...] He also said that [...] "Baby I exploits nearly every beat in existence, resulting in messiness." [...] Writing for MTV, Jenna Hally Rubenstein praised the vocal performance explored in the song comparing to Grande's previous single, according to her, while [...] "The Way" [...] "set the bar pretty high for Ariana", [...] "Baby I," [...] "sets the bar even higher" [...] and referred to the song as [...] "a more than worthy followup." ...|$|E

Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're <b>truly</b> <b>an</b> actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I think of all the things that I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them."

500|$|The {{song was}} {{produced}} and mixed by Max Martin and Rami Yacoub. Max Martin {{began working on}} the song at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden in mid-2001 and Spears recorded in June {{of the same year}} at Battery Studios in New York City, New York. The June 20, 2001 recording session aired on MTV Diary on September 1, 2001. Background vocals were provided by Martin and Jeanette Oison. Spears considered the song as one of her favorites, while praising Dido for [...] her input into its songwriting, saying [...] "it was <b>truly</b> <b>an</b> honor for you to be part of my album. Thanks for your input." [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] is a pop power ballad, founded on a strong piano melody, that lasts for three minutes and 49 seconds. The song is composed in the key of E♭ major and is set in time signature of common time, with a moderately slow tempo of 76 beats per minute. The song's lyrics talk about the angst and heartache that teenage girls suffer with puberty, where Spears claims, [...] "I used to think I had the answers to everything." [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] has a basic sequence of E♭–A♭2–Fm7–B♭ as its chord progression.|$|E

500|$|Later reviews, however, {{have seen}} [...] "Closure" [...] {{in a much}} more {{positive}} light, with many critics praising its ending. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–". He argued that the episode worked due to two scenes: the sequence in which Mulder reads aloud from Samantha's diary, and the final shot of Mulder being reunited with his sister. He wrote that the [...] "stark simplicity" [...] of the former made it emotionally powerful, and that the latter was [...] "a bit sappy, a bit surreal, a bit lovely" [...] but nonetheless [...] "a beautiful moment". Meghan Deans of Tor.com felt that the story was [...] "silly", but that, when paired with the idea that Samantha was <b>truly</b> <b>an</b> innocent victim, successfully becomes a [...] "comfort". She called it a move that [...] "the show must give Mulder, and us, in order to shut down this storyline for good." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called it [...] "brave". The two noted that while some of the sentimentality is pushed too far—such as when Mulder finds his sister's diary speaking to him, or when Mulder talks about all lost souls being stars—the [...] "critical moment" [...] featuring Mulder reuniting with his sister's spirit is [...] "extraordinarily moving".|$|E
