A single phase power system minimizes the wiring, sensing, and control complexities required in a multi-sourced redundantly distributed power system. The single phase addresses only the distribution link; mulitphase lower frequency inputs and outputs accommodation techniques are described. While the 440 V operating potential was initially selected for aircraft operating below 50, 000 ft, this potential also appears suitable for space power systems. This voltage choice recognizes a reasonable upper limit for semiconductor ratings, yet will direct synthesis of 220 V, 3 power.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} a {{low-cost}} method for the assembly of flexible substrate antennas and UHF RF identification silicon (Si) chips. Such a method exploits a magnetic coupling mechanism, thus not requiring for galvanic contacts between the Si chip and antenna itself. The magnetic coupling is established by a planar transformer, the primary and secondary windings of which are implemented on flexible substrate and Si chip, respectively. As a result, the Si chip can be assembled on the antenna with a mere placing and gluing process. First, the idea has been validated by theory. Electromagnetic simulations of a square heterogeneous transformer (1. 0 -mm side) show a maximum available power gain (MAG) of 0. 4 dB at 868 MHz. In addition, the heterogeneous transformer is also quite tolerant with respect to misalignment between primary and secondary. An offset error of 150 m reduces the MAG to 0. 5 dB. A sub-optimal matching strategy, exploiting a simple on-chip capacitor, is then developed for antennas with 50 - input impedances. Finally, the idea has been experimentally validated exploiting printed circuit board (PCB) prototypes. A PCB transformer (1. 5 -mm side) and a <b>transformer</b> <b>rectifier</b> (two-diode Dickson multiplier) have been fabricated and tested.

As {{it is not possible}} to outgas the ends of the filament and the supports, these parts have been shielded from the field. The usual source of high potential consisting of <b>transformer,</b> <b>rectifier</b> and condensers is used. A description is given of a method for measuring potentials from a few volts up to 25, 000 volts. Use is made of a galvanometer and series resistance, and it is thought that the range can be extended to at least 100, 000 volts. With heat treated wires results are obtained in good agreement with earlier work, but it is shown that with such wires an appreciable current is obtained only after a break has occurred in the surface of the wire. The resulting characteristic depends only on the power available during the break and is shown to obey the empirical equation: [ [...] . ]. Microtographs are presented which makes it plausible that the potential gradient may exceed 40 million volts/cm without producing currents in excess of [ [...] . ] amperes and that the gradient is probably [ [...] . ] volts/cm or more when reasonably large currents are obtained. With untreated wires a "loop phenomenon" is described which is thought to be due to positive ions from the anode. Heating the tube in an electric furnace is shown to have a great influence on the emission in this case. Microphotographs show that the diameter of such a wire decreases with use.
