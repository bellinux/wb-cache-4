5000|$|The phrase [...] "singing in the wire" [...] {{can refer}} to the sonic {{vibration}} commonly induced by wind blowing across small wires and conductors, making these lines whistle or whine like an aeolian harp. It could also, or even simultaneously, refer to the sounds that a lineman might hear when attaching a <b>telephone</b> <b>earpiece</b> to {{a long stretch of}} raw telephone or telegraph line, i.e., without typical line equalization and filtering. [...] In the recording, a notable feature of the orchestral arrangement is the effort of the violins and keyboards to mimic these ethereal sounds and morse code, and the lyric [...] "I can hear you through the whine" [...] further alludes to them.|$|E
50|$|Telephone systems {{also use}} matched {{impedances}} to minimise echo on long-distance lines. This {{is related to}} transmission-line theory. Matching also enables the telephone hybrid coil (2- to 4-wire conversion) to operate correctly. As the signals are sent and received on the same two-wire circuit to the central office (or exchange), cancellation is necessary at the <b>telephone</b> <b>earpiece</b> so excessive sidetone is not heard. All devices used in telephone signal paths are generally dependent on matched cable, source and load impedances. In the local loop, the impedance chosen is 600 ohms (nominal). Terminating networks are installed at the exchange to offer the best match to their subscriber lines. Each country has its own standard for these networks, but they are all designed to approximate about 600 ohms over the voice frequency band.|$|E
25|$|Headphones {{originated}} from the <b>telephone</b> receiver <b>earpiece,</b> {{and were the}} only way to listen to electrical audio signals before amplifiers were developed. The first truly successful set was developed in 1910 by Nathaniel Baldwin, who made them by hand in his kitchen and sold them to the United States Navy.|$|R
50|$|Usually, a {{standard}} telephone handset was placed into a cradle {{that had been}} engineered to fit closely (by the use of rubber seals) around the microphone and earpiece of the handset. A modem would modulate a loudspeaker in the cup attached to the handset's microphone, and sound from the loudspeaker in the <b>telephone</b> handset's <b>earpiece</b> would {{be picked up by}} a microphone in the cup attached to the earpiece. In this way signals could be passed in both directions.|$|R
