5|$|Suqami's {{passport}} {{survived the}} crash {{and landed in}} <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>below.</b> Soaked in jet fuel, it {{was picked up by}} a passerby who gave it to a New York City Police Department (NYPD) detective shortly before the South Tower collapsed. Investigators retrieved Mohamed Atta's luggage, which had not been loaded onto the flight. In it they found Omari's passport and driver's license, a videocassette for a Boeing757 flight simulator, a folding knife, and pepper spray. In a recording, a few months later in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, took responsibility for the attack. The attack on the World Trade Center exceeded even bin Laden's expectations: he had expected only the floors above the plane strikes to collapse. The flight recorders for Flight11 and Flight175 were never found.|$|E
5|$|The clip starts showing Gaby Moreno {{playing a}} melody in a guitar while staying {{close to a}} window, {{watching}} the people walk on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>below.</b> Meanwhile, scenes of all the places featured on the video are interpolated. Just as the song begins, Arjona is shown leaving the Tikal ruins on an orange Jeep, as well as images of Moreno singing {{in front of a}} piano. Then, as Arjona abandons the Jeep and goes as a passenger on another vehicle, Moreno is shown singing inside a house, close to another Jeep similar to that of Arjona's. Finally, Arjona reaches the town on which Moreno has been waiting for him, just to find that she is gone to where he has been before, on the Tikal ruins. As of October 2017, the video has received over 520 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} the {{legislation}} were largely the work of architect George Ford. Ford had sympathies with the City Beautiful movement, disliked the unimaginative form of many New York skyscrapers, and had concerns over urban public health, but he also found tall buildings exciting and believed that horizontal visual unity produced boring architecture. As a consequence of Ford's influence, New York's laws were relatively complex and divided up the city into different zones; in each zone, a particular zoning envelope applied, controlling the height to which buildings could be built. Typically a building could only rise up from the sidewalk vertically by around , after which the building had to be set back at a set angle to allow sunlight to reach <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>below.</b> On {{a quarter of the}} site, however, the owner could build as high as they wished, without any further restrictions.|$|E

25|$|The tram stop {{itself was}} substantial, {{with a small}} station {{building}} containing a waiting area housing steps and a lift to reach <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>below,</b> plus as short footbridge over Station Street that connected to the main railway station. Up to three trams could be accommodated on the two platform faces: the western platform had a single length platform, while the eastern platform was an extended double-length platform.|$|E

25|$|The best-known {{and most}} picturesque park {{of the period}} is that {{composed}} of the Squares Willette and Nadar on the slope directly below the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur on Montmartre. It was begun by Formigé in 1880, but not completed until 1927 by another architect, Léopold Béviére, {{after the death of}} Formigé in 1926. The park features terraces and slopes dropping eighty meters from the Basilica to <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>below,</b> and has one of the best-known views in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The metal {{doors and}} trim were {{manufactured}} by Dalhstrom Metallic Door Company, of Jamestown, New York. Some of these street-level doors possess relief art of eagles in brass. The original {{glass of the}} beacon was of green hue, and topped with a decorative globe, surrounded by seven and half ton circle of stone eagles. In 1932, it was damaged and repaired after a lighting strike. This architectural feature removed in 1950 after one eagle fell to <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>below</b> in 1930.|$|E

25|$|On August 13, 2014, a {{train at}} the Taft Avenue station became derailed and {{overshot}} to the streets. First the train stopped after leaving Magallanes station (the station before the Taft Avenue station) {{due to a}} technical problem. Later, the train broke down, so that a following train was used to push the stalled train. During this process, however, the first train was detached from the rails and overshot towards Taft Avenue, breaking the concrete barriers and falling to <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>below.</b> At least 38 people were injured. The accident was blamed on poor maintenance provided by the DOTC-appointed provider.|$|E
25|$|Early one morning, a room-service waiter at a New York City {{hotel is}} horrified to {{discover}} that the young man to whom he has just delivered breakfast (Basehart) is standing on the narrow ledge outside his room on the 15th floor. Charlie Dunnigan (Douglas), a policeman on traffic duty in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>below,</b> tries to talk him off the ledge to no avail. He is ordered back to traffic patrol by police emergency services deputy chief Moksar (Da Silva), but he is ordered to return when the man on the ledge will not speak to psychiatrists summoned to the scene. Coached by a psychiatrist (Martin Gabel), Dunnigan tries to relate to the man on the ledge as one human to another.|$|E
25|$|The Beatles' {{flight to}} Tokyo stopped in Anchorage, Alaska late on 27 June, local time, and was {{grounded}} there {{due to the}} presence of a typhoon over Japan. Epstein arranged for the Beatles to wait out the delay at Anchorage's Westward Hotel, where the band's presence instantly attracted a crowd of local fans, who serenaded them from <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>below.</b> The flight finally arrived at Haneda Airport in Tokyo {{in the early hours of}} 29 June, according to a report by Dudley Cheke, a chargé d'affaires at the British Embassy. Alternatively, an arrival time of around 3.30 am on 30 June is given by Beatles biographers Barry Miles and John Winn and in a 2016 Tokyo Weekender article about the visit.|$|E

25|$|Facing {{the gardens}} near the Palazzo Serbelloni and the customs houses is another {{perfect example of}} a Neoclassical residence, the Palazzo Saporiti. Commissioned by Gaetano Belloni, manager of the gaming room at the Scala, it was {{designed}} by Innocenzo Giusti. The building is a typical Neoclassical residence. On the ground floor level, the symmetrical facade is decorated with a bugnato ashlar in pink granite while the first floor features a portico with Ionic columns from which parades in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>below</b> could be viewed. Between the first floor and the attic, there {{is a series of}} bas-reliefs depicting scenes from the history of Milan, while the attic itself is crowned with classical statues of the Dii Consentes sculpted by Pompeo Marchesi and Grazioso Rusca.|$|E
25|$|On February 4, 1977, an {{accident}} {{occurred on the}} sharp left-hand curve at Wabash/Lake. Two trains were involved, one was the Ravenswood Line (today's Brown Line) with the second being the Lake-Dan Ryan Line (parts of today's Red and Green Line). The Ravenswood train was stopped waiting for the clearance to proceed. The motorman of the Lake-Dan Ryan train failed to see the signals warning him of a stopped train. What occurred was a rear-end collision, the initial collision was only minor. However the motorman continued to apply power forward; which led to three cars being pushed off the elevated tracks to <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>below.</b> With the fourth car dangling while still attached to the other four cars on the track. 11 deaths were reported with more than 180 injuries.|$|E
25|$|The oldest known {{reference}} {{to the use of}} the three colours of green, white and orange as a nationalist emblem dates from September 1830 when tricolour cockades were worn at a meeting held to celebrate the French Revolution of that year— a revolution which restored the use of the French tricolour. The colours were also used in the same period for rosettes and badges, and on the banners of trade guilds. However, widespread recognition was not accorded to the flag until 1848. At a meeting in his native city of Waterford on 7 March 1848, Thomas Francis Meagher, the Young Ireland leader, first publicly unveiled the flag from a second-floor window of the Wolfe Tone Club as he addressed a gathered crowd on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>below</b> who were present to celebrate another revolution that had just taken place in France.|$|E

50|$|A {{windstorm}} on January 15, 2008 caused loose {{construction materials}} {{to blow off}} the building and into <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>below.</b> Parked vehicles were damaged by falling plywood, {{but there were no}} injuries. The neighbouring Terasen Gas building also sustained damage in the storm. Police closed off West Georgia Street for over twelve hours.|$|R
25|$|Above {{the main}} cornice, which unites the towers with the portico {{and the outer}} walls, the details are boldly scaled, in order to read well from <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>below</b> and from a distance. The towers rise above the cornice from a square block plinth which is plain apart from large oculi, that on the south being filled by the clock, while that on the north is void. The towers are {{composed}} of two complementary elements, a central cylinder rising through the tiers {{in a series of}} stacked drums, and paired Corinthian columns at the corners, with buttresses above them, which serve to unify the drum shape with the square plinth on which it stands. The entablature above the columns breaks forward over them to express both elements, tying them together in a single horizontal band. The cap, an ogee-shaped dome, supports a gilded pineapple-shaped finial.|$|E
25|$|Evil businesswoman Angelica Nero {{intends to}} kill J.R. {{and his cousin}} Jack for double {{crossing}} her, but J.R. has her apprehended by the police. Unfortunately, Angelica has already had a bomb attached to Jack's car, which explodes with Jamie inside. After hearing this on the phone, J.R. runs {{out of his office}} to go to Jack's apartment. As he leaves the office, Sue Ellen arrives in the other elevator looking for him. As soon as she enters J.R.'s office, another bomb left by Angelica goes off, and the entire floor that houses Ewing Oil explodes, showering debris onto <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>below.</b> The scene then shifts to Pam in bed, the day after her marriage to Mark Graison. Pam wakes up to hear the shower running. Assuming it's Mark, she opens the shower door, only to find Bobby Ewing, alive and well. (In the Season Ten premiere, Bobby's death and all of Season Nine would be revealed as a dream that Pam was having).|$|E

The grenade exploded seconds later and Monsoor's body absorbed most of the force of the blast. Monsoor was severely wounded and although evacuated immediately, he died 30 minutes later. Two other SEALs next to him at the time were injured by the explosion but survived.|$|E
