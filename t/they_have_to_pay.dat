5|$|In November 2012 Transport for London (TfL) {{presented}} {{a proposal to}} abolish the Greener Vehicle Discount that benefited, among others, vehicles with small diesel engines that avoid the charge because their engines produce emissions of less than 100g per km of CO2. Approved by Mayor Boris Johnson in April 2013, the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. The measure was designed to curb {{the growing number of}} diesel vehicles on London's roads. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year sunset period before <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the full congestion charge. The sunset period ended on 24 June 2016.|$|E

Criticism of this government over its immigration policy is simply waived away; only when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> money will they sit up and take notice.|$|E
25|$|At {{four months}} infants still prefer infant-directed speech to adult-directed speech. Whereas 1-month-olds only exhibit this {{preference}} if the full speech signal is played to them, 4-month-old infants prefer infant-directed speech even when just the pitch contours are played. This shows that between 1 and 4 months of age, infants improve in tracking the suprasegmental {{information in the}} speech directed at them. By 4 months, finally, infants have learned which features <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> attention to at the suprasegmental level.|$|E

500|$|In November 2005, a Belgian judge {{seated in}} Mons {{ruled that the}} opening four-bar theme to [...] "Frozen" [...] was plagiarized from the song [...] "Ma vie fout le camp" [...] ("My Life's Getting Nowhere"), {{composed}} by Salvatore Acquaviva. The judge subsequently ordered the withdrawal from sales of all remaining discs, and forbade any further playing of the song on Belgian TV and radio. The judge also ordered Warner Bros., EMI and Sony to spread the decision within fifteen days to media outlets on pain of a penalty of €125,000 for non-compliance with the court order. Acquaviva's lawyer, Victor Vicent Dehin, said: [...] "We tried to reach a friendly agreement... but they didn't want to negotiate so I sued for plagiarism. They have stolen a song, so <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{the value of the}} song." [...] No award damages for the song were granted. Salvatore Acquaviva had explained to the court that Madonna heard [...] "Ma vie fout l'camp" [...] during a trip to Mouscron in the late 1970s. She had been recruited to be a dancer during a tour with French singer Patrick Hernandez, whose discs were produced in Mouscron. Dehin also stated that the lawsuit was just the first step, and the next discussion would be about the copyright gains Madonna obtained with [...] "Frozen". Subsequently, the song was omitted from the track listing on the Belgian pressings of Celebration in 2009. However, Madonna performed the song during the Sticky & Sweet Tour in Werchter, with Bert Bieseman, marketing manager of Belgian branch of Warner Bros. stating that [...] "Madonna is not afraid of a more or less riot". Acquaviva commented about the case: ...|$|E

2500|$|Public opinion however holds {{negative}} feelings towards the HST with an Ipsos Reid poll showing {{vast majority of}} British Columbians (82%) and Ontarians (74%) oppose their provincial government’s plans to harmonize the sales tax. Only 39% of the public believes the HST would be beneficial for businesses whereas the Task Force on Competitiveness, Productivity and Economic Progress found costs will decrease for small business as they recover sales taxes <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> on goods and services they purchase and will lower their administrative costs. Additionally, only 10% of the public agree that the move will help to create more jobs. [...] A study by Jack Mintz of the University of Calgary School of Public Policy found that the HST and {{a drop in the}} corporate tax rate will create almost 600,000 new jobs over the next ten years.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Greener Vehicle Discount was substituted by the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) {{scheme that}} went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limited the free access to the congestion charge zone to any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. [...] there are no internal combustion-only vehicles that meet this criteria. The measure is designed to limit {{the growing number of}} diesel vehicles on London's roads. Mayor Boris Johnson approved the new scheme in April 2013, after taking into account a number of comments received during the 12-week public consultation that took place. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year sunset period (until 24 June 2016) before <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the full congestion charge.|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who stayed}} quickly lost their Filipino ties since many among the Filipinos {{were like the}} local Cubans. [...] They can speak Spanish, they were Catholic, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> taxes or tributos, and they were treated like slaves by their Spanish masters. [...] (Back in the Philippines, entire provinces were {{assigned}} to grow tobacco and nothing more. [...] Those caught stealing a [...] single leaf of tobacco or caught growing the food staple, rice, were hit with sugarcane or sentenced to death by garrote). [...] Nonetheless, [...] their children survive to this day. [...] That is why there are Filipino or Chinese-Filipino sounding surnames in Cuba, such as Tampico, Magalan (from Magalang or to show respect), Batunbacal (from Batungbakal), Maquilin, Sumayao (to dance), Parian, Mabolo, Pilapil, Alimoron (from Alimurung), Nacpil, Gotiaco, Piat, Singson or Singzon, Tuason or Tuazon, Hizon or Hison, Dizon or Dison, Hinojosa or Hinohosa, Gandionco, Quiambao, Salambao, Puyat, Edralin, et al.|$|E

60|$|Now just as I {{have nothing}} but praise for the average general practitioner, so I {{have nothing but}} praise and admiration for those stalwart-looking publications.

They give much knowledge, they do much to ventilate perplexing questions, but a broadly conceived and properly endowed weekly circular could, I believe, do much more. At any rate, in my Utopia this duty of feeding up the general practitioners will not be left to private enterprise.|$|E
60|$|In the {{old days}} the people were taxed, or perhaps {{squeezed}} would be the better word, to about one-half of the produce of the land. There are those who may say that the present system is not so advantageous as it looks. Beforetime, the farmers, it is true, paid heavily, but only, on their nominal holdings. They could, and often did, hold more land than they were assessed on. Today a rigid bureaucracy surveys every foot of their farms, and upon every foot <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Somewhat similar complaints are made still by the simple peasantry of India, for {{if there is one}} thing that the Oriental detests more than another, it is the damnable Western vice of accuracy. That leads to doing things by rule. Still, by the look of those terraced fields, where the water is led so cunningly from level to level, the Japanese cultivator must enjoy at least one excitement. If the villages up the valley tamper with the water supply, there must surely be excitement down the valley--argument, protest, and the breaking of heads.|$|E

Everywhere there are two parties, the one for independence, the other for the Portuguese; but such as hold to the former {{naturally}} keep silent. What may happen in the future no man knows; but at present none have any hope that the southern provinces can resist the great force the Portuguese can bring against them, by sea and land. The mass of the people take no interest in the struggle. The natives, who are indeed the mass, care nothing whether they are governed from Lisbon or from Rio; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> their taxes whoever is master. Of the whites, those families who have long been settled here are silent, that is to say, they are for independence; while those who have relations and connections in Portugal vehemently and loudly support its cause, and persecute all whom they suspect of entertaining opinions to the contrary. But all these things concern the population of the great towns; we in the interior take but little heed of them. Here we cultivate our fields, we say our masses, we carry on our trade, and politics interest us but little. If they do interest us, at least we do not speak of them. Silence is golden, my son, as you have doubtless learnt for yourself in Peru. How came so young a man as you to undertake so terrible a journey as you have made?” he asked, changing the conversation.|$|E
