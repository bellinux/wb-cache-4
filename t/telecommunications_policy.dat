President Richard Nixon {{appointed}} him {{general counsel for the}} Office of <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Policy,</b> where one of his principal assignments was to formulate federal policy for the growth of cable television. From 1972 to 1974, he was chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States, a small independent agency that sought to improve the functioning of the federal bureaucracy. In mid-1974, Nixon nominated him as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel. After Nixon's resignation, the nomination was continued by President Gerald Ford, and Scalia was confirmed by the Senate on August 22, 1974.|$|E

The context of the paper is Singapore's telecommunications industry. This paper attributes some of the development of Singapore's telecommunications services and infrastructure to actual and potential competition at the market and internation levels. It argues {{that it is possible to}} introduce some competitive pressures into a market with few competitors, to ensure close-to-competitive-market outcomes. It also demonstrates the impact of internation competition on within-country <b>telecommunications</b> <b>policies</b> and infrastructure.

25|$|Under {{its unique}} {{macro-economic}} and political environment, the China {{has adopted a}} special <b>telecommunications</b> <b>policy</b> and strategy for telecommunications reform. As a fundamental and strategic industry, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) of China has monopolized telecommunication operations {{for more than four}} decades. Recognizing its incapability of monopolizing the huge market and of meeting increasing demand, China launched a telecommunications reform that has been aimed at full competition. As the result, the basic telecommunication market advanced from a monopoly to a duopoly, and it is now being extended to pluralistic competition. In 1994, China Unicom was formed and allowed to build and to operate nationwide cellular networks. To promote fair competition in the paging service, the paging sector of China Telecom was split in 1998 to form Guoxin Paging Ltd.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} {{telephones}} was ever increasing {{and in the}} 1990s Indian government was under increasing pressure {{to open up the}} telecom sector for private investment as a part of Liberalisation-Privatisation-Globalisation policies that the government had to accept to overcome the severe fiscal crisis and resultant balance of payments issue in 1991. Consequently, private investment in the sector of Value Added Services (VAS) was allowed and cellular telecom sector were opened up for competition from private investments. It was during this period that the Narsimha Rao-led government introduced the National <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>policy</b> (NTP) in 1994 which brought changes in the following areas: ownership, service and regulation of telecommunications infrastructure. The policy introduced the concept of telecommunication for all and its vision was to expand the telecommunication facilities to all the villages in India. Liberalisation in the basic telecom sector was also envisaged in this policy. They were also successful in establishing joint ventures between state owned telecom companies and international players. Foreign firms were eligible to 49% of the total stake. The multi-nationals were just involved in technology transfer, and not policy making.|$|E

40|$|In 1998, most EU {{member states}} fully liberalized their {{telecommunications}} markets, thereby abandoning the long-established monopolies {{of their national}} postal administrations over services and network infrastructure.

40|$|Satisfying the {{constraints}} for sustainable regulatory <b>telecommunications</b> <b>policies</b> is more challenging for regulatory regimes based on competition than monopoly. In an earlier paper, Johannes Bauer and I used complexity theory {{to improve our}} understanding of the requirements for sustainable <b>telecommunications</b> <b>policies,</b> showing that regulation has a diminishing capacity to achieve specifically desired outcomes and greater attention must be paid to the adaptability of policies and policymaking processes themselves. The present Article examines the implications of the complexity theory perspective for federalism. Federalism is a distinctive (patching) algorithm that confers system advantages for adaptability through diversity and coupling of policymaking jurisdictions-mechanisms for both experimentation and stability-that are essential for development of sustainable policies. An important implication is that policies of complete federal preemption, and particularly full deregulation, must be approached with great caution because such policies eliminate the adaptive properties of a more highly patched and coupled policymaking system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{traces the}} {{evolution}} of India’s <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>policies</b> from its colonial days to the present time. The policies have undergone major shifts. During the British rule of India, the policies were strictly motivated by the colonizer’s need to control the native population. After independence, the policies were dictated by the need for self-sufficient development and Fabian socialism, which led to other problems that curtailed telecommunications growth in India. In the last {{decades of the twentieth}} century, sheer economic survival imperatives led to the gradual opening up of India to market economies. This gave impetus to accelerated growth in the telecom sector. However, while the growth of India’s telecom sector, especially the cellular telecom sector has been spectacular in the last decade, the basic question of whether it has actually achieved the avowed developmental policy objectives of the government remains in doubt. This paper seeks to critically focus on evolution of <b>telecommunications</b> <b>policies</b> in India, discuss the philosophy behind the policies, their successes and failures over the years, current trends and the future outlook for telecommunications in India...|$|R

40|$|Sustainable <b>telecommunications</b> <b>policies</b> require {{simultaneous}} {{satisfaction of}} economic viability and political feasibility constraints, and meeting these constraints is increasingly difficult {{in a competitive}} regulatory regime. In prior research, Cherry has sought to provide a general analytical framework for designing sustainable <b>telecommunications</b> <b>policies,</b> relying primarily on legal and economic analyses and incorporating insights from the political science literature. Cherry and Bauer (2004) have recently enhanced this framework by incorporating insights from complexity theory. This paper expands upon the analysis in Cherry and Bauer (2004) to examine the implications for federalism in the U. S. This paper shows that, from the complexity theory perspective, federalism is a patching algorithm for policymaking that confers system advantages for adaptability through diversity and coupling of policymaking jurisdictions. Such diversity and coupling is important for adaptability of the policymaking process itself, by providing mechanisms for both experimentation and stability that are essential for development of sustainable policies. In addition, as a coevolving complex adaptive system, a federalism regime evolves over time. This paper asserts that, as for sustainable environmenta...|$|R
40|$|Currently, U. S. and EU <b>telecommunications</b> <b>policies</b> {{differ in}} many respects. For example, {{wholesale}} access to local loops is largely deregulated in the U.

S. has an elaborate universal service policy {{with a set of}} universal service funds and specific policies for high-cost regions and low-income users, while universal service policies in the EU are much more sporadic. Will the forceful technical and market developments that are associated with IP convergence, next generation access (NGA) and mobile broadband (4 G) lead to a convergence of <b>telecommunications</b> <b>policies</b> in the U. S. and EU? Based on a survey of the relevant U. S. and EU related economics literature the current paper addresses this issue for the five policy areas of interconnection, wholesale loop access, net neutrality, spectrum policy and universal service. While IP convergence and the spread of 4 G are likely to enhance policy convergence, NGA could have a different effect, because the penetration of and the competitive properties of NGA depend crucially on legacy infrastructures that differ between the two continents...|$|R
