2500|$|St. Ignatius of Antioch {{spoke in}} [...] "praise of unity" [...] in a Letter to the Ephesians, saying [...] "He, therefore, {{that does not}} {{assemble}} with the Church, has even by this manifested his pride, and condemned himself. For it is written, 'God resisteth the proud.' Let us be careful, then, not to set ourselves {{in opposition to the}} bishop, in order that we may be subject to God". Stressing the relationship between the Church initiated by Jesus and the hierarchy set in motion by the apostles, Ignatius writes: [...] "we should look upon the bishop even as we would upon the Lord Himself" [...] (ยง6). Ignatius stresses the hierarchical relationship between God and the bishop more strongly to the Magnesians urging them [...] "to yield him all reverence, having respect to the power of God the Father, ... submitting to him, or rather not to him, but to the Father of Jesus Christ, the bishop of us all". In ยง6 he exhorts them to harmony, and in ยง13 urges them to [...] "tudy ... to be established in the doctrines of the Lord and the apostles, ... with your most admirable bishop...." [...] Thus Ignatius emphasizes unity, obedience, and the hierarchical relationship among the faithful and between the bishop and God. Further elements of the hierarchical relationship are mentioned by St. Clement of Alexandria, referring to advice in the [...] "holy books: some for presbyters, some for bishops and deacons" [...] (Jurgens ยง413), and writing treatises with titles [...] "On the Unity and Excellence of the Church" [...] and [...] "On the Offices of Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and Widows." [...] In his Stromateis, Clement of Alexandria writes that [...] "according <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> the grades here in the Church, of bishops, presbyters, deacons, are imitations of the angelic glory, and of that economy which, the Scriptures say, awaits those who, following the footsteps of the apostles, have lived in perfection of righteousness according to the Gospel".|$|E

60|$|Of course, {{about all}} such things {{there is a}} great deal which a cool critic could make ridiculous, but I hold <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> of them nevertheless.|$|E

60|$|Here {{are some}} figures which are {{perfectly}} authentic, and which seem <b>to</b> justify <b>my</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Marian {{could not}} help triumphing. [...] "Well, Edmund, I am glad you have come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> at last. I knew you would not like the Lyddells when you knew them better." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{propose to}} tell you--in the first place--what {{is known of}} {{the manner in which}} your cousin met his death; appending to the {{statement}} such inferences and conclusions as we are justified (according <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion)</b> in drawing from the facts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he's quite Greek," [...] said Mrs. March, in assent <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> of his nose. [...] "Too Greek for a clergyman, almost. But he isn't vain of it. Those {{beautiful}} {{people are often}} quite modest, and Mr. Glendenning is very modest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{still think}} them useless and dangerous, and by reading them would wish <b>to</b> confirm <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> and give weight <b>to</b> <b>my</b> arguments." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{father will}} become a convert <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinions.</b> Miss Effingham," [...] said John, [...] "and {{he will not be}} home a twelve-month before he will make the {{discovery}} that the government is a press-ocracy, and its ministers, self-chosen and usurpers, composed of those who have the least at stake, even as to character." ...|$|R
6000|$|I don't {{often say}} what I think. At least, {{not much of}} it. I don't often get the chance. And, besides, being a timid and a modest man, I'm afraid to. But just this once, I'm going to [...] "try it on." [...] Object <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinions</b> as you will. But still, let me express them. Strike--but hear me! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eh! {{never mind}} {{a hundred or}} two, more or less. What is this loss at cards? A mere bagatelle! You are playing for a principality. You want your kingdom in Virginia; and if you listen <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> the little misfortune which has {{happened}} to your swain {{is a piece of}} great good-fortune to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} do," [...] Whitney agreed. [...] "But I stick <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> that he {{has some}} particular reason for choosing a light machine." [...] He hesitated a moment. [...] "I don't want to butt in, and as the fellow's a family friend, it's delicate ground; but if you feel you'd like a run through Galloway--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Merton {{was also}} silent; to himself he said, [...] "I {{knew that it}} would grieve her a little at first, but she is not unreasonable, and in a short time she will come round <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion.</b> The girl is well enough, but not a fit {{associate}} for my wife, and it is better to get rid of-her now before making new friends." ...|$|E

40|$|Augustus Thomas, East Hampton, Long Island, New York, USA, letter, 1911 August 4, to Hamlin Garland, Boulder, Colorado, USA. "Replying to {{your letter}} {{concerning}} Mr. Mawson's play of 'Dombey and Son' and your enquiries as <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinions</b> on the subject, I {{have to tell}} you that I have never read 'Dombey and Son' and I have never seen the play in question. " [...] first line...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh,' I says, 'and what do {{they know}} about it--these gents that sit down and write about it for their living! You show me a book {{cracking}} up the old times, writ by a chap as lived in 'em, and I'll believe you. Till then I'll stick <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> that the old days were {{much the same as}} these days, and maybe a trifle worse.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{this was}} {{precisely}} the thing which Vivian had determined not to do; and so he diplomatised, {{in order to gain}} time. [...] "In stating, Mr. Cleveland, that the communication which I had to make was one of importance, I beg to be understood, that it was with reference merely <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> of its nature that that phrase was used, and not as relative to the possible, or, allow me to say, the probable, opinion of Mr. Cleveland." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Ethel! have I spoken a word {{contrary}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion?</b> It is not fit for me, {{a girl of}} twenty, to go disputing and dragooning as {{you would}} have me; but a little savoir faire, a grain of common sense, thrown in among the babble, always works. Don't you remember how Mrs. Ward's sister told us that a whole crowd of tottering Chinese ladies would lean on her, because they felt her firm support, though {{it was out of}} sight?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I were <b>to</b> express <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> of your behaviour," [...] Helen went on, {{picking up}} a pine cone and {{examining}} it, [...] "I might astonish you." ...|$|R
60|$|June 8.--In {{regard to}} Romayne, Mrs. Eyrecourt seems <b>to</b> be of <b>my</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm no just free <b>to</b> gie <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> stir," [...] {{said the}} {{cautious}} captive, [...] "on what might cost my neck; but I doubt {{it will be}} very little better." ...|$|R
6000|$|The form-master laughed. [...] "You evidently {{think that}} the 'Boy who would not grow up' must {{have been written by}} a 'grown-up who could never have been a boy.' Perhaps that is the meaning of the 'Never- never Land.' I daresay you're right in your criticism, but I don't agree with you about Bassington. He's a handful to deal with, as anyone knows who has come in contact with him, but if one's hands weren't full with a {{thousand}} and one other things I hold <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> that he could be tamed." ...|$|E
6000|$|As <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> then, {{namely that}} we cannot say {{what is the}} {{significance}} of an archaic pattern in Scotland, or elsewhere, though we may know the meaning assigned to it in Central Australia, there can no longer be any mistake. I take the blame of having misled Dr. Munro by an unguarded expression {{in a letter to the}} Society of Scottish Antiquaries, {67} saying that, if the disputed objects were genuine, they implied the survival, on Clyde, [...] "of a singularly archaic set of ritual and magical ideas," [...] namely those peculiar to the Arunta and Kaitish tribes of Central Australia. But that was a slip of the pen, merely.|$|E
6000|$|Dear Sir: In {{reply to}} your favour of July 2d, I have the [...] honour {{to inform you}} that, {{according}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion,</b> there [...] is no place on the habitable globe that presents to the eye [...] stronger evidence of the need of a first-class shoe store [...] than does the town of Coralio. There are 3,000 inhabitants [...] in the place, {{and not a single}} shoe store! The situation [...] speaks for itself. This coast is rapidly becoming the goal [...] of enterprising business men, but the shoe business is one [...] that has been sadly overlooked or neglected. In fact, there [...] are a considerable number of our citizens actually without [...] shoes at present.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no; I didn't suppose that," [...] {{returned}} {{the old man}} tranquilly. [...] "And I've since had reason <b>to</b> revise <b>my</b> <b>opinion.</b> I think he is interested in Mrs. Bowen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go on," [...] said Devine, drily. [...] "I'm {{generally}} quite willing <b>to</b> back <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> of a mine or man. Besides, I {{have picked}} up one or two pointers about you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Clarinda {{has done}} nothing of the sort," [...] I replied. [...] "She has not {{attempted}} <b>to</b> influence <b>my</b> <b>opinion.</b> I was really obliged to leave London, as I told you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, sir," [...] {{said the}} lawyer, [...] "we will come back, if you like, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> of Miss Gwilt. It doesn't at all agree with yours, I'm afraid. You think her {{an object of}} pity--quite natural at your age. I think her an object for {{the inside of a}} prison--quite natural at mine. You shall hear the grounds on which I have formed my opinion directly. Let me show you that I am in earnest by putting the opinion itself, in the first place, to a {{practical}} test. Do you think Miss Gwilt is likely to persist in paying you a visit, Mr. Armadale, after the answer you have just sent to her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not surprised," [...] he said, gravely, [...] "to {{hear that}} you are inclining more favorably <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion.</b> After what you have just told me, Mr. Vanstone, no {{sensible}} man could do otherwise. This is becoming serious. I hardly know what results may {{not be expected to}} follow the communication of your approaching change in life to Mrs. Lecount. My niece may be involved in those results. She is nervous; she is sensitive in the highest degree; she is the innocent object of this woman's unreasoning hatred and distrust. You alarm me, sir! I am not easily thrown off my balance, but I acknowledge you alarm me for the future." [...] He frowned, shook his head, and looked at his visitor despondently.|$|E
6000|$|... "And does nobody {{hunt the}} foxes about here at present?" [...] Then Morton {{explained}} {{that on the}} Saturday following the U. R. U. hounds, under the mastership of that celebrated sportsman Captain Glomax, would meet at eleven o'clock exactly at the spot on which they were then standing, and that if Mr. Gotobed would walk out after breakfast he should see the whole paraphernalia, including about half a hundred [...] "dogs," [...] and perhaps {{a couple of hundred}} men on horseback. [...] "I shall be delighted to see any institution of this great country," [...] said Mr. Gotobed, [...] "however much opposed it may be <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinion</b> either of utility or rational recreation." [...] Then, having nearly eaten up one cigar, he lit another preparatory to eating it, and sauntered back to the house.|$|E
60|$|We {{went to the}} Golden Cross at Charing Cross, then a mouldy sort of {{establishment}} in a close neighbourhood. A waiter showed me into the coffee-room; and a chambermaid introduced me <b>to</b> <b>my</b> small bedchamber, which smelt like a hackney-coach, and was shut up like a family vault. I was still painfully conscious of my youth, for nobody stood in any awe of me at all: the chambermaid being utterly indifferent <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>opinions</b> on any subject, and the waiter being familiar with me, and offering advice <b>to</b> <b>my</b> inexperience.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor am I accustomed, sir, to be {{interfered}} with in my official duties. I speak as a magistrate, Sir Lothian, but I am always ready <b>to</b> sustain <b>my</b> <b>opinions</b> as a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suits me, forsooth! Yes; he has pretended <b>to</b> make <b>my</b> <b>opinions</b> {{and tastes}} his own. He has humoured me for good reasons. I think, Polly, you and I will bid him good-by." ...|$|R
