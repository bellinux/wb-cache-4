5|$|Liukin decided <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{done with}} {{gymnastics}} {{and made her}} first post-Olympics competitive appearance at the CoverGirl Classic, where she competed only on balance beam. She placed second behind teammate Ivana Hong. Liukin thought about competing uneven bars and beam at the U.S. Championships, but decided to once again just perform on beam. She placed fourth and looked on track to possibly make a fourth World Championships team. Liukin {{was added to the}} national team and included in the World Championships selection camp. However, she pulled out of Worlds selection consideration because she felt <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> quite up to World Championships standards.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Emmy Noether and Emil Artin {{received}} the Ackermann–Teubner Memorial Award {{for their contributions}} to mathematics. The prize carried a monetary reward of 500Reichsmarks and {{was seen as a}} long-overdue official recognition of her considerable work in the field. Nevertheless, her colleagues expressed frustration at the fact <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> elected to the Göttingen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften (academy of sciences) and was never promoted to the position of Ordentlicher Professor (full professor).|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the anti-Semitic passages in her memoir were intended to be used as evidence <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> Jewish; alternatively, she may have been influenced by Ezra Pound's anti-Semitic radio broadcasts. Whatever the case, she did help a Jewish couple escape Italy, providing passage on a ship to the United States. By {{the end of the war}} her sympathies had again changed, and she saw the Allies as liberators.|$|E
40|$|A {{sensible}} epistemologist {{may not see}} how <b>she</b> {{could know}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a Brain In a Vat (BIV); but she doesn’t panic. She sticks with her empirical beliefs, and as that requires, believes <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a BIV. (<b>She</b> does not inferentially base her belief <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a BIV on her empirical knowledge—she rejects that ‘Moorean’ response to skepticism.) Drawing on the psychological literature on metacognition, I describe a mechanism that’s plausibly responsible for a sensible epistemologist coming to believe <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a BIV. I propose <b>she</b> thereby knows <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a BIV. The particular belief-forming mechanism employed explains why she overlooks this account of how <b>she</b> knows <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a BIV, making it seem {{that there is no}} way for her to know it. I argue this proposal satisfactorily resolves the skeptical puzzle...|$|R

5|$|Warren is {{a leading}} figure in the Democratic Party and is popular among American progressives. Although she {{repeatedly}} stated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> running for the presidency, Warren was frequently mentioned by political pundits as a strong potential candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Warren remained neutral during the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, endorsing presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton only after all fifty states had voted.|$|E
5|$|Winanta's father, Raden Koesoema, {{tells him}} that he should divorce his wife, Retnaningsih, to marry his cousin Fatimah, on threat of being disowned. To spare her husband from this fate, Retnaningsih decides to abandon him and moves from Bandung to Batavia (now Jakarta), where she lives a life of poverty. Unknown to her, this {{decision}} is used by Raden Koesoema as proof of her <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> trustworthy. Winanta falls into despair, but eventually marries Fatimah.|$|E
5|$|Annette O'Toole plays Martha Kent, Clark's adoptive mother. She and her husband, Jonathan, give Clark wise {{advice about}} coping with his {{increasing}} abilities. In season five Martha takes a state-senate seat, and in season six {{she leaves the}} show. Although Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent, during filming everyone (including Ettinger) realized <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> right for the part. O'Toole was committed to the television series The Huntress when Ettinger filmed the original pilot. Around the time the creators wanted to recast Martha Kent when The Huntress was canceled, allowing O'Toole to join the cast. The actress had played Lana Lang in Superman III.|$|E
50|$|Determined to help Jean, John sneaks {{back into}} her room and asks her if she {{will allow him to}} give her the {{injection}} of sodium pentathol. She agrees, and after the injection, discloses <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> married to Thorpe and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> Jean Patterson. Miss Dixon and Thorpe break into the room before Jean can continue, and John is escorted off the school grounds.|$|R
50|$|Miss Clavel: Madeline's {{teacher and}} minder. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> {{commonly}} {{believed to be}} a Catholic nun, due to her general appearance, but her attire in Bemelmans' illustrations is actually that of a nurse (the fact <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a nun <b>is</b> also evidenced by the fact <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> called Sister or Mother). <b>She</b> <b>is</b> always trying to keep Madeline out of trouble. Voiced by Stevie Vallance.|$|R

5|$|At the Boels Rental Hills Classic Van Dijk {{was part}} of front group that {{consisted}} of six riders which fell apart into {{a group of three}} riders. With an uphill finish, Van Dijk lost the sprint from Johansson (Orica-AIS) and finished second ahead of Amy Pieters (Rabo Liv). Van Dijk won the mountain classification of the race. In June, Van Dijk started as the main favourite at the Dutch National Time Trial Championships, but did not win her fourth time trial title. She finished second, with a margin of only 0.02 seconds, behind Annemiek van Vleuten (Rabo Liv). Van Dijk was disappointed and responded <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> that good as in 2013 without having a real explanation for it.|$|E
5|$|Charles Marowitz created A Macbeth in 1969, a {{streamlined}} {{version of}} the play which requires only eleven actors. The production strongly suggests that Lady Macbeth is in league with the witches. One scene shows her leading the three to a firelight incantation. In Eugène Ionesco's satirical {{version of the}} play Macbett (1972), one of the witches removes a costume to reveal that she is, in fact, Lady Duncan, and wants to be Macbeth's mistress. Once Macbeth is King and they are married, however, she abandons him, revealing <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> Lady Duncan all along, but a witch. The real Lady Duncan appears and denounces Macbeth as a traitor.|$|E
5|$|Charles VI's uncle, Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, {{thought the}} {{proposed}} marriage ideal {{to build an}} alliance with the Holy Roman Empire and against the English. Isabeau's father agreed reluctantly and sent her to France with his brother, her uncle, on the pretext of taking a pilgrimage to Amiens. He was adamant <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> to know she was being sent to France to be examined as a prospective bride for Charles, and refused permission {{for her to be}} examined in the nude, customary at the time. According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart, Isabeau was 13 or 14 when the match was proposed and about 16 {{at the time of the}} marriage in 1385, suggesting a birth date of around 1370.|$|E

5|$|Falke {{departed}} Montevideo {{and crossed}} the Atlantic to Dakar, proceeding to Las Palmas and then Lisbon. There she was visited by Frederick Augustus III of Saxony. She arrived in Danzig on 15 April, after {{five and a half}} years abroad. The ship was decommissioned on 20 January, and an evaluation determined <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> worth overhauling. She was accordingly stricken from the naval register on 25 October 1912 and broken up the following year at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig.|$|E
5|$|Her public profile rose {{even further}} {{when she was}} awarded Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize two months later in December. On 19 December 2011, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani awarded her the National Peace Award for Youth. At the {{proceedings}} in her honour, Yousafzai stated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a member of any political party, but hoped to found a national party of her own to promote education. The prime minister directed the authorities {{to set up an}} IT campus in the Swat Degree College for Women at Yousafzai's request, and a secondary school was renamed in her honour. By 2012, Yousafzai was planning to organise the Malala Education Foundation, which would help poor girls go to school.|$|E

Despite previously confirming her return, Leakes confirmed in September 2016 <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> asked back for the series' ninth season. The ninth season premiered on November 6, 2016, with Whitfield returning in a full-time capacity {{for the first time since}} the fourth season. Hampton and Morton made multiple guest appearances during the season, with former housewife Zolciak-Biermann making an appearance at the season's finale.|$|E

5|$|In March 2000, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} to permit {{assisted}} feeding of Terri, which is not considered a life-prolonging procedure under Florida law. Since clinical records indicated that Terri Schiavo was not responsive to swallowing tests and required a feeding tube, Judge Greer ruled <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> capable of orally ingesting sufficient nutrition and hydration to sustain life, and denied the request. The Medical Examiner in his postmortem report was more definitive and reaffirmed that Schiavo could not have swallowed.|$|E
5|$|Jun'yō was torpedoed in November 1943 {{and spent}} three months under repair. She was damaged by several bombs during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944, but quickly {{returned}} to service. Lacking aircraft, {{she was used}} as a transport in late 1944 and was torpedoed again in December. Jun'yō was under repair until March 1945, when work was cancelled as uneconomical. She was then effectively hulked {{for the rest of the}} war. After the surrender of Japan in September, the Americans also decided <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> worth the cost to make her serviceable for use as a repatriation ship, and she was broken up in 1946–1947.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 2016, Manning {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} after what media sources characterized as a suicide attempt. The following week, Manning confirmed through an attorney statement that she had attempted to end her own life. On July 28, 2016, the ACLU announced that Manning was under investigation and facing several possible charges related to her suicide attempt. She was not allowed to have legal representation at the disciplinary hearing for these charges. At the hearing, held on September 22, she was sentenced to 14 days in solitary confinement, with seven of those days suspended indefinitely. Manning emerged from solitary confinement on October 12, after serving seven days; she said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> given the opportunity to appeal the ruling before being placed in solitary.|$|E

5|$|The {{standard}} {{accounts of}} the life of Joan of Arc have been challenged by revisionist authors. Claims made by such authors include: that Joan of Arc was not actually burned at the stake; that she was secretly the half sister of King Charles VII; <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a true Christian but a member of a pagan cult; and that most of the story of Joan of Arc is actually a myth. None of these claims are widely accepted by historians.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to London in early 1937, {{recognising}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{going to be a}} success on the stage David abandoned thoughts of a theatrical career. Later in the year she took a post as a junior assistant at the fashion house of Worth, where smart young women from upper class backgrounds were sought after as recruits. She found the subservience of retail work irksome, and resigned in early 1938. Over the next few months she spent time holidaying in the south of France and on Corsica, where she was greatly taken with the outgoing nature of the people she stayed with and the simple excellence of their food. After returning to London, and disenchanted with life there, she joined Cowan in buying a boat, just big enough to suffice, with the intention of sailing it to Greece. They crossed the Channel in July 1939 and navigated the boat through the canal system of France to the Mediterranean coast.|$|E
5|$|After {{reporting}} {{appearances of}} a tall woman in black who vanishes, and her teacher recommending <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> herself, her mother {{took her to a}} physician. As a result, only two weeks before her death she was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia and hospitalized at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Lafayette, Louisiana. At the request of her family, she was informed by the hospital chaplain, Joseph Brennan, a newly ordained Catholic priest, {{that she was going to}} die. Though the illness was painful, she remained cheerful, meekly accepted her fate, and offered up her suffering to God. Brennan was deeply impressed by her faith and visited her daily. While dying, Richard prayed for other individuals to be healed or to be converted to Catholicism. The Director of Pediatrics at the hospital, Theresita Crowley, a nun, also witnessed her calm acceptance of suffering and prayers for others. Brennan and Crowley claimed that those for whom Richard prayed recovered from their illnesses or became Catholic. Richard died on 11 August 1959.|$|E
