5|$|Northrop Grumman and Raytheon {{decided in}} 2002 to locate its ground station for National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the {{successor}} of EOS, to Helsinki, Finland, instead of Svalbard. The reason was lack of {{optical fiber cable}} connection to the archipelago. NSC took initiative to build such a cable in July 2002 and gained interest from NASA, NOAA and Telenor. The cable was financed by the satellite operators paying the same fee for the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> {{as they would have}} to pay for a satellite connection until the cable was paid for. A 40 million United States dollar contract was signed with Tyco International for two cables between Harstad on the mainland and Longyearbyen.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel algorithm for secure, reliable and flexible <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> big <b>data</b> in two hop wireless networks using cooperative jamming scheme. Two hop wireless networks consist of source, relay and destination nodes. Big data has to transmit from source to relay and from relay to destination by deploying security in physical layer. Cooperative jamming scheme determines <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> big <b>data</b> in more secure manner by protecting it from eavesdroppers and malicious nodes of unknown location. The novel algorithm that ensures secure and energy balance <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> big <b>data,</b> includes selection <b>of</b> <b>data</b> transmitting region, segmenting the selected region, determining probability ratio for each node (capture node, non-capture and eavesdropper node) in every segment, evaluating the probability using binary based evaluation. If it is secure transmission resume with the two- hop <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> big <b>data,</b> otherwise prevent the attackers by cooperative jamming scheme and transmit {{the data in}} two-hop transmission.

2500|$|Part of {{the reason}} for the delay between the {{gathering}} of and <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> is that all of the New Horizons instrumentation is body-mounted.

[...] Previous spacecraft, such as the Voyager program probes, had a rotatable instrumentation platform (a [...] "scan platform") that could take measurements from virtually any angle without losing radio contact with Earth. New Horizons elimination of excess mechanisms was implemented to save weight, shorten the schedule, and improve reliability during its 15-year lifetime.|$|E
