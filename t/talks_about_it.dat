If the leader is popular, leadership {{will be seen as}} an attractive goal, and the Scout will follow the example of the leader. The Scoutmaster living the Scout law will have more influence than one who simply <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> In the boys' eyes it is what a man does that counts and not so much what he says.|$|E
500|$|Regarding her {{involvement}} in a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, Foster confirmed to Larry King in 1997 that she [...] "would definitely be part of it." [...] She told Entertainment Weekly magazine in 1997 that [...] "Anthony Hopkins always <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I mean, everybody wants to do it. Every time I see him, it's like: 'When {{is it going to}} happen? When is it going to happen?'" [...] De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, even believing the final film was better for it. Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a [...] "hunch" [...] she would not be. Foster did turn it down, confirming this in late December 1999.|$|E
500|$|... "Harvest Festival" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel J. Goor and {{directed}} by Dean Holland. The episode marked {{the culmination of a}} seven-episode story arc that began with the third season premiere, [...] "Go Big or Go Home", in which Leslie and the parks department prepare to relaunch the harvest festival, which had previously been a Pawnee tradition before it ended. The storyline stemmed from serious budget problems facing Pawnee which forced a government shutdown and threatened major cuts to the parks department, prompting Leslie to bring the harvest festival back and stake the future of the entire department on its success or failure. Amy Poehler said she believed the storyline was appropriate for a series about small government and was well handled by the writers: [...] "What I like about the show is it doesn't spend 25 episodes talking about this thing, it <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in the right amount of time. It happens and then there's consequences of it. The show keeps moving forward, which is always really fun." ...|$|E

500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{a great deal}} of the scenes in [...] "Rock Show" [...] were improvised by the actors. Paul Schneider made up his own {{dialogue}} during the scene in which he and Poehler sit next to the pit and he <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> as if it is already a park. Poehler's laughter at his jokes in this scene is her genuine reaction. Pratt also improvised much of his own dialogue, including his rationale to Ann for why he lied about his leg casts: [...] "I really, really like it when you serve me food." [...] Pratt also changed the reaction his character had to Mark falling into the pit. The script originally called for Andy to be serious and concerned, but Pratt changed it so his character thought the fall was funny. Pratt also improvised the songs he sang during an early scene in the episode, in which Andy makes up songs about random items in Ann's living room out of boredom from wearing the casts for so long. One of the songs he sings is about a lamp, and included the lyrics, [...] "I wish you were a lamp that would light up when you get touched." [...] Pratt thought of the song because he had recently gotten such a lamp as a gift from a friend.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a private}} correspondence, Wolfgang Pauli {{formulated}} in 1953 a six-dimensional theory of Einstein's field equations of general relativity, extending the five-dimensional theory of Kaluza, Klein, Fock {{and others to}} a higher-dimensional internal space. However, {{there is no evidence}} that Pauli developed the Lagrangian of a gauge field or the quantization of it. Because Pauli found that his theory [...] "leads to some rather unphysical shadow particles”, he refrained from publishing his results formally. Although Pauli did not publish his six-dimensional theory, he gave two <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in Zürich. Recent research shows that an extended Kaluza–Klein theory is in general not equivalent to Yang–Mills theory, as the former contains additional terms.|$|E
2500|$|Nearing {{the end of}} the season, Perry {{continued}} his torrid scoring pace. On March 9, Perry scored two more goals, his 32nd and 33rd goal of the season, surpassing his previous career-high, single-season goal tally. Perry scored another goal in a win against Colorado. In the next game, he scored the only two goals as the Ducks lost to the Phoenix Coyotes. From March 19 through April 6, Perry recorded a least a point in ten consecutive games, later taking the League scoring lead from Steven Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning when he scored two goals against the defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks. He then recorded his third career hat-trick in a game against the San Jose Sharks on April 6, with his third of the game giving him 50 for the year. After reaching the mark, he became just the third Ducks player to record a 50-goal season, joining Teemu Selänne and Paul Kariya. [...] "Fifty is a huge number," [...] Perry said after being serenaded with [...] "M-V-P!" [...] chants from the Honda Center crowd in Anaheim.

[...] Sadly, the people most affected by the spills get rewarded not even a penny for their agony". Amata stated in an interview {{that the purpose of the}} film is to [...] "bring to light the injustice and inhumane situation of the Niger Delta", he also said [...] "If BP can be made to compensate the people of the Gulf of Mexico, why can't the world make the oil companies polluting our land make amends? We have been suffering spills the size of Exxon Valdez for 50 years, yet no one <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> as long as they benefit from the oil." [...] The producer of the film Dede Mabiaku says Black November is [...] "an eye-opening movie with a cause" [...] which he says should be able to encourage people to fight for the immediate clean-up of the Niger Delta. The Guardian states; [...] "Amata's film is weighing into the 50-year history of western exploitation of the delta's oil resources, local collusion and violent resistance to it".|$|E
