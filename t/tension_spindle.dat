40|$|The APC/C is a {{ubiquitin}} ligase (E 3) that targets proteins for cell cycle-regulated proteolysis through ubiquitination. Cdc 23 p, an APC/C subunit, directly binds the mitotic cyclin, Clb 2 p, {{and associates}} with the kinetochore protein Okp 1 p by two-hybrid analysis. ^ In these studies, the APC/C has been localized in budding yeast by tagging two APC/C subunits, CDC 23 (APC 8) and APC 9 with {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP). Microscopic analysis of CDC 23 -GFP and APC 9 -GFP indicates that the APC/C is nuclear throughout the cell cycle. In addition, the complex is targeted to small nuclear spots co-localizing with two kinetochore proteins, Slk 19 p and Okp 1 p. The APC/C also co-localizes with the mitotic anaphase spindle. Regulation of APC/C localization may be one mechanism for controlling APC/C activity. To test this model, APC/C kinetochore localization has been monitored after spindle checkpoint activation. This checkpoint can halt the cell cycle upon spindle damage by inactivating the APC/C. APC/C kinetochore localization is disrupted upon checkpoint activation in an okp 1 - 5 kinetochore mutant and after nocodazole treatment. However, spindle checkpoint activation by overexpression of MPS 1 does not cause a loss of the sub-nuclear localization of the APC/C. In the ndc 10 - 1 kinetochore mutant, which lacks a checkpoint sensor, the APC/C localization is unchanged. Therefore, {{in the case of}} defective microtubule-kinetochore attachment and/or <b>tension,</b> <b>spindle</b> checkpoint activation results in displacement of the APC/C from the kinetochore, a possible mechanism of APC/C inactivation. In addition, these studies indicate that the APC/C regulator Cdc 20 p plays a role in maintaining the APC/C at the kinetochore. ...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{distribution}} of genetic material {{is critical for}} the formation of functional cells and their proliferation. During cell division, sister chromatids separate from each other and segregate to opposite poles. To ensure accurate chromosome segregation all sister chromatids should be attached to microtubules from opposite spindle poles, known as bi-orientation. Cohesin is a protein complex that holds sister chromatids together from the time of its replication in S phase until anaphase onset, and it is required for proper chromosome segregation both in mitosis and in meiosis. It is distributed intermittently along the full length of chromosomes with significant enrichment in the region surrounding the centromere, known as the pericentromere. This chromosome domain was shown to be crucial for chromosome bi-orientation. In my PhD I studied how the establishment of tension between sister chromatids in the process of bi-orientation affects the {{distribution of}} different pericentromeric proteins on budding yeast chromosomes. It was known that levels of cohesin at the pericentromere are decreased in response to the establishment of tension. I demonstrate that other proteins, such as subunits of condensin, members of the Chromosome Passenger Complex (CPC) and others, exhibit similar dynamics, and suggest a model to explain this phenomenon. Out of all studied proteins, Shugoshin (Sgo 1) {{was the only one that}} was completely removed from the pericentromere in response to <b>spindle</b> <b>tension</b> establishment. There is evidence that Sgo 1 plays a role in sensing <b>spindle</b> <b>tension</b> and halting the cell cycle until this has been achieved but how it does so is not known. Therefore, removal of Shugoshin from the pericentromere might be a signal for the cell that bi-orientation occurred. I then found that <b>spindle</b> <b>tension</b> itself is not sufficient for Sgo 1 re-localization from the pericentromere, and there are other factors that affect it. I showed that deletion of RTS 1, a highly conserved regulatory subunit of Protein Phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A), results in substantial enrichment of Shugoshin at the pericentromere in the situation when <b>spindle</b> <b>tension</b> is absent. In addition, Bub 1 kinase, a protein that is required for Sgo 1 localization, was found to be removed from the centromere in response to <b>spindle</b> <b>tension</b> as well as Sgo 1. The role of Bub 1 the in localization of Shugoshin is to phosphorylate histone H 2 A, which then becomes a mark for Sgo 1 loading. Therefore, we assume that Sgo 1 dynamics and, potentially, its role in sensing bi-orientation, are regulated through the array of phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation events at the pericentromeric area. Finally, I have also found that budding yeast Sgo 1 undergoes the posttranslational modification as sumoylation. I showed that sumoylation of Shugoshin is not required for its removal from the pericentromere during biorientation. However, it might be important for the regulation of Sgo 1 degradation and its role in the metaphase to anaphase transition in mitosis...|$|R

40|$|Chromosome bi-orientation occurs after {{conversion}} of initial lateral attachments between kinetochores and spindle microtubules into stable end-on attachments near the cell equator. After bi-orientation, chromosomes experience <b>tension</b> from <b>spindle</b> forces, which {{plays a key}} role in the stabilization of correct kinetochore-microtubule attachments. However, how end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments are first stabilized in the absence of tension remains a key unanswered question. To address this, we generated Drosophila S 2 cells undergoing mitosis with unreplicated genomes (SMUGs). SMUGs retained single condensed chromatids that attached laterally to spindle microtubules. Over time, laterally attached kinetochores converted into end-on attachments and experienced intra-kinetochore stretch/structural deformation, and SMUGs eventually exited a delayed mitosis with mono-oriented chromosomes after satisfying the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC). Polar ejection forces (PEFs) generated by Chromokinesins promoted the conversion from lateral to end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments that satisfied the SAC in SMUGs. Thus, PEFs convert lateral to stable end-on kinetochore-microtubule attachments, independently of chromosome bi-orientation...|$|R

The checkpoint monitors attachment between kinetochores and mitotic <b>spindles</b> and the <b>tension</b> between sister kinetochores.

Moreover, Mad 1 p associates with the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and is enriched at kinetochores upon checkpoint activation. Using partial mad 1 deletion alleles we determined that the C-terminal half of Mad 1 p is necessary and sufficient for checkpoint activation in response to microtubule depolymerizing agents, high-fidelity transmission of a reporter chromosome fragment, and in vivo association with centromeres, but not for robust NPC association. Thus, spindle checkpoint activation and chromosome transmission fidelity correlate and these Mad 1 p functions likely involve kinetochore association but not robust NPC association. These studies are the basis for elucidating the role of protein complexes containing Mad 1 p in the spindle checkpoint pathway and in maintaining genome stability in S. cerevisiae and other systems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn mitosis, {{cohesion}} {{appears to}} be present along {{the entire length of}} the chromosome, between centromeres and along chromosome arms. By metaphase, sister chromatids appear as two adjacent but visibly distinct rods [1 – 4]. Sister chromatids separate from one another in anaphase by releasing all chromosome cohesion. This is different from meiosis I, in which pairs of sister chromatids separate from one another, moving to each spindle pole by releasing cohesion only between sister chromatid arms [5 – 8]. Then, in anaphase II, sister chromatids separate by releasing centromere cohesion. Our objective was to find where cohesion is present or absent on chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis and when and how it is released. We determined cohesion directly by pulling on chromosomes with two micromanipulation needles. Thus, we could distinguish for the first time between apparent doubleness as seen in the microscope and physical separability. We found that apparent doubleness can be deceiving: Visibly distinct sister chromatids often cannot be separated. We also demonstrated that cohesion is released gradually in anaphase, with chromosomes looking as if they were unzipped or pulled apart. This implied that <b>tension</b> from <b>spindle</b> forces was required, but we showed directly that no tension was necessary to pull chromatids apart...|$|R

A number of proteins, including mad 2, bub 1, and bubR 1, have {{been implicated in}} the metaphase checkpoint control in mammalian cells. Metaphase checkpoints have been shown, in various systems, to read loss of either <b>spindle</b> <b>tension</b> or microtubule attachment at the kinetochore. Characteristically, HeLa cells arrest in metaphase in response to low levels of microtubule inhibitors that leave an intact spindle and a metaphase plate. Here we show that the arrest induced by nanomolar vinblastine correlates with loss of tension at the kinetochore, and that in response the checkpoint proteins bub 1 and bubR 1 are recruited to the kinetochore but mad 2 is not. mad 2 remains competent to respond and is recruited at higher drug doses that disrupt spindle association with the kinetochores. Further, although mad 2 forms a complex with cdc 20, it does not associate with bub 1 or bubR 1.

40|$|Dynamic {{attachment}} of microtubules to kinetochores during mitosis generates pulling force, or tension, {{required for}} the high fidelity of chromosome separation. A lack of <b>tension</b> activates the <b>spindle</b> checkpoint and delays the anaphase onset. A key step in the tension–response pathway involves the phosphorylation of the 3 F 3 / 2 epitope by an unknown kinase on untensed kinetochores. Using a rephosphorylation assay in Xenopus laevis extracts, we identified the kinetochore-associated Polo-like kinase Plx 1 as the kinase both necessary and sufficient for this phosphorylation. Indeed, Plx 1 is the physiological 3 F 3 / 2 kinase involved in checkpoint response, as immunodepletion of Plx 1 from checkpoint extracts abolished the 3 F 3 / 2 signal and blocked association of xMad 2, xBubR 1, xNdc 80, and xNuf 2 with kinetochores. Interestingly, the kinetochore localization of Plx 1 is {{under the control of}} the checkpoint protein xMps 1, as immunodepletion of xMps 1 prevents binding of Plx 1 to kinetochores.

40|$|The {{ring-shaped}} cohesin complex links sister chromatids {{until their}} timely segregation during mitosis. Cohesin is enriched at centromeres where {{it provides the}} cohesive counterforce to bipolar tension produced by the mitotic spindle. As a consequence of <b>spindle</b> <b>tension,</b> centromeric sequences transiently split in pre-anaphase cells, in some organisms up to several micrometers. This ‘centromere breathing’ presents a paradox, how sister sequences separate where cohesin is most enriched. We now show that in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cohesin binding diminishes over centromeric sequences that split during breathing. We see no evidence for cohesin translocation to surrounding sequences, suggesting that cohesin is removed from centromeres during breathing. Two pools of cohesin can be distinguished. Cohesin loaded before DNA replication, which has established sister chromatid cohesion, disappears during breathing. In contrast, cohesin loaded after DNA replication is partly retained. As sister centromeres re-associate after transient separation, cohesin is reloaded in a manner independent of the canonical cohesin loader Scc 2 /Scc 4. Efficient centromere re-association requires the cohesion establishment factor Eco 1, suggesting that re-establishment of sister chromatid cohesion contributes to the dynamic behaviour of centromeres in mitosis. These findings provide new insights into cohesin behaviour at centromeres...|$|R

However, the apparent lack of such controls in model organisms has excluded genetic proof that Topo II checkpoints exist and are separable from the conventional DNA damage checkpoint controls. But here, we define a Topo II-dependent G 2 /M checkpoint in a genetically amenable eukaryote, budding yeast, and demonstrate that this checkpoint enhances cell survival. Conversely, a lack of the checkpoint results in aneuploidy. Neither DNA damage-responsive pathways nor Pds 1 /securin are needed for this checkpoint.

During metaphase, the dynein-dynactin complex removes spindle checkpoint proteins from kinetochores to facilitate the transition to anaphase. Three components (p 150 Glued, dynamitin, and p 24) compose a key portion of the dynactin complex, termed the projecting arm. To investigate the roles of the dynactin complex in mitosis, we used RNA interference to down-regulate p 24 and p 150 Glued in human cells. In response to p 24 down-regulation, we observed cells with delayed metaphase in which chromosomes frequently align abnormally to resemble a “figure eight,” resulting in cell death. We attribute the figure eight chromosome alignment to impaired metaphasic centrosomes that lack <b>spindle</b> <b>tension.</b> Like p 24, RNA interference of p 150 Glued also induces prometaphase and metaphase delays; however, most of these cells eventually enter anaphase and complete mitosis.

To achieve this goal, human behaviors during point-to-point reaching in multiple novel dynamic environments were examined and neural coding schemes in the brain were inferred from the observed behaviors, e. g. the pattern of generalization. The patterns of generalization across limb position in multiple dynamic conditions suggested that the internal model encodes limb position and velocity using a gain-field scheme. That is, neural elements in the brain seem to encode limb velocity and position multiplicatively. This multiplicative combining scheme seems to extend to encoding of limb velocity and acceleration as the pattern of generalization across acceleration space rejects a linearly separable encoding of acceleration and velocity. The nonlinear combining of all sensory information in the brain might originate from {{the properties of the}} proprioceptive sensors in our body, muscle spindles.

Attachment sites within the kinetochore outer plate generate microtubule dependent forces for chromosome movement and regulate spindle checkpoint protein assembly at the kinetochore. The Ndc 80 complex, comprised of Ndc 80 (Hec 1), Nuf 2, Spc 24, and Spc 25, is essential for metaphase chromosome alignment and anaphase chromosome segregation. It has also been suggested to have roles in kinetochore microtubule formation, production of kinetochore <b>tension,</b> and the <b>spindle</b> checkpoint. Here we show that Nuf 2 and Hec 1 localize throughout the outer plate, and not the corona, of the vertebrate kinetochore. They are part of a stable “core” region whose assembly dynamics are distinct from other outer domain spindle checkpoint and motor proteins. Furthermore, Nuf 2 and Hec 1 are required for formation and/or maintenance of the outer plate structure itself. Fluorescence light microscopy, live cell imaging, and electron microscopy provide quantitative data demonstrating that Nuf 2 and Hec 1 are essential for normal kinetochore microtubule attachment.

40|$|Chromosome {{segregation}} machinery {{is controlled}} by mechanochemical regulation. Tension in a mitotic spindle, which is balanced by molecular motors and polymerization-depolymerization dynamics of microtubules, {{is thought to be}} essential for determining the timing of chromosome segregation after the establishment of the kinetochore-microtubule attachments. It is not known, however, whether and how applied mechanical forces modulate the tension balance and chemically affect the molecular processes involved in chromosome segregation. Here we found that a mechanical impulse externally applied to mitotic HeLa cells alters the balance of forces within the mitotic spindle. We identified two distinct mitotic responses to the applied mechanical force that either facilitate or delay anaphase onset, depending on the direction of force and the extent of cell compression. An external mechanical impulse that physically increases tension within the mitotic spindle accelerates anaphase onset, and this is attributed to the facilitation of physical cleavage of sister chromatid cohesion. On the other hand, a decrease in <b>tension</b> activates the <b>spindle</b> assembly checkpoint, which impedes the degradation of mitotic proteins and delays the timing of chromosome segregation. Thus, the external mechanical force acts as a crucial regulator for metaphase progression, modulating the internal force balance and thereby triggering specific mechanochemical cellular reactions...|$|R

They {{are found in}} organisms ranging from bacteria to humans and are implicated in genome instability, evolution, and cancer. In budding yeast, inactivation of Mec 1, a homolog of mammalian ATR, leads to chromosome breakage at fragile sites referred to as replication slow zones (RSZs). RSZs are proposed to be homologous to mammalian common fragile sites (CFSs) whose stability is regulated by ATR. Perturbation during S phase, leading to elevated levels of stalled replication forks, is necessary but not sufficient for chromosome breakage at RSZs or CFSs. To address the nature of additional event(s) required for the break formation, we examined involvement of the currently known or implicated mechanisms of endogenous chromosome breakage, including errors in replication fork restart, premature mitotic chromosome condensation, <b>spindle</b> <b>tension,</b> anaphase, and cytokinesis. Results revealed that chromosome breakage at RSZs is independent of the RAD 52 epistasis group genes and of TOP 3, SGS 1, SRS 2, MMS 4, or MUS 81, indicating that homologous recombination and other recombination-related processes associated with replication fork restart {{are unlikely to be}} involved. We also found spindle force, anaphase, or cytokinesis to be dispensable. RSZ breakage, however, required genes encoding condensin subunits (YCG 1, YSC 4) and topoisomerase II (TOP 2).

Interference with either survivin or Plk 1 activity manifests many similar outcomes: prometaphase delay/arrest, multinucleation, and increased apoptosis. Moreover, the expression of both survivin and Plk 1 is deregulated in cancer. Given these similarities, we speculated that these two proteins may cooperate during mitosis and/or in cell death pathways. Here we report that survivin and Plk 1 interact during mitosis and that Plk 1 phosphorylates survivin at serine 20. Importantly, we find that overexpression of a non-phosphorylatable version, S 20 A, is unable to correct chromosomes connected to the spindle in a syntelic manner during prometaphase and allows cells harboring these maloriented chromosomes to enter anaphase, evading the <b>spindle</b> <b>tension</b> checkpoint. By contrast, the constitutive phosphomimic, S 20 D, completes congression and division ahead of schedule and, unlike S 20 A, is able to support proliferation {{in the absence of}} the endogenous protein. Despite the importance of this residue in mitosis, its mutation does not appear to affect the anti-apoptotic activity of survivin in response to TRAIL.

This result suggested that the asters pull on the <b>spindle</b> poles, putting <b>tension</b> on the <b>spindle,</b> while the spindle acts as a governor, limiting the rate of pole separation. To further test these inferences, we used a UV-laser microbeam to damage one of the two asters in living PtK 2 cells at early anaphase B and monitored the effects on individual spindle pole movements, pole-pole separation rates and astral microtubules (MTs). Irradiation at the estimated position of a centrosome greatly reduced its array of astral MTs and nearly stopped the movement of the irradiated pole, whereas the sister pole retained its normal array of astral MTs and actually accelerated. Control irradiations, either close to the estimated position of the centrosome or beside the spindle at the equator, had little or no effect on either spindle pole movements or astral MTs. These results support the inferences that during anaphase B in living PtK cells, the central <b>spindle</b> is under <b>tension</b> generated by pulling forces in the asters (presumably MT-mediated) and that the spindle generates counterforces that limit the rate of pole separation. The results also suggest that the central spindle in living PtK cells may be able to generate a pushing force...|$|R

Immunoblot analysis showed that Survivin was no longer detectable in cultures 60 hours after transfection with Survivin-specific siRNA. Live cell analysis showed that many Survivin-depleted cells were delayed in mitosis, and immunofluorescence analysis of fixed specimens revealed that Survivin-depleted cells accumulated in prometaphase with misaligned chromosomes. The chromosomal passenger proteins, INCENP and Aurora-B, which can interact directly with Survivin, were absent from the centromeres of Survivin-depleted cells. These data contribute to the emerging picture that Survivin operates together with INCENP and Aurora-B to perform its mitotic duties. Some Survivin-depleted cells eventually exited mitosis without completing cytokinesis. This resulted in a gradual increase {{in the percentage of}} multinucleated cells in the culture. Time-lapse imaging of synchronized cultures revealed that control and Survivin-depleted cells arrested in mitosis in the presence of nocodazole; however, the latter failed to arrest in mitosis when treated with taxol. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that Survivindepleted cells were unable to stably maintain BubR 1 at the kinetochores in the presence of either taxol or nocodazole.

It is widely accepted that in marsupials X and Y chromosomes do not share homologous regions, and during male first meiotic prophase the synaptonemal complex is absent between them. Although these sex chromosomes do not recombine, they segregate reductionally in anaphase I. We have investigated the nature of sex chromosome association in spermatocytes of the marsupial Thylamys elegans, in order to discern the mechanisms involved in ensuring their proper segregation. We focused on the localization of the axial/ lateral element protein SCP 3 and the cohesin subunit STAG 3. Our results show that X and Y chromosomes never appear as univalents in metaphase I, but they remain associated until they orientate and segregate to opposite poles. However, they must not be tied by a chiasma since their separation precedes {{the release of the}} sister chromatid cohesion. Instead, we show they are associated by the dense plate, a SCP 3 -rich structure that is organized during the first meiotic prophase and that is still present at metaphase I. Surprisingly, the dense plate incorporates SCP 1, the main protein of the central element of the synaptonemal complex, from diplotene until telophase I. Once sex chromosomes are under <b>spindle</b> <b>tension,</b> they move to opposite poles losing contact with the dense plate and undergoing early segregation.

At low concentrations, it suppresses the growth phase of microtubule dynamic instability in interphase cells, arrests mitosis, and induces apoptosis, suggesting that suppression of spindle microtubule dyna-mics induces mitotic arrest. To further test this hypothe-sis, we measured {{the effects of}} eribulin on dynamics of centromeres and their attached kinetochore microtubules by time-lapse confocal microscopy in living mitotic U- 2 OS human osteosarcoma cells. Green fluorescent protein– labeled centromere-binding protein B marked centromeres and kinetochore-microtubule plus-ends. In control cells, sister chromatid centromere pairs alternated under tension between increasing and decreasing separation (stretching and relaxing). Eribulin suppressed centromere dynamics at concentrations that arrest mitosis. At 60 nmol/L eribulin (2 mitotic IC 50), the relaxation rate was suppressed 21 %, the time spent paused increased 67 %, and dynamicity decreased 35 % (but without reduction in mean centromere separation), indicating that eribulin decreased normal microtubule-dependent <b>spindle</b> <b>tension</b> at the kinetochores, preventing the signal for mitotic checkpoint passage. We also examined a more potent, but in tumors less efficacious antiproliferative halichondrin derivative, ER- 076349. At 2 IC 50 (4 nmol/L), mitotic arrest also occurred in concert with suppressed centro-mere dynamics. Although media IC 50 values differed 15 -fold between the two compounds, the intracellular concentrations were similar, indicating more extensive relative uptake of ER- 076349 into cells compared with eribulin. The strong correlation between suppression of kinetochore-microtubule dynamics and mitotic arrest indicates that the primary mechanism by which eribulin blocks mitosis is suppression of spindle microtubule dynamics.

Molecular dynamics simulations predict that, at forces expected in living systems, PR 65 undergoes (visco-) elastic deformations {{in response to}} pulling/pushing on its ends. At lower forces, smooth global flexural and torsional changes occur via even redistribution of stress along the hydrophobic core of the molecule. At intermediate forces, helix–helix separation along one layer (“fracturing”) leads to global relaxation plus loss of contact in the other layer to unstack the affected units. Fracture sites are determined by unusual sequences in contiguous interhelix turns. Normal mode analysis of the heterotrimeric PP 2 A enzyme reveals that its ambient conformational fluctuations are dominated by elastic deformations of PR 65, which introduce a mechanical linkage between the separately bound regulatory and catalytic subunits. PR 65 -dominated fluctuations of PP 2 A {{have the effect of}} opening and closing the enzyme’s substrate binding/catalysis interface, as well as altering the positions of certain catalytic residues. These results suggest that substrate binding/catalysis are sensitive to mechanical force.

5000|$|The SAC {{monitors}} {{the interaction between}} improperly connected kinetochores and spindle microtubules, and is maintained until kinetochores are properly attached to the spindle. During prometaphase, CDC20 and the SAC proteins concentrate at the kinetochores before attachment to the spindle assembly. These proteins keep the SAC activated until they are removed and the correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment is made. Even a single unattached kinetochore can maintain the spindle checkpoint. After attachment of microtubule plus-ends and formation of kinetochore microtubules, MAD1 and MAD2 are depleted from the kinetochore assembly. Another regulator of checkpoint activation is kinetochore tension. When sister kinetochores are properly attached to opposite spindle poles, forces in the mitotic <b>spindle</b> generate <b>tension</b> at the kinetochores. Bi-oriented sister kinetochores stabilize the kinetochore-microtubule assembly whereas weak tension has a destabilizing effect. In response to incorrect kinetochore attachments such as syntelic attachment, where both kinetochores becomes attached to one spindle pole, the weak tension generated destabilizes the incorrect attachment and allows the kinetochore to reattach correctly to the spindle body. During this process, kinetochores that {{are attached to the}} mitotic spindle but that are not under <b>tension</b> trigger the <b>spindle</b> checkpoint. Aurora-B/Ipl1 kinase of the chromosomal passenger complex functions as the tensions sensor in improper kinetochore attachments. It detects and destabilizes incorrect attachments through control of the microtubule-severing KINI kinesin MCAK, the DASH complex, and the Ndc80/Hec1 complex [...] at the microtubule-kinetochore interface. The Aurora-B/Ipl1 kinase is also critical in correcting merotelic attachments, where one kinetochore is simultaneously attached to both spindle poles. Merotelic attachments generate sufficient tension and are not detected by the SAC, and without correction, may result in chromosome mis-segregation due to slow chromatid migration speed. While microtubule attachment is independently required for SAC activation, it is unclear whether tension is an independent regulator of SAC, although it is clear that differing regulatory behaviors arise with tension.|$|R
40|$|To {{maintain}} genetic integrity, eukaryotic cells must faithfully segregate their chromosomes to daughter cells during mitosis. Errors during bi-orientation lead to aneuploidy, {{a hallmark}} of human cancers. A highly conserved mechanism termed the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) delays the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes have correctly aligned on the metaphase plate. The proteins responsible for the SAC signal include Mad 1, Mad 2, BubR 1 (Mad 3 in fission yeast), Bub 1, Bub 3 and Mph 1 kinase. The SAC monitors <b>tension</b> across the <b>spindle</b> and the attachment status of kinetochores; large, proteinaceous structures that assemble on centromeres during mitosis, and is maintained until all kinetochores are properly attached to microtubules. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at the kinetochore also regulate chromosome biorientation. Although the SAC has been intensively studied, the exact kinetochore binding site of some SAC components and regulatory mechanisms surrounding the SAC are poorly understood. I have shown, subsequent to previous work which implicated Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP 1) in SAC silencing, that two PP 1 -binding motifs within the N-terminus of kinetochore protein Spc 7 (KNL- 1 in human cells) bind Dis 2, a fission yeast homologue of PP 1, in vitro. This interaction is essential for viability and efficient SAC silencing. I also present data implicating kinesin motor proteins Klp 5 and Klp 6 in PP 1 -binding and SAC silencing. Furthermore, I have established a role for the Spc 7 MELT motifs in recruiting Bub 1, Bub 3 and Mad 3 to the kinetochores using phospho-null (spc 7 - 9 TA) and phosphomimetic (spc 7 - 9 TE) mutants, and present evidence that this interaction {{is required for the}} recruitment of other SAC components. Additionally, the MELT motifs have a role in SAC maintenance and chromosome segregation, and spc 7 - 9 TE cells are able to silence the SAC more efficiently than wild type cells. Results presented in this thesis highlight KNL- 1 as a major platform for SAC silencing at the kinetochore and will likely form the basis of future studies within the field of mitosis...|$|R
40|$|The B-type cyclin Clb 5 is {{involved}} primarily {{in control of}} DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We conducted a synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis, testing for synthetic lethality between the clb 5 deletion and a selected 87 deletions related to diverse aspects of cell cycle control based on GO annotations. Deletion of the spindle checkpoint genes BUB 1 and BUB 3 caused synthetic lethality with clb 5. The spindle checkpoint monitors the attachment of spindles to the kinetochore or <b>spindle</b> <b>tension</b> during early mitosis. However, another spindle checkpoint gene, MAD 2, could be deleted without ill effects {{in the absence of}} CLB 5, suggesting that the bub 1 / 3 clb 5 synthetic lethality reflected some function other than the spindle checkpoint of Bub 1 and Bub 3. To characterize the lethality of bub 3 clb 5 cells, we constructed a temperature-sensitive clb 5 allele. At nonpermissive temperature, bub 3 clb 5 -ts cells showed defects in spindle elongation and cytokinesis. High-copy plasmid suppression of bub 3 clb 5 lethality identified the C-terminal fragment of BIR 1, the yeast homolog of survivin; cytologically, the BIR 1 fragment rescued the growth and cytokinesis defects. Bir 1 interacts with IplI (Aurora B homolog), and the addition of bub 3 clb 5 -ts significantly enhanced the lethality of the temperature-sensitive ipl 1 - 321. Overall, we conclude that the synthetic lethality between clb 5 and bub 1 or bub 3 is likely related to functions of Bub 1 / 3 unrelated to their spindle checkpoint function. We tested requirements for other B-type cyclins in the absence of spindle checkpoint components. In the absence of the related CLB 3 and CLB 4 cyclins, the spindle integrity checkpoint becomes essential, since bub 3 or mad 2 deletion is lethal in a clb 3 clb 4 background. clb 3 clb 4 mad 2 cells accumulated with unseparated spindle pole bodies. Thus, different B-type cyclins are required for distinct aspects of spindle morphogenesis and function, as revealed by differential genetic interactions with spindle checkpoint components...|$|R

Advisor: Duncan J Clarke, PhD. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 132 pages, appendix p. 100 - 132. Sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome condensation are two essential cell cycle processes for maintaining genome stability. Pds 1 {{is the only}} known regulator for maintaining cohesion between sister chromatids during S phase till anaphase onset by inhibiting Esp 1 activity, which is important for preventing aberrant chromosome segregation. However, pds 1 null yeast are viable and able to keep cohesion during S phase. This indicates a redundant pathway maintains sister chromatid cohesion {{in the absence of}} Pds 1. We have identified the Pds 1 -independent mechanism involved in S phase sister chromatid cohesion. This mechanism requires the function of two B-type cyclins, Clb 5 and Clb 6, as well as Cdc 28. When DNA replication is efficient, either the Pds 1 - or Clb 5 /Clb 6 -dependent mechanism is sufficient to maintain sister chromatid cohesion. However, both mechanisms are required for S phase cohesion under conditions of replication stress. Further investigation revealed that cells lacking Clb 5 and Clb 6 have reduced levels of chromatin associated cohesin under conditions of replication stress. Further, this cohesion defect requires <b>spindle</b> <b>tension</b> to be observed by examining TRP 1 locus separation. In conclusion, yeast cells maintain sister chromatid cohesion by a Clb 5 /Clb 6 dependent mechanism for efficiently loading cohesin onto chromatin during S phase as well as a Pds 1 dependent mechanism for inhibiting the protease activity of Esp 1 before anaphase onset. Chromosome condensation requires the function of the condesin complex. Recent studies mainly focused on the ATPase activity of condensin in introducing DNA supercoiling. We studied how condensin is regulated through the cell cycle. We found that the protein levels of condensin subunits are cell cycle regulated. Chromosomes condense in response to higher condensin protein abundance. Chromosome decondensation {{at the end of the}} cell cycle requires Smc 4 proteolysis mediated by APC/C ubiquitin ligase. This Smc 4 protein turnover needs the function of Mad 2 in the absence of nocodazole, but Mad 2 is dispensable for Smc 4 proteolysis under conditions of pre-anaphase arrest in the presence of nocodazole. In addition to protein abundance, phospho modification of Smc 4 by Cdc 28 also regulates the timing of chromosome condensation. This phospho modification of Smc 4 destabilized Smc 4 protein as well as preventing premature chromosome condensation early in the cell cycle. Collectively, we studied the underlying mechanisms of two essential events for genome stability: sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome condensation. Both events are under regulation by multiple mechanisms to ensure the faithfulness. Understanding these mechanisms using budding yeast would avail against the human diseases caused by genome instability...|$|R
40|$|A counterrotating-shoulder {{mechanism}} {{has been}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} the mechanism and fixtures used in conventional friction stir welding. The mechanism would internally react most or all of the forces and torques exerted on the workpiece, making it unnecessary to react the forces and torques through massive external fixtures. In conventional friction stir welding, a rotating pin tool is inserted into, and moved along, a weld seam. As the pin tool moves, it stirs together material from the opposite sides of the seam to form the weld. A large axial plunge force must be exerted upon the workpiece through and by the pin tool and a shoulder attached above the pin tool in order to maintain the pressure necessary for the process. The workpiece is secured on top of an anvil, which supports the workpiece against the axial plunge force and against the torque exerted by the pin tool and shoulder. The anvil and associated fixtures must be made heavy (and, therefore, are expensive) to keep the workpiece stationary. In addition, workpiece geometries must be limited to those that can be accommodated by the fixtures. The predecessor of the proposed counterrotating-shoulder mechanism is a second-generation, self-reacting tool, resembling a bobbin, that makes it possible to dispense with the heavy anvil. This tool consists essentially of a rotating pin tool with opposing shoulders. Although the opposing shoulders maintain the necessary pressure without need to externally apply or react a large plunge force, the torque exerted on the workpiece remains unreacted in the absence of a substantial external fixture. Depending on the RPM and the thickness of the workpiece, the torque can be large. The proposed mechanism (see figure) would include a spindle attached to a pin tool with a lower shoulder. The spindle would be coupled via splines to the upper one of three bevel gears in a differential drive. The middle bevel gear would be the power-input gear and would be coupled to the upper and lower bevel gears. The lower bevel gear would be attached to the upper shoulder and would slide and rotate freely over the spindle. The spindle would be fastened by its threaded upper end to an external submechanism that would exert axial <b>tension</b> on the <b>spindle</b> to load the workpiece in compression between the shoulders. By reducing or eliminating (relative to the use of a self reacting tool) the torque that must be reacted externally, the use of the proposed tool would reduce the tendency toward distortion or slippage of the workpiece. To begin a weld, the spindle would be inserted through a hole in the workpiece or run-on tab at the beginning of the seam and fastened to the loading submechanism. Rotation and axial loading would be increased gradually from zero and, after a time to be determined by trial and error, translation along the weld seam would be increased gradually from zero to a steady weld speed. The weld would be ended by running the mechanism off the workpiece or, if the lower shoulder were detachable, by detaching the lower shoulder from the spindle and pulling the pin tool out...|$|R
40|$|Rev is a {{regulatory}} protein that {{plays an important}} role in the replication of HIV virus by post-transcriptionally promoting expression of viral proteins late in infection. Rev expression also slows cell growth, leads to an accumulation of cells in G 2 /M specifically before the spindle checkpoint, and can produce changes in ploidy. Because Rev is capable of depolymerizing microtubules (MTs) in vitro, possibly by a mechanism shared with Kinesin- 13 proteins, themselves potent cellular MT depolymerases, I tested the hypothesis that these cellular defects were due to an interaction between Rev and tubulin. To this end, Rev and select Rev mutants defective in RNA binding and nuclear import (M 6), nuclear export (M 10), and Rev multimerization (M 4) were expressed in HeLa cells. Rev 2 ̆ 7 s ability to interact with tubulin was monitored by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies specific for tubulin and the Rev transgene. Results from these experiments are consistent with this hypothesis as Rev and tubulin can be detected in the same immunoprecipitates. To extend these results, deconvolution microscopy was used to colocalize Rev and spindle microtubules. Whereas Rev, M 4, M 6, and M 10 fused to green or yellow fluorescent protein are largely dispersed throughout the cytoplasm of mitotic cells, the use of colocalization software indicates there is a shallow gradient of Rev accumulation proximal to the spindle. Some M 6 appears to colocalize at or near spindle poles although this is also seen in control cells. However, while these data suggest there is a potential for substantial colocalization between Rev and tubulin, visual inspection shows there is little compelling colocalization with spindle MTs. However, because immunostaining readily detects tubulin polymerized into MTs and not soluble tubulin heterodimers, the results of the colocalization and co-immunoprecipitation assays are both consistent with the hypothesis that Rev and Rev mutants are interacting with the heterodimer and not the polymerized tubulin. Intriguingly, significant amounts of wild-type Rev, M 4 and M 10 accumulate perichromosomally where a large fraction of spindle MTs nucleates early in mitosis. Thus Rev is spatially positioned within the cell to affect spindle assembly during early mitosis. Indeed, the previously discovered cell cycle defects of wild-type Rev, M 4, M 6, and M 10 are all consistent with this hypothesis. Taken together, these results suggest that cells have the ability to correct spindle defects that occur during prometaphase. In conclusion, these results suggest that Rev and Rev mutants interact with tubulin heterodimers and might interfere with cell cycle progression. Since Rev expressing cells accumulate in G 2 /M phase, the mitotic defects in cells expressing Rev and Rev mutants were examined. Previous research has suggested that expression of Rev and Rev mutants alters progression through mitosis with cells accumulating before the spindle assembly checkpoint. These results suggest that Rev expression may interfere with chromosomal congression and therefore alter <b>tension</b> across the <b>spindle</b> and between kinetochores. To investigate this, the distances between spindle poles and interkinetchore distances were measured in metaphase cells. No significant differences were found between cells expressing Rev or Rev mutants and control cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetochore}} is a multi-protein complex {{which supports}} chromosome segregation in mitosis by mediating {{the connection between}} centromeric DNA and the mitotic spindle. In addition, {{it serves as a}} docking platform for the spindle checkpoint proteins. The spindle checkpoint is a surveillance mechanism which monitors the proper assembly of the mitotic spindle apparatus. It allows the transition from meta- into anaphase only if all kinetochores are bipolarly attached to the spindle microtubules and if <b>tension</b> across the <b>spindle</b> is applied. The tetrameric Ndc 80 -complex (Ndc 80, Nuf 2, Spc 24, Spc 25) is part of the kinetochore. It is highly conserved and was shown to be required for the spindle checkpoint in S. cerevisiae (Janke et al. 2001). The kinase Mps 1 has also been implicated in spindle checkpoint control (Hartwick et al. 1996). In mammalian cells, the kinetochore localisation of Mps 1 depends on the presence of the Ndc 80 -complex (Stucke et al. 2004). Furthermore, endogenous Mps 1 was found as a faint Coomassie-stained protein band in a Ndc 80 -complex pull down from yeast (C. Jaeger, unpublished results). Based on these observations, the goal of the present studies was to elucidate whether components of the S. cerevisiae Ndc 80 -complex are phosphorylated by Mps 1 and if this phosphorylation has an influence on the regulation of the spindle checkpoint. The following observations were made: 1. Mps 1 physically interacts with Ndc 80 ∑ Mps 1 weakly associates with the kinetochore by ChIP-analysis in S. cerevisiae. ∑ Mps 1 physically interacts with the Ndc 80 -complex after spindle checkpoint activation by Mps 1 -overexpression. ∑ Mps 1 specifically interacts with the conserved, globular N-terminus of Ndc 80 in vitro. 2. Mps 1 phosphorylates Ndc 80 ∑ Mps 1 phosphorylates the N-terminus of Ndc 80 in vitro. ∑ Ndc 80 -phosphorylation depends on Mps 1 in vivo. 3. Ndc 80 -phosphorylation activates the spindle assembly checkpoint ∑ Ndc 80 in its non-phosphorylated state (ndc 8014 A) is checkpoint deficient. ∑ constitutive pseudo-phosphorylation of Ndc 80 (ndc 8014 D) causes lethality due to a permanently activated spindle checkpoint (cell cycle arrest in mitosis). This checkpoint activation specifically depends on the checkpoint proteins Mad 2 and Bub 1. ﬁ Ndc 80 -phosphorylation by Mps 1 is an integral step in the spindle checkpoint pathway! 4. The kinetochore of ndc 8014 D-cells is functional ∑ The expression levels and the kinetochore localisation of the ndc 8014 D protein are comparable to the wild-type protein. ∑ The ndc 8014 D-protein is able to compete with the wild-type protein for binding-sites at the kinetochore. ∑ the spindle in ndc 8014 D-cells is under tension, a state which can only be achieved in the presence of an intact kinetochore. ﬁ the observed checkpoint activation is specifically caused by the introduced point mutations rather than by a general kinetochore defect. 5. Mps 1 -activity is required downstream of Ndc 80 ∑ The ndc 8014 D mutant is unable to activate the spindle checkpoint in Mps 1 -depleted cells. ﬁ Mps 1 has a second function in spindle checkpoint activation downstream of Ndc 80 -phosphorylation which might involve the phosphorylation of the checkpoint protein Mad 1. The results which were obtained in the current work provide evidence that Mps 1 specifically phosphorylates Ndc 80 and that Ndc 80 -phosphorylation is a mechanism by which the spindle checkpoint is activated in the presence of unattached kinetochores in early stages of mitosis. The functional characterisation of Ndc 80 -phosphorylation allows for a refinement of the current model of the spindle assembly checkpoint (Figure 32) ...|$|R
