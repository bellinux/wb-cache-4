5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> immediate and natural {{explanation for the}} ultimate rejection of the painting {{was the fact that}} time had rendered the painting unfashionable.

5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E

5|$|Around 1779 Priestley and Shelburne had a rupture, {{the precise}} reasons for which remain unclear. Shelburne blamed Priestley's health, while Priestley claimed Shelburne had no further use for him. Some contemporaries speculated that Priestley's {{outspokenness}} had hurt Shelburne's political career. Schofield argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> likely reason was Shelburne's recent marriage to Louisa Fitzpatrick—apparently, {{she did not}} like the Priestleys. Although Priestley considered moving to America, he eventually accepted Birmingham New Meeting's offer to be their minister.|$|E

5|$|Biomechanical {{studies by}} Ken Carpenter in 2002 {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> likely {{function of the}} forelimbs in predation was grasping, as their great lengths would have permitted longer reach than for most other theropods. The rather large and elongated coracoid, indicating powerful muscles in the forelimbs, further strengthened this interpretation. Carpenter's biomechanical studies using bone casts also showed that Deinonychus could not fold its arms against its body like a bird ("avian folding"), contrary to what was inferred from the earlier 1985 descriptions by Jacques Gauthier and Gregory S. Paul in 1988.|$|E

Hand's message that liberty is safeguarded by everyday Americans struck a popular chord, and he suddenly found himself a folk hero. Though he enjoyed the acclaim, he thought it unmerited. His biographer Gerald Gunther, noting the paradox of the agnostic Hand's use of religious overtones, suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> challenging aspect {{of the speech}} was {{that the spirit of}} liberty must entertain doubt.|$|E

Gaga incorporated theatrics in her live performances of the songs from the album. Hence she hoped that people would take notice of the performance art, which she was trying to bring back with the album and its music; according to her, the music put the lifestyle in front of it.|$|E

Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important aspect of the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the roles}} and {{importance}} of {{the various forms of}} vitamin E are presently unclear, and it has even been suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important function of α-tocopherol is as a signaling molecule, with this molecule having no significant role in antioxidant metabolism. The functions of the other forms of vitamin E are even less well understood, although γ-tocopherol is a nucleophile that may react with electrophilic mutagens, and tocotrienols may be important in protecting neurons from damage.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the International Resource Panel, {{hosted by}} the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), {{published}} the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries.

From a production perspective, it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes, agriculture and fisheries have the most important impacts. Meanwhile, from a final consumption perspective, it found that household consumption related to mobility, shelter, food and energy-using products cause the majority of life-cycle impacts of consumption.|$|E

5|$|One {{result of}} Wallace's early travels {{is a modern}} {{controversy}} about his nationality. Since Wallace was born in Monmouthshire, some sources have considered him to be Welsh. However, some historians have questioned this because neither of his parents was Welsh, his family only briefly lived in Monmouthshire, the Welsh people Wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be English, and because Wallace himself consistently referred to himself as English rather than Welsh (even when writing about his time in Wales).
