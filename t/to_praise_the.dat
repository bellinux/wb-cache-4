5|$|However, {{the sort}} of {{authority}} accorded by this position is widely discussed. The problem arise from the word MTQNNʿ; its exact meaning is debated. The word is translated to Latin as corrector but restitutor is another possible translation; the latter title was an honorary one meant <b>to</b> <b>praise</b> <b>the</b> bearer for driving enemies out of Roman territories. However, the inscription of Vaballathus is clearer as the word PNRTTʿ is not a Palmyrene word but a direct Palmyrene translation of the Greek term Epanorthotes which is usually an equivalent to corrector.|$|E

Like a contemporary, Shen Kuo (1031–1095), Su Song was a polymath, a person whose {{expertise}} spans a significant number of different interests. It was written by his junior colleague and Hanlin scholar Ye Mengde (1077–1148) that in Su's youth, he mastered the provincial exams and rose {{to the top of the}} examination list for writing the best essay on general principles and structure of the Chinese calendar. From an early age, his interests in astronomy and calendrical science led him onto a distinguished path as a state bureaucrat. In his spare time he was fond of writing poetry, which he used <b>to</b> <b>praise</b> <b>the</b> works of artists such as the painter Li Gonglin (1049–1106). He also was an antiquarian and collector of old artworks from previous dynasties.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of the script was {{distributed}} to the cast, but Patrick Stewart did not receive a copy.

LeVar Burton called Stewart <b>to</b> <b>praise</b> <b>the</b> script. Stewart was sent a copy and requested a meeting to discuss changes. Piller feared the worst, but after a twenty-minute meeting with Stewart, who requested several dialogue changes, the script was finalized.

5|$|It is {{distinguished}} by its position against the French absolute monarchy, support for religious tolerance, including for Jansenism, support for democratic reforms {{such as the}} introduction of parliaments, support for the American independence and the Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791. The newspaper preferred <b>to</b> <b>praise</b> <b>the</b> changes in Poland (the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) more than those in France, criticizing {{the violence of the}} French Revolution, and contrasting it with the peaceful transformation in Poland. This relative lack of support for the French Revolution may explain why the paper was abolished on 23 April 1798, three years after the invasion of the Netherlands by France and the Batavian Revolution. It reappeared as the Nouvelles politiques publiées à Leyde in October, but it was seen as no longer independent. Under a new name—Journal politique publié à Leyde—it lasted from 1804 until 1811, but it never regained its audience and its quality, and disappeared after the annexation of Holland by the French Empire. A new Leyden Gazette briefly appeared after the liberation of Holland in 1814.|$|E

5|$|Torajans perform dances {{on several}} occasions, most often during their {{elaborate}} funeral ceremonies. They dance {{to express their}} grief, and to honour and even cheer the deceased person because {{he is going to}} have a long journey in the afterlife. First, a group of men form a circle and sing a monotonous chant throughout the night to honour the deceased (a ritual called Ma'badong). This is considered by many Torajans to be the most important component of the funeral ceremony. On the second funeral day, the Ma'randing warrior dance is performed <b>to</b> <b>praise</b> <b>the</b> courage of the deceased during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made from buffalo skin, a helmet with a buffalo horn, and other ornamentation. The Ma'randing dance precedes a procession in which the deceased is carried from a rice barn to the rante, the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the Ma'katia dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The Ma'akatia dance is performed to remind the audience of the generosity and loyalty of the deceased person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called Ma'dondan.|$|E
5|$|Upon graduating, Harding had stints as {{a teacher}} and as an {{insurance}} man, and made a brief attempt at studying law. He then raised $300 in partnership with others to purchase a failing newspaper, The Marion Star, weakest of the growing city's three papers, and its only daily. The 18-year-old Harding used the railroad pass that came with the paper to attend the 1884 Republican National Convention, where he hobnobbed with better-known journalists and supported the presidential nominee, former Secretary of State James G. Blaine. Harding returned from Chicago to find that the paper had been reclaimed by the sheriff. During the election campaign, Harding worked for the Marion Democratic Mirror and was annoyed at having <b>to</b> <b>praise</b> <b>the</b> Democratic presidential nominee, New York Governor Grover Cleveland, who won the election. Afterward, with the financial aid of his father, the budding newspaperman redeemed the paper.|$|E
