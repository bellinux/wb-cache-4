40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{life cycle}} assessment of panels for aircraft interiors was conducted, including both a conventional glass fiber-reinforced panel and different novel sustainable panels. The conventional panel is made of a glass fiber-reinforced thermoset composite with halogenated flame retardant, whereas the sustainable panels are made of renewable or recyclable polymers, natural fiber reinforcements, and nonhalogenated flame retardants. Four different sustainable panels were investigated: a geopolymer-based panel; a linseed-oil–based biopolymer panel; and two thermoplastic panels, one with polypropylene (PP) and another with polylactic acid (PLA). All of the sustainable panels were developed to fulfil fire resistance requirements and to be lighter than the conventional panels {{in order to reduce}} fuel consumption and air pollutant emissions from the aircraft. The environmental impacts associated with energy consumption and air emissions were assessed, as well as other environmental impacts resulting from the extraction and processing of materials, transportation of materials and waste, panel manufacturing, use, maintenance, and end of life (EoL). All the sustainable panels showed better environmental performance than the conventional panel. The overall impacts of the sustainable panels were offset by the environmental benefits in the use stage attributed to weight reduction. One square meter of the novel panels could save to 6, 000 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents. The break-even point (in months) at which the use of sustainable panels would yield an environmental benefit relative to the impacts arising in production and EoL was as follows: 1. 2 for the geopolymer panel; 1. 7 for the biopolymer panel; 10. 4 for the PLA panel; and 54. 5 for the PP panel.

This study aims to identify <b>the</b> state of <b>eco-innovation</b> of <b>the</b> chemical industries. The study further develops a holistic eco-innovation framework and empirically examines <b>the</b> determinants of <b>eco-innovation</b> in <b>the</b> Malaysian chemical-manufacturing firms. A sequential exploratory design {{was used for the}} purpose of this study. The qualitative analysis deploys a case study approach where semi-structured interviews with six chemical firms were conducted to gauge <b>the</b> state of <b>eco-innovation</b> practices and to validate <b>the</b> holistic <b>eco-innovation</b> framework, based especially on <b>the</b> nine <b>eco-innovation</b> drivers identified from the literature. Survey questionnaires were then distributed to the chemical firms located in the state of Selangor and the data was used to empirically examine the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> drivers and eco-innovation. For this purpose, the Partial Least Square (PLS) technique was used. The results show that in terms of state of eco-innovation, firms are largely net adopters. However, the level of creation of eco-innovation taking place indicated that firms have embraced advanced sustainable manufacturing practices and concepts. Firms are moving away from eco-innovations that merely treat pollutants at the end of manufacturing process to eco-innovations that manage these pollutants at the initial stage of production. Credit for <b>the</b> success of <b>eco-innovation</b> and sustainable manufacturing practices that firms have achieved thus far is due to high top management commitment and strong corporate environmentalism culture. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>eco-innovations</b> framework structured based on the interviews, exhibited a merger of three sub-models, namely; resources, strategy and eco-innovation models that link <b>the</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> drivers through direct and indirect linkages. <b>Eco-innovation</b> in <b>the</b> chemical firms was mainly driven by the firms’ environmental strategies and environmental regulations. Environmental strategies display a central tendency to connect with other <b>eco-innovation</b> drivers within <b>the</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> framework. Export behaviour and environmental collaboration, meanwhile exhibited strong indirect effect on eco-innovation through environmental strategies. The implications of the study are as follows. Although governmental actions through command and control policies have in <b>the</b> past promoted <b>eco-innovation</b> among firms, however, it was increasing demand for green products and emerging environmental issues that thrusted firms into their environmental strategies entailing for more flexible policy options such as informational measures, voluntary agreements and credible price signal. Firms also had an urgent need to strengthen their absorptive capacity due to huge amounts of practical and tacit knowledge involved during environmental strategy formulation but with no proper mechanism in place to capture this knowledge. On the theoretical front, the study confirms that the mix of theories and knowledge from the field of environmental economics, innovation economics and management are imperative to effectively develop a holistic eco-innovation framework and to provide practical solutions to problems related to <b>eco-innovation.</b> <b>The</b> study and its findings are still largely exploratory and sector specific, which limits generalization of the results.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> journey can {{be defined}} as {{deliberate}} shifts undertaken by firms to move away from unsustainable practice (Ehrenfeld, 2008). Such shifts might include changes in technologies, and ways of thinking about these to improve environmental performance e. g. resource productivity. The Literature on innovation provides rich accounts of the factors which might stimulate <b>the</b> development of <b>eco-innovations</b> and <b>the</b> consequences of implementing new technologies. However, there is relatively little literature which considers the process of how eco-innovations might unfold over time. This paper reports results from a study on <b>the</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> journey in <b>the</b> context of food and sustainability. Although literature on this particular topic has largely concentrated on farming and the behaviour of consumers, {{little is known about the}} intermediate actors e. g. food processors and manufacturers who provide a critical link in the food supply chain. This paper presents research from a firm in the UK food processing sector to help address these two gaps in knowledge. The paper draws on innovation and organization literatures to frame a concept of 'eco-innovation journey' as a socio-technical and messy process, which include power struggles and interplay of many actors. The method identified to explore <b>the</b> construction of <b>eco-innovation</b> process within a UK food processing firm was a longitudinal case study undertaken through action research (AR).

Towards this aim, our paper assesses those scoreboards against four criteria stemming from innovation analysis: (1) relevance of areas and stakeholders covered; (2) ability to indicate changes; (3) directions towards common goals; and (4) ability to facilitate further changes. We conclude both are promising, despite data shortages, and have great potential to contribute towards the sustainable development goals (SDGs), {{particularly with regard to}} the SDGs on sustainable industrialization and sustainable consumption and production. In comparison, the ASEI covers more countries than the Eco-IS. However, the ASEI has limitations on measuring indicators due to limited data availability in Asian countries. The Eco-IS is closely linked with the regional and national policies for eco-innovation in Europe, while the ASEI’s impact appears more limited, as of now. In conclusion, the research results give insights into key areas, goals and applications of eco-innovation indices, and can help upgrading eco-innovation indices.

Our study has focused on <b>eco-innovations</b> with <b>the</b> aim  to find sustainable solutions, leading the reduction in greenhouse gases, on the extraction of renewable energy sources, since studies have indicated a link between the industrialization and the impact on the climate.   The purpose formulated for this study was to explore the external sources of knowledge that are present around <b>the</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> firms. By conducting this exploratory study we will contribute to existing research by adding empirical evidence to identifying what the external sources of knowledge are and further explore what kind of knowledge eco-innovation firms gain from these external sources. The participating companies in the study was chosen since they represent Swedish firms in <b>the</b> development of <b>eco-innovations</b> with <b>the</b> goal to minimize the environmental impact.   We conducted the thesis with a qualitative approach and the empirical data was gathered from four different companies in the field of wave and tidal power. The four interviews were executed through telephone interviews with both the researches acting as interviewers. The respondents were either the CEO of the company or a board member, since these persons were most likely to possess the relevant information for this study.   In our study we have found the external sources of knowledge to be of significant importance to <b>the</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> firms. Based on our theoretical framework, we have identified the external assets as suppliers, customers, competitors, governmental actors and research institutions. These external sources have different importance depending on the character of the knowledge that is gained. The external sources showed to contribute with important knowledge in areas of R&D capabilities, technology development, market orientation and regulation. By assessing the external sources of knowledge firms will unlock great potential knowledge that would otherwise be very costly. A conclusion was that as eco-innovation firms acquire knowledge by their external assets in parallel there are signals, unconsciously communicated going out to the external environment. Since our study has shown that academic experience among the founders seemed to have been helping the firms in their contact with governmental actors in order to attract subsidies and in the approval process for test sites, this indicates that what seems to be communicated from within <b>the</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> firms to their external environment is certain legitimacy, credibility and reputation that strengthen the relationship with governmental actors. This study was performed as a multiple case study on four different eco-innovation firms working with development of technology to extract energy from renewable energy sources in terms of wave and tidal power. Our choice to only interview one person on each firm, due to a limited time frame and resources, might make it hard to generalize the findings since there is a possibility of biased data. Other limitations that make it hard to draw to much from the results are the fact of focusing on a limited area on eco-innovation in only one country, since regulations play an important role this might differ between different countries...|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this case study was to {{contribute}} to the body of knowledge on <b>the</b> assessment of <b>eco-innovations</b> by carrying out an experimental case study in the agricultural plantations industry. Innovations mainly aimed at enhancing economic gains can have accidental impact on the environment. However the assessment of the impact of these <b>eco-innovations</b> is <b>the</b> challenge. Since due to the underdeveloped theoretical and methodological approaches to analyze these benefits (Rennings 2000; Peiris and Gunarathne, 2015), the study used the triple bottom line approach. In doing so physical and monetary sustainability information was used (Burritt et al. 2002, International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) 2005) to quantify these impacts. Yet there are many potential impacts that were not captured in the present paper. It is only when these impacts are considered that the full benefit of eco-innovations can be evaluated. This case study reveals the difficulty in having a standardized set of indicators to measure <b>the</b> impact of <b>eco-innovations</b> owing to <b>the</b> multidimensionality of sustainability. Further, this case study emphasizes that the problems associated with measuring sustainability are common to <b>the</b> assessment of <b>eco-innovations</b> as well. Hence {{there is a need for}} further development of sustainability indicators to make inter and intra industry comparisons of <b>the</b> <b>eco-innovations</b> meaningful. <b>The</b> way forward would be to adopt broad sustainability indicators that represent the wholeness of the system while capturing the long term impacts.|$|R

As a solution, eco-innovation has received {{a great amount of}} attention from European countries and as a result, many efforts to analyze <b>the</b> development of <b>eco-innovation</b> quantitatively have been made. This study aims to evaluate the validity of an eco-innovation index developed to support the sustainable development goal. For this purpose, four factors of eco-innovation—capacity, supportive environment, activity, and performance—were applied to three categories of the Triple-Bottom-Line (TBL) concept in sustainability to compare <b>the</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> development level of 49 Asia-Europe Meeting countries. Factors for eco-innovation and TBL at the country level were organized in quartile and compared to see strength and weaknesses for each nation. In order to test if eco-innovation factors of a nation adequately reflect its sustainability, we used various comparisons of ANOVA. The results of this study are as follows: First, the one-way ANOVA tests present the scores for capacity, supportive environment, and performance as grouped into four quartiles in the same pattern as their economic, social, and environmental scores. The three-way ANOVA tests showed significance for the economic category. Scores for capacity, supportive environment, activity and performance were significant at a nation’s economic level. Lastly, the MANOVA test revealed that TBL significantly explains four eco-innovation factors. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>eco-innovation</b> performance level of European nations and Asian nations were compared. The possibility that many nations still have room to be competitive in their eco-innovation efforts was identified. Nations with unbalanced eco-innovation growth are urged to implement new strategies to balance their growth. Therefore, this research contributes to extending research on eco-innovation...|$|R
