500|$|The global {{financial}} crisis and Great Recession prompted renewed {{discourse on the}} architecture of the {{global financial}} system. These events called to attention financial integration, inadequacies of global governance, and the emergent systemic risks of financial globalization. Since the establishment in 1945 of a formal international monetary system with the IMF empowered as its guardian, the world has undergone extensive changes politically and economically. This has fundamentally altered the paradigm in which international financial institutions operate, increasing the complexities of the IMF and World Bank's mandates. The lack of adherence to a formal monetary system has created a void of global constraints on national macroeconomic policies and a deficit of rule-based governance of financial activities. French economist and Executive Director of the World Economic Forum's Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee, Marc Uzan, has pointed out that some radical proposals such as a [...] "global central bank or a world financial authority" [...] have been deemed impractical, leading to further consideration of medium-term efforts to improve <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>disclosure,</b> strengthen emerging market financial climates, bolster prudential regulatory environments in advanced nations, and better moderate capital account liberalization and exchange rate regime selection in emerging markets. He has also drawn attention to calls for increased participation from the private sector in the management of financial crises and the augmenting of multilateral institutions' resources.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to examine risk <b>and</b> {{governance}} <b>disclosure</b> practices in UK higher education institutions (HEIs) {{in a period of}} increased austerity and reform. Specifically, the project sought to investigate the extent to which UK HEIs voluntarily disclose information relating to their internal governance mechanisms and risk management in their annual/audit committee reports with the objective of identifying, developing and disseminating ‘best practice’ within the sector. Content analysis method was employed in collecting and analysing three main types of data from HEIs' annual/audit committee reports. First, a comprehensive weighted (i. e., scored from 0 to 6) best practice risk disclosure index, containing 127 risk items with three main sub-sections, consisting of: (i) financial; (ii) operational; and (iii) strategic risks, was developed based mainly on the HEFCE (2001 a, b, 2005) good practice guides for risk management in HEIs. Second, a comprehensive unweighted (i. e., scored from 0 to 1) good governance disclosure index containing 100 governance items with five sub-sections, consisting of: (i) governors and governing boards; (ii) processes and structures; (iii) performance evaluation, remuneration and rewards; (iv) auditing, accounting and accountability; and (v) dialogue with stakeholders and social responsibility, was developed based on the 2009 and 2014 CUC, 2008 CUC audit handbook, and 2013 CSC Scottish good governance codes. Third, a wide range of governance data relating to governing boards, governing board committees, senior management teams and financial data relating to UK HEIs were collected. The entire population of 164 UK publicly funded HEIs were longitudinally sampled from 2009 to 2014. The full data required was obtained for 117 (71 %) HEIs and therefore, were included in the final sample. The main findings are as follows: Overall, the level of <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>disclosures</b> relating to risk management practices by UK HEIs are relatively low (e. g., compared with similar sized for profit organisations), but the distribution varies widely, ranging from a minimum of 6. 96 % to a maximum of 31. 76 % with an average of 17. 31 %. •Of the three main types of risk items examined, disclosures relating to financial risk were highest, compared with operational <b>and</b> strategic risk <b>disclosures.</b> Specifically, the average UK HEI disclosed 30. 83 % of the financial risk items compared with 12. 66 % operational risk items and 16. 91 % strategic risk items. •Overall, and similar to the risk disclosures, the level of <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>disclosures</b> relating to governance practices by UK HEIs were relatively low (e. g., compared with similar sized for profit organisations), with the distribution equally varying widely, ranging from a minimum of 8. 00 % to a maximum of 75. 00 % with an average of 40. 02 %. •Of the five main types of governance mechanisms investigated, disclosures relating to the governors and governing boards were the highest, whilst those relating to performance evaluation, remuneration and rewards were the lowest. Specifically, the average UK HEI disclosed 52. 65 %, 49. 67 %, 40. 07 %, 31. 52 %, and 24. 98 % of the governance structures examined relating to governors and governing boards, auditing, accounting and accountability, dialogue with stakeholders and social responsibility, processes and structures, and performance evaluation, remuneration and rewards, respectively. •A positive finding is that a steady increasing pattern can be observed with respect to both disclosures relating to the risk items, and governance structures that were examined over time. For example, the average UK HEI’s level of good risk (governance) disclosures were 16. 31 % (37. 37 %), 16. 63 % (38. 96 %), 17. 07 % (39. 66 %), 17. 47 % (40. 46 %), 17. 97 % (41. 14 %) and 18. 41 % (42. 51 %), respectively, in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, accounting for about 13 (14) percentage points increase over the six years investigated. These increasing patterns are also observable in the sub-indices. However, <b>and</b> on average, <b>disclosures</b> relating to governance mechanisms were higher than those relating to risk management practices. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary and {{incomplete}} A key motivation for <b>transparency</b> regulations <b>and</b> <b>disclosure</b> rules {{is the view}} that corporations are more opaque than they could be. Traditional arguments attribute this tendency to agency problems between managers {{on one side and}} stakeholders and/or outsiders on the other. We propose a completely different argument for why corporations limit the flow of information. When secondary markets are shallow, more information can reduce the expected payoff of stakeholders who need to liquidate their positions early. Even given direct and costless control over information design then, the very stakeholders of long-term investment projects have an incentive to curtail information. This holds even if stakeholders have the option to keep information releases to themselves. The existing evidence that financial intermediaries tend to be especially opaque particularly during financial crisis provides direct support that a fundamental trade-off exists between information and liquidity...|$|R
