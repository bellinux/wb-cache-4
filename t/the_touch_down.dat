40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the dynamic {{behaviour}} of catenary shaped risers under imposed motions applied at the top. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the heave component of motion which is of substantial importance for practical applications as it results to the amplification of large bending moments in <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> region. In fact, the bending moment obtains its maximum value at the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> point and very close to the location of its maximum static counterpart. This singular behaviour is discussed using the results from the solution of the eigenvalue problem. To this end the eigenfrequencies and the corresponding mode shapes are calculated using the WKB approximation making no assumption regarding the variation of the static components. In addition, the feature of the correlation between the axial component of the velocity of the excitation and the extreme bending moments at the lower part (Passano and Larsen, 2006) is further investigated through comparative numerical calculations of the problem using both frequency and time domain techniques.

40|$|Oil and gas {{exploration}} and production activities in deep and ultra deep waters in hostile environments necessitates {{the need to develop}} innovative riser systems capable of ensuring transfer of fluids from the seabed to a floating vessel and vice versa, with little or no issues with respect to influences of environmental loads and vessel motions. The design of the riser system must focus on different types of loading and load effects than for traditional water-depth. A variety of different riser concepts are proposed, both with respect to geometric shape and selection of materials. In the last few years, steel catenary risers have been a preferred riser solution for deep-water field developments due to its simple engineering concept, cost effective, flexibility in using different host platform and flexibility in geographical and environmental conditions. In this report, a case study considering a steel catenary riser operating in 1000 m water depth was conducted. The riser was subjected to extreme environmental conditions and static and dynamic response analyses were performed by the computer program RIFLEX.

40|$|Steel {{catenary}} risers (SCRs) in deepwater environment exhibit complex dynamic dynamic response {{governed by}} various {{factors such as}} environmental conditions, vessel motions, soil-structure interaction and material degradation. Uncertainties in the SCR design exist in the design data, analysis methodologies, fabrication, and hence a conservative approach has been adopted to overcome these shortfalls. Recent advances in monitoring systems installed on SCRs provide operator the assurance of the integrity of the SCRs in service, verify the SCR design, and enhance basic understanding of the SCR response. This paper outlines a strategy for monitoring the SCRs to characterize the response due to vessel motions, vortex induced vibrations (VIV), and soil-structure interaction. A detailed example of real-time SCR monitoring system with optimized array of motion and strain measurements is presented. The methodology for sensor selection and optimization is based on linear regression analysis. The measured data processing methods include shape matching the response amplitudes with correlating response frequencies. The principles and methods of measured data interpretation to capture global response shape due to wave and vessel motions induced and VIV are presented. The pipe-soil interaction such as soil stiffness, suction, softening and trenching effects characterized using the strain measurements in <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> zone are presented. In addition, the methods to calibrate the individual vertical, lateral and axial models for pipe-soil interaction are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} today is a heavily regulated segment, and current standard hasestablished restrictions which yields a very limited weather window for offshore cable installations. This is due to experience with cable failure in harsh weather. A limiting factor in current practice is the design criterion for the minimum allowable radius of curvature in the touchdown point. In addition, current practice does not allow for occurrence of compression in <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> zone, since this is associated with loop formation and loss of the functionality of the cable. The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the validity and conservatism of current practice, by investigating the issues related to torsion instability through a proposed design procedure. The scope of the thesis comprehends numerical analyses using the SINTEF OCEAN developed software SIMLA. The numerical studies concern a J-lay installation scenario at 100 meters water depth with an implemented cable laying vessel with realistic RAO properties. Two real-life cable cross-sections are evaluated; a single-layered cable without armoring (umbilical 1) and a torsional balanced cable with double-armoring (umbilical 2). The mechanical properties of these are calculated analytically, where the main differences lay in the torsional stiffness of the cross-sections. The effect of installation route is evaluated, and two scenarios are simulated; an end cap turn and a curved route to avoid obstacles. The results are obtained in two steps. Primarily, the critical values of torsion momentand resultant curvature with respect to loop formation are established. These parameters are determined for both a linear and a non-linear pipe material model. Subsequently a range of dynamic analyses with irregular waves are carried out. The irregular waves are applied using a Pierson-Moskowitz wave spectrum with Hs= 2 − 3 mandTp= 7 − 10 s with a one hour simulation time. In the dynamic analyses, the torsion moment and curvature in the cable are analyzed and compared with the capacity parameters for each scenario. For umbilical 1 it is found that the maximum resultant curvature for all sea states exceeds the critical API curvature, while the torsion moment is below the critical torsion moment. The sea states can, due to excess of the API criterion, not be classified as acceptable. It is also concluded that a contributing factor is the low magnitude of the horizontal bottom tension. The maximum resultant curvature for umbilical 2 oscillates around curvature values below the design criterion for minimum radius of curvature for all sea states. The torsion moments are lower than the critical torsion moment. All seastates for umbilical 2 are categorized as acceptable with respect to experienced resultant curvature. It is in addition investigated whether the cables experience compression in <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> zone while subjected to irregular waves. For umbilical 1 it is found that compression occurs inthe touch down zone for all sea states for both installation scenarios. Umbilical 2 experiences compression in varying degree for all sea states except for Hs= 2 m,Tp= 7 s. The magnitude of the compressive axial force is increasing in accordance with increasing wave height andperiod. The magnitude of the compressive axial forces experienced are compared with the buckling loads associated with local helix buckling and birdcaging. None of the force values are within the range for the buckling loads for tensile armour buckling. Hence it can be concluded that its possible with occurrence of compression without necessarily associated kink formation nor local buckling. The effect of wave heading is also investigated. Changing the wave heading impacts the maximum resultant curvature. It is found that the most critical scenario occur when the waves are incoming with a heading of [π, 2 π]. This is due to the cable configuration, which experience a slight bend in <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> zone at the initiation of the dynamics. It is also carried out a study of the effect of additional sea current. A current velocity of 4 m/s with correspondingly heading of 0 °, 90 °, 180 °, 270 ° is applied. This result in the observation that the most critical scenario is a current heading of 180 ° due to reduction of the cable effective weight. It is investigated whether a too low horizontal bottom tension is the reason of the severe curvature levels for umbilical 1. Analyses with a T 0 = 5 kN are run for the respective sea states. Resulting from this the curvature levels for umbilical 1 is lowered to acceptable levels for Hs= 2 m. The same analyses are carried out for umbilical 2, where the resulting curvatures increase compared to lower initial tension. This is due to severe yielding of the friction moment for the case of T 0 = 5 kN, inducing more severe deformation of the cable...|$|E

At the same time, more and more problems are encountered. A lot of effort has been put to gain more knowledge about pipeline installation, operation and so on. During installation of subsea pipeline, the penetration of the pipe prior to operation has a tendency of being larger than the predicted values. This may have a great influence on the intervention work and cost impact.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a {{nonlinear}} control has been de-signed using the dynamic inversion approach for automatic landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), along with associ-ated path planning. This {{is a difficult}} problem because of light weight of UAVs and strong coupling between longitudinal and lateral modes. The landing maneuver of the UAV is divided into approach, glideslope and flare. In the approach UAV aligns with the centerline of the runway by heading angle correction. In glideslope and flare the UAV follows straight line and exponential curves respectively in the pitch plane with no lateral deviations. The glideslope and flare path are scheduled {{as a function of}} approach distance from runway. The trajectory parameters are calculated such that the sink rate at touchdown remains within specified bounds. It is also ensured that the transition from the glideslope to flare path is smooth by ensuring C 1 continuity at the transition. In the outer loop, the roll rate command is generated by assuring a co-ordinated turn in the alignment segment and by assuring zero bank angle in the glideslope and flare segments. The pitch rate command is generated from the error in altitude to control the deviations from the landing trajectory. The yaw rate command is generated from the required heading correction. In the inner loop, the aileron, elevator and rudder deflections are computed together to track the required body rate commands. Moreover, it is also ensured that the forward velocity of the UAV at <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>down</b> remains close to a desired value by manipulating the thrust of the vehicle. A nonlinear six-DOF model, which has been developed from extensive wind-tunnel testing, is used both for control design as well as to validate it. I...|$|E
