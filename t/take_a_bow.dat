Recognizing her from the screen, he arranged for her to have a screen test for the movie Stand Up and Cheer! Temple arrived for the audition on December 7, 1933; she won the part and was signed to a $150-per-week contract that was guaranteed for two weeks by Fox Film Corporation. The role was a breakthrough performance for Temple. Her charm was evident to Fox executives, and she was ushered into corporate offices almost immediately after finishing Baby <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bow,</b> a song and dance number she did with James Dunn. On December 21, 1933, her contract was extended to a year at the same $150/week with a seven-year option and her mother Gertrude was hired on at $25/week as her hairdresser and personal coach. Released in May 1934, Stand Up and Cheer! became Shirley's breakthrough film. Within months, she became the symbol of wholesome family entertainment.

500|$|The first Paris performance, on 14 November 1958, was disastrous. According to Stephen Walsh, Pierre Boulez {{failed to}} fulfil his {{undertaking}} to obtain adequate performers, {{and those that}} he could obtain broke down several times. The audience response was polite at first, but when Stravinsky refused to return and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>bow,</b> it gradually descended into jeers. Stravinsky said he would never conduct in Paris again. Stravinsky felt humiliated by {{what he called a}} [...] "scandalous concert", writing in his diary immediately after the performance that it was the [...] "unhappiest concert of my life" [...] and blaming Boulez for the result. Robert Craft adds that Boulez had promised to rehearse Threni, but failed to do so. Stravinsky nevertheless had a share in the blame for not cancelling the concert despite the pleas of family and friends, including his wife and Nadia Boulanger. Conceding that the performance was a [...] "catastrophe", Boulez nevertheless insisted that he did in fact participate in the piano rehearsals, together with Stravinsky, whom he had tried in vain to persuade to be more firm with the singers. He concluded that Stravinsky [...] "was not a good conductor; he was a terribly lousy conductor", and the problems with the singers were compounded because [...] "the orchestra had been ill-prepared by Craft". While agreeing that the singers were [...] "absolutely awful", Boulez protested they had been chosen not by himself, but by an {{agent in charge of the}} Aix-en-Provence festival.|$|E

Although Burt had meant a sports team, when Kurt enthusiastically tells Burt that he has join the glee club, he accepts this as an adequate substitute in part due to its competitive aspect. In the show's final episode, [...] "Dreams Come True", Burt and Carole attend the rededication ceremony of the McKinley High auditorium in the year 2020, when it is renamed the [...] "Finn Hudson Memorial Auditorium".
