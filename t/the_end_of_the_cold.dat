The Swiss Air Force lost the capability to carry out air-to-ground operations when the Hunters were withdrawn from service.|$|E

Airborne early warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of southeastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War and the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia and the Central Asian republics were {{weakened}} {{economically and}} faced declines in GDP.

5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, the FPÖ {{became more}} eurosceptic, which was {{reflected}} by its change from pan-Germanism to Austrian patriotism. The party's {{opposition to the}} European Union grew stronger in the 1990s. The FPÖ opposed Austria's joining the EU in 1994, and promoted a popular initiative against {{the replacement of the}} Austrian Schilling with the Euro in 1998, but to no avail. Owing to perceived differences between Turkish and European culture, the party opposes the accession of Turkey to the EU; it has declared that should this happen, Austria must immediately leave the EU.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, the US Army {{considered}} new {{options for}} the integration and organization of active duty, Army Reserve and Army National Guard units in training and deployment. Two division headquarters activated in the active duty component for training National Guard units. The 7th Infantry Division and the 24th Infantry Division headquarters were selected. The subordinate brigades of the divisions did not activate so {{they could not be}} deployed as divisions, however their active duty status would allow the headquarters to focus on the national guard units under them full-time.|$|E

5|$|Cheney {{publicly}} {{expressed concern}} that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union in 1991. <b>The</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War in 1989, the US {{government}} conducted careful {{restructuring of}} national priorities {{and of the}} defense establishment. Fort Lewis, ideally located {{to act as a}} base for mobilization and power projection into the Pacific region, was one of few military bases that did not downsize with the US military overall. Thus, while most of the Army was downsizing, Fort Lewis began to grow, however, several tenant units such as the 9th Infantry Division were downsized.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War {{there have}} been a number of {{attempts}} to curb military activity or even abolish the armed forces altogether. A notable referendum on the subject, launched by an anti-militarist group, was held on 26 November 1989. It was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal. A similar referendum, called for before, but held shortly after the 11 September attacks in the US, was defeated by over 78% of voters.|$|E

5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, III Corps {{headquarters}} itself saw {{no major}} contingencies, however it saw numerous units under its command deploy to contingencies around the world. III Corps units {{were sent to}} Grenada, Panama, Honduras, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq. In the fall of 1990, two 6th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat) units deployed to Iraq during Operation Desert Shield. One of those units was 2nd Battalion, 158th Aviation Regiment, a Chinook battalion from Fort Hood. Other corps units also provided humanitarian support for Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. III Corps elements supported Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} of the Cold War is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Army leaders {{including}} General Eric Shinseki began shifting the Army force toward brigade centered operations. All separate brigades had been inactivated in the 1990s {{as part of}} the U.S. Army's drawdown following <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War. These inactivations, along with subsequent reorganization of U.S. Army divisions, saw several divisional brigades stationed in bases that were far from the division's headquarters and support units. These brigades had difficulty operating without support from higher headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, India has {{increased}} its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons {{at the time and}} was not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The British Army {{has seen}} action in major wars between the world's great powers, {{including}} the Seven Years' War, the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War and the First and Second World Wars. Britain's victories in these decisive wars {{allowed it to}} influence world events and establish itself {{as one of the}} world's leading military and economic powers. Since <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War the British Army has deployed to a number of conflict zones, often as part of an expeditionary force, a coalition force or part of a United Nations peacekeeping operation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War and {{the signing}} of the CFE Treaty gave rise to a {{requirement}} for Germany {{to reduce the size of}} its armed forces, including the number of combat aircraft. To meet this need, one of the Marinefliegers Tornado wings was disbanded on 1 January 1994; its aircraft replaced the Phantoms of a Luftwaffe reconnaissance wing. The second wing was enlarged and continued in the anti-shipping, reconnaissance and anti-radar roles until it was disbanded in 2005 with its aircraft and duties passed on to the Luftwaffe.|$|E
