40|$|A {{questionnaire}} survey {{was given to}} 1, 951 radiological <b>technologists</b> in Hokkaido to examine their views on teleradiology. The questionnaire consisted of questions about their understanding of teleradiology and interest in {{it as well as}} examining the need for teleradiology and problems with it. A total of 1, 275 radiological <b>technologists</b> responded to the survey, a response rate of 65. 4 %. The returned questionnaires were analyzed according to different groups categorized by age of the radiological <b>technologists</b> and type of medical facility. Almost all radiological <b>technologists</b> knew about teleradiology. Among the different age groups, the higher age groups showed greater recognition and understanding of teleradiology. About 60 % of radiological <b>technologists</b> were interested in teleradiology (no significant differences among age groups). When it was assumed that a teleradiology system would be introduced, (1) the working load for radiological <b>technologists</b> was estimated to be about 17, 820 (± 24, 233) yen per month. (2) Sixty percent of the respondents considered that the system should be used for the reading and diagnosis of difficult cases. (3) Fifty percent of them thought that the system should be managed and operated by radiological <b>technologists.</b> (4) Many radiological <b>technologists</b> pointed out problems concerning initial costs and the facility's management system...|$|R
