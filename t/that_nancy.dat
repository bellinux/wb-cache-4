Desperate {{to get rid}} of Nancy, Sienna frames Nancy for several dilemmas, including leaving Oscar trapped in a fire, {{in order to make it}} look like she is still addicted to painkillers.

2500|$|Abergavenney {{apparently}} had several tenders seriatim. The tender Ferret and the cutter [...] {{were involved in}} a curious incident in which Ferrets captain, Acting Lieutenant Michael Fitton, served a shark to Lieutenant Hugh Wilie, captain of Sparrow and then surprised him with some papers.

25|$|Critics gave 7 largely {{positive}} reviews, favoring its {{shift to}} more modern and global sounds, {{and its ability}} to join these sounds with local music and 90's Arabian themes. Lyrically, the record speaks of love, admiration, heartbreak and relationships, subjects <b>that</b> <b>Nancy</b> had spoken about in previous sets. In addition, other songs extend to deeper meanings about life, childhood and family.|$|E
60|$|Hence, when I became {{infatuated}} with Maude Hutchins, after that Sunday when she so unexpectedly had refused me, I {{might have known}} <b>that</b> <b>Nancy's</b> suspicions would be aroused. She startled me by accusing me, out of a clear sky, of being in love. I denied it a little too emphatically.|$|R
50|$|Through {{much of the}} TV, the recovering, childlike Nancy's world {{revolves}} entirely around Yomiko.

The AJC claimed the source was a recently released report from the Fayette County Sheriff's Office.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Ringwald {{appeared}} on the TV series Diff'rent Strokes and was selected {{to become part of}} a very large cast of that show's spin-off The Facts of Life.

25|$|Evolution has a {{different}} meaning {{in terms of the}} lizards. Leslie and Sarah are literally evolving. They were creatures that lived in the sea but apparently developed beyond their species. They were compelled to move to the land, though they do not really understand why. Though Leslie and Sarah are somewhat fearful of the change, they do accept the help <b>that</b> <b>Nancy,</b> enthusiastically, and Charlie, reluctantly, give them. At the end of the play, rather than go back into the sea where they might feel safer, they remain on land.|$|E
25|$|At {{the press}} conference held by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on July 17, 2007, it was {{announced}} that three different drugs were found in Nancy Benoit's system: hydrocodone, hydromorphone and Xanax. All three drugs were found to be at levels investigators considered normal for therapeutic treatment (as opposed to recreational use or abuse.) A blood-alcohol level was found at 0.184. Dr. Kris Sperry, the medical examiner, added it was impossible to say whether any of the blood findings was due to ingestion of alcohol or the post-mortem process. It was also ruled out <b>that</b> <b>Nancy</b> was sedated by Chris before she was murdered.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{character is}} Nancy Price Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), a housewife from southern California {{who becomes a}} pot dealer after her husband Judah (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) dies.

5000|$|Joseph Hanks died in 1793.

At <b>that</b> time, <b>Nancy</b> went to live for an unspecified period of time with her mother who was now Lucy Hanks Sparrow, having married Henry Sparrow in Harrodsburg, Kentucky two or three years earlier.

5000|$|Jennifer Stowe contends <b>that</b> <b>Nancy's</b> {{portrayal}} devolves significantly {{over the}} years: The 1930s Nancy Drew is characterized as bold, capable and independent. She actively seeks out clues, and {{is shown in}} the center of the compositions. In subsequent characterizations Nancy Drew becomes progressively weaker, less in control. By the 1990s there is a complete reversal in the representation of her character. She is often shown being chased or threatened, the confidence of 1930s being replaced by fear.|$|R
25|$|There is {{critical}} debate over exactly what genre of play Seascape is. Some {{believe it is}} a comedy, while others see it as absurdist, satirical, or allegorical. Most agree that an element of fantasy is involved. While Nancy and Charlie are humans and act accordingly, Leslie and Sarah are fantastic creations. They are human-sized lizards that have left their life in the sea to live on land. They speak perfect English and understand some aspects of human life. Charlie {{has a hard time}} accepting that they are real. He wants to believe that he and Nancy see them because they are suffering from food poisoning or are dead. In terms of the play Leslie and Sarah are very real, a fact <b>that</b> <b>Nancy</b> immediately grasps and embraces. The fantasy aspect of the play creates dramatic irony and allows issues such as progress, values, and differences to be discussed.|$|E
25|$|Nancy and Becca's husband Jake enter {{a secret}} relationship. Jake begins to control Nancy. Jake proposes to Nancy, who accepts. When Nancy begins {{tutoring}} Newt, Jake becomes convinced <b>that</b> <b>Nancy</b> will cheat {{on him with}} Newt due to Becca's infidelity with a student. When his attempts to control Nancy fails, he reports her to the police, making allegations she is {{having an affair with}} Newt; she is arrested and later fired. Fearing Nancy is not taking the allegations seriously, Jake verbally attacks her, branding her pathetic. She cries and begins blaming herself but Jake then comforts her, turning the situation around in his favour. Nancy is later cleared of the charges. Jake begins to distance her from her friends, deleting messages from her phone. Nancy discovers this and goes out with Hannah and Sarah Barnes who tell Nancy they dislike Jake and his treatment of Nancy. Nancy denies that Jake is mistreating her, further distancing herself from them. Jake later breaks her phone so that she can not contact them. When Charlie falls ill Nancy is unable to call for an ambulance so she has to leave Charlie and go for help. Jake blames Nancy for Charlie's condition. Charlie is diagnosed with leukaemia and needs a bone marrow transplant, leading to Nancy discovering Jake is not a donor match and thus not Charlie's biological father.|$|E
