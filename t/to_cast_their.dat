5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> {{votes for the}} president. As the election occurred prior to ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, each elector cast two votes for the presidency, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for the same person. Under the terms of the constitution, the individual who won the most electoral votes would become president while the individual with the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered to Congress to be counted.|$|E

5|$|Although Hancock won Georgia's {{popular vote}} easily, {{there was an}} {{irregularity}} in that state’s electoral votes. According to Article II, Section 1, clause 3 of the Constitution, “The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.” In 1792, Congress had set the date for the Electoral College {{to vote on the}} first Wednesday in December, which in 1880 fell on December 1. However, Georgia’s electors failed <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> ballots on December 1, instead voting on the following Wednesday, December 8. Congress chose to count Georgia's vote in the official tally anyway; had they not done so, Hancock’s electoral vote would have been 144, not 155.|$|E

The couple believed that humans could learn from great teachers on these journeys; Ernest said that this contact held the potential to educate and heal humanity. Ernest also spoke of the scientific advancements of other worlds. The couple also discussed revelations about their past lives, including Jesus and Mary of Bethany among their past identities. Ruth stated that she had lived about 50lives over several million years; she recalled being several well-known and a few obscure people on Earth, as well as beings from other planets and an archangel. Their group developed a mythology from the accounts that Ernest and Ruth gave of these lives, including tales from their past incarnations in Atlantis and Lemuria. Some of their stories were similar to the plots of contemporary books and films, prompting Tumminia <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> beliefs as a pastiche or bricolage of the surrounding culture.|$|E
5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> {{votes for the}} president. As originally prescribed by Article II of the Constitution, each state chose a number of electors equal to its representation in Congress. Each elector then cast two votes for president, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for the same person, and were prohibited from casting both their ballots for persons from their own state. The individual who won the most electoral votes would become president while the individual with the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered to Congress to be counted. Adams received 34 electoral college votes in the presidential election of 1789, finishing in second place behind George Washington, who garnered 69 votes. As a result, Washington became the nation's first president, and Adams became the its first vice president.|$|E

Müller, although deeply disappointed by his defeat, remained in Oxford for the rest of his career, but never taught Sanskrit there. The 1860 election was the last time that Convocation chose the Boden professor, as this power was removed in 1882 as a result of reforms imposed by Parliament. , the professorship is still in existence, and is now the last remaining Sanskrit professorship in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{candidates}} {{appeared in}} televised debates {{during which they}} discussed various topics. One of them were the rules governing the voting of non-resident nationals, which had been changed by the National Electoral Commission during the campaign. Before the campaign, non-resident nationals who wanted <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> votes as absentee ballots had been obliged to request voting materials, but the Commission had introduced a new system in which such materials were sent to all non-residents entered in the electoral register, whether they had asked for them or not. Opposition parties, representing the left-wing of Slovenian politics, disliked this move because the record of voters' addresses was not always reliable, and also because the rules had been changed after the campaign had already started. They particularly opposed the change because voters from abroad seemed to favor right-wing parties, {{so that in the}} event of a very close ballot, votes from non-residents could tip the scale in favour of Peterle.|$|E
5|$|Desha {{was drawn}} into the Holley {{controversy}} during the 1824 presidential election. When no candidate achieved {{a majority of the}} electoral votes cast, the contest was resolved by the U.S. House of Representatives. Desha and the New Court partisans in the General Assembly instructed the state's congressional delegation <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>their</b> votes for Andrew Jackson, but the delegation, led by House Speaker Henry Clay, defied these instructions and voted instead for John Quincy Adams. Because of this vote, Clay, a trustee for Transylvania and supporter of Holley, became Desha's political enemy. Desha's hostility for Transylvania and Holley worsened when, {{in the aftermath of the}} Isaac Desha trial, a student at Transylvania delivered a speech critical of the governor in the university's chapel. Although Holley was present for the speech, Transylvania historian John D. Wright, Jr. wrote that he did not know the student's topic beforehand and after hearing the speech, made no effort to condone its content. It was Holley's practice, however, to allow students to speak openly about current political matters, regardless of which position they took. Desha maintained that, because Holley had not silenced the student, he was at fault for tacitly condoning disrespectful criticism of the state's chief executive.|$|E

50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the already heated political mood, the planned local elections of May 1989 took on greater significance than usual. GDR citizens had long become accustomed <b>to</b> <b>casting</b> <b>their</b> vote by simply folding their ballot paper containing the confirmed candidate list and placing it in the ballot box without even using the voting booths. However, after falsified electoral results at some polling stations in 1986 had been noted by oppositional observers, such controls were now supposed to be systematically carried out in all regions. Since the previous summer, different groups - mostly religious in nature - had called on Christians in the GDR to actively intervene in the preparation of the election on 7 May 1989.|$|R
