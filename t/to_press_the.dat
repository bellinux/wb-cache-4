5|$|A {{delegation}} from Leeds, {{including two}} Members of Parliament (MPs), {{met with the}} Home Secretary, H H Asquith on 27 January <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> borough's case.

5|$|After {{a series}} of Russian retreats at the {{beginning}} of the campaign, the nobility grew alarmed about the advancing French troops and forced the Czar to dismiss the army's commander, Barclay de Tolly. Mikhail Kutuzov was appointed as his replacement. In a final attempt to save Moscow, the Russians made a stand near the village of Borodino, west of the town of Mozhaysk. They fortified their positions and waited for the French to attack. The Russian right wing occupied ideal defensive terrain, so the French tried <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> Russian left for much of the battle.|$|E

5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira and it would be better not <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> issue. Even so, three key members of the MCC were aware of the reality of the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.|$|E
5|$|During trials, {{the player}} cross-examines witnesses. They can move {{backwards}} and forwards through {{statements in the}} testimony, and can choose <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> witness {{for more information on}} a particular statement; sometimes, the witness will revise their testimony based on this. If the player spots a lie or a contradiction in the testimony, they can present evidence to demonstrate the contradiction. If the player presents incorrect evidence, the judge's confidence in the player will be lowered; if the judge's confidence in the player is depleted, the game ends.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, a black LGBT organisation, the Out and Proud Diamond Group (OPDG), in {{association}} with the Peter Tatchell Foundation, organised a protest outside Jamaica's London embassy on 28 August.

Peter Tatchell later asserted that the lack of action by Simpson-Miller and the police was tantamount to colluding with those guilty of an anti-LGBT hate crime.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant General Sir Manley Power, KCB, ComTE (1773 – 7 July 1826) was a British {{military}} leader {{who fought in}} a number of campaigns for Britain and rose to the rank of Lieutenant General. He is chiefly remembered for leading a brigade of Portuguese troops under The Duke of Wellington in the Iberian Peninsular War. He is also remembered for jointly causing the removal of Sir George Prevost, governor-in-chief of British North America, for Prevost's refusal <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> attack on Plattsburgh, New York, in 1814, during the War of 1812. After his active military service Sir Manley Power was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Malta.|$|E
5|$|Reviewing the {{situation}} {{at the end of}} the day, Edson, along with Colonel Gerald Thomas and Lieutenant Colonel Merrill Twining from Vandegrift's staff, decided to try to encircle the Japanese defenders around Point Cruz. They ordered 1/5 and 3/5 to continue <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> Japanese along the coast the next day while 2/5 wheeled north to envelop their adversaries west and south of Point Cruz. Tamura's battalion had taken heavy losses in the day's fighting, with Tamura's 7th and 5th Companies being left with only 10 and 15 uninjured soldiers respectively.|$|E

5|$|Signs of {{a strong}} Viet Cong and North Vietnamese {{presence}} were detected {{almost as soon as}} 3 RAR began its sweep, while the blocking elements also had a number of sightings, and a few contacts with small parties moving north. Possibly alerted by allied air and road movements, the communists seemed to be avoiding open combat. Late on the afternoon of 6 June 5 Platoon, B Company located what was thought to be the main communist position, however with nightfall approaching, it was decided not <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> attack that night. During the evening a few shots were exchanged between the Australians and Viet Cong, and the Australian platoon subsequently withdrew into a night harbour.|$|E
5|$|The British and Americans {{agreed to}} {{continue}} <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes. Although the British argued for further {{operations in the}} Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade France in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The success {{achieved}} by Operation Badr surprised Egyptian commanders, whose confidence soared. Sadat came under pressure <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> offensive towards the Sinai Passes, but remained unyielding, holding {{to the original}} goal of waging a limited war. Ahmed Ismail and Shazly were also on par with Sadat's opinion. However, appeals from the Syrians, whose situation was desperate by October 9, ultimately forced Sadat {{to change his mind}} for political reasons, against the protests of his commanders. Consequently, Egypt would lose the initiative to Israel when it launched its unsuccessful attack eastwards on October 14.|$|E

5|$|After docking in Kiel, the {{men from}} Asar-i Tevfik were {{transferred}} to İzmir, but with no funds to buy coal, the men were stranded in Germany. Germaniawerft stripped down Asar-i Tevfik, but then halted work to await the first Ottoman payment. By mid-1901, the men had accumulated significant debt and the Ottoman government had {{made no effort to}} return them or pay the installments for the modernization program. Even Kaiser Wilhelm II became involved in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman government to settle the debts incurred by the sailors. Instead, the Ottomans demanded that Krupp, the owner of the Germaniawerft shipyard, make an advance of 6,000lira so that İzmir could be prepared for the voyage back to Constantinople. The Ottomans were at the time negotiating for a large armament contract with Krupp for the Army, and used this as leverage; by late 1901, Krupp conceded, rather than risk the lucrative contract. The debts in Kiel were paid and İzmir finally departed for home.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{warships}} {{protected the}} convoy, Commodore Dance knew that lookouts could, from a distance, mistake a large East Indiaman for a ship of the line. He raised flags that indicated that his fleet included {{part of the}} Royal Navy squadron operating in the Indian Ocean {{at the time and}} formed into a line of battle. Although Linois's ships were clearly superior, the British reaction unnerved him and he quickly broke off combat. Dance continued his ruse, pursuing Linois for two hours until the body of the convoy was safe. King George III knighted Dance for his courage and various mercantile and patriotic organisations awarded him large sums of money, while both Linois's own officers and the Emperor Napoleon personally castigated the French admiral for his failure <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> attack against a weaker and extremely valuable enemy. Although he remained in command of the squadron for another two years and had some minor success against undefended merchant ships, he suffered a string of defeats and inconclusive engagements against weaker British naval forces. Ironically, Linois was captured at the Action of 13 March 1806 by a numerically superior British battle squadron that he mistook for a merchant convoy.|$|E
5|$|Despite her 50 guns, Centurions {{armament}} {{left her}} vulnerable as most were carronades, short-range heavy cannon that were useless {{in the face}} of the long-range gunnery from Marengo. Centurion consequently suffered severe damage and by 13:15 had been holed, with her rigging wrecked and her anchor cable shot through, which caused her to slowly drift away from the shore, out of control. Seeing that his opponent was disabled, Linois decided not <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> attack and issued orders for his squadron, accompanied by their prize, to sail away. Lind gradually regained control of his ship and even managed to raise some sail in pursuit, but the French were too far ahead. After some final parting shots, Centurion anchored as her crew set about repairing the damage. Linois remained within sight for the rest of the day, but showed no sign of renewing the action; he disappeared on the north-east horizon at dusk.|$|E

5|$|Essex reacted {{by making}} a {{surprise}} attack on the Royalist lines at dawn, capturing several pieces of high ground and leaving Charles on the back foot. A series of Royalist attacks led to {{a large number of}} casualties and the slow retreat of Essex's force, which was driven from the central hill and almost encircled; Essex succeeded in rallying his infantry, however, and pushed forward in a counter-attack. The slowing of this counter-attack {{in the face of the}} Royalist cavalry forced Essex to send for reinforcements, who, while marching to him, were attacked and forced to retreat. This left a hole in the Parliamentarian line, dividing the army into two wings through which the Royalists hoped to pass, splitting the Parliamentarians and allowing Charles's troops to encircle and defeat the enemy. In line with this, the Royalists moved forward <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> attack, but were forced to halt by the London Trained Bands. With night falling, the battle ended, and both exhausted armies disengaged. The next morning, low on ammunition, the Royalists were forced to allow Essex to pass and continue his retreat to London.|$|E
5|$|Flamininus {{moved his}} camp to the {{position}} where the skirmish had occurred. For a day {{he waited for the}} Spartans to attack him but, when no attack came, he called a war council to discuss whether or not <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> siege. All the Greek leaders except Aristaenos thought that they should attack the city, as capturing it was their primary objective in going to war. Aristaenos, on the other hand, argued that they should instead strike directly at Sparta and Laconia. Flamininus agreed with Aristaenos and the army marched to Tegea in Arcadia. The next day, Flamininus advanced to Caryae, where he waited for allied auxiliaries to reinforce him. These forces soon arrived and joined the Romans; they consisted of a contingent of Spartan exiles led by Agesipolis, the legitimate King of Sparta, who had been overthrown by the first Tyrant of Sparta, Lycurgus, twenty years earlier, and 1,500 Macedonians with 400 Thessalian cavalry sent by Philip. News also reached the allies that several fleets had arrived off the Laconian shore: a Roman fleet under Lucius Quinctius with forty ships; a Rhodian fleet with eighteen ships, led by Sosilas, hoping that the defeat of Nabis would stop the pirates that plagued their ships; and a Pergamene fleet of forty ships under King Eumenes II of Pergamum, who hoped to gain more favor with Rome and Roman support if Antiochus invaded.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Vizagapatam {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{fought in}} the approaches to Vizagapatam harbour in the Coastal Andhra region of British India on the Bay of Bengal on 15 September 1804 during the Napoleonic Wars. A French squadron under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois in the ship of the line Marengo attacked the British Royal Navy fourth rate ship HMS Centurion and two East Indiaman merchant ships anchored in the harbour roads. Linois was engaged in an extended raiding campaign, which had already involved operations in the South China Sea, in the Mozambique Channel, off Ceylon and along the Indian coast of the Bay of Bengal. The French squadron had fought one notable engagement, at the Battle of Pulo Aura on 15 February 1804, in which Linois had attacked the Honourable East India Company's (HEIC) China Fleet, a large convoy of well-armed merchant ships carrying cargo worth £8 million. Linois failed <b>to</b> <b>press</b> <b>the</b> attack and withdrew with the convoy at his mercy, invoking the anger of Napoleon when the news reached France.|$|E
