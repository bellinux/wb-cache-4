5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, accompanied by three light cruisers and several colliers, sailed across the Pacific Ocean—in the process evading the various Allied naval forces sent to intercept them—before arriving off the southern coast of South America. On 1 November 1914, Scharnhorst {{and the rest of}} the East Asia Squadron encountered and overpowered a British squadron at the Battle of Coronel.

5|$|In {{response}} to the growing Confederate activity in the area, Grant decided <b>to</b> <b>dispatch</b> troops from the Vicksburg trenches across the river. The presence of Maj. Gen. John G. Walker's Confederate division on the Louisiana side was of particular concern; its presence could possibly aid a Confederate escape from Vicksburg. Therefore, Brig. Gen. Alfred W. Ellet's Mississippi Marine Brigade and Joseph A. Mower's brigade from Sherman's corps were ordered to the vicinity of Milliken's Bend. Mower and Ellet were to cooperate against Walker's division, which was stationed {{in the vicinity of}} Richmond, Louisiana. Richmond also happened to be an important supply line providing Vicksburg with food from Louisiana. On June 15, Ellet and Mower defeated Walker and destroyed Richmond, Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|As {{reports of}} the grave {{registration}} work became public, the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers.

The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed. The directorate's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} dispatching mechanisms {{built into}} programming languages are sometimes inadequate {{to the needs}} of the programmer. In the case of Java, the need for more flexibility has led to the development of a number of tools, including visitors and multi-method extensions, that each add some particular functionality, but lack the generality necessary <b>to</b> support user-defined <b>dispatching</b> mechanisms. In this paper we advocate a more modular approach <b>to</b> <b>dispatching,</b> and we present a tool, PolyD, that allows the programmer <b>to</b> design custom <b>dispatching</b> strategies and <b>to</b> parametrize many aspects of the dispatching process. PolyD exhibits excellent performance and compares well against existing tools...|$|R

However, by Bachelot's arrival, KamehamehaIII had again {{changed his mind and}} Bachelot was removed from the island and confined to a ship for several months. He was freed only after the French and British navies imposed a naval blockade on the Honolulu harbor. Although he was later able to secure passage on a ship to Micronesia, he died en route and was buried on an islet near Pohnpei. His treatment in Hawaii prompted the government of France <b>to</b> <b>dispatch</b> a frigate to the island; the resulting intervention is known as the French Incident and led to the emancipation of Catholics in Hawaii.|$|E

While Rick's group is ready to abandon the farm, Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) intends to protect his land with his own life, if needed. As the group starts <b>to</b> <b>dispatch</b> walkers, Rick and Carl are able to lure a number into the barn, and set it ablaze.

Later, on 3 February, D Company, 3 RAR spoiled a harassing attack on Long Dien, and conducted a sweep of Hoa Long.
