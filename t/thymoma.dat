25|$|A <b>thymoma</b> is a tumor {{originating}} from the epithelial {{cells of the}} thymus that may be benign or malignant. Thymomas are frequently associated with the neuromuscular disorder myasthenia gravis; <b>thymoma</b> is found in 20% of patients with myasthenia gravis. Once diagnosed, thymomas may be removed surgically. In the rare case of a malignant tumor, chemotherapy may be used.|$|E

40|$|<b>Thymomas</b> are {{the most}} common tumors of the mediastinum. The {{introduction}} of multimodality treatment strategies, as well as novel approaches to the diagnosis of these tumors, has led to changes in the clinical management of <b>thymomas.</b> Here we review the literature for current clinical practice in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of <b>thymomas.</b> <b>Thymomas</b> are rare neoplasms arising from tissue elements of the thymus and developing in the anterior mediastinum [1]. They can be associated with a variety of systemic and autoimmune disorders, such as pure red cell aplasia, pancytopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, collagen-vascular disease, and most commonly with myasthenia gravis [2 – 5]. <b>Thymomas</b> are uncommon tumors with an annual incidence of only 0. 15 cases per 100, 000 person-years [6], yet representing the most frequently diagnosed tumor of the anterior mediastinum [7]. Classification of <b>Thymomas</b> Several classification systems of <b>thymomas</b> have been developed and described.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{combination}} of epithelial cells and lymphocytes {{results in a}} varied histomorphology of <b>thymomas</b> and consequent varied classification systems. AIM: To correlate the Marino and Muller-Hermelink (MMH) classification with the invasive behaviour of <b>thymomas.</b> SETTING AND DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. MATERIALS AND METHOD: <b>Thymomas</b> encountered in the past 21 years were re-classified with the MMH classification and correlated with Masaoka&#x 2032;s staging and clinical presentation. RESULTS: The <b>thymomas</b> formed 91 &#x 0025; of the primary thymic epithelial tumours. Predominantly cortical <b>thymomas</b> (n= 21) and cortical <b>thymomas</b> (n= 22) were the common subtypes and 60 &#x 0025; and 77 &#x 0025; of these, respectively, were in stages II or III. Cystic change, necrosis or haemorrhage played no role in predicting invasive behaviour. Cortical epithelium correlated well {{with the presence of}} para-thymic syndromes, especially myasthenia gravis. CONCLUSION: MMH classification is easy to apply.

40|$|Abstract:Thymomas and thymic carcinomas (TC) {{are rare}} {{epithelial}} {{tumors of the}} thymus. Although most <b>thymomas</b> have organotypic features (i. e., resemble the normal thymus), TC are morphologically undistinguishable from carcinomas in other organs. Apart from their different morphology, TC and <b>thymomas</b> differ also in functional terms (TC, in contrast to <b>thymomas,</b> have lost the capacity to promote the maturation of intratumorous lymphocytes), have different genetic features (discussed in this review), a different immunoprofile (most TC overexpress c-KIT, whereas <b>thymomas</b> are consistently negative), and different clinical features (TC, in contrast to <b>thymomas,</b> are not associated with paraneoplastic myasthenia gravis). Thus, although all the {{data suggest that the}} biology of <b>thymomas</b> and TC is different, in clinical practice, their therapeutic management up to now is identical. In the age of personalized medicine, the time may have come to think this over. We will briefly review the molecular genetics of malignant thymic tumors, summarize the current status of targeted therapies with an emphasis on the multitargeted kinase inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib, and try to outline some future directions...|$|R
25|$|As thymomas {{are seen}} in 10% of all people with the MG, people are often given a chest X-ray and CT scan to {{evaluate}} their need for surgical removal of their thymus and any cancerous tissue that may be present. Even if surgery is performed to remove a <b>thymoma,</b> it generally {{does not lead to}} the remission of MG. Surgery in the case of MG involves the removal of the thymus, although in 2013 there was no clear indication of beneficial except {{in the presence of a}} <b>thymoma.</b> A 2016 randomized controlled trial, however, found some benefits.|$|E
25|$|One-third of {{patients}} have their tumors discovered {{because they have}} an associated autoimmune disorder. As mentioned earlier, {{the most common of}} those conditions is myasthenia gravis (MG); 10–15% {{of patients}} with MG have a <b>thymoma</b> and, conversely, 30–45% of patients with thymomas have MG. Additional associated autoimmune conditions include thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity, pure red cell aplasia and Good syndrome (<b>thymoma</b> with combined immunodeficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia). Other reported disease associations are with acute pericarditis, agranulocytosis, alopecia areata, ulcerative colitis, Cushing's disease, hemolytic anemia, limbic encephalopathy, myocarditis, nephrotic syndrome, panhypopituitarism, pernicious anemia, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, sensorimotor radiculopathy, stiff person syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and thyroiditis.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{who have}} {{undergone}} thymectomy for <b>thymoma</b> should be warned of possible severe side effects after yellow fever vaccination. This is probably caused by inadequate T-cell response to live attenuated yellow fever vaccine. Deaths have been reported.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{investigated}} 16 western <b>thymomas,</b> 9 {{from the}} United States and 7 from Europe, {{for the presence}} of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA sequences by both Southern blot hybridization analysis and polymerase chain reaction using EBV-specific DNA probes that detect the long internal repeat and terminal repeat regions and the EBNA- 1 gene. None of the 16 <b>thymomas</b> contained evidence of the EBV genome, even though we could detect EBV by Southern blotting when EBV DNA represents {{less than or equal to}} 1 % of the total DNA and by polymerase chain reaction when a single EBV-positive cell is present among 10 (5) EBV-negative cells. These results fail to demonstrate EBV genome in western <b>thymomas</b> and stand in contrast to those of McGuire et al (Am J Pathol 1988, 131 : 385) who previously reported that the EBV genome is present in <b>thymomas</b> occurring in southern Chinese patients. Therefore EBV does not appear to be implicated in the pathogenesis of all <b>thymomas.</b> The presence of EBV in eastern <b>thymomas,</b> regions where EBV is endemic may be due to epidemiologic factors and/or genetic predispositions...|$|R
40|$|Using the Southern procedure, we {{have studied}} the {{presence}} of ecotropic-specific murine leukemia viral sequences in genomic DNA isolated from primary X-ray-induced <b>thymomas,</b> from lymphoid cell lines established from them, or from secondary tumors passaged in vivo. We found that primary radiation-induced <b>thymomas</b> and infiltrated spleens do not harbor newly acquired ecotropic provirus. However, additional ecotropic proviruses (which appear recombinant in the gagpol region) could be detected {{in most of the}} tumorigenic cell lines established in vitro from them and in tumors arising from subcutaneous transplantation of the primary <b>thymomas.</b> These results suggest that primary radiation-induced <b>thymomas</b> may not be clonal. They also indicate a strong correlation between the presence of ecotropic recombinant proviruses in the genome and the growth ability, both in vitro and in vivo, of specific cells within these <b>thymomas,</b> suggesting a possible mitogenic function for murine leukemia virus...|$|R
40|$|The {{histological}} {{and clinical}} features of 22 <b>thymomas</b> were reviewed. Immunohistochemical studies were performed using antibodies to cytokeratins (CAM 5. 2 and S 29) and to desmosomal protein. The heterogeneity of staining patterns {{seen in the}} epithelial cells supported the concept of separating <b>thymomas</b> into cortical, medullary, or mixed groups. Interdigitating cells were identified by antibody to S 100 protein, and these varied in number between different tumours. Clustering of interdigitating reticulum cells occurred in association with foci of mature lymphocytes which were shown by staining of the leucocyte common antigen (CD 45). The extent to which this occurred {{was used to assess}} the degree of medullary differentiation within the <b>thymomas</b> and this was correlated with the histological and clinical features. The lymphocyte population of six of the <b>thymomas</b> was studied using a range of antibodies to T and B cells; this showed the presence of B lymphocytes in <b>thymomas...</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{third of}} all people with a <b>thymoma</b> have {{symptoms}} caused by compression of the surrounding organs by an expansive mass. These problems may {{take the form of}} superior vena cava syndrome, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), cough, or chest pain.|$|E
25|$|Surgery is the {{mainstay}} of treatment for <b>thymoma.</b> If the tumor is apparently invasive and large, preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy {{may be used to}} decrease the size and improve resectability, before surgery is attempted. When the tumor is an early stage (Masaoka I through IIB), no further therapy is necessary. Removal of the thymus in adults does not appear to induce immune deficiency. In children, however, postoperative immunity may be abnormal and vaccinations for several infectious agents are recommended. Invasive thymomas may require additional treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and cisplatin).. Recurrences of <b>thymoma</b> are described in 10-30% of cases up to 10 years after surgical resection, and in the majority of cases also pleural recurrences can be removed. Recently, surgical removal of pleural recurrences can be followed by hyperthermic intrathoracic perfusion chemotherapy or Intrathoracic hyperthermic perfused chemotherapy (ITH).|$|E

40|$|The role of antigen {{expression}} by <b>thymomas</b> in {{myasthenia gravis}} (MG) is not clear. Previous reports of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) mRNA expression by the highly sensitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) produced varying results. To try to clarify this issue, we first used RT-PCR but {{then turned to}} the more accurate and quantitative RNase protection assays (RPA) to assess AChR subunit mRNA expression in <b>thymomas</b> from 25 patients (22 with MG). By RT-PCR, all five AChR subunits could be detected in many <b>thymomas.</b> However, by RPA, the mRNA for the adult-specific AChR epsilon-subunit was found in 13 / 25 (52 %) <b>thymomas,</b> but not mRNA for the other subunits. AChR epsilon-subunit was more frequently detected in <b>thymomas</b> of A or AB histology (WHO classification) than those with B 1 -B 3 histology. Overall, 6 / 6 with <b>thymomas</b> of A or AB histology were positive compared with only 8 / 19 with B histology (p= 0. 02). Autoantibodies in the two patients with the highest levels of epsilon-subunit mRNA bound better to adult (alpha(2) betadeltaepsilon) AChR than to fetal (alpha(2) betadeltagamma) AChR, whereas the other sera bound better to fetal AChR. The greater abundance of mRNA for AChR epsilon-subunit than for other subunits suggests that the AChR epsilon-subunit may play a distinctive role in autosensitization in MG-associated <b>thymomas,</b> particularly those of type A or AB...|$|R
