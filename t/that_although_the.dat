5|$|Following the collision, Melbourne {{travelled}} to Singapore {{for temporary}} repairs to her bow, arriving on 6 June. Melbourne departed Singapore on 27 June and arrived in Sydney on 9 July, where the carrier underwent almost identical repairs at Cockatoo Island Dockyard as in 1964 (primarily {{the installation of}} a new bow section). However, an industrial dispute amongst the shipyard workers meant <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> <b>the</b> work was completed in early September, the ship remained in the drydock until 11 October.|$|E

5|$|Internal realism was {{the view}} <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> <b>the</b> world may be causally {{independent}} of the human mind, {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent. The general idea is influenced by Kant's idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the world on the categories of thought.|$|E
5|$|Kylsart appealed his {{conviction}} on count 3 and was bailed pending the appeal. The appeal was heard in November 1931 where the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, ruling <b>that</b> <b>although</b> <b>the</b> statements within the prospectus were all true, the document {{as a whole}} was false because of what it concealed, omitted or implied.|$|E
5|$|Neighbours {{executive}} producer Susan Bower said {{the creation of}} the character and his storyline was a result of requests from young viewers in the Neighbours website forums.

She added that Chris's coming out storyline was also based on the real life experiences of the shows writers.|$|E

5|$|Plantinga argued <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> <b>the</b> first {{premise is}} not rationally established, {{it is not}} {{contrary}} to reason. Michael Martin argued that, if certain components of perfection are contradictory, such as omnipotence and omniscience, then the first premise is contrary to reason. Martin also proposed parodies of the argument, suggesting {{that the existence of}} anything can be demonstrated with Plantinga's argument, provided it is defined as perfect or special in every possible world.|$|E
5|$|Swedish analysts Carolina Vendil Pallin and Fredrik Westerlund said <b>that</b> <b>although</b> <b>the</b> Russian Black Sea Fleet did {{not meet}} {{significant}} resistance, it proved effective at implementing elaborate manoeuvres.

5|$|After Armstrong {{served as}} backup {{commander}} for Apollo 8, Slayton offered him {{the post of}} commander of Apollo11 on December 23, 1968, as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon. In a meeting that was not made public until the publication of Armstrong's biography in 2005, Slayton told him <b>that</b> <b>although</b> <b>the</b> planned crew was Armstrong as commander, lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin and command module pilot Michael Collins, he was offering the chance to replace Aldrin with Jim Lovell. After thinking it over for a day, Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with Aldrin, as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command. Replacing Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the Lunar Module Pilot, unofficially the lowest ranked member, and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell, the commander of Gemini 12, in the number3 position of the crew.|$|E
5|$|After their {{training}} had been completed, on 17 November the sappers were transported to an RAF airfield at Skitten in Scotland, with the operation scheduled to commence two days later. On {{the evening of}} 19 November, Group Captain Cooper, {{with the aid of}} a Norwegian meteorologist and regular reports from the SOE agents stationed near the landing zone, decided <b>that</b> <b>although</b> <b>the</b> weather was not perfect, it would be best to launch the operation that night; Cooper believed that if it were delayed, the weather might deteriorate on subsequent days and prevent the operation from being conducted entirely. The first aircraft–glider combination took off from the airfield at 17:50, with the second following at 18:10; after circling the airfield several times the two combinations headed out across the North Sea towards their objective.|$|E
5|$|Although Dean's {{landfall}} in Mexico {{occurred in}} a relatively uninhabited area and the storm's well-predicted track gave ample warning, the storm inflicted extreme damage. In Majahual, the only town to experience {{the full force of}} the hurricane, hundreds of buildings were destroyed. Quintana Roo Governor Félix González Canto reported <b>that</b> <b>although</b> <b>the</b> cleanup in the state capital of Chetumal was completed within three weeks, it took more than six months to fix all of the region's more rural roads. Unable to handle the hurricane's aftermath, the state government appealed to federal authorities for aid. Together, they established a housing-repair fund which contributed to the reconstruction of over 37,000residences.|$|E

5|$|Although officially {{designated}} a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual {{report to the}} World Meteorological Organization that Grace {{should not have been}} classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued <b>that</b> <b>although</b> <b>the</b> storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{explained}} <b>that</b> <b>although</b> <b>the</b> {{title of}} his documentary was Fuck, he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as Fuck, including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title. Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, {{it was important to}} keep Fuck as its title.|$|E
5|$|Atchison {{remarked that}} his {{theme for the}} film, deemed an {{inspirational}} film, was about overcoming obstacles despite difficult challenges along the way. He {{also said that he}} wanted to portray African Americans in a manner that was not stereotypical and tried to show how African American children incorporate some stereotypes. The film alludes to the importance of community as well as to problems black communities face. It also deals with esteem and stigma in school while criticizes the public school system. Cast members said <b>that</b> <b>although</b> <b>the</b> film was aimed at children, they considered it had important lessons for the parents as well.|$|E

5|$|British {{architect}} Frederick Gibberd {{published a}} diagrammatic comparison of Durham Cathedral alongside a power station {{typical of the}} design of the time, like the one planned at Kepier. This made clear <b>that,</b> <b>although</b> <b>the</b> Cathedral was {{one of the largest in}} the country, it still would looked small next to the projected power station. It was argued that as long as the two structures were viewed simultaneously, the visual juxtaposition would be detrimental to the Cathedral. Somewhat ironically, Gibberd's Didcot Power Station would later be voted the third worst eyesore in Britain in 2003.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, traffic {{congestion}} {{on the bridge}} had become a serious problem. A 1978 study revealed <b>that</b> <b>although</b> <b>the</b> bridge could handle a peak 1,600 vehicles passing over the bridge per hour, excess traffic pushing it towards its theoretical capacity of 1,920 vehicles per hour could potentially cause gridlock on the bridge. The United States Senate report accompanying the fiscal 1983 appropriation bill for the United States Department of Transportation mentioned that its replacement had become a high priority. A proposed schedule was for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to receive plans for a cable stayed superstructure by February 1, 1983, and for the project {{to be approved by}} mid-April 1983.|$|E
5|$|David French {{wrote that}} the {{follow-up}} formations landing in Normandy were on average two days behind schedule and that had the 33rd Armoured Brigade, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and the 7th Armoured Division's infantry brigade landed on time, XXX Corps {{might have been able}} to secure Villers-Bocage, before the arrival of substantial German forces. Other historians wrote that substantial British forces remained uncommitted during the battle. Mungo Melvin wrote <b>that</b> <b>although</b> <b>the</b> 7th Armoured Division changed its organisation to a flexible combined arms structure, which was not done by the other British armoured divisions until after Operation Goodwood, neither the 131st Infantry Brigade nor the balanced divisional reserve of an armoured regiment and an infantry battalion were employed well.|$|E
