40|$|Familial adenomatous {{polyposis}} (FAP) is a hereditary disorder {{caused by}} mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, {{which leads to}} adenoma formation and subsequently to cancer, predominantly in the colon and the rectum {{but also in the}} duodenum. The cancer morbidity and mortality can be decreased by presymtomatic screening and surgical treatment. We have therefore studied the epidemiology of the disease in the Swedish population over time and the effect of family screening. Data was obtained from the Swedish Polyposis Registry, which was set up in the late 1950 s. The registry included 431 patients in 145 families at the end of 1996. The risk of having colorectal cancer (CRC) at diagnosis was very low in patients detected by screening. Moreover, females were diagnosed with symptoms and CRC significantly earlier than males. The most common surgical treatment for FAP has been colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (IRA), but since the early 1980 s, restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has been an alternative to IRA. Patients with IRA remain at risk of rectal cancer. Therefore we investigated the risk of rectal cancer and rectal amputation after IRA and searched for risk factors that could predict the fate of the rectal stump. We also compared the surgical and functional outcome of IRA and IPAA. Rectal cancer occurred in almost 10 % of IRA operated patients despite a high rectal excision rate. Dense polyposis was shown to be a risk factor for a malignant trait. However, the functional outcome was better after IRA, compared to IPAA. Duodenal cancer has become the second most common cause of death in FAP patients as screening and prophylactic treatment of CRC have improved. We assessed the risk of premalignant and malignant lesions in the periampullary region of the duodenum in 180 patients screened by upper endoscopy. The cumulative risk at age 60 of periampullary advanced adenomas and adenocarcinomas was 20 % and 10 %, respectively. We also investigated <b>the</b> <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> in families with these lesions. Mutations were found in 14 out of 16 families accessible for analysis and they were clustered between codons 1051 - 1309 in exon 15 of the APC gene. The pathogenesis of intestinal adenomatosis in FAP is still unknown. Thus, we studied tenascin and alkaline sphingomyelinase, factors that have been implicated in the regulation of epithelial cell growth regulation. Tenascin, an extracellular matrix constituent, was found to be differently expressed in dysplastic and hyperplastic mucosa of rectal adenomas in FAP patients compared to surrounding normal mucosa and mucosa from controls. The sphingomyelinase activity was decreased both in adenomas and surrounding normal mucosa from FAP patients. In conclusion, a national screening program for FAP efficiently reduces the risk of CRC although patients operated with IRA are still at risk of rectal cancer, especially those with a high number of polyps at operation. It also demonstrates the influence of gender on the course of the disease. IPAA, although more radical than IRA, has the disadvantage of a poorer functional outcome. Duodenal cancer is a an increasing clinical problem and advanced periampullary adenomas together with genotype seem to be predictive of prognosis. Tenascin and alkaline sphingomyelinase may be involved in the pathogenesis of adenoma formation in FA...|$|E

In contrast, villi are longer in the ileum of ApcMin/+ mice relative to C 57 BL/ 6 mice at 12 and 15 weeks of age.

Peripheral blood counts, however, did not differ between C 57 BL/ 6 and ApcMin/+ mice at 15 weeks of age. Lymphoid depletion in ApcMin/+ mice was characterized by diminished numbers of splenic lymphoid follicles and small intestinal Peyer's patches.

40|$|Background and Aim. Germline {{mutations}} of the adenomatous polyposis coli (<b>APC)</b> <b>gene</b> cause {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} (FAP), an {{autosomal dominant}} inherited disease mainly characterized by colorectal adenomatous polyposis. Genetic studies of FAP have shown that somatic APC mutations are dependent on the position of <b>the</b> germline <b>APC</b> mutation. However, <b>the</b> molecular mechanism underlying these genotype-phenotype associations for APC in Chinese remain largely unknown. Patients and Methods. In this study, we investigated <b>the</b> <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutation</b> in a Chinese FAP family by systematic screening with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC), and DNA sequencing. Promoter methylation was detected by methylation-specific PCR. Results. The identical germline mutation c. 1999 C>T (Q 667 X) of APC was identified in 5 affected members, among which 2 members carried somatic mutations of APC, one with promoter hypermethylation {{and the other with}} loss of wild-type allele in their adenomas. The somatic mutations were shown connected with the disease severity, demonstrating a unique genotype-phenotype association in this FAP pedigree. Conclusion. The study revealed the existence of novel pathogenic mutations in Chinese patients with FAP.

40|$|AbstractPeriampullary {{carcinoma}} is {{a malignant}} tumour {{arising from the}} ampulla of vater. Adenomatous polyposis coli (<b>APC)</b> <b>gene</b> has {{a key role in}} stabilizing β-catenin pathway, in which hypermethylation in <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> could lead to proteasome degradation of β-catenin. The aim of this case report is to identify <b>the</b> <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutation</b> and its influence on β-catenin pathway in patient with periampullary carcinoma. A 51 -year-old woman was diagnosed with yellow discolouration of sclera, passing deep yellow coloured urine and pruritus. A family history of ovarian cancer had been reported in her mother. Her radiological, pathological and laboratory examination confirmed periampullary carcinoma. She underwent whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy, and the histopathology of the resected specimen showed a well differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the ampulla of vater. Further, the tumour region was subjected to genetic screening by polymerase chain reaction – restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), cytogenetic analyses such as karyotyping and immunohistochemical techniques. These results showed non-sense <b>mutation</b> in <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> at codon 1309, chromosomal alterations at 5 q 21 and irregular accumulation of β-catenin in nuclear membrane. The family history revealed a strong association of ovarian cancer (maternal) with a similar <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutation.</b> We conclude that periampullary carcinoma patient exhibit FAP due to de novo germ-line <b>mutation</b> of <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> that engenders an inactivation of β-catenine/TCF mediated transcription function, which is linked with a family history of ovarian cancer...|$|R
50|$|Familial adenomatous {{polyposis}} (FAP) {{is caused}} by an inherited, inactivating <b>mutation</b> in <b>the</b> <b>APC</b> <b>gene.</b> More than 800 <b>mutations</b> in <b>the</b> <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> {{have been identified in}} families with classic and attenuated types of familial adenomatous polyposis.

40|$|Objectives. <b>The</b> <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutation</b> {{triggers}} {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} (FAP) {{and approximately}} 80 % of sporadic colorectal cancers. FAP summarizes {{the natural history of}} colorectal cancer because low-and high-grade dysplastic lesions and adenocarcinoma are simultaneously present in the same patients free from individual and environmental variability factors. Estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) has recently been suggested as the most likely mediator of estrogen-related anti-carcinogenic effects in Apc(Min-/+) mice and humans. In this study we assessed the ER beta expression in the intestinal mucosa of FAP patients to verify its possible involvement in tumor progression in colorectal cancer. Material and methods. ER beta and ER alpha expression, cell proliferation (Ki- 67) and apoptosis (TUNEL), were evaluated on archival biopsy material from six patients with FAP who underwent colectomy. Results. A progressive significant decrease of ER beta expression was observed in the different stages of the disease as compared to normal mucosa (p < 0. 001). Interestingly, a decreased ER beta expression was directly correlated with apoptosis (r = 0. 76, p < 0. 001), and inversely correlated with cell proliferation (r = 0. 54, p < 0. 05). Conclusions. ER beta expression is related to the severity of the disease, supporting the role of ER beta as a relevant biomarker of tumor progression and possible chemopreventive target in patients at risk of colonic neoplasia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Germline {{mutations}} in <b>the</b> adenomatous polyposis <b>gene</b> (<b>APC)</b> result in {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} (FAP). FAP is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder predisposing to colorectal cancer. Typical FAP is characterized by hundreds to thousands of colorectal adenomatous polyps and by several extracolonic manifestations. An attenuated form of polyposis (AFAP) is characterized by less than 100 adenomas and later onset of the disease. Methods Here, we analyzed <b>the</b> <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> for germline <b>mutations</b> in 59 Czech and 15 Slovak FAP patients. In addition, 50 apparently APC mutation negative Czech probands and 3 probands of Slovak origin were screened for large deletions encompassing <b>the</b> <b>APC</b> <b>gene.</b> <b>Mutation</b> screening was performed using {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} and/or protein truncation test. DNA fragments showing an aberrant electrophoretic banding pattern were sequenced. Screening for large deletions was performed by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification. The extent of deletions was analyzed using following microsatellite markers: D 5 S 299, D 5 S 82, D 5 S 134 and D 5 S 346. Results In the set of Czech and Slovak patients, we identified 46 germline mutations among 74 unrelated probands. Total mutation capture is 62, 2 % including large deletions. Thirty seven mutations were detected in 49 patients presenting a classical FAP phenotype (75, 5 %) and 9 {{mutations in}} 25 patients with attenuated FAP (36 %). We report 20 novel germline APC mutations and 3 large deletions (6 %) encompassing the whole-gene deletions and/or exon 14 deletion. In the patients with novel mutations, correlations of the mutation localization are discussed in context of the classical and/or attenuated phenotype of the disease. Conclusion The results of the molecular genetic testing are used both in the establishment of the predictive diagnosis and in the clinical management of patients. In some cases this study has also shown the difficulty to classify clinically between the classical and the attenuated form of FAP according to the established criteria. Interfamilial and/or intrafamilial phenotype variability was also confirmed in some cases which did not fit well with predicted genotype-phenotype correlation. All these findings have to be taken into consideration both in the genetic counselling and in the patient care. </p...|$|R

Adoptive transfer of in vitro generated Apc/Min+ iTregs (inducible Tregs) failed to inhibit intestinal tumorigenesis, suggesting that naïve CD 4 T cells generated from Apc/Min+ mice thymus were impaired. We also showed that adoptively transferred IL- 17 A-deficient Apc/Min+ Tregs inhibited tumor growth, suggesting that IL- 17 A was critical to impair the tumor regression function of Apc/Min+ Tregs.

In general, carriers of biallelic MYH mutations should be treated and followed up as for FAP patients with a similar phenotype. Relatives of MAP patients should be counseled as for any other recessive condition, although it remains possible that carriers of single mutations are at a modestly increased risk of colorectal cancer...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that both dysfunction of the Wnt signaling pathway, including mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (<b>APC)</b> and β-catenin <b>genes,</b> and genetic instability play {{important roles in}} colorectal carcinogenesis. However, alteration of the components in the Wnt signaling pathway in colorectal cancer (CRC) with microsatellite instability (MSI) has not been elucidated. In order to assess {{the status of the}} Wnt signaling components in CRC with MSI, mutational analyses of <b>the</b> β-catenin, <b>APC,</b> Axin 1, and T cell factor 4 (TCF 4) genes were performed. Three of 33 samples had mutations in exon 3 of the β-catenin gene and two in <b>the</b> <b>APC</b> <b>gene.</b> Eight <b>mutations</b> in seven samples were detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism and subsequent direct sequence analysis of the entire coding region of the Axin 1 gene. Furthermore, TCF 4, {{which is one of the}} transcriptional factors in the Wnt signaling pathway and has a mononucleotide repeat sequence (a nineadenine repeat, (A) 9) in its C-terminal region, was mutated in 13 of the 33 samples. Thus, alteration in the Wnt signaling pathway is frequently observed in CRC with MSI, including hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, as well as in familial adenomatous polyposis and sporadic CRC without MSI. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and {{aggressive}} cancers worldwide. The majority of CRC cases are sporadic that caused by somatic mutations. The Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC; OMIM 611731) is a tumor suppressor gene of Wnt pathway and is frequently mutated in CRC cases. This study was designed to inves-tigate <b>the</b> spectrum of <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> in Iranian patients with sporadic colorectal cancer. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, Tumor and normal tissue samples were obtained from thirty randomly selected and unrelated sporadic CRC patients.

Eighty three of 825 FAP patients (10 %) from 49 of 161 kindreds (30 %) had desmoids. The absolute risk of desmoids in FAP patients was 2. 56 / 1000 person years; comparative risk was 852 times <b>the</b> general population. <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> were similar in families with and without desmoids.

40|$|We {{examined}} the adenomatous polyposis coli (<b>APC)</b> <b>gene</b> for disease-causing <b>mutations</b> in 51 unrelated Argentinean probands affected by {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} (FAP). Using {{a combination of the}} protein truncation test, the single strand conformation polymorphism technique, DNA sequencing and quantitative PCR analysis, we identified the specific mutation in 39 (average age: 28. 4 years) of the 51 probands (detection rate: 76. 47 %); 13 are novel germline mutations and one is a novel sequence variant. There were 27 small deletions, four small duplications, five nonsense mutations in exon 15, three nonsense mutations in exons 6, 11, and 12, and one sequence variant in exon 3 identified in a patient bearing a truncating mutation in exon 15. The most common mutation (found in 10 cases) was at codon 1309. All patients negative for APC mutations were also negative for the MutY homolog (MYH) <b>gene</b> <b>mutation,</b> as expected because of fully penetrant FAP cases.

40|$|Abstract Background Familial adenomatous {{polyposis}} (FAP) is an autosomal dominant-inherited {{colorectal cancer}} syndrome, caused by germline <b>mutations</b> in <b>the</b> <b>APC</b> <b>gene.</b> Recently, biallelic <b>mutations</b> in MUTYH {{have also been}} identified in patients with multiple colorectal adenomas and in APC -negative patients with FAP. The aim of this work is therefore to determine <b>the</b> frequency of <b>APC</b> and MUTYH mutations among FAP families from two Spanish populations. Methods Eighty-two unrelated patients with classical or attenuated FAP were screened for APC germline mutations. MUTYH analysis was then conducted in those APC -negative families and in 9 additional patients from a previous study. Direct sequencing, SSCP analysis and TaqMan genotyping were used to identify point and frameshift mutations, meanwhile large rearrangements in <b>the</b> <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> were screened by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Results APC germline mutations were found in 39 % of the patients and, despite the great number of genetic variants described so far in this <b>gene,</b> seven new <b>mutations</b> were identified. The two hotspots at codons 1061 and 1309 of <b>the</b> <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> accounted for 9, 4 % of <b>the</b> <b>APC</b> -positive families, although they were underrepresented in Galician samples. The deletion at codon 1061 was not found in 19 APC -positive Galician patients but represented 23 % of the Catalonian positive families (p = 0, 058). The same trend was observed at codon 1309, even though statistical analysis showed no significance between populations. Twenty-four percent of <b>the</b> <b>APC</b> -negative patients carried biallelic MUTYH germline mutations, and showed an attenuated polyposis phenotype generally without extracolonic manifestations. New genetic variants were found, {{as well as the}} two hotspots already reported (p. Tyr 165 Cys and p. Gly 382 Asp). Conclusion The results we present indicate that in Galician patients the frequency of the hotspot at codon 1061 in APC differs significantly from the Catalonian and also other Caucasian populations. Similar results had already been obtained in a previous study and could be due to the genetic isolation of the Galician population. MUTYH analysis is also recommended for all APC -negative families, even if a recessive inheritance is not confirmed. </p...|$|R

Although <b>the</b> <b>APC</b> <b>gene</b> is expressed in most tissues, including the lung, liver, kidney, and mammary gland, its somatic mutations have rarely been found in primary tumors affecting these organs.
