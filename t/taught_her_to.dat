5|$|Turner was {{introduced}} to Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism in 1973 by a friend of Ike's named Valerie Bishop. Turner wrote in her autobiography I, Tina that after Valerie <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> recite the Buddhist chant Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, Tina observed that Ike, instead of hitting her for singing supposed wrong notes during recording sessions, would give her money to go shopping, something she regarded as a benefit of her newfound spiritual practice.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's father <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{play the}} piano, which she {{mastered}} well {{enough for him}} to believe that she might follow in his sister's footsteps and become a professional musician. Blyton considered enrolling at the Guildhall School of Music, but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer. After finishing school in 1915 as head girl, she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at Seckford Hall near Woodbridge in Suffolk. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway provided inspiration for her later writing. At Woodbridge Congregational Church Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at Ipswich High School, and suggested that she train as a teacher. Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school, and recognising her natural affinity with them she enrolled in a National Froebel Union teacher training course at the school in September 1916. By this time she had almost ceased contact with her family.|$|E

Fighting on the non-dominant side of things through her activism allowed <b>her</b> <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>her</b> book-writing with a deeper level of understanding sufficient {{enough to know what}} was going on. The voice she had in her activism in the 1970s also helped her obtain her theoretical voice used in her books. Adams explains, in many interviews, that <b>her</b> activism <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> how <b>to</b> write.|$|R

25|$|Catherine was young, joyous and carefree; Mannox had <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{play the}} virginals. She {{was too young}} to take part in {{administrative}} matters of State. Nevertheless, every night Sir Thomas Heneage, Groom of the Stool, came to her chamber to report on the King's well-being. No plans were made for a coronation, yet she still travelled downriver in the royal barge into the City of London to a gun salute and some acclamation. She was settled by jointure at Baynard Castle: little changed at court, other than the arrival of many Howards. Every day she dressed with new clothes in the French fashion bedecked with precious jewels. With ominous foresight the motto adopted read Non autre volonte que la sienne (No other wish but his), decorated in gold around her sleeves.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Mary, Elizabeth's other daughter, Anne, {{is thought to}} have had a close relationship with her mother. Elizabeth had been in charge of her children's early education, including Anne's, and she had <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> play on various musical instruments, to sing and to dance, as well as embroidery, poetry, good manners, reading, writing and some French. In 1525, Henry VIII fell in love with Anne, and Elizabeth became her protective chaperone. She accompanied Anne to Court, since Anne was attempting to avoid a sexual relationship with the King. Elizabeth travelled with Anne to view York Place {{after the fall of the}} Boleyn family's great political opponent, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey — an intrigue which had given Anne her first real taste of political power. She was crowned queen four years later.|$|E
25|$|Mohammed Fleyfel took a close {{interest}} in Nouhad's talent. Among other things, he <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> recite verses from the Koran (in the recitative style known as Tajweed). On one occasion, Nouhad was heard singing by Halim el Roumi, {{head of the}} Lebanese radio station and a prominent musician {{in his own right}} (also the father of the famous Lebanese singer Majida Roumi). Roumi was impressed by her voice and noticed that it had a rare flexibility that allowed her to sing both Arabic and Western modes admirably. At Nouhad's request, El Roumi appointed her as a chorus singer at the radio station in Beirut and went on to compose several songs for her. He chose for her the stage name Fairuz, which is the Arabic word for turquoise.|$|E

25|$|In any case, Hildegard and Jutta were {{enclosed}} {{together at}} the Disibodenberg, and formed {{the core of a}} growing community of women attached to the male monastery. Jutta was also a visionary and thus attracted many followers who came to visit her at the cloister. Hildegard tells us that Jutta <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> read and write, but that she was unlearned and therefore incapable of teaching Hildegard sound biblical interpretation. The written record of the Life of Jutta indicates that Hildegard probably assisted her in reciting the psalms, working in the garden and other handiwork, and tending to the sick. This might have been a time when Hildegard learned how to play the ten-stringed psaltery. Volmar, a frequent visitor, may have taught Hildegard simple psalm notation. The time she studied music could have been the beginning of the compositions she would later create.|$|E
25|$|Her {{mother died}} in 1838 and she took up much of the {{domestic}} chores {{as a result of}} this while an elder sister and teacher <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> read and write as well as to sing and use the guitar; she also learned how to sew and cook. The girl also turned a small room in her house as a domestic chapel. Martillo had a clear perception of her call to saintliness as a child and received her Confirmation on 16 September 1839. Martillo frequented a small wood near her home for contemplation in solitude while the guava tree near which she went to is now a large pilgrimage destination. The girl also chose the then-Blessed Mariana de Jesús as her patron with whom she identified and strived to imitate in her own life. Martillo was known for being sweet and thoughtful with a peaceful and generous disposition; she was obedient to those around her and was well-known and loved in her village. Martillo was blonde with bright blue eyes and was strong and agile; she was also tall.|$|E

After stopping briefly at Marseille they sailed on to Antibes, where they remained {{for more than six}} months, unable to gain permission to leave. There David met and became greatly influenced by the ageing writer Norman Douglas, about whom she later wrote extensively. He inspired her love of the Mediterranean, encouraged her interest in good food, and <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> [...] "search out the best, insist on it, and reject all that was bogus and second-rate."

Months later, after her half-brother sold the farm, Paine found them [...] "looking sad and dejected" [...] with Nathaniel in South Killingly, Connecticut and made arrangements for her mother and step-father to live in an apartment.|$|E

Goodwin explained that [...] "we go on quite an adventure and I came away with an actual, physical scar from it." [...] The incident required that the actress' face receive stitches in a hospital emergency room. Goodwin and Joshua Dallas {{said that it was}} their favorite episode up to that point, with Dallas saying it was [...] "lot of fun to shoot and it’s just great." [...] In another tweet, Goodwin commented that Jennifer Morrison <b>taught</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> perform CPR during a scene with Dallas, as Morrison learned the procedure while she was a regular on House M.D.|$|E

In the first carnival she competed in, she finished sixth in the F-division 50 m butterfly. She was informed about disabled athletes by a teacher at school. Her initial reaction to learning about disabled sport was to question if she was [...] "disabled enough" [...] to compete. She made her first national team appearance {{when she was in}} year 12 in school, after winning twelve gold medals in national swimming meets. By that time, Cooper had already begun serious training, waking up at 4 a.m. to make sure she had time in the pool.|$|E
