The organisation established reporting and recording facilities in a number of overseas locations, including the Middle East, Greece and around the Asia-Pacific region. An early challenge to its independence came in June, 1940 when wartime censorship was imposed, meaning that the Department of Information (headed by Sir Keith Murdoch) took control of the ABC's 7 p.m. nightly national news bulletin. This lasted until September, when control of the news was returned to the ABC after listeners expressed a preference for independent news presented by the Commission.|$|E

2500|$|Brazil’s public {{research}} institutes {{and universities}} follow rigid rules {{that tend to}} make them difficult to manage. States may opt {{to develop their own}} research institutes and university systems but, as all laws and regulations are adopted at federal level, they all have to follow the same rules and regulations. Thus, they all come up against the same hurdles. These include extensive bureaucratic structures, an obligation <b>to</b> <b>recruit</b> <b>staff,</b> academic or otherwise, from among public servants, analogous career ladders and salary systems, an irregular flow of funds, overly complex procurement procedures and powerful unions in the civil service. A structural alternative was developed in 1998, with the creation of social organizations. These private, non-profit entities manage public research facilities under contract to federal agencies. They have the autonomy to hire (or fire) staff, contract services, buy equipment, choose the topics and objectives of scientific or technological research and sign research contracts with private companies. The flexibility accorded to these social organizations and their management style have made them a success story in Brazilian science. As of 2015, there were six such organizations: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to regular EMS, many jurisdictions also have non-emergency patient transport services operating. In many jurisdictions, these are companies {{who specialize in}} non-emergency patient transfers. [...] Such companies have their own vehicles, which are similar to ambulances and carry some similar patient care equipment. These services can relieve the workload on public EMS through the elimination of some, or most, of the non-emergency transfer volume, and some provide service {{to the public that}} is of the highest standard. In many cases, such services are small private businesses, using second-hand ambulances which have been retired from public EMS service, while others use vehicles expressly built for their purposes. There has, however, been some controversy, in some jurisdictions, with respect to the operating procedures of some (but not all) of these services. [...] In some cases, the vehicles are often made to look as much like EMS ambulances as possible, even retaining emergency lights and sirens (which they are forbidden by law to use), and incorporating the word [...] "paramedic" [...] (this term is not protected in Canada yet), variations on [...] "EMS" [...] (in some cases, [...] "event medical services") or spelling variations of [...] "ambulance", such as [...] "ambu-lans", or using the Star of Life logo on their vehicle markings. These services are not generally licensed, or required to meet any recognized standard. These services generally attempt <b>to</b> <b>recruit</b> <b>staff</b> who meet provincial EMS qualification standards, but are under no legal obligation to do so. Such services are not covered by provincial health insurance, operate on a fee-for-service basis, and are not considered to be a legitimate part of mainstream EMS.|$|E

40|$|Although exact {{numbers are}} not known, {{it is clear}} that the {{proportion}} of people with a disability within the UK clinical psychology workforce remains significantly less than within the UK population generally. The aim of this study was to investigate the attractiveness of clinical psychology to people living with a disability who are or are studying to become eligible to apply for professional psychology training. Q methodology was used to analyse patterns in the Q sorts of statements about recruitment incentives and disincentives of thirty three participants. From an exploratory factor analysis of ratings, four narrative interpretations are presented, one for each of four factors identified. Based upon high- and low-rated statements, each narrative demonstrates broad attraction to clinical psychology held in tension with various disincentives. The tensions generated by each narrative probably demand differing degrees of tolerance from potential <b>recruits</b> <b>to</b> apply for training. We conclude critically, wondering whether the profession’s disincentives outweigh its attractors for <b>recruiting</b> <b>staff</b> with a disability. Key Practitioner Message: •	Appreciating how potential applicants with a disability may construe clinical psychology, is a step further towards realising a more representative workforce •	Self-examination by the UK clinical psychology profession is required to raise awareness of barriers, inadvertent or otherwise, <b>to</b> <b>recruiting</b> <b>staff</b> with a disability...|$|R
