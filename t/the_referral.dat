40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} <b>the</b> {{appropriateness of}} <b>referrals</b> of high-risk pregnancies {{in the basic}} healthcare network of Sobral, in Ceará, Brazil. Methods: A descriptive quantitative study. The medical files of 173 pregnant patients referred to the high-risk outpatient clinic of Centro de Especialidades Médicas of Sobral, {{during the period from}} July 2006 to April 2007, were analyzed. Variables analyzed were correctness of <b>the</b> <b>referrals,</b> professionals who made them, causes and origins of <b>the</b> <b>referrals,</b> and age bracket of the patients referred. <b>The</b> <b>referrals</b> were divided into “appropriate” and “inappropriate”, according to the classification of risk established by the technical manual of the Ministry of Health. Rresults: Of the 173 cases, 102 (59 %) were considered appropriate/correct, and 71 (41 %) referrals were considered inappropriate/incorrect. <b>The</b> <b>referrals</b> were divided according to the professional class of the referring individuals: physicians or nurses. Of <b>the</b> 173 <b>referrals,</b> 49 (28. 3 %) were made by physicians, and 124 (71. 7 %) by nurses. Of the 49 patients referred by physicians, 39 (79. 6 %) were considered correct. Of <b>the</b> 124 <b>referrals</b> made by nurses, 63 (50. 8 %) were considered incorrect, revealing {{a significant difference between the}} groups (p < 0. 00001). The most common causes of referrals of pregnant patients were hypertensive syndromes (23. 6 %), physiological modifications of pregnancy (22. 6 %), prolonged pregnancy (15. 1 %), and diabetes (12. 3 %). Cconclusions: There was a low rate of appropriate/correct referrals.

On 25 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited Esther Ackah, a distant relative of Kouao by marriage, and a midwife, counsellor and preacher. Ackah and her daughter noted that Climbié was wearing a wig and looked small and frail. On 26 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited the Homeless Persons' Unit of Ealing Council, where they were seen by Julie Winter, a homeless persons' officer. Together, Kouao and Winter completed a housing application form. Kouao explained that Climbié was wearing a wig because she had short hair, an explanation accepted by Winter. Although Winter was shown Climbié's passport (with a photograph of Anna), she {{paid no attention to}} them, believing that Kouao's application was ineligible on the grounds of habitual residence.

25|$|In 2000 and 2006, Paleontologists around Octávio Mateus {{described}} a find from the Lourinhã Formation in Portugal {{as a new}} specimen of Ceratosaurus, consisting of an upper thigh bone, a shin bone, and several isolated teeth. The specimen provides evidence of a Portuguese theropod fauna similar in composition to the North American Morrison Formation: Besides Ceratosaurus, the researchers also noted the presence of Allosaurus and Torvosaurus in the Portuguese rocks. During the Late Jurassic, Europe had just been separated from North America by the still narrow Atlantic Ocean, and Portugal, {{as part of the}} Iberian Peninsula, was still separated from other parts of Europe. The similarity between the Portuguese and North American theropod fauna indicates the presence of a temporary land bridge, allowing for faunal interchange.

30|$|These large {{immediate}} {{effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>referrals</b> are {{not consistent with}} the crowding out of informal search methods by formal ones (Engström 2012; van den Berg and van der Klaauw 2006) and seem to suggest that both the automated and <b>the</b> caseworker-induced <b>referrals</b> can enhance <b>the</b> matching of job seekers to vacancies (Fougère et al. 2009). The finding that <b>the</b> automated <b>referrals</b> generate lower effects than <b>the</b> caseworker induced <b>referrals</b> is consistent with the hypothesis that automated referrals are of lower quality than the ones with a caseworker intervention. In this line of reasoning, one may expect that referrals that are transmitted to the unemployed after a personal meeting are more effective in raising the job-finding rate than referrals that are sent by the caseworker without this personal contact. This is not what we find, but this may be {{explained by the fact that}} less individuals receive a referral in case of an invitation than when they are directly transmitted this referral by e-mail or telephone contact: 34 % of the invited job seekers do not show up at the meetings (see Fig.  1); when meetings take place, the job seeker receives a referral in only 45 % of the cases (see Fig.  1), presumably because the personal contact reveals to the caseworker that a referral to a vacancy is not the best strategy to bring the unemployed back to work. This implies that only 30 % of the invited individuals receive a <b>referral.</b> If <b>the</b> short-run treatment effect would be completely induced by <b>the</b> <b>referrals,</b> <b>the</b> employment rate would be enhanced by as much as 410 % (= 123 / 0.30) per referral, which is about twice the magnitude of <b>the</b> effect of <b>referrals</b> that were sent out by caseworkers without these personal meetings. But this is for sure an overestimation, because it is unlikely that the effect of the invitations is only induced by <b>the</b> <b>referrals</b> that are sent out in this case. In fact, in view of the persistence of the effects, we argue next that part of the immediate effects is likely related to the “wake-up call” that the treatment triggers among the unemployed: it makes them realize that the PES is indeed monitoring their search behavior and that if they do not intensify their search they might be sanctioned.|$|R
