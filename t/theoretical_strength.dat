We accomplish this by reflecting on the implications of symbolic interactionist ethnography for enriching interpretive research, and by highlighting how the adaptation of the “constant comparison ” technique from grounded theory may help move the ethnography study towards theoretical interpretation of symbolic interactions in varied IS research settings. In particular, we argue that the approach as outlined in this paper may effectively combine the <b>theoretical</b> <b>strengths</b> of the interactionist perspective with the empirical strengths of ethnography and the analytical edge of grounded theory. This approach may thus provide one starting point to help reconcile between the pursuit of academic knowledge vis-à-vis practice-oriented insights in IS research...|$|R

The anchorage was defended by a fortified citadel (known today as Fort St.-Louis), manned by the local militia company, and by the warship Les Jeux under Captain Thomas-Claude Renart, while they could expect some additional assistance from the captains and crews of the merchant ships in the harbour.

Fearon concludes that asymmetric information and commitment problems are the two sufficient explanations for why rational actors might choose to wage war because they appropriately explain why an actor's most rational choice is to fight instead of negotiate.|$|E
