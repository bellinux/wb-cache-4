5|$|He {{was baptized}} Francisco Javier Eugenio de Santa Cruz y Espejo in the El Sagrario parish on February 21, 1747. According to most historians, {{his father was}} Luis de la Cruz Chuzhig, a Quichua Indian from Cajamarca, who arrived in Quito as an {{assistant}} to the priest and physician José del Rosario, and his mother was Maria Catalina Aldás, a mulatta native to Quito. However, some historians, especially Carlos Freile Granizo, argue <b>that</b> <b>contemporary</b> documents imply that Espejo's mother was white; for instance, his parents' marriage was recorded in the book for white marriages (as they were deemed as criollos), and the birth certificates of Espejo and his siblings were entered in the same book.|$|E

5|$|Jose Brandao, a {{historian}} specializing in North American Native history, suggests <b>that</b> <b>contemporary</b> {{analyses of the}} Lachine Massacre continue to demonstrate cultural bias. Brandao criticizes historians Parkman, Charles McIlwain, and George Hunt for citing the growing dependence on European goods (which were, according to these historians, viewed by the Iroquois as superior to other goods) {{as a reason for}} Iroquois dissatisfaction and violence. Brandao dismisses this theory as a largely ethnocentric interpretation with little evidence to support it. Brandao also dismisses Hunt’s suggestion that natives, similar to the Europeans, waged wars for economic reasons.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins and Edgar Anderson wrote a {{paper in}} 1954 on the {{importance}} of hybridization in adapting to new environments. They proposed novel adaptations would facilitate the invasion of habitats not utilized previously by either parent and that novel adaptations may facilitate the formation of stabilized hybrid species. Following this paper, Stebbins developed the first model of adaptive radiation. He proposed that a high degree of genetic variability was necessary for major evolutionary advances, that because of slow mutation rates, genetic recombination was the most likely source of this variation, and that variation could be maximised though hybridization. As of 2006, research is ongoing regarding whether hybridization is an accidental consequence of evolution or if it is necessary for the creation and evolution of plant species; it has been argued <b>that</b> <b>contemporary</b> studies are part of an intellectual lineage that started with the work of Stebbins and Anderson.|$|E
5|$|Brin {{originally}} {{planned for the}} ships to displace 13,850 tons (14,066 tonnes), to have a secondary armament of eighteen 6-inch (152-mm) guns, and to carry 3,000 tons (3,047 tonnes) of coal for increased range over that of the Caio Duilio class. In the end, however, the 6-inch (152-mm) armament was reduced to eight 6-inch (152mm) and the coal capacity to 1,700 tons (1,727 tonnes) on 15,000 tons (15,237 tonnes) displacement. The number of 6-inch (152-mm) guns was reduced because {{it was found that}} the additional guns could not have been manned when the 17-inch (432-mm) guns were in use. Unlike other ships built at the time, the two Italia-class ironclads dispensed with vertical belt armor. Brin believed <b>that</b> <b>contemporary</b> steel alloys could not effectively defeat armor-piercing shells of the day. Additionally, fitting belt armor on a ship the size of Italia would cause a prohibitive increase in displacement, and so he discarded it completely in favor of a thin armored deck.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that some Taíno men and African women inter-married and lived in relatively isolated Maroon communities {{in the interior of}} the islands, where they evolved into a hybrid rural or campesino population with little or no interference from the Spanish authorities. Scholars also note <b>that</b> <b>contemporary</b> rural Dominicans retain Taíno linguistic features, agricultural practices, food ways, medicine, fishing practices, technology, architecture, oral history, and religious views.

25|$|Contrastingly, Rabinow {{defines the}} {{contemporary}} as a (re)assemblage of both {{old and new}} elements and their interactions and interfaces.

Emergence refers to “a state in which multiple elements combine to produce an assemblage, whose significance cannot be reduced to prior elements and relations.” It follows that the History of the Present, while often helpful, is not fully adequate {{to work on the}} contemporary because by definition the contemporary is contingent.|$|E

25|$|Richard Rorty {{argues in}} Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature <b>that</b> <b>contemporary</b> {{analytic}} philosophy mistakenly imitates scientific methods. In addition, he denounces the traditional epistemological perspectives of representationalism and correspondence theory that rely upon {{the independence of}} knowers and observers from phenomena and the passivity of natural phenomena in relation to consciousness. As a proponent of anti-foundationalism and anti-essentialism within a pragmatist framework, he echoes the postmodern strain of conventionalism and relativism, but opposes much of postmodern thinking with his commitment to social liberalism.|$|E

He thought <b>that</b> <b>contemporary</b> Christianity was subject to Ahrimanic influence, since it tended towards materialistic interpretations. Steiner predicted that Ahriman, as a supersensible Being, would incarnate into an earthly form, 'some little time after our present earthly existence, in fact in the third post-Christian millennium'.|$|E
