Studies with AEDs on spontaneous seizures (chronic period) of this model {{have not yet been}} established. We now report the effects of different AEDs on spontaneous seizures. Male Wistar rats were subjected to PILO-induced SE. Following recovery from SE animals were daily observed in order to detect spontaneous seizures and to establish the baseline seizure frequency.

PB, CBZ and PHT were effective against spontaneous seizures. VPA was also effective against spontaneous seizures at the dose of 600 mg/kg and ETX was inactive against these seizures. Such pharmacological profiles correlate well with complex partial seizures. the results indicate that spontaneous recurrent seizures after PILO-induced SE may be a useful model for finding new AEDs with better efficacy against complex partial seizures. the use of animal models that share both pharmacological and phenomenological features with human epilepsy might improve their predictive value for specific types of human epilepsy.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 201 : 320 - 325, 1977. The effects of ethosuximide on spinal monosynaptic transmission were studied in cats. The drug in doses of 200 or 400 mg/kg deepened {{the decline of}} monosynaptic response amplitude evoked by trains of 10 stimuli to a motor nerve at 2, 5 or 10 Hz, without affecting the transmission of single isolated impulses. The patterns of decline were analyzed {{under the assumption that}} they reflect a partial depletion of the apparent transmitter stores in the presynaptic terminals, each incoming volley releasing a constant fraction of the store while a constant fraction of the instant size of the depleted part is being replenished per second. Ethosuximide increased the fractional release without a consistent effect on the fractional rate of replenishment. It is suggested that the resulting more rapid and more profound depletion of the apparent transmitter store could account for the observed preferential depression of repetitive transmission in the spinal monosynaptic pathway by this drug. From the neuropharmacological evidence available, it appears very likely that the major part of action of antiepileptic drugs is exerted on normal neurons rather than on pathologi-cally altered neurons of the seizure focus (Woodbury, 1969). One of the synaptic phenom-ena which is affected by anticonvulsants is the synaptic recovery.

The antagonistic action of antiepileptic drugs effective against seizures induced by excitatory amino acids (diazepam and valproate), and drugs acting on excitatory amino acid receptors (AP 7, CPP, and KYNA) upon seizures induced by AOAA suggests an involvement of excitatory neurotransmission in the convulsant action of the drug.

Diphenylhydantoin sodium (Dilantin Sodium), 100 mg., and/or phenobarbital, 30 - 100 mg., three to four times a day, is recommended in patients with focal and grand mal epilepsy. Psychomotor automatisms are a form of focal seizure. Primidone (Mysoline), in doses of 125 - 250 mg. two to three times a day, is a very useful anticonvulsant in patients with myoclonic features, psychomotor automatisms and grand mal seizures. Primidone should be started in small doses. Drug reactions, especially cerebellar ataxia in the case of diphenylhydantoin and blood dyscrasias in the case of some drugs, should be recognized. Excessive drowsiness can be avoided by proper dosage and proper timing of drug administration. Patients should be seen regularly at least two to three times a year. The objective of treatment is to achieve optimum control of seizures by using the appropriate drug in adequate dosage. Social adaptation is good in the majority of patients, who should be encouraged to carry on their life independently, usually free to marry and have children. Attention to special occupational hazards has to be considered. Education of employers and employees is often necessary. Special work arrangements are occasionally indicated for selected patients. Patients should be seizure-free for two to three years before permission is given to drive an automobile...|$|E
