40|$|For {{satellites}} in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) {{the available}} propellant mass {{leads to a}} limited yet predictable operational life span. Already in an early phase during routine operations the question arises whether the remaining propellant is sufficient to fulfill the expected operational lifetime. Especially {{towards the end of}} operational life the remaining propellant mass is the driving factor for deciding when <b>to</b> <b>re-orbit</b> the satellite to the graveyard orbit. Therefore, at any time during mission operations, a statement about the expected durability of the remaining propellant mass is desired. A simple extrapolation of retrospective propellant mass data is insufficient since the mass consumption is affected. Three impacts that severely influence the propellant consumption are identified. The major impact on the satellite is the sequential consumption of the propellant mass seen over the whole satellite lifetime. With diminishing satellite mass the amount of propellant needed to create a specific velocity increment, is decreasing. As an effect of the sequential propellant mass reduction the propellant pressures drop over the long term, which represents the second major impact. Therefore, an increasing amount of propellant is needed to create a specific velocity increment. The perturbations on the orbit due to the moon and the su...|$|E
40|$|Through careful {{consideration}} of the orbit perturbation force due to the oblate nature of the primary body a secular variation of the ascending node angle of a near-polar orbit can be induced without expulsion of propellant. Resultantly, the orbit perturbations {{can be used to}} maintain the orbit plane in, for example, a near-perpendicular (or at any other angle) alignment to the Sun-line throughout the full year of the primary body; such orbits are normally termed Sun-synchronous orbits [1, 2]. Sun-synchronous orbits about the Earth are typically near-circular Low-Earth Orbits (LEOs), with an altitude of less than 1500 km. It is normal to design a LEO such that the orbit period is synchronised with the rotation of the Earth‟s surface over a given period, such that a repeating ground-track is established. A repeating ground-track, together with the near-constant illumination conditions of the ground-track when observed from a Sun-synchronous orbit, enables repeat observations of a target over an extended period under similar illumination conditions [1, 2]. For this reason, Sun-synchronous orbits are extensively used by Earth Observation (EO) platforms, including currently the Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT), the second European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS- 2) and many more. By definition, a given Sun-synchronous orbit is a finite resource similar to a geostationary orbit. A typical characterising parameter of a Sun-synchronous orbit is the Mean Local Solar Time (MLST) at descending node, with a value of 1030 hours typical. Note that ERS- 1 and ERS- 2 used a MLST at descending node of 1030 hours ± 5 minutes, while ENVISAT uses a 1000 hours ± 5 minutes MLST at descending node [3]. Following selection of the MLST at descending node and for a given desired repeat ground-track, the orbit period and hence the semi-major axis are fixed, thereafter assuming a circular orbit is desired it is found that only a single orbit inclination will enable a Sun-synchronous orbit [2]. As such, only a few spacecraft can populate a given repeat ground-track Sun-synchronous orbit without compromise, for example on the MLST at descending node. Indeed a notable feature of on-going studies by the ENVISAT Post launch Support Office is the desire to ensure sufficient propellant remains at end-of-mission for <b>re-orbiting</b> <b>to</b> a graveyard orbit to ensure the orbital slot is available for future missions [4]. An extension to the Sun-synchronous orbit is considered using an undefined, non-orientation constrained, low-thrust propulsion system. Initially the low-thrust propulsion system will be considered for the free selection of orbit inclination and altitude while maintaining the Sun-synchronous condition. Subsequently the maintenance of a given Sun-synchronous repeat-ground track will be considered, using the low-thrust propulsion system to enable the free selection of orbit altitude. An analytical expression will be developed to describe these extensions prior to then validating the analytical expressions within a numerical simulation of a spacecraft orbit. Finally, an analysis will be presented on transfer and injection trajectories to these orbits...|$|R
