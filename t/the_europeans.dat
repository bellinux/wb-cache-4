5|$|Firearms {{remained}} {{in use in}} China throughout the following centuries. Meanwhile, gunpowder and firearms spread elsewhere very quickly. Gunpowder {{seems to have been}} widely known by the 13th century. <b>The</b> <b>Europeans,</b> Arabs, and Koreans all obtained firearms in the 14th century. The Turks, Iranians, and Indians all got firearms no later than the 15th century, in each case directly or indirectly from <b>the</b> <b>Europeans.</b> The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century, and then from the Portuguese rather than the Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Scholars cannot {{tell from}} records whether {{the writers of}} the time, when using the term Tonto Apache, were {{referring}} to Yavapai or Apache, or those mixed bands. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> often referred to the Wi:pukba and Guwevkabaya incorrectly as the Yavapai Apache or Yuma Apache. <b>The</b> <b>Europeans</b> referred to the Ɖo:lkabaya, the southwestern group of Yavapai, and the Hualapai (who belonged to the Upland Yuma Peoples), as Yuma Apache or Mohave Apache.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, several tribes, {{including}} the Shawnee, migrated into Indiana, where they attempted to resettle in land belonging to the Miami. The Iroquois gained the military advantage after they were supplied with firearms by <b>the</b> <b>Europeans.</b> With their superior weapons, the Iroquois subjugated at least thirty tribes and nearly destroyed several others in northern Indiana.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{inaccurate}} {{though to}} depict the conflict as one sided and mainly perpetrated by Europeans on Aborigines. Although many more Aborigines died than British, this may have {{had more to do}} with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by <b>the</b> <b>Europeans.</b> Aboriginal tactics varied, but were mainly based on pre-existing hunting and fighting practices—using spears, clubs and other primitive weapons. Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America, on the main Aborigines failed to adapt to meet the challenge of <b>the</b> <b>Europeans.</b> Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms, this was not widespread. The Aborigines were never a serious military threat to European settlers, regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them. On occasions large groups of Aborigines attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued, during which the Aborigines would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage. This could sometimes be effective, with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents, waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their spears while the settlers reloaded. However, such open warfare usually proved more costly for the Aborigines than <b>the</b> <b>Europeans.</b>|$|E

5|$|Jose Brandao, a {{historian}} specializing in North American Native history, suggests that contemporary {{analyses of the}} Lachine Massacre continue to demonstrate cultural bias. Brandao criticizes historians Parkman, Charles McIlwain, and George Hunt for citing the growing dependence on European goods (which were, according to these historians, viewed by the Iroquois as superior to other goods) {{as a reason for}} Iroquois dissatisfaction and violence. Brandao dismisses this theory as a largely ethnocentric interpretation with little evidence to support it. Brandao also dismisses Hunt’s suggestion that natives, similar to <b>the</b> <b>Europeans,</b> waged wars for economic reasons.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{has also}} often {{been accused of}} exaggerating the atrocities he {{described}} in the Indies, some scholars holding that the initial population figures given by him were too high, making the population decline look worse than it actually was, and that epidemics of European disease were the prime cause of the population decline, not violence and exploitation. Demographic studies {{such as those of}} colonial Mexico by Sherburne F. Cook in the mid-20th century suggested that the decline {{in the first years of}} the conquest was indeed drastic – ranging between 80 and 90%, due of course to many different causes, but all ultimately traceable to the arrival of <b>the</b> <b>Europeans.</b> The overwhelming main cause was disease introduced by <b>the</b> <b>Europeans.</b> It has also been noted that exaggeration of numbers was the norm in writing in 16th-century accounts, and both contemporary detractors and supporters of Las Casas were guilty of similar exaggerations.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{debate whether}} an {{alliance}} between the Franks and Mongols would {{have been successful in}} shifting {{the balance of power in}} the region, and if it would have been a wise choice on the part of <b>the</b> <b>Europeans.</b> Traditionally, the Mongols tended to see outside parties as either subjects or enemies, with little room in the middle for a concept such as an ally.|$|E

5|$|The first {{official}} communications between Western Europe and the Mongol Empire occurred between Pope Innocent IV (fl. 1243–1254) and the Great Khans, via letters and envoys that were sent overland and {{could take years}} to arrive at their destination.

5|$|This road got {{its name}} because it {{formerly}} served as a demarcation line which separated the civic area from the ethnic settlements of Singapore {{as part of the}} British colonial government's town planning, known as the Jackson Plan.

5|$|According to Jerusalem {{architectural}} historian David Kroyanker, {{the heyday}} of the Downtown Triangle lasted from the early 1930s to the 1970s. Many stores and restaurants were opened by German Jewish immigrants who sought to recreate a European ambience in the city center. Their upscale boutiques, coffeehouses, delicatessens, and exclusive restaurants were frequented by senior Mandate officials and wealthy, English-speaking tourists. Unlike Israeli stores that sold all kinds of unrelated products under one roof, <b>the</b> <b>Europeans</b> introduced boutiques that featured only one item, such as gloves or ties. Some shops offered unique extras, such as coffeehouses that included an orchestra and dance floor, and a bookstore with a second-floor library.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{establishment}} of Iximche, the K'iche' left the Kaqchikel in peace {{for a number}} of years. The peace did not last and the Kaqchikel soundly defeated their former overlords around 1491. This was followed by infighting among the Kaqchikel clans with the rebel clans finally being overcome in 1493. Wars against the K'iche' continued throughout the early 15th century. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in Mexico, the Aztec emperor sent messengers to warn the Kaqchikel. After the surrender of the Aztecs to Hernán Cortés, Iximche sent its own messengers to offer a Kaqchikel alliance with the Spanish. Smallpox decimated the population of Iximche before the physical arrival of <b>the</b> <b>Europeans.</b> At the time of the Spanish Conquest Iximche was the second most important city in the Guatemalan Highlands, after the K'iche' capital at Q'umarkaj. Conquistador Pedro de Alvarado was initially well received in the city in 1524 and the Kaqchikel kings provided the Spanish with native allies to assist in the conquest of the other highland Maya kingdoms. Iximche was declared the first capital of the Kingdom of Guatemala in the same year. Due to excessive Spanish demands for tribute the Kaqchikel soon broke the alliance and deserted their capital, which was burned 2 years later by Spanish deserters. <b>The</b> <b>Europeans</b> founded a new town nearby but abandoned it in 1527 due to the continued hostility of the Kaqchikel, who finally surrendered in 1530.|$|E
