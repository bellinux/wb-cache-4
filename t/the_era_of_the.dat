5|$|During the ages, {{the lands}} {{surrounding}} {{the town of}} Suwałki had been variously part of Lithuanian, Polish, and German borderlands.

5|$|For example, in the 17th century, {{the solar}} cycle {{appeared}} to have stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum.

Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{influential}} linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it {{was assumed}} that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary. Although onomatopoeia is a clear exception, since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic, the Saussurean approach was to treat these as marginal exceptions. ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges this theory.|$|E

5|$|Another {{genre of}} history writing {{produced}} during <b>the</b> <b>Era</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Princes was the terse Ethiopian annal known as ya'alam tarik.

For instance, the translated work of John of Nikiû explaining human history until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 642 became a canonical text in Ethiopian historiography. There are also chronological and genealogical lists of rulers and Orthodox Church patriarchs that include some elements of historical narrative.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{their main}} campus in Broadmoor, the {{congregation}} also operates Beth Israel Cemetery, {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Located at 19th Street and 5th Avenue, it was originally outside of Meridian's city limits and {{was intended to be}} a rural cemetery, but the city has since expanded and annexed the area containing the cemetery. The cemetery contains generations of German and Alsatian immigrants, as well as many big names of the largely mercantile Jewish community of {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries. Beth Israel Cemetery is the only remaining built memorial for many of Meridian's early Jews since <b>the</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1879 and 1906 temple buildings, neither of which still stands.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, with <b>the</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> romantic ballet at an end, the {{principal}} personalities of the ballet, such as Perrot, Saint-Léon, Taglioni, and the composer Pugni, joined the Tsar's Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg, Russia. Ballet in London {{went through a}} considerable decline beginning with the fire at Her Majesty's Theatre, a decline that lasted {{until the end of}} the 19th century. Ballet in London was not resurrected until the early 20th century, when such dancers as Adeline Genée began performing. The theatre's ballet company found a new home at the Old Vic and soon took on the name of the Vic-Wells Ballet. Later, moving primarily to the Sadler's Wells Theatre, the company became known as the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Eventually the troupe began performing at the Royal Opera House and became the Royal Ballet, as it is known today.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{political}} upheaval, the Egyptian temple style continued to evolve without absorbing much foreign influence. Whereas earlier temple building mostly focused on male gods, goddesses and child deities grew increasingly prominent. Temples {{focused more on}} popular religious activities such as oracles, animal cults, and prayer. New architectural forms continued to develop, such as covered kiosks in front of gateways, more elaborate column styles, and the mammisi, a building celebrating the mythical birth of a god. Though {{the characteristics of the}} late temple style had developed by the last period of native rule, most of the examples date from <b>the</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ptolemies, Greek kings who ruled as pharaohs for nearly 300 years.|$|E

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{collodion}} process, {{before the}} arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the gelatin silver process, photographic film, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|E
5|$|Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, {{when the}} Catholic King James II of England was deposed and the Protestant William III ascended the throne, a {{rebellion}} of Maryland Puritan Protestants overthrew Calvert's rule. They quickly rescinded the Toleration Act and banned public practice of Catholicism, {{and it would}} never be reinstated under colonial rule. In fact, the colony established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718. The Calvert family regained control over the colony in 1715, but only after Benedict Calvert converted to Protestantism. His political control remained tenses enough that he did not risk an attempt to reinstate protections for Catholics. It took until <b>the</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Revolution for religious tolerance or freedom to again become the practice in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In Roman Britain Cumbria was the {{territory}} of the Carvetii. As the site of the western part of Hadrian's Wall, it was of strategic importance. The north of the county is rich in archaeological evidence from the period, but nothing is known that suggests any Roman habitation in the Keswick area, other than finds that point to the existence of one or more Roman highways passing the vicinity of the present-day town. Such nearby settlements as can be traced from <b>the</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romans and the years after their departure seem to have been predominantly Celtic. Many local place names from the period, including that of the River Derwent, are Celtic, some closely related to Welsh equivalents.|$|E
