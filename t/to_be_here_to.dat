500|$|At {{the age of}} 21 years old, Zamzam Mohamed Farah was {{the only}} female athlete {{competing}} for Somalia at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She was making her first appearance in the quadrennial event. Prior to the competition, Farah spoke of her and Mohamed's training which involved running through manned militia road blocks who occasionally mistaken them for suicide bombers and threatened to shoot them. Despite this, {{she said that she}} was [...] "very much excited" [...] to compete at the Games: “I hope I will win, inshah’Allah [...] That is what I am expected to do, so that I can change the narrative of Somalia.” Farah competed in the first heat of the women's 400 metre discipline on 3 August, finishing seventh and last of all runners, with a time of one minute and 20.48 seconds. She finished behind Geisa Coutinho of Brazil (53.43 seconds) and Kazakhstan's Marina Maslyonko (53.66 seconds) in a heat led by Francena McCorory of the United States (50.78 seconds). Farah finished 45th (and last) out of all runners overall, and was unable to advance into the semi-finals after finishing 28.39 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in her heat who made the later stages. After the event she was appaulded by the crowd and said: [...] "It was great <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> participate in the Olympic Games and tell people Somalia is still here." ...|$|E
