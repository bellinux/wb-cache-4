5|$|As {{the weather}} warmed and work resumed {{on the main}} pipeline, Alyeska administrators were distracted by a {{controversy}} about pipeline welds {{that had been done}} the previous year. In September 1975, a former employee of Ketchbaw Industries filed suit against the company, alleging that he had been laid off because he would not participate in a conspiracy to falsify quality control X-Rays of pipeline welds. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was unique among pipeline projects to that point in that it required all welds of the main pipeline <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>verified</b> by X-Ray. This was a time-consuming process, and the quality-control procedures continually lagged behind the welders.|$|E
5|$|In Vietnam, {{heavy rains}} {{produced}} by the typhoon caused widespread flooding in northern provinces. Early assessments from the Vietnamese flood control committee indicated that 60,000hectares (148,000acres) of rice fields were submerged and 6,700metric tons (7,400short tons) of grain were soaked. High winds also caused extensive damage. At least 29,000homes collapsed and 119,000others were left roofless. Additionally, 572 hospitals or clinics were damaged. Several fatalities were reported in the region; however, they had yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>verified</b> by October12. Within two weeks of Brian's passage, Typhoons Angela and Dan struck the country, causing further damage and loss of life. Due to the rapid succession of storms, losses resulting from the three typhoons are difficult to differentiate. Because of the widespread damage caused by the storms, the Vietnamese Government appealed for international assistance.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-6 {{was named}} for the Kepler Mission, a NASA and {{accomplishment}} project launched in 2009 that aims to discover Earth-like planets that transit, or cross in front of, their home stars with respect to Earth. Unlike stars like the Sun or Sirius, Kepler-6 {{does not have a}} common and colloquial name. The discovery of Kepler-6b was announced by the Kepler team on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society along with planets around Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8. It was the third planet to be discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>verified</b> by data from Kepler had been previously discovered. These three planets were used to test the accuracy of Kepler's measurements.|$|E

25|$|Track {{switching}} greatly increases headway distance. A vehicle {{must wait}} for the previous vehicle to clear the track, for the track to switch and for the switch <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>verified.</b> If the track switching is faulty, vehicles {{must be able to}} stop before reaching the switch, and all vehicles approaching the failed junction would be affected.|$|E
25|$|Most NAND {{devices are}} shipped {{from the factory}} with some bad blocks. These are {{typically}} marked according to a specified bad block marking strategy.

25|$|Mechanical vehicle {{switching}} minimizes inter-vehicle spacing or headway distance, but it {{also increases}} the minimum distances between consecutive junctions. A mechanically switching vehicle, maneuvering between two adjacent junctions with different switch settings, cannot proceed from one junction to the next. The vehicle must adopt a new switch position, and then wait for the in-vehicle switch's locking mechanism <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>verified.</b> If the vehicle switching is faulty, that vehicle {{must be able to}} stop before reaching the next switch, and all vehicles approaching the failed vehicle would be affected.|$|E
25|$|In other {{situations}} the delusion {{may turn out}} to be true belief. For example, in delusional jealousy, where a person believes that their partner is being unfaithful (and may even follow them into the bathroom believing them to be seeing their lover even during the briefest of partings), it may actually be true that the partner is having sexual relations with another person. In this case, the delusion does not cease to be a delusion because the content later turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>verified</b> as true or the partner actually chose to engage in the behavior of which they were being accused.|$|E

In April 1932, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton at the Cavendish laboratory in England announced that they had bombarded lithium with protons and succeeded in transmuting it into helium. The energy required {{turned out to be}} quite lowâ€”well within the capability of the 11-inch cyclotron. On learning about it, Lawrence wired the Berkeley and asked for Cockcroft and Walton's results <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>verified.</b> It took the team until September to do so, mainly due to lack of adequate detection apparatus.|$|E

25|$|Before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, {{there was}} no {{regulation}} of securities at the federal level. Even firms whose securities were publicly traded published no regular reports or even worse rather misleading reports based on arbitrarily selected data. To avoid another Wall Street Crash, the Securities Act of 1933 was enacted. It required the disclosure of the balance sheet, profit and loss statement, the names and compensations of corporate officers, about firms whose securities were traded. Additionally those reports had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>verified</b> by independent auditors. In 1934 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was established to regulate {{the stock market and}} prevent corporate abuses relating to the sale of securities and corporate reporting.|$|E

Once Bell was convinced the message was genuine, he became enraged. On 20 February, Hall informally sent a copy to United States Ambassador Walter Hines Page. On 23 February, Page met with British Foreign Minister Arthur Balfour and was given the ciphertext, the message in German, and the English translation. Page then reported the story to President Woodrow Wilson, including details <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>verified</b> from telegraph company files in the United States. Wilson released the text to the media on 28 February 1917.|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{definition}} alone {{it is not}} obvious that NP-complete problems exist; however, a trivial and contrived NP-complete problem can be formulated as follows: given {{a description of a}} Turing machine M guaranteed to halt in polynomial time, does there exist a polynomial-size input that M will accept? It is in NP because (given an input) it is simple to check whether M accepts the input by simulating M; it is NP-complete because the verifier for any particular instance of a problem in NP can be encoded as a polynomial-time machine M that takes the solution <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>verified</b> as input. Then {{the question of whether the}} instance is a yes or no instance is determined by whether a valid input exists.|$|E
