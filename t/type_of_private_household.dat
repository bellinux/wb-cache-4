It is shown that the difference is small for households consisting {{of at least three}} persons. For three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> households the {{difference between}} net wages and social assistance is measured for the 1962 - 1998 period.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{problems}} existing in the poultry meat and egg markets in Nairobi is investigated. Particular emphasis is directed towards revealing the structUre of the retailing and wholesaling systems for both poultry meat and eggs. In addition, sources of supply, marketing channels and functions performed at various levels 1 n the marketing of the different products are indicated. Producers and consumers were not interviewed and, hence, the discussion on supply and demand fluctuations and their effect on wholesale and retail prices is based on non-quantitative {{information provided by the}} retailers. _ Finally the price-setting determinants at wholesale and retail levels are looked into. The term 'poultry' has been adopted and is used synonymously to the term 'chicken'. This is due to the insignificance of other kinds of poultry (e. g. turkeys, duck and geese) in the Nairobi Market. A further distinction Is made within the poultry industry with respect to <b>types</b> <b>of</b> products marketed. Two broad categories of chicken are distingu~shed. These are the 'soft chicken referred to as 'broilers' and thc'tough-meated ones referred to as 'boilers' or 'backyard' Chicken. The <b>types</b> <b>of</b> consumers (<b>private</b> <b>households</b> or' institutions and hotels) and the nature of competition between the 'broiLer pr~ducts ~nd backyard chicken are investigated. Various important aspects forming the background to the study are discussed briefly in Chapter 1. Chapters 2, 3 and 4 are devoted to introductory remarks about the existing problems in the poultry meat and egg markets in Nairobi, objectives of the study and research methodology respectively. The survey results for poultry meat marketing are presented in Chapter 5 and those for egg marketing in Chapter 6.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{financial}} balances {{implies that the}} general government balance can be improved only if the enterprise sector and the foreign sector simultaneously increase their financial deficits and the household sector cuts its surplus. This paper explores how these adjustments can be influenced by economic policy during “a period of diminished expectations” (a period of weak GDP growth {{which is expected to}} persist for the coming years). Credit financed growth <b>of</b> <b>private</b> investment is unlikely to accelerate as capacity utilization rates are low. Increased spending by the foreign sector, which allows an export oriented growth strategy, could be dampened by simultaneous budget consolidation efforts of all European countries. Savings rates <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>households</b> have increased during the crisis. In order to reduce them various alternatives are discussed. Firstly, a credit financed housing bubble This has been practiced by some economies in recent years, but proved to be not sustainable. Secondly, a decline of unemployment rates and consequently of precautionary saving: During periods of low growth of GDP and employment, improvements in the employment elasticity of growth enhancing policy measures and reductions of working time could be effective in this respect. Thirdly, incentives for upper income households to expand investment expenditures and cut back their savings. Fourthly, a redistribution of wealth and income: This strategy leads to a decrease of average savings rates and an increase of consumption rates <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>households.</b> Budget consolidation, fiscal balances, savings rates <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>households...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Paying {{pharmaceuticals}} out-of-pocket is {{an important}} source of financing pharmaceutical consumption. Only limited empirical knowledge is available on the determinants of these expenditures. OBJECTIVES: In this paper we analyze which characteristics <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>households</b> influence out-of-pocket pharmaceutical expenditure (OOPPE) in Austria. DESIGN & METHODS: We use cross-sectional information on OOPPE and on household characteristics provided by the Austrian household budget survey 2009 / 10. We split pharmaceutical expenditures into the two components prescription fees and over-the-counter (OTC) expenditures. To adjust for the specific characteristics of the data we compare different econometric approaches: two-part model, hurdle model, generalized linear model, zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. FINDINGS: The finally selected econometric approaches give a quite consistent picture. The probability of expenditures <b>of</b> both <b>types</b> is strongly influenced by the household structure. It increases with age, doctoral visits and the presence of a female householder. The education level and income only increase the probability of OTC-pharmaceuticals. The level of OTC-expenditures remains widely unexplained while the household structure and age influences the expenditures for prescription fees. Insurance characteristics <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>households</b> either <b>private</b> or public play a minor role in explaining the expenditure levels in all specifications. This refers to a homogenous and comprehensive provision of pharmaceuticals in the public part of the Austrian health care system.

40|$|Most of {{previous}} empirical analyses concerning the consumption <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>households</b> mainly took specific goods {{or groups of}} goods into consideration yielding rather a rag rug than a consistent picture. The aim of the analysis is to sort {{out some of the}} partially dispa-rate results and to draw an overall picture of the development of the spending <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>households</b> over a large period of time. Especially, the structure of spending and its changes will be analysed and set into relation to the welfare of society and periods of different eco-nomic prosperity. Special emphasis will be given to the question, whether emerging vertical and horizontal social inequalities respectively the development of diversification and indi-vidualisation of life-styles is going to be reflected in the spending <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>households</b> and in the related structure over time. The empirical analysis is based upon the Laufende Wirtschaftsrechnungen of the Statisti-cal Office of Germany, which cover a period of 35 to 50 years depending on the specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> household. These data record the spending of three household-types, (i) two-person households of pensioners and people on social security, (ii) four-person households with middle income and (iii) four-person households with high income. Expenditures for these household groups are portrayed for nine groups of goods. The empirical analysis of changes in the structure of spending over a large period of about 50 years shows two effects, first, a rise in spending <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>households</b> in real terms and, second, considerable changes in the composition of the expenditure structure. The relevance of spending on housing, health care and traffic raised substantial and dominate the structure in the 1990 ’s, whereas the spending on food and semi-luxuries, on furniture and household effects, and on clothing noticeably dropped. So, in 1964 spending on food and semi-luxuries dominated the structure whereas in 1998, the main part of spending belonged to housing. In the course of these changes, a levelling of the structural differences between the three household types took place which principally proved to be an adaptation to the expen-diture pattern structure of the spending of households with the highest income. Our finding is that these structural changes are reflecting a specific mode <b>of</b> spending <b>of</b> <b>private</b> house-holds during a rise of welfare. With that, on the aggregate level of groups of goods no em-pirical indication could be found for the often expressed development into a diversification and individualisation within the society. ...|$|R

Furthermore, it also tries to predict the possible future development in their size, number and structure in 2012 - 2031. Emphasis is placed on the comparison of Australian states and territories. The analysis in this thesis is primary based on censuses. In the first part there are outlines of theories of family and second the demographic transition. There is also focus on Australian indigenous people, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as the organization of family life and households differs from the European system. Attention is also paid to demographic development of Australia and its states and territories in 1991 - 2011, because it is an important precondition of the analysis of changes in the size and structure of families and households.

The disposal behaviour <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>households</b> concerning used textiles is greatly determined by the attitude they have developed over time towards the alternatives of disposal ways.

40|$|AbstractWith {{the advent}} of the Internet in <b>private</b> <b>households</b> and in almost every company in the last two decades, many things have changed. One of the major changes {{concerns}} the rapid growth of the e-commerce utilization, which brings changes to the transportation system – e. g., courier, express and parcel service providers (CEP) sector with it. Thus, the CEP sector is the most increasing and dominant logistics sector worldwide. Especially in agglomerations, a high growth potential is expected for the future. It is mostly driven by the demand <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>households</b> and retail in urban agglomerations. Considering the importance of CEP, the knowledge about CEP – from a transport modeller's view – is still scarce. There are several studies with focus on consumer's e-commerce behaviour or the supply side. However, – as far as the authors are aware of – there are no extensive studies examining both, transport demand and supply. This, however, is crucial for a better understanding and modelling of CEP actors. We present our first results and a theoretical and empirical based approach to characterise not only the supply side of CEP service providers, but also the demand side <b>of</b> <b>private</b> <b>households,</b> and businesses regarding e-commerce as a driver for the development of freight demand...|$|R
