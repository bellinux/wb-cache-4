25|$|There were {{variations}} on the infantry formation, depending on role. The light divisions (14th, 17th and 39th) as formed in 1942 had only two brigades and lacked much heavy equipment. Transport was provided by six mule and four Jeep companies. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> was later dropped. The Animal and Mechanised transport divisions (A & MT) (7th, 20th and 23rd and later the 5th) had a mixture of animal and vehicle transport, as the name suggests. In particular, one of the vehicle-drawn field artillery regiments {{was replaced by a}} mountain artillery regiment with twelve 3.7-inch howitzers, carried on mules. The anti-tank and light anti-aircraft regiments were replaced by a single regiment, with two batteries each of anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. The divisional reconnaissance unit was replaced by a lightly equipped infantry battalion. Another standard infantry battalion provided the HQ Defence unit.|$|E

In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the tension that}} exists in many large organizations between the need for <b>division</b> <b>of</b> work among architects and the requirement of developing an integrated set of architectural principles and models spanning {{all aspects of the}} organization. Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> work are presented that set different requirements on knowledge integration. Drawing from insights of the fields of IS research (business-IT alignment), organizational theory (knowledge-based theory of the firm) and sociology (boundary objects) we arrive at a conceptual model linking knowledge integration mechanisms to <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> <b>of</b> work. We test this conceptual model in three cases. The results show that the concepts of boundary objects and of interconnectedness are relevant in realizing the integration required...|$|R

500|$|From 1961 to 1963, the Army began reorganizing {{its force}} {{so that each}} {{division}} would have a similar structure, which would {{vary depending on the}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> it was. This move was called the Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD) plan. The plan eliminated regiments but reintroduced brigades to the Army's structure, allowing three brigades to a division. The reorganization also allowed for the use of [...] "separate" [...] brigades which had no division headquarters and could be used for missions that did not require an entire division. The 173rd Brigade was selected to become a separate brigade and a special airborne task force, which could deploy rapidly and act independently. It was then designed uniquely from other separate brigades. The 173rd was the only separate brigade to have support formations permanently assigned to it, though other separate brigades would receive support elements of their own a year later. The brigade was also the only separate brigade to receive its own tank company, in the form of Company D, 16th Armor. Consistent with regimental combat teams activated before them, these separate brigades were given their own shoulder sleeve insignia. The soldiers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade created a patch with a wing on it to symbolize their status as an airborne unit, along with red, white, and blue, the national colors of the United States. The SSI would be given to them in May 1963.|$|E

50|$|In modern times, most {{military}} forces have standardized their divisional structures. This {{does not mean}} that divisions are equal in size or structure from country to country, but divisions have, in most cases, come to comprise units of 10,000 to 20,000 troops with enough organic support to be capable of independent operations. Usually, the direct organization of the division consists of one to four brigades or battle groups of its primary combat arm, along with a brigade or regiment of combat support (usually artillery) and a number of direct-reporting battalions for necessary specialized support tasks, such as intelligence, logistics, reconnaissance, and combat engineers. Most militaries standardize ideal organization strength for each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>division,</b> encapsulated in a Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&E) which specifies exact assignments of units, personnel, and equipment for a division.|$|E

5000|$|The {{division}} of the Indo-European languages into satem and centum groups was put forward by Peter von Bradke in 1890, although a similar <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> had been proposed by Karl Brugmann in 1886. In the satem languages, which include the Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian branches, as well as (in most respects) Albanian and Armenian, the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European palatovelars remained distinct and were fricativized, while the labiovelars merged with the [...] "plain velars". In the centum languages, the palatovelars merged with the plain velars, while the labiovelars remained distinct. The results of these alternative developments are exemplified by the words for [...] "hundred" [...] in Avestan (satem) and Latin (centum) - the initial palatovelar developed into a fricative s in the former, but became an ordinary velar k in the latter.|$|E
50|$|As the IJA was an {{infantry}} {{force the}} most common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> was the infantry division. Later four tank and one parachute division were formed. The first 18 infantry divisions were originally formed as square divisions, and after 1938, most of the remainder were formed as triangular divisions with the security divisions being binary divisions. During the course of its existence the IJA organized three Guards Divisions and over 220 infantry divisions of various types (A/Reinforced, B/Standard, C/Counter-insurgency). On 7 December the IJA had two divisions serving in Japan/Korea and 50 serving abroad, most in China. During the war another 117 were raised for foreign service and 56 were raised for national defense. These totaled 223 including the Imperial Guard. Of this total no more than 35, that is one fifth of the IJA infantry division total, fought in the Pacific theatre.|$|E
