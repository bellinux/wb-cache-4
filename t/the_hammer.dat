50|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>hammers</b> {{are made}} of white lead, the {{instrument}} sheds small amounts of lead powder. Musicians who actively use this instrument have adopted the practice of coating <b>the</b> <b>hammers</b> in Epoxy glue, which {{does not affect the}} sound but stops the wearing away of <b>the</b> <b>hammers</b> (and prevents <b>the</b> poisoning of children, cats and other small creatures).|$|R

5|$|After {{the second}} lacuna, Hymir {{is sitting in}} the boat, unhappy and totally silent, as they row back to shore. On shore, Hymir {{suggests}} that Thor should help him carry a whale back to his farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and carries it all back to Hymir's farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir's head on Týr's mother's suggestion, Thor and Týr are given the cauldron. Týr cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll it, and so with it they leave. Some distance from Hymir's home, an army of many-headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two, but are killed by <b>the</b> <b>hammer</b> of Thor.

5|$|During the 1970s various {{internal}} {{changes and}} improvements {{were made to}} the mechanics. In 1969 <b>the</b> <b>hammer</b> tips were changed to neoprene rubber instead of felt, to avoid the excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports were changed from wood to aluminum. Although this made production cheaper, it changed the resonance of the instrument slightly. In 1977 the power amplifier design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model. The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models. A new 54-note model was added to the range.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the French {{team were}} {{scheduled}} to play a team from the United States, but the latter withdrew from the competition as three of their team were taking place in <b>the</b> <b>hammer</b> throw at the same time. The Scandinavians were accepted as late entrants by the organisers, and their team was composed primarily of athletes who were competing in other events, though it also included a journalist, Edgar Aabye, {{to make up the}} numbers. The mixed team won each of the first two pulls against the French in a best-of-three contest to win the gold medal. Due to a second, unofficial, match subsequently taking place between the United States and the Scandinavians, some records have erroneously listed the United States as gold medalists.|$|E
5|$|Pendants in a {{distinctive}} shape representing <b>the</b> <b>hammer</b> of Thor (known in Norse sources as Mjöllnir) have frequently been unearthed in Viking Age Scandinavian burials. The hammers {{may have been}} worn {{as a symbol of}} Norse pagan faith and of opposition to Christianization, a response to crosses worn by Christians. Casting moulds have been found for the production of both Thor's hammers and Christian crucifixes, and at least one example of a combined crucifix and hammer has been discovered. The Eyrarland Statue, a copper alloy figure found near Akureyri, Iceland dating from around the 11th century, may depict Thor seated and gripping his hammer.|$|E
5|$|Six {{teams from}} North America and six teams {{representing}} {{the rest of}} the World play a series of games against each other in order to win points. The first side to win a majority of the points available wins the cup. Teams compete in four formats: team games, mixed doubles games, singles competitions, and skins games. Team games are regular curling games, with two teams of four playing against each other. Mixed doubles games involve two teams, each consisting of one male and one female, playing against each other. Mixed doubles teams use only six stones per end, one of which is positioned {{prior to the start of}} the end. This is in contrast to the eight stones per end used by teams of four in regular curling games. The singles competition involves two teams playing against each other. There are six types of shots contested in the singles competitions. Each curler from each team is assigned to throw at least one type of shot. Points are given based on how well the shot is made. After all of the shots have been thrown, the team with the most points wins the competition. Skins games involve two teams playing against each other, where the objective is to win skins by scoring two or more points with <b>the</b> <b>hammer</b> or stealing points without <b>the</b> <b>hammer.</b> The points for the skins games, which go toward the total points for the cup, are distributed throughout the game, and the teams earn these points by winning skins.|$|E
