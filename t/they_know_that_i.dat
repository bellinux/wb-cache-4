2500|$|Just as Lancashire's tail {{had pushed}} {{on at the}} end of their innings, so did Somerset's on the third day. Blackwell made his second century in two innings, finally {{surrendering}} on 122. The second-highest scorer was Richard Johnson with 40. Blackwell explained, [...] "I've changed a few things this year and started to bat on off stump. A lot of bowlers have been going across me because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> go at widish balls. The ball's now closer to me if it's slanted across and I'm backing my hand-eye co-ordination to avoid being lbw." [...] The day itself was very cold, with Blackwell saying, [...] "It was absolutely perishing out there. I think play should be abandoned if it gets that cold." [...] After Somerset were dismissed for 272, six Somerset men came out to field sporting woollen hats. Bad light and rain meant the day ended at 2.07pm, with Lancashire on 33 for 1, 84 runs ahead. Whilst a Lancashire victory was not out of the question, the most likely result was the draw.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> live?" [...] asked Grisell, [...] "or"--unable {{to control}} a little laugh--"do they deem that I was slain {{in the shape of}} a hare?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In acting thus--in {{daring to}} act thus," [...] the King expounded, [...] "they proceed as if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can have but {{a short time}} to live." ...|$|R
60|$|With their single eyes in {{the centre}} of their heads and every eye turned upon their prey, they did not note my soundless approach, so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was upon them with my great long-sword and four of them lay dead ere <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was among them.|$|R
60|$|That's my {{stock in}} trade. You don't imagine people would read my poems if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was sober, industrious, and economical. As {{a matter of}} fact I lead the virtuous life of a clergyman's daughter, but not a {{reviewer}} would notice me if he knew it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed it will not. You may be {{sure that}} the Turks are even now searching for you, and as <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am here, and that you belong to my household--" ...|$|E
6000|$|He is with her, and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know Where they are, {{what they}} do: they believe my tears flow While they laugh, laugh at me, at me {{fled to the}} drear Empty church, to pray God in, for them!--I am here! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{play games}} exactly like real boys?' he asked very proudly. 'O Maimie, please tell them!' But when he {{revealed}} how he played, by sailing his hoop on the Round Pond, and so on, {{she was simply}} horrified.|$|E
6000|$|... "By my old enemies, Watson. By {{the charming}} society whose leader {{lies in the}} Reichenbach Fall. You must {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew,</b> and only <b>they</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was still alive. Sooner or later they believed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should come back to my rooms. They watched them continuously, and this morning they saw me arrive." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{were told}} that our big brother India is so rich and we are dying of poverty and hunger. My father sells dahi wada in a stall in Lahore {{and we did not}} even get enough food to eat from his earnings. <b>I</b> was promised <b>that</b> once <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was {{successful}} in my operation, they would give 150,000 rupees (around US$ 3,352), to my family," [...] said Kasab.|$|R
6000|$|... "That will be good," [...] Meinik said. [...] "I {{shall never}} {{go outside the}} English land, again. There will be plenty to do, and a great trade on the river; {{everyone}} will be happy and contented. I should be a fool {{to go back to}} Upper Burma; where they would chop off my head, if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been down to Rangoon when the English were there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{live among}} the Druses, you see,' said Fakredeen, shaking his head, and looking with his {{glittering}} eye a thousand meanings. 'The Druses love me. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{am one of}} themselves. They will only think that I have made the Maronites eat sand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{play games}} exactly like real boys?" [...] he asked very proudly. [...] "Oh, Maimie, please tell them!" [...] But when he {{revealed}} how he played, by sailing his hoop on the Round Pond, and so on, {{she was simply}} horrified.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} {{drew a deep}} breath, and looked across curiously to the bronzed face of the simple old officer. Then he asked, a little huskily, [...] "And why didn't my father's or mother's {{relations}} reclaim me, sir? Do <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am still living?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take {{that message}} back, and <b>they</b> will <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{received}} this, {{as well as}} if I wrote. Make {{the best of your}} way. Good night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was only}} a bluff. They wouldn't hurt me. They look upon me as a father. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{whatever}} <b>I</b> do is for their own good." ...|$|R
25|$|And I will execute great vengeance {{upon them}} with furious rebukes; and <b>they</b> shall <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{not as far}} as THIS HOUSE and {{the lands}} I {{actually}} OCCUPY AND CULTIVATE are concerned; and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am safe {{to fight to the}} last, and carry the case to the Supreme Court in that case, until the swindle is exposed, or they drop it; but I may have to pay them something to keep the squatters off my UNOCCUPIED land." ...|$|E
6000|$|Burnamy laughed. [...] "I don't {{believe they}} envy me. It won't be all roses for me--they know that. But <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{can take care}} of myself if it isn't." [...] He remembered {{something}} one of his friends in the office had said of the painful surprise the Bird of Prey would feel if he ever tried his beak on him in the belief that he was soft.|$|E
6000|$|... "It may do with me. There {{are reasons}} which bind me to him, {{which will not}} bind other men. Men don't {{talk to me about}} it, because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am bound to him through you. But I am aware of the feeling which exists. You can't be really loyal to a king if you never see him,--if he be always locked up in some almost divine recess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{would they}} think if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that,</b> if <b>I</b> {{chose to do}} it, I could buy every ship, and its cargo, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall meet between here and Gibraltar!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is another}} matter," [...] he answered. [...] "I am {{accustomed}} to sleeping very little; and besides, {{it is probable}} that this affair may become one which it will be necessary for you to follow up alone. The sight of me, or the mention of my name, is like poison to all the Waldenburgs. They would only be the more bitter and hard to deal with if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I,</b> too, had joined in the chase. I {{hope to be able to}} do my share secretly." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "And <b>they</b> shall <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am the Lord" [...] (KJV): This {{becomes a}} {{recurring}} theme for Ezekiel, revealing that [...] "the prophet identifies his words {{as a manifestation of}} the active presence of God." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No use. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{shall not}} be of age till January, besides the other matter. I assured them that however that might end, my uncles would honour any order I might give {{for the sake of}} rescuing her, but they laughed the idea to scorn. O'Leary had the impudence to intimate, however, that if I chose to accept the terms expressed, 'his wife might be amenable.'" ...|$|E
60|$|And a neat pretty cottage it was, with clipped yew hedges {{all round}} the garden, and yews inside too, cut into {{peacocks}} and trumpets and teapots {{and all kinds}} of queer shapes. And out of the open door came a noise like that of the frogs on the Great-A, when they know {{that it is going to}} be scorching hot to-morrow--and how <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't know, and you don't know, and nobody knows.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{they tell}} me. What {{should we have}} to talk about here if {{somebody}} didn't quarrel sometimes? She and I ought to get up a quarrel for the good of the public;--only <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never can quarrel with anybody. I never see anybody interesting enough to quarrel with." [...] But Mrs. MacHugh said nothing about Miss Stanbury, except that she sent over a message with reference to a rubber of whist for the next night but one.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to her 2014 return, Davidson was alerted {{that her}} storyline would include Susan Banks. [...] "They told me, but <b>they</b> also <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was up for}} it." [...] Lisa Williams {{returned}} as Davidson's double.|$|R
5000|$|Hennesy {{spoke about}} being {{approached}} {{to write the}} novel during an interview with Xfinity, [...] "About {{a year and a}} half ago Jill Farren Phelps approached me and said that all the higher up at ABC and the publishing house, Hyperion, and Disney and because of the Pandora series <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was already a published author. So they’re the ones who actually approached me, would I like to write a fictionalized account of all the characters in Port Charles from Spinelli’s point of view. I don’t think I actually have the imagination to pitch the idea to them. They came to me and it took off from there." ...|$|R
6000|$|Yes, rank has its {{responsibilities}} {{as well as}} its [...] privileges. <b>I</b> will remember <b>that.</b> It is necessary to do [...] so, as otherwise one would be without consolation for what [...] one has to suffer. For <b>I</b> find <b>that</b> one has to suffer, [...] Amelia. I know papa would have advised me to marry this [...] man; and so, I dare say, mamma would, and Frank, and [...] Beatrice, if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> liked him. It would not be [...] so bad if we all thought alike about it; {{but it is hard to}} [...] have the responsibilities all on one's own shoulder; is it [...] not? ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{interrupted}} quietly: [...] "Sorrow don't buy bread [...] . I {{never had}} nobody {{ask me about}} things before." [...] And, slowly moving his long face from side to side, he added: [...] "Besides, what could people do? They can't be expected to support you; and if they started askin' you questions they'd feel it very awkward. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> suspect. Of course, there's such a lot of us; the hansoms are pretty nigh as bad off as we are. Well, we're gettin' fewer every day, that's one thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have made}} the acquaintance," [...] he continued, [...] "of these two men, your late partners--sought them out and made it purposely. They are coming here to see me to-night. They fancy {{that it is just}} a {{friendly}} call. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have money to invest. I have even made use of them, employed them to buy for me bonds of my own choosing. They think it is an affair of a little business chat, perhaps, and a restaurant supper. Pull yourself together, Stanley! Go into that corner, behind the curtain. Wait your time!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] he went on. [...] "From {{any other}} point of view, {{some of the}} {{entertainments}} to which I have been bidden appear utterly without meaning. However, {{it is part of}} my programme to prove to the world that we Democrats can open our arms wide enough to include every class in life. Therefore, I go to many places I should otherwise avoid. I have studied the attitude of the younger women whom I have approached, purely impersonally and without the slightest hypersensitiveness. They have all been perfectly pleasant, perfectly disposed for conversation or any of the usual social amenities. But <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have in the background a wife. To flirt with a married man of fifty isn't worth while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whoever they be, Agatha," [...] {{said the}} old Marquis, [...] "give them a warm welcome if they come in the King's name. <b>They</b> will <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot rise to meet them, but make them welcome to {{everything}} in and about the château." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{would never}} assume an {{editorial}} position. What I would do very often is, if somebody was being dismembered, I would rather color it in yellow because it's garish, and also {{so you could}} see what was going on. Or red, for the blood element, but not to subdue the artwork. ... I mean, the main reason these people were buying these books was to see somebody'd head cut off, y'know? ... And editors trusted me with a lot a stuff. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't subdue artwork; I would just kind of shield it a little bit so if a parent picked up the book in the drug store, they wouldn't see that somebody's stomach was all red.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been almost the very day it happened," [...] she said, with a little shudder. [...] "He came down in the {{afternoon}} and he seemed a bit queer, as though he had something on his mind. He took out the envelope once or twice and looked at it. Once he said to me, 'Agnes,' he said, 'there are men in London who, if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> carried this with me, would kill me for it. I was frightened, and I begged him to leave it somewhere. I think {{he said that he had}} to have it always with him, because he couldn't think of a safe hiding-place for it. Just as he was going, though, he came back and took it out of his pocket once more." ...|$|R
