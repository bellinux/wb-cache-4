5|$|During a {{press conference}} on January 25, 1989, Metro Director Alan Gibbs {{confirmed}} that the granite had been quarried in South Africa and announced that an investigative report would be delivered to the Metro Council <b>Transit</b> <b>Committee</b> the following week. The announcement was met with calls from King County Councilman Ron Sims to fire the responsible Metro officials who knowingly allowed the purchase. Metro's ban on South African goods was stricter than the federal sanctions, which only prohibited importation of specific materials such as steel, coal, uranium and agricultural products, and was used by UMTA to threaten to pull its funding for the bus tunnel project.|$|E
5|$|The Metro <b>Transit</b> <b>Committee</b> {{debated the}} {{inclusion}} of the bus tunnel in the project's environmental impact assessment well into 1983, Seattle members opposing the tunnel in favor of a transit mall and suburban members supporting a bus tunnel that would be converted to a light rail system. On September 22, UMTA requested that a preferred alternative be declared by the end of November, which prompted the Metro Council to expedite its decision. Metro Council Executive Director Neil Peterson favored the tunnel alternative, while the Seattle City Council and Mayor Charles Royer preferred the transit mall, but stated that a tunnel would be a long-term solution to downtown congestion. The Seattle City Council reversed its decision on their preferred alternative, voting unanimously on October 17 in favor of an electric-only transit tunnel. Along with Mayor Royer, they were willing to compromise on Peterson's proposed dual-mode buses to serve suburban commuters where trolleybuses were not feasible. The Metro Council approved the downtown bus tunnel by a unanimous vote on November 3, 1983, estimating a cost of $300 million to build a five-station tunnel under 3rd Avenue and Pine Street to be completed in 1989 along with the conversion of 3rd Avenue into a landscaped transit mall.|$|E
25|$|Yeomans {{was named}} as {{vice-chair}} of the MUC public <b>transit</b> <b>committee</b> in December 1985. In late 1986, {{he argued that}} new revenues for transit should come from increased fees rather than a rise in taxation as proposed by newly elected Montreal mayor Jean Doré.|$|E
2500|$|A Montreal Gazette ran an {{editorial}} in early 1990 that was strongly critical of the public <b>transit</b> <b>committee's</b> direction under Yeomans's leadership, arguing that it had become [...] "preoccupied with secondary matters" [...] and was avoiding [...] "serious examination of crucial issues" [...] such as declining ridership.|$|R

Specific regional governance options for public transit in Greater Edmonton are evaluated through case studies of regional public transit delivery in Canada and these options are assessed using information acquired from interviews with members of key regional <b>transit</b> <b>committees.</b> The findings reveal that regional problems necessitate regional solutions and public transit is an inherently metropolitan and regional service requiring cooperation among municipalities and {{the involvement of the}} provincial government...|$|R

In September 1991, the Montreal Gazette reported that Yeomans's committee was planning to support a faster approval process and longer patent protection for new prescription drugs.|$|E
25|$|Yeomans was {{promoted}} to chair of the MUC's public <b>transit</b> <b>committee</b> in November 1986. Shortly thereafter, he called for the province to finish delayed renovations on the Dorion–Rigaud commuter line and expressed disappointment when the government instead allocated the money for a road link to Mirabel Airport. Yeomans later opposed the provincial government's plan to extend Highway 440 to the Trans-Canada Highway, arguing that it would create more urban sprawl and reduce investment in Montreal. He did, however, strongly support the province's plans to renovate Montreal's Deux-Montagnes Line.|$|E

2500|$|The {{proposed}} {{park has}} been criticized by transit advocates such as the Queens Public <b>Transit</b> <b>Committee,</b> who prefer to rebuild the rail line as a proposed expansion of the New York City Subway. More than 322,000 people live within one mile of the Rockaway Beach Branch, combined {{with the fact that}} New York City Subway service in the area is limited, with only the BMT Jamaica Line (...) passing through the neighborhood. Another argument is that the Queensway would pass through Forest Park, where there is already a large [...] park. There is also heavy opposition from residents, who fear that their privacy would be invaded and that their rents would be raised {{as a result of the}} Queensway. A new subway line, on the other hand, would connect the IND Queens Boulevard Line (...) at Queens Boulevard, with the [...] running south of Liberty Avenue.|$|E
