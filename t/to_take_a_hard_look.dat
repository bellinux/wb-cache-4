It may well be the defining outcome of this tragedy that the worst mistakes of the 1960s and 1970s are systematically torn down." ...|$|E

50|$|Her first novel, Bonheur d'occasion (1945), gave a starkly {{realistic}} {{portrait of}} the lives of people in Saint-Henri, a working-class neighbourhood of Montreal. The novel caused many Quebeckers <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>look</b> at themselves, and is regarded as the novel that helped lay the foundation for Quebec's Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. The original French version won her the prestigious Prix Femina in 1947. Published in English as The Tin Flute (1947), the book won the 1947 Governor General's Award for fiction as well as the Royal Society of Canada's Lorne Pierce Medal. Distributed in the United States, where it sold more than three-quarters of a million copies, the Literary Guild of America made The Tin Flute a feature book of the month in 1947. The book garnered so much attention that Roy returned to Manitoba to escape the publicity.|$|E

5000|$|At the time, {{the title}} and simple {{emotional}} appeal of [...] "We Gotta Get out of This Place" [...] lent itself to some obvious self-identifications—for instance, {{it was a very}} popular number to be played at high school senior proms and graduation parties. In music writer Dave Marsh's view, it was one of a wave of songs in 1965, by artists such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan, that ushered in a new role for rock music as a vehicle for common perception and as a force for social consciousness. [...] Writer Craig Werner sees the song as reflecting the desire of people <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>look</b> at their own lives and the community they come from.

The world flavor is highly described and guidelines for adventures and play are given. For those of you who have been waiting to play in this world, now you can. However, this addresses one other problem with this worldbook; you need TWO other Steve Jackson Games products to play it, GURPS Basic and Supers. This is going to cause some players <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>look</b> at Wild Cards; do they want to buy a GURPS worldbook to play a GURPS worldbook? If they want to play Wild Cards, then the answer is a resounding yes!

50|$|In practice, the {{appointment}} of Erich Koch to administer the Reichskommissariat Ukraine substantially undermined Rosenberg's authority. Hitler ordered Koch <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> and brutal approach; Rosenberg wished to portray the Germans as liberators of Ukraine from Soviet domination, but Koch's brutality helped to push potential Ukrainian allies back to the Soviet camp. Furthermore, Rosenberg's ministry was denied authority over army and other security formations within the occupied territories. The other Reich Commissar, Hinrich Lohse (Ostland) was widely disregarded. The SS filled the resulting power vacuum, acting as they wished.|$|R

50|$|By 1980 it was {{becoming}} clear that the National Parks Board need <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>look</b> at the racial discrimination against visitors from different race groups.Not only was there a steadily growing demand from other race groups (especially black and Indian) to visit the Kruger Park (bed occupancy increased from 6,783 in 1976 to 7,371 in 1980 and entrance fees paid increased from 14,733 entrants to 18,967 for the same period); it also attracted mixed race groups from the neighbouring self-governing homelands and independent states such as Swaziland who demanded internationally accepted standards of courtesy. Also, embarrassing situations started happening almost daily during peak periods when visitors had to be denied the 'white' facilities in the park. Increasingly visitors also reserved accommodation under assumed names (or had Afrikaans or English surnames) and insisted on the accommodation they reserved on arrival, leading to yet more difficult situations. Although not allowed {{to go as far}} as complete desegregation, the Board decided in June 1981 to open the restaurants to all races and to create more, and equal, facilities for the other race groups. It was only {{by the end of the}} 1980s that the segregation of visitor facilities was completely abandoned.|$|E
