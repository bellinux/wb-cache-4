25|$|Modell {{announced}} on November 6, 1995, {{that he had}} signed a deal to relocate the Browns to Baltimore in —a move which would return the NFL to Baltimore {{for the first time}} since the Colts relocated to Indianapolis after the 1983 season. The very next day, on November 7, 1995, Cleveland voters overwhelmingly approved an issue that had been placed on the ballot at Modell's request, before he made his decision to move the franchise, which provided $175million in <b>tax</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> refurbish the outmoded and declining Cleveland Municipal Stadium. Taxpayers ultimately paid close to $300million to demolish the old stadium and construct a new stadium for the Browns on the site of Municipal Stadium.|$|E

25|$|The National Energy Program had {{a number}} of other flaws. It was based on a world price {{steadily}} increasing to $100 per barrel. The world oil price declined to as little as $10 per barrel in the years following. Since the federal government based its spending on the larger figure, the result was that it {{spent a great deal of}} money on subsidies that could not be recovered in taxes on production. Furthermore, due to proximity to the U.S. market companies had opportunities to make money by playing differentials in prices. For instance, refiners in Eastern Canada would import oil subsidized down to half the world price, refine it into products, and export the products to the U.S. at full world price. Airlines flying between Europe and the U.S. via the polar route would take off with as little fuel as possible, and stop briefly in Canada to fill up before continuing on to their destination. Trucking companies operating between locations in the Northern U.S. would detour their trucks through Canada to refuel. None of these transactions was illegal, or even unusual considering the integrated nature of the economies, but all had the effect of transferring billions of Canadian <b>tax</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> the balance sheets of (mostly foreign owned) companies. A third flaw was that the NEP assumed that future oil discoveries would be made in areas under federal jurisdiction, such as the Arctic and offshore. As it turned out, most of the major oil discoveries in Canada had already been made, and the subsidies given by the federal government to companies exploring in federal jurisdiction were not productive. All of these flaws resulted in large, and unexpected, increases in the federal budget deficit.|$|E

However, these plans were shelved in May 2016, possibly because it became known that Orlando City SC, the closest Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise, has territorial rights for the Tampa/St. Petersburg market, clouding the prospects for potentially bringing the Rowdies to MLS and delaying {{the need for a}} larger venue.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lack of a}} large indoor {{sports center}} {{inhibited}} the growth of professional sports in the city, {{as well as the}} city's ability to host major high school athletic tournaments. In 1975, the city of Billings constructed the Montana's Entertainment, Trade and Recreation Arena (or METRA), a 12,000 seat multi-purpose arena. [...] In 1977, an organization known as Leadership Great Falls (a program of the Great Falls Area Chamber of Commerce) undertook a process to provide city civic and business leaders with a vision for the city of Great Falls. [...] Out of this year-long process came the request for the city to construct a large, multi-purpose, indoor sports arena. Great Falls City Commissioner John St. Jermain championed the effort to build an arena, and fought for a ballot initiative in 1977 that would have used city <b>tax</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> build it. But voters rejected the proposal. St. Jermain then sought and won in 1978 a federal grant to pay {{for the majority of the}} cost of constructing the facility. St. Jermain lost reelection in November 1978.|$|E
