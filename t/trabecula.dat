40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively {{assess the}} effect of {{including}} or excluding endocardial <b>trabeculae</b> in left ventricular (LV) measurements and the reproducibility of these measurements at cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with true fast imaging with steady-state precession (FISP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study {{was approved by the}} local ethics committee, and each subject gave informed consent before participating. Twenty healthy subjects and 20 consecutive patients underwent 1. 5 -T cardiovascular MR imaging. Seven to 12 short-axis views encompassing the entire LV were acquired by using true FISP. Endocardial and epicardial contours were traced manually. The data sets in each patient were analyzed twice: with inclusion of endocardial <b>trabeculae</b> in the LV cavity volume and with exclusion of endocardial <b>trabeculae</b> from the cavity volume. On the basis of these two contour sets, the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) LV volumes, ejection fraction (EF), and LV mass were calculated. Additionally, interobserver and interexamination reproducibility was assessed by using Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Compared with exclusion of <b>trabeculae,</b> inclusion of <b>trabeculae</b> in the LV cavity volume resulted in significantly larger ED and ES LV volumes (mean differences, 21 mL ± 11 [standard deviation] and 19 mL ± 33, respectively; P <. 001) and lower EFs (mean difference, - 2 % ± 2; P <. 001). The calculated LV mass was significantly smaller with inclusion than with exclusion of <b>trabeculae</b> (mean difference, - 21 g ± 12; P <. 001). All interobserver and interexamination limits of agreement based on inclusion of <b>trabeculae,</b> except those for EF measurements, were superior to those based on exclusion of <b>trabeculae.</b> At measurement reproducibility comparisons, differences in interobserver ED LV volume, and LV mass and interexamination LV mass were statistically significant, favoring the inclusion of <b>trabeculae</b> in the LV cavity volume. CONCLUSION: <b>Trabeculae</b> significantly affect quantifications of LV volume and mass. The superior reproducibility of LV measurements with the inclusion of endocardial <b>trabeculae</b> in the cavity volume favors this tracing algorithm for clinical use. © RSNA, 2005...|$|R
40|$|Iloprost, {{a stable}} {{derivate}} of prostacyclin (epoprostenol), {{is known to}} diminish PVR. In addition, improvement of right ventricular function has been observed after inhaled administration. Direct inotropic actions are not studied until now. In the present experimental study the dose-dependent contractile response of human atrial and rabbit atrial and ventricular <b>trabeculae</b> to iloprost and epoprostenol was investigated. In the first series of tests the dose-dependent contractile response to stepwise increased iloprost concentrations was investigated. Developed force was continuously registered at a pacing frequency of 1 Hz at 37 °C. Iloprost concentration was stepwise increased from 10 - 11 to 10 - 7 M. In the second series of tests the dose-dependent contractile response to stepwise increased epoprostenol was investigated. At first concentrations between 10 - 9 and 10 - 6 M were studied. Because of the rapid spontaneous decay of prostacyclin in solutions the positive inotropic effect was significant but short lasting. A dose-response- curve could not be acquired. Therefore in a third series of tests the contractile response to 10 - 6 M epoprostenol was investigated during 15 min after addition. Baseline values were 7, 42 +/- 2, 1 mN/mm 2 for human atrial <b>trabeculae</b> and 13, 23 +/- 2, 1 mN/mm 2 for rabbit <b>trabeculae.</b> Iloprost exerted a positive inotropic effect in 11 of 18 human <b>trabeculae</b> (“responders”). In 7 <b>trabeculae</b> no change in contractility was observed, despite a positive effect of recalcification. At higher concentrations aftercontractions were seen in 29 % of all human <b>trabeculae.</b> In 9 of 17 rabbit ventricular <b>trabeculae</b> iloprost increased developed (“responders”), in 8 <b>trabeculae</b> no positive effect was achieved. Aftercontraction were not seen in rabbit <b>trabeculae.</b> Epoprostenol exerted a significant short lasting positive inotropic effect in each investigated muscle. Our data suggest that iloprost exerts direct positive inotropic effects in a subset of human atrial and rabbit right ventricular <b>trabeculae.</b> However, species-independent, a relevant number of <b>trabeculae</b> {{did not respond to}} iloprost. Further investigations concerning the underlying mechanism of iloprost induced positive inotropism are necessary...|$|R

40|$|Anterior part of {{the skull}} is in embryos {{composed}} of two rod-like cartilages called <b>trabeculae</b> cranii. The final shape of the skull of jawed vertebrates {{is affected by the}} manner of composition of <b>trabeculae.</b> There are two types of arrangement of vertebrate skull: the platybasic, which is probably the original one, and the tropibasic, which has developed independently in birds, bony fishes and mammals. Jawless vertebrates (lampreys and hagfishes) also have cartilaginous elements called <b>trabeculae,</b> but there are doubts about homology of these structures between groups of jawed and jawless vertebrates. The <b>trabeculae</b> initially became interesting elements because of their possible position in premandibular segment as a former premandibular branchial arch.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{propofol}} on myocardial contractility were studied in rat, {{in which the}} contractile activation mainly depends on calcium derived from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and guinea-pig, in which transsarcolemmal influx of calcium plays a major role. Intact and chemically skinned <b>trabeculae</b> from the right ventricle were studied. Intact <b>trabeculae</b> were electrically stimulated and force development during steady state and post rest contractions was measured. In saponin skinned <b>trabeculae</b> Ca 2 + uptake and release by the SR was studied. In Triton skinned <b>trabeculae</b> the influence of propofol on calcium sensitivity of the myofilaments was studied. In intact rat <b>trabeculae</b> propofol in concentrations of 28, 112 and 280 [*]μM did not change peak force development nor the pattern of post rest contraction. In guinea-pig <b>trabeculae</b> propofol significantly reduced peak force to respectively 64, 40 and 23 % of control values and the post rest contractions were potentiated. In skinned <b>trabeculae</b> propofol did not affect Ca 2 + handling by the SR, nor did it change force production and Ca 2 + sensitivity of the myofilaments. This study shows that, in contrast to rat, in guinea-pig propofol directly depresses myocardial contractility, probably by decreasing transsarcolemmal Ca 2 + influx. There is no significant influence of propofol on Ca 2 + handling by the SR, nor on the contractile proteins...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{quantify}} {{changes to}} the trabecular structure in the femoral heads of patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA). MethodsPatients with OA (n= 14; F= 7), mean (standard deviation age) 50. 6 (10. 1) years, had macroradiographs at approximately × 4 magnification at baseline and 18 months later using a standardized protocol. Following digitization, computerized measurement was obtained of minimum hip joint space width and fractal signature analysis (FSA) measured longitudinal changes separately in the principal compressive (vertical) and horizontal <b>trabeculae</b> at the region of interest within {{the centre of the}} head. ResultsThe patient group had mean annual rate of joint space narrowing of 0. 14 ± 0. 36 mm/yr. FSA detected no significant changes in horizontal <b>trabeculae,</b> whereas the larger principal compressive (vertical) <b>trabeculae</b> (0. 96 mm to 1. 02 mm) increased significantly in thickness and the fine to medium <b>trabeculae</b> (0. 18 mm to 0. 54 mm) decreased significantly in number. ConclusionThe increased thickness of the larger <b>trabeculae</b> within the compressive structural element of the femoral head is a response to the increase in stress associated with an overall loss of <b>trabeculae</b> in this region, suggesting the presence of an osteoporosis within the femoral head in OA patients...|$|R
