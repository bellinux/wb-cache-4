5|$|The <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> {{were either}} ignored or {{extended}} by multiple decrees, meaning that all notes {{of these issues}} remained legal tender in practice until 21 August 2006.|$|E
5|$|Jeppesen {{made the}} {{simplest}} modification to the U.S. Navy tables by drawing {{a new line}} to reduce no-stop limits on an otherwise unchanged table. Divers were recommended to remain within the modified no-stop limit. If {{one of the new}} <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> was not listed on the U.S. Navy table, the next shorter table entry was to be selected.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.3a was {{released}} on November 10, 2006, and had Cable and Sink modifications for type C, source termination recommendations, and removed undershoot and maximum rise/fall <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> It also changed CEC capacitance limits, and CEC commands for timer control were brought back in an altered form, with audio control commands added. It also added the optional ability to stream SACD in its bitstream DST format rather than uncompressed raw DSD.|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} study, we {{assessed}} whether undergraduate electronic gaming machine (EGM) gamblers {{would be more}} apt to set a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> and spend less time gambling when asked to consider setting an explicit <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> prior to their gambling session. To this end, participants (N ¼ 43) {{were randomly assigned to}} a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition or control condition, both of which involved gambling on an EGM in a virtual reality (VR) casino. In the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition, participants were asked (via pop-up message) to consider setting a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on play and entering that limit in an available text box prior to commencing play. In the no <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition, participants engaged in play immediately upon accessing the EGM in the VR casino (i. e. they were not exposed to a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up message). As predicted, participants who were explicitly asked to consider setting a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on their EGM play were signiﬁcantly more likely to do so and spent less time gambling than those who were not given such instructions. The results provide preliminary support for the contention that setting a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on EGM play is an effective responsible gambling strategy...|$|R
50|$|In the Practice mode, {{there is}} no <b>time</b> <b>limit,</b> however only a select number of levels are open (the Train Station, Forest and Caves). The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for the other levels varies; On easy, the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> is ten minutes, on medium, the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> is seven minutes, and on hard, five minutes. Each time {{the game is played}} Waldo is moved to a new {{location}} in the scene.|$|R
50|$|Neo Contra also {{marks the}} return of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> from some {{versions}} of the original Contra games, with the last third of the sixth stage grants the players <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> to complete the mission. Unlike the timed missions in the original Contra where the player loses one life once <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> drops to zero, the entire game is over once the player is unable to complete {{the last part of the}} sixth stage within <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|R
5|$|Metroid Prime Hunters {{features}} a multiplayer mode that supports {{up to four}} players and includes voice chat capability. In it, the player is able to control Samus or one of six other bounty hunters featured in the single-player mode. Each bounty hunter has a unique alternative form, such as Samus's Morph Ball, and a special weapon. The game host can set options for point and <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> and restrict the use of radar. Computer-controlled players of varying skill levels {{can be added to}} games if the minimum of four players is not met.|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of {{gameplay}} in Murder on the Orient Express has the player questioning characters and listening to lengthy periods of dialogue in order to acquire clues which {{may lead to the}} murderer. Other tasks the player must complete include collecting passports and other paraphernalia left by the passengers in an effort to acquire clues to lead to the solution of the murder, and retrieving certain objects for various characters. Combining items in the inventory forms {{a major part of the}} puzzles in the game. There are no puzzles with <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> in the game, although some puzzles require correct timing. There are also several single screen puzzles, such as a safe-cracking puzzle.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, Players can {{customize}} the protagonist's gender, body type, hairstyle, and outfit using the character creator. Players may also alter the look of their customized character at any point during the game by approaching a vendor named Callista. After creating their characters, players proceed to the game's open world, which is free for players to explore at any time. A fast travel system is provided allowing players to reach different locations and to navigate the world quickly. The game features a main campaign with story elements and side-missions, which are triggered automatically when players enter certain locations in the city. These quests mainly involve players delivering objects to other non-playable characters and collecting items from the world. Some of these quests have <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|E
50|$|Secondly, such {{definition}} requires {{workers to}} knowingly engage in expedience. If {{the rules are}} not known or well understood, or are accidentally broken, this behavior doesn’t qualify as expedience. For example, if a long haul driver drove over the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> because he doesn’t know about the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> rule, misunderstood the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> rule, or forgot {{to look at the}} watch and accidentally broke the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> rule, such behavior does not qualify as expedience.|$|R
5000|$|There is a <b>time</b> <b>limit,</b> usually of two minutes; if {{the task}} is not {{completed}} within the <b>time</b> <b>limit,</b> the team is disqualified.|$|R
5000|$|... 1980: unranked, {{arrival at}} {{destination}} outside <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> - 72 of 90 participants reached the destination in time (furthermore 2 boats outside <b>time</b> <b>limit)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Further {{denominations}} {{ranging from}} $5000 to $500 million were issued {{in the period}} between August 2006 and May 2008 as cent cheques quickly became outmoded. In {{the second quarter of}} 2008, special Agro cheques (Agricultural Cheques) were issued in denominations ranging from $5 billion to $100 billion as the currency exchange rate was floated. Since the functions were similar to Bearer cheques, it was in regular use as prices continue to rise. These cheques also carried <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> and limited security features. In the final months of the second dollar, the $200000 cheque was the lowest legal tender denomination by decree, despite having its expiry date extended twice. The $100000000 Bearer Cheque would have been the lowest legal tender denomination in circulation had the expiry dates of currency cheques been enforced without extension, with the $100 billion Agro Cheque being the highest whether or not the $200000 note was legal tender.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by President Clinton on August 22, 1996.|$|E
5000|$|Each sub-game has a <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> In some sub-games it is {{possible}} to [...] "die", thus ending the sub-game prematurely, while others only end after the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> expires.|$|R
5000|$|The set <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> is {{ten minutes}} with a thirty-second {{period in which}} a student may go {{overtime}} with no penalty, colloquially {{referred to as a}} 'grace period.'According to National Speech and Debate Association rules, a student who exceeds the ten minute and thirty second <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> cannot be awarded the rank of 1st in the round. There is no minimum <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{the show}} was on Fox Sports Net, all matches had a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> (10 minutes for normal singles matches and 30 minutes for title matches) and the station's Fox Box was used. In {{the event of a}} <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> draw, the winner was {{determined}} by the NWA Championship Committee, a group consisting of three veteran stars. Since leaving the channel, GFW discarded the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> concept.|$|R
5|$|Super Mario 64 DS is a 3D {{platformer}} {{in which}} the player controls four different characters through numerous levels to collect 150 Power Stars, 30 more than the original game. Each level is an enclosed world {{in which the}} player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> The worlds are inhabited with enemies that attack the characters as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask for help. The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As the player collects stars, more areas of the castle become accessible.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff had}} {{problems}} composing an opening {{theme for the}} series until someone provided some music by Ling Tosite Sigure, who was engaged to compose the opening theme. Egoist, who composed the ending theme, had debuted on Noitamina with Guilty Crown. Shiotani said they asked Egoist to record three versions of the ending theme so they could alternate them to match the episode's ending. Across the series, <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> resulted in the ending songs being removed or replaced with instrumental versions to avoid cutting scenes from the episode. When there were concerns from the producers of the songs, Tomohiro and Shiotani discussed this with them.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{distinct}} protocols for awarding the Medal of Honor. The {{first and most}} common is nomination and approval through {{the chain of command}} of the service member. The second method is nomination {{by a member of the}} U.S. Congress, generally at the request of a constituent. In both cases, if the proposal is outside the <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> for the recommendation, approval to waive the time limit requires a special Act of Congress. The Medal of Honor is presented by the President on behalf of, and in the name of, the Congress. Since 1980, nearly all Medal of Honor recipients--or in the case of posthumous awards, the next of kin--have been personally decorated by the Commander-in-Chief. Since 1941, more than half of the Medals of Honor have been awarded posthumously.|$|E
5000|$|Horror Mode - Each round, {{some players}} are {{selected}} as zombies. Zombies must kill all the humans while humans {{try to stay}} alive until the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> is up. Humans that get killed before the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> will turn into a zombie. Zombies win the round if no humans are left alive and humans win the round when at least one survives by the <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for {{the stage}} was 12h 35' [...] and 35 riders were within the time. The last rider in was N Coates who walked the last 5 miles so he could finish, albeit 4 hours after Opperman, 1 hour 40 minutes outside the <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> It appears the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> was not {{enforced}} however as all 52 finishers were reported as starting stage 2.|$|R
5000|$|... 4 - <b>Time</b> <b>limit</b> reached before 1,000 km {{distance}} was completed (six {{hours for the}} Le Mans Series and Blancpain Endurance Series races, the 2010 Oldtimers Festival race had a seven-hour <b>time</b> <b>limit).</b>|$|R
5|$|In each level, {{the player}} must {{complete}} certain objectives and then exit the stage. The requirements are varied, with many levels requiring the recovery {{and use of}} numerous high-tech gadgets. If Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player must start the level again. Three distinct difficulty settings are available for each level, the choice of which will affect aspects such {{as the number of}} objectives that must be completed, enemy accuracy and damage, the effectiveness of the game's optional aiming assistance, and the availability of ammunition and protective shields. If all the levels are completed on the highest difficulty, an additional setting becomes available, allowing players to customise various aspects of enemies, such as their health, their aiming accuracy and the damage they inflict. In addition to the main campaign, there are four bonus missions, with three enabling the player to control other characters with unique special abilities. Players can also unlock cheats by completing the levels within certain <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1827, {{the canal}} company {{announced}} that they were taking over the River Tone Navigation, {{under the terms of}} their acts of parliament of 1811 and 1824. This they did in November, when William Goodland, the river superintendent, was evicted from his cottage, the tolls were raised again, and maintenance ceased. This action was ruled to be illegal by the Court of King's Bench, as the canal company had not complied with the <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> enshrined in the act, but the canal company held on to the river despite the order to give it back to the conservators. Both sides took their case to the High Court, which ruled that the Conservators should have the river in February 1830. A further series of legal actions followed, after which the canal company attempted to obtain a new act of parliament to obtain the Tone by compulsory purchase. The Conservators then decided to negotiate, and an act of parliament passed in July 1832 authorised the takeover.|$|E
5|$|Human Revolution {{was planned}} for {{consoles}} and Microsoft Windows systems, {{and one of}} the things Dugas insisted upon was that the PC version would not be a port of the console versions. With this in mind, the two versions needed to be as close as possible in gameplay feel. The full motion cutscenes were created collaboratively by Eidos Montréal, Square Enix's CGI department Visual Works, and Vancouver-based company Goldtooth Creative. Goldtooth created initial concepts based on the game, then the animation proper was handled by Visual Works. It was later stated that, despite knowing the necessity of incorporating multiple story-telling methods into the game, the team felt that the cutscene creation process was turned into a multi-studio effort due to time constraints. <b>Time</b> <b>limits</b> also forced them to drop real-time cutscenes. For the engine, the team used the Crystal Engine, developed by Crystal Dynamics and previously used in Tomb Raider Legend. It was intended to be part of a technology sharing policy that would further improve the engine for distribution in an enhanced form. Despite the initial intentions and an early tech demo going smoothly, the engine quickly proved to be inadequate to the team's needs as Eidos Montréal and Crystal Dynamics were pulling the engine's design in different directions. Eidos Montréal were given permission to branch away from the core engine so they could make the game work, adding new production tools that made it work in the new environment.|$|E
5000|$|Fights have {{a five-minute}} <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> and are won via pinfall, surrender, or referee stoppage. If a fight {{ends at the}} <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> with no winner, a winner is {{declared}} by a three-judge committee.|$|R
50|$|Many recent {{multiplayer}} {{video games}} (such as Halo 4 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3) involve {{some form of}} a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on its online servers. Usually, each game is given a ten- to twenty-minute <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> For many games, a certain score by one team will end the game, but otherwise, whichever team holds the lead at the expiration of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> is declared the winner.|$|R
50|$|The {{title is}} often defended in matches with a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> of {{ten or fifteen}} minutes. More often than with other {{champion}}ships, title matches result in <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> draws and the champion retaining the belt.|$|R
5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{in which}} the player uses a rifle-shaped light gun to fire at targets on the screen. One duck at a time flies across the screen, with each duck {{appearing}} {{in a different place}} {{on the sides of the}} screen and flying in different paths. The player is allowed three shots to hit the duck as it flies across the screen. As with other light gun games, a hit is registered if the gun is pointed at the duck or similar light source when the trigger is pulled; no projectile is fired. When a shot is fired, a mark appears on the screen where the player was aiming; if the shot misses the duck, it changes direction away from the bullet. If the player hits a duck, it falls to the ground, and a hunting dog runs over and collects it. Each duck hit adds a small image of a duck to a row at the top of the screen. An screen overlay shows an image of marsh reeds and a tree branch. The gun is attached to the game cabinet by a metal cord, and is holstered in a small circular recess in the cabinet when not in use. Attempting to remove the gun sounds an alarm buzzer. Each game costs a quarter, and runs until the time limit runs out. Machines have adjustable <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> or can be set to run each game indefinitely, starting the score count over when the start button is pressed.|$|E

50|$|An Iron Man Match is a multiple-fall {{match with}} a set <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> The match is won by the wrestler who wins the most falls within the said <b>time</b> <b>limit,</b> by either pinfall, submission, disqualification, or countout.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> is {{a phrase}} in video game {{terminology}} {{that is used}} to make gameplay faster on the threat of losing a life. A typical <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> can range from a single second to multiple minutes.|$|R
