500|$|In August 1991 he {{returned}} to England with a £100,000 move to Port Vale; {{he was one of}} three new arrivals, along with Peter Swan (who took him in as a lodger) and Martin Foyle. He scored a brace against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux on 3 September, but tore his hamstring later in the month. He finished 1991–92 with five goals in 24 games, and went on to help the [...] "Valiants" [...] to win the TNT Tournament in the summer. The club finished bottom of the Second Division, though the introduction of the Premier League meant that they were demoted to the Third Division, which was immediately re-branded as the Second Division. He scored six goals in 28 league games in 1992–93, and did not feature in the League Trophy final or the play-off final. He fell out with manager John Rudge and the two stopped speaking to each other, and Houchen later admitted that [...] "I should have knocked on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'This is stupid'".|$|E
2500|$|... "Woodward {{just showed}} up at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{he was in the}} area," [...] Joan Felt was quoted as saying in Kessler's book, which was {{published}} in 2002. [...] "He came in a white limousine, which parked at a schoolyard about ten blocks away. He walked to the house. He asked if it was okay to have a martini with my father at lunch, and I said it would be fine." ...|$|E
2500|$|A similar fate would befall half of St. Philip's families, and {{the church}} was so despised locally for its Tory {{associations}} that legend has it a mob came together to burn it down {{at one point during}} the later years. They were supposedly dissuaded from doing so by George Washington himself, who stood at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "That, sir, is my church!" [...] In gratitude the stained glass window in the church's vestibule depicts him.|$|E
6000|$|The rest of {{the party}} stopped {{at the other end}} of the gallery, to allow the few files of {{soldiers}} who were led by the orderly to pass them, when they all moved towards the prison in a body. The sentinel was relieved in due military style; when Dillon placed his hand on one of <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> with a malicious sneer: ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{a minute}} or two John returned, {{followed}} by a gentleman. The latter paused at <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>said,</b> bowing courteously, as he advanced, to Mrs. Dowsett,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|When I joined Euphemia in her room, she met me with {{a mysterious}} {{expression}} on her face. She shut <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>said</b> in a very earnest tone: ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{elevators}} in {{that particular}} building were operated by young girls, and I made special arrangements with one in advance. She agreed to cooperate and {{thought it would be}} fun. I went with the gentleman to the elevator. He wasn't afraid of walking into an elevator, but when it started to move it became an unbearable experience. So I chose an unbusy time and I had him walk {{in and out of the}} elevator, back in and out. Then at a point when we walked in, I told the girl to close <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Let's go up." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 1972, after Curtiss and Genie had accidentally {{been locked}} out of the Riglers' home, Curtiss said to Genie, [...] "Tell them [...] what happened" [...] and Genie pointed to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Tell door lock"; this {{indicated}} her language included recursion, which they considered an especially important development. The scientists interpreted another utterance from 1973, [...] "Ask David see swing", as both further confirmation she had grasped recursion and the first complex sentence she produced. By this time she understood and used intensifiers such as the word very, but only tenuously grasped superlatives. She never used them in her own speech but appeared to understand them, and while she was generally better with the suffix -est than with the word most Curtiss thought Genie might not have known the actual meaning of -est. The contrast between her understanding and lack of production of superlatives furthered the researchers' belief that, {{even in the absence}} of language, her cognition had developed in some form.|$|E

6000|$|Having been {{supplied}} with these properties, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> farewell to Logan, Merton stole downstairs, walked round the house, entered the kitchen by <b>the</b> back <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to Mrs. Bower, 'Grannie, I maun be ganging.' ...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the police}} report, Crowley arrived at the scene, went up to <b>the</b> front <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> asked Gates to step outside. Crowley {{explained}} he was investigating the report of a break-in in progress; as he did so, Gates opened <b>the</b> front <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Why, because I'm {{a black man in}} America?" ...|$|R
60|$|March {{told his}} wife of the idyllic mood {{in which he had}} left Fulkerson at <b>the</b> widow's <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> she <b>said</b> he must be in love.|$|R
6000|$|Joey {{was heard}} {{coming up the}} stairs. Picotee opened <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> with an anxiety transcending Ethelberta's, 'Well?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Cyril {{remained}} outside while Dr. Hodges {{went into}} {{three or four}} houses. Presently he came down to <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to him,-- ...|$|E
60|$|The going was quiet. Not much laughing. Howard {{stood at}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{good night to}} them all, his heart very tender.|$|E
6000|$|Two hours passed. At length a low tap {{followed}} by two others was heard at <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> slave at once opened it. Carpadon entered, and with a sudden movement threw one arm round the slave's neck {{and with the other}} stabbed him to the heart. Then he opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> wide, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> in a low tone: ...|$|R
5000|$|Originally, [...] "Oh, My Lover", {{one of the}} {{two other}} songs, was {{considered}} the potential hit but the completed track for [...] "He's So Fine" [...] with its now-classic 'Doo-lang doo-lang doo-lang' background vocal - the suggestion of the session's sound engineer Johnny Cue - seemed an obvious smash, although Capitol Records for whom the Tokens were house producers rejected the track: Jay Siegal of the Tokens would recall Capitol president Voyle Gilmore dismissing the track as [...] "too trite...too simple". The Tokens shopped [...] "He's So Fine" [...] to ten labels before placing it with Laurie Records. Siegal; [...] "We played it ,<b>and</b> they locked <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'You're not getting out of here. We want that record.' [...] [...] [...] Of course, we'd already been turned down by ten companies. Give us eighty cents and we'd have given you the record." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the moment}} when the {{aspiration}} crossed his mind, it was suddenly answered by a low knock at <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> a voice <b>said</b> softly in the passage outside, [...] "Let me come in." ...|$|R
6000|$|While Caleb stood {{watching}} Raymond, {{as he walked}} off with long strides towards the mountain, his grandmother came to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> ...|$|E

60|$|Val laughed triumphantly, {{and called}} her sister Mrs. Curiosity, {{and at that moment}} Aunt Jane knocked at <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> Val was not to talk.|$|E
6000|$|The turnkey {{stopped at}} a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung <b>the</b> <b>door</b> slowly open, <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> as they all bent their heads and passed in: ...|$|R
5000|$|As Chamberlain rose {{to leave}} he paused at <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> turning <b>said</b> with much deliberation, [...] "You young gentlemen have entertained me royally, {{and in return}} I {{will give you a}} priceless secret.

6000|$|They got {{themselves}} out of <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> manager <b>said</b> to the bar-keeper, who came round to gather up the fragments of the broken tumbler, [...] "Think his wife {{will be glad to}} see 'em, Charley?" ...|$|R
6000|$|A woman opened <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to Mrs. Staveley: [...] "Dinner, ma'am." [...] That stopped this nasty {{exhibition}} of our tempers. We {{had a very}} good dinner.|$|E

6000|$|Charlotte {{worked on}} in much grief and perplexity for some minutes, {{revolving}} the vanity {{that had led}} to her follies, and humbling herself in her own eyes. Suddenly, a flash of thought crossed her, and woke a smile upon her face, almost a look of mischief. She tied on a clean apron, and running upstairs, opened <b>the</b> drawing-room <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'If you please, ma'am, might I ask Miss Faithfull's Martha to tea on Tuesday night?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Finally, one of {{the sailors}} stuck his head in <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> quietly <b>said,</b> [...] "DeLong, she ain't no more." [...] I didn't fully {{understand}} what he meant but I decided to ease the rudder lest it bang against the stops and get stuck. I was a little late but in time {{enough to keep the}} rudder from jamming. There was a jolt as the rudder hit the stop, but it was light enough so there was no jamming.|$|R
60|$|When the Princess {{presented}} {{herself at}} <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that the Queen had {{ordered her to}} place the box in her own room, the governor laughed heartily at the idea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Tom, going away. But {{he turned}} again at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "But you'd better come, you know. There's the dessert,--nuts, you know, and cowslip wine." ...|$|E
