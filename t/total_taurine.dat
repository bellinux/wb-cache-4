40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{industrial}} chemical, hydrazine (4 - 12 mM), on methionine synthase (EC 2. 1. 1. 13) activity and levels of the sulphur amino acids homocysteine, cysteine, and taurine as well as GSH were investigated in vitro in isolated rat hepatocyte suspensions and monolayers in order to {{explain some of the}} adverse in vivo effects of hydrazine. None of the concentrations of hydrazine were overtly cytotoxic in hepatocyte suspensions (measured as lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] leakage) after 3 hr. However, after 24 hr in culture cells treated with 12 mM, hydrazine showed a significant increase in LDH leakage. Methionine synthase activity was reduced by hydrazine (8 and 12 mM) in suspensions (by 45 and 55 %, after 3 hr) and monolayers (12 mM; 65 - 80 % after 24 hr). This was not due to nitric oxide production and the inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, Nomega-nitro-L-arginine, failed to protect against the hydrazine-induced loss of ATP and GSH and the reduction in urea synthesis at 24 hr. Homocysteine export was increased by 6 mM hydrazine, and <b>total</b> <b>taurine</b> content of treated cells was increased by 12 mM hydrazine. Thus, hydrazine was found to have several important and possibly deleterious effects on some parts of the sulphur amino acid pathway...|$|E
40|$|Background: Bile acids (BAs) play an {{important}} role in releasing incretin hormones via the enteroendocrine L-cell surface TGR 5 receptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in BA concentration at baseline and in response to a meal stimulus between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and a matched normoglycaemic group. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study of 12 patients with known T 2 DM and 12 matched normoglycaemic controls compared BA fractions after an overnight fast and following a standard meal. Results: The T 2 DM group had higher baseline glucose (P< 0. 001), but baseline total BA, total glycine conjugated BAs (GCBA) and <b>total</b> <b>taurine</b> conjugated BA (TCBA) were similar between both groups. The T 2 DM group compared to the normoglycaemic group had a higher post-prandial peak change in total BAs 4. 28 (3. 51 – 5. 38) mmol/L vs. 0. 88 (0. 60 – 1. 57) mmol/L (P< 0. 001) and peak total GCBA 2. 77 (1. 07 – 4. 19) mmol/L vs. 0. 94 (0. 34 – 1. 15) mmol/L (P< 0. 0001), but similar peak total TCBA 0. 36 (0. 02 – 0. 76) mmol/L vs. 0. 08 (0. 04 – 0. 22) mmol/L (P 0. 91). Conclusion: The post-prandial bile acid response is elevated in obese patients with T 2 DM compared to matched normoglycaemic individuals...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a low protein diet on the {{excretion}} of sulfate and taurine, major metabolites of L-cysteine in mammals, were studied in rats fed with synthetic 10 % (group A) and 25 % (group B) casein diets. The average excretions of <b>total</b> <b>taurine</b> (taurine plus hypotaurine) and total sulfate (free plus ester sulfate) (mumol/kg of body weight per day after the adaptation to the synthetic diet) in group A were 14. 2 +/- 13. 4 and 122. 3 +/- 39. 6, respectively, which were very low compared with 280. 4 +/- 93. 8 and 943. 2 +/- 144. 8, respectively, in group B. The taurine/sulfate ratio in group A was 0. 12 +/- 0. 11, which was significantly lower than that (0. 30 +/- 0. 08) in group B. A single intraperitoneal injection of 5 mmol of L-cysteine per kg of body weight in group A resulted {{in an increase in}} average taurine and sulfate excretion to 693. 4 +/- 195. 6 and 2440. 6 +/- 270. 0, respectively, and thus the average taurine/sulfate ratio increased to 0. 29. These increases were transient and low taurine excretion resumed again 24 h after the L-cysteine administration. L-Cysteine injection in group B resulted in a similar increase in taurine and sulfate excretion, but the ratio changed only slightly (0. 28). The present results suggest that in vivo production of taurine is reduced preferentially over sulfate production when sulfur amino acid supply is limited. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fasting and {{postprandial}} plasma {{concentrations of}} glycine and taurine conjugates of cholic, chenodeoxycholic, and deoxycholic acid were {{measured by a}} high pressure liquid chromatography-enzymatic assay in nine healthy subjects. The mean value of each bile acid concentration increased significantly (2. 4 - 4. 7 times) in the postprandial period. The <b>total</b> glycine <b>taurine</b> ratio of 2. 5 in the fasting state increased significantly to a maximum value of 3. 3 at one to 1 1 / 2 hours postprandially and then declined. This shift in glycine taurine ratio shows, that the relative increase in concentrations of glycine conjugates exceeds the relative increase in concentrations of taurine conjugates in the early postprandial period, and supports the view that there is significant absorption of glycine conjugated bile acids from the proximal small intestine...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE To gain {{a deeper}} {{understanding}} of the influence of skeletal muscle fiber orientation on metabolite visibility, magnetization transfer from water, and water proton relaxation rates in (1) H MR spectra. METHODS Non-water-suppressed MR spectroscopy was performed in tibialis anterior muscle (TA) of 10 healthy adults, with the TA oriented either parallel or at the magic angle to the 3 T field. Spectra were acquired with metabolite-cycled PRESS, and water inversion from 50 to 2510 ms before excitation. Water proton T 2 relaxation was sampled with STEAM with echo times from 12 to 272 ms. RESULTS Apparent concentrations of <b>total</b> creatine (tCr), <b>taurine,</b> and trimethylammonium compounds were reduced by 29...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of taurine in the fetal and neonatal organs, and the maternal organs, plasma and urine of rats between the 15 th day of gestation and the 21 st day after birth were determined using an automatic amino acid analyzer. In the fetal liver and brain {{and in the}} placenta, the taurine concentration was the highest of all ninhydrin positive compounds. In the fetal liver and placenta, the {{concentrations of}} taurine increased significantly with the gestational days. Concentrations of taurine in the brain were much higher in the fetus and neonate than that in the adult. Moreover, the <b>total</b> amount of <b>taurine</b> per fetus increased markedly after the 15 th day of gestation, and near term, reached almost the same amount as in the adult rat liver. In contrast to this, a significant decrease was observed in the taurine concentration in the maternal liver and muscle near term. The concentration of taurine in the urine of pregnant rats decreased near term, but in the plasma of pregnant rats the concentration of taurine did not change during pregnancy. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPerhexiline is {{a potent}} anti-anginal drug used for {{treatment}} of refractory angina {{and other forms of}} heart disease. It provides an oxygen sparing effect in the myocardium by creating a switch from fatty acid to glucose metabolism through partial inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and 2. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effects elicited by perhexiline are not fully understood. The present study employed a combined proteomics, metabolomics and computational approach to characterise changes in murine hearts upon treatment with perhexiline. According to results based on difference in-gel electrophoresis, the most profound change in the cardiac proteome related to the activation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Metabolomic analysis by high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed lower levels of <b>total</b> creatine and <b>taurine</b> in hearts of perhexiline-treated mice. Creatine and taurine levels were also significantly correlated in a cross-correlation analysis of all metabolites. Computational modelling suggested that far from inducing a simple shift from fatty acid to glucose oxidation, perhexiline may cause complex rebalancing of carbon and nucleotide phosphate fluxes, fuelled by increased lactate and amino acid uptake, to increase metabolic flexibility and to maintain cardiac output.

40|$|Microglia {{activation}} {{has emerged}} as a potential key factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease. Metabolite levels assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are used as markers of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, but how they relate to microglial activation in health and chronic disease is incompletely understood. Using MRS, we monitored the brain metabolic response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) -induced microglia activation in vivo in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimers disease (APP/PS 1) and healthy controls (wild-type (WT) littermates) over 4 [*]hours. We assessed reactive gliosis by immunohistochemistry and correlated metabolic and histological measures. In WT mice, LPS induced a microglial phenotype consistent with activation, associated with a sustained increase in macromolecule and lipid levels (ML 9). This effect was not seen in APP/PS 1 mice, where LPS did not lead to a microglial response measured by histology, but induced a late increase in the putative inflammation marker myoinositol (mI) and metabolic changes in <b>total</b> creatine and <b>taurine</b> previously reported to be associated with amyloid load. We argue that ML 9 and mI distinguish the response of WT and APP/PS 1 mice to immune mediators. Lipid and macromolecule levels may represent a biomarker of activation of healthy microglia, while mI may not be a glial marker...|$|R
