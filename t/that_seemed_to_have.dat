5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye-sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Tyrannosaur-inflicted damage has been found on skeletons of hadrosaurs and Triceratops <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> survived initial attacks. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur {{had to be the}} top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. The top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics with Tyrannosaurus that only small dromaeosaurs remain as feasible top predators. In this light, scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was an active predator that was willing to scavenge if it could.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of the Aryacakravarti rulers, the laws {{governing}} the society was based on a compromise between a matriarchal system of society <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had deeper roots overlaid with a patriarchal system of governance. These laws seemed to have existed side by side as customary laws to be interpreted by the local Mudaliars. In some aspects such as in inheritance the similarity to Marumakattayam law of present-day Kerala and Aliyasanatana of modern Tulunadu was noted by later scholars. Further Islamic jurisprudence and Hindu laws of neighboring India also seemed to have affected the customary laws. These customary laws were later codified and put to print during the Dutch colonial rule as Thesavalamai in 1707. The rule under earlier customs seemed to have been females succeeded females. But when the structure of the society came to be based on patriarchal system, a corresponding rule was recognized, that males succeeded males. Thus, we see the devolution of muthusam (paternal inheritance) was on the sons, and the devolution of the chidenam (dowry or maternal inheritance) was on the females. Just as one dowried sister succeeded another, we had the corresponding rule that if one’s brother died instate, his properties devolved upon his brothers to the exclusion of his sisters. The reason being that in a patriarchal family each brother formed a family unit, but all the brothers being agnates, when one of them died his property devolved upon his agnates.|$|E
5|$|He used a {{somewhat}} negative advertising campaign <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign {{was based on}} the platform of supply-side economics and inner-city enterprise zones. In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemp's campaign managers say he was unmanageable: he ignored timers on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling Super Tuesday, in which his 39delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg, New York to Bethesda, Maryland, their residence {{at the time of his}} death. In 1994, Kemp's 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits in Iowa and New Hampshire, and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.|$|E

25|$|The first {{experimental}} antivirals {{were developed}} in the 1960s, mostly to deal with herpes viruses, and were found using traditional trial-and-error drug discovery methods. Researchers grew cultures of cells and infected them with the target virus. They then introduced into the cultures chemicals which they thought might inhibit viral activity, and observed whether the level of virus in the cultures rose or fell.

25|$|The {{discovery}} of a specific function for DCC <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{little to do with}} cell cycle control, the low somatic mutation rate and the absence of cancer predisposition in DCC heterozygotes were fairly discouraging evidence for DCC's putative tumour suppressor status. This caused focus to shift to DCC's role in axon guidance for a time, until one study implicated DCC in regulation of cell death. As the 18q chromosomal deletions were never resolved to be related solely to another gene, DCC was rapidly reaccepted as a candidate. Recent research into the mechanisms of DCC signaling and in-vitro studies of DCC modifications have solidified DCC's tumour suppressor position, and have begun to integrate DCCs divergent functions as both an axon guidance molecule and a tumour suppressor into a single concept.|$|E

25|$|The Blues {{climbed the}} ladder quickly, making the finals in 1903-04-05 without winning the flag. Worrall's old club Fitzroy were the {{benchmark}} {{of the competition}} at this point, and eliminated Carlton from the finals in the latter two years. Worrall continually turned over players {{in an effort to}} find the right combination for success. Eventually, he developed a big, strong team that favoured long kicking and liked to close up the game, forming packs and using their physical strength in the crushes. Fitness was a priority for Worrall: he ensured that his team trained harder than the opposition. Finally, in 1906, Carlton defeated their nemesis Fitzroy in the Grand Final by a record margin with a young team <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the footballing world at its feet.|$|E
25|$|In 1824, Port Cornwallis was the {{rendezvous}} {{of the fleet}} carrying the army to the First Burmese War. In the 1830s and 1840s, shipwrecked crews who landed on the Andamans were often attacked and killed by the natives and the islands {{had a reputation for}} cannibalism. The loss of the Runnymede and the Briton in 1844 during the same storm, while transporting goods and passengers between India and Australia, and the continuous attacks launched by the natives, which the survivors fought off, alarmed the British government. In 1855, the government proposed another settlement on the islands, including a convict establishment, but the Indian Rebellion of 1857 forced a delay in its construction. However, because the rebellion gave the British so many prisoners, it made the new Andaman settlement and prison urgently necessary. Construction began in November 1857 at Port Blair using inmates' labour, avoiding the vicinity of a salt swamp <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been the source of many of the earlier problems at Port Cornwallis.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers gave Bedsitcom {{generally}} negative feedback. Some {{were critical}} of the storylines that had been devised by the writers, calling them unimaginative and clichéd. Others were {{critical of the}} premise of the show itself, describing it as [...] "deeply offensive and manipulative" [...] and [...] "morally reprehensible"—all three actors, particularly Jones, received criticism for their acting abilities. Frances Traynor of The Daily Record called the show [...] "about as funny as sharing a flat with that German cannibal" [...] and Paddy Sherman of The Liverpool Echo branded the show [...] "intensely irritating". Paul Hoggart of The Times called it [...] "a show <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> nothing to recommend it whatsoever",—after watching the first episode, Charlie Catchpole of The Daily Star simply stated: [...] "It isn't funny." [...] Critics on Newsnight Review also spoke harshly about the programme, with Tom Paulin calling it [...] "a disgraceful piece of television" [...] and Jeanette Winterson describing it as [...] "incredibly dull".|$|E

500|$|Almost {{from its}} inception, the Kingston Trio found itself {{at odds with}} the {{traditional}} music community. Urban folk musicians of the time (to whom Bob Dylan referred in Rolling Stone as [...] "the left-wing puritans <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a hold on the folk-music community") frequently associated folk music with leftist politics and were contemptuous of the Trio's deliberate political neutrality. Peter Dreier of Occidental College observed that [...] "Purists often derided the Kingston Trio for watering down folk songs in order to make them commercially popular and for remaining on the political sidelines during the protest movements of the 1960s." [...] A series of scathing articles appeared over several years in Sing Out! magazine, a publication that combined articles on traditional folk music with political activism. Its editor Irwin Silber referred to [...] "the sallow slickness of the Kingston Trio" [...] and {{in an article in the}} spring 1959 issue Ron Radosh said that the Trio brought [...] "good folk music to the level of the worst in Tin Pan Alley music" [...] and referred to them as [...] "prostitutes of the art who gain their status as folk artists because they use guitars and banjos." [...] Following the Trio's performance at the premier Newport Folk Festival in 1959, folk music critic Mark Morris wrote: [...] "What connection these frenetic tinselly showmen have with a folk festival eludes me... except that it is mainly folk songs that they choose to vulgarize." ...|$|E

The Cannes Film Festival saw the premiere of Flight of the Red Balloon (2007) by the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien.

When that idea failed to find sufficient funding, Hou developed it into a feature-length film and secured the necessary financing. The film was well received by international critics and went on to debut around the world early in 2008. Paying homage to Albert Lamorisse's 1957 short The Red Balloon, Hou's film tells the story of a woman's efforts to juggle her responsibilities as a single mother with her commitment to her career as a voice artist.
