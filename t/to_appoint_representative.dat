40|$|Individual investors {{victimized by}} {{securities}} fraud have no voice in directing class actions brought {{on their behalf}} once institutional investors obtain lead plaintiff appointments. The same holds for state-level transactional class actions claiming breaches of fiduciary duty by boards of directors in connection with mergers and acquisitions. In theory, the interests of institutional and individual investors align, nullifying {{the need for a}} separate voice for individuals; one rationale for the lead plaintiff modifications of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 was that individuals would benefit from the sophistication of institutional investor lead plaintiffs. But in practice, individual investors’ interests in these actions often differ from, and may directly conflict with, those of institutional lead plaintiffs. The routine appointment of institutional lead plaintiffs without regard to these conflicts effectively elevates the interests of institutional over individual investors, running afoul of procedural requirements that lead plaintiffs be typical and adequate class representatives. This Article examines the recurrent conflicts between these two groups of investors and suggests that the best remedy is for courts <b>to</b> <b>appoint</b> <b>representative</b> individual investors as co-lead plaintiffs with institutional investors. This Article proposes a procedure for selecting such individual co-lead plaintiffs from the pool of sophisticated individuals who are likely to be class members...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} of government and financial institutions {{in the operation of}} a company through the relationship of the main bank system and the system of amakudari (<b>appointing</b> retired bureaucrats <b>to</b> the boards of public companies).

However, a negative relationship is established between the presence of such amakudari and subsequent firm performance. Thus, while the system of amakudari may use its influence in an attempt to save troubled companies, it is possible that, as suggested by agency theory, the monitoring ability of the board may consequently be jeopardized to the detriment of overall firm performance. </p...|$|R
