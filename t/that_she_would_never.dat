5|$|On the day Murugesa is {{supposed}} to marry Valli at his house, Kali learns that the entire village has left to attend Valli's marriage to Kumaran. He intercepts Valli's group, reminding her that he loves her and how difficult {{it would be to}} live without her.

6000|$|... 'Oh! Rashe and I {{understand}} each other,' said Cilly, secure <b>that</b> though <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> treat Rashe with her former confidence, yet {{as long as}} they travelled en grand seigneur, there was no fear of collisions of temper.|$|R
6000|$|... "She forbears {{to judge}} {{them as a}} whole, but she has her {{exceptions}} whom she admires--Louis and Mr. Hall, and, of late, yourself. She did not like you once; I knew <b>that,</b> because <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> speak of you. But, Robert----" ...|$|R
5|$|Witherspoon is {{actively}} involved in children's and women's advocacy organizations. She is a longtime supporter of Save the Children, an organization that helps provide children {{around the world with}} education, health care and emergency aid. She also serves {{on the board of the}} Children's Defense Fund, a child advocacy and research group. In 2006, she was among a group of actresses who went to New Orleans, Louisiana in a CDF project to publicize the needs of Hurricane Katrina victims. During this trip, she helped open the city's first Freedom School, as she met and talked with the children. Witherspoon later called this an experience <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> forget.|$|E
5|$|Few {{people in}} London {{other than their}} close friends knew that the couple were not married. Hogg's family had heard rumours that he was {{planning}} to marry, and had been curious to know whom he had chosen. They were very upset after hearing of his plans for a union with Jane. His mother was unwilling to introduce Jane to their social circles as Mrs Hogg, which ensured <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> visit them. Hogg did not enter his family's house in Durham for seven years after he informed them of his relationship with Jane. Word of their union spread throughout Durham, and Hogg stopped practising law there for some time because of the damage to his reputation. Several of their friends were supportive of their union. Mary Shelley particularly approved of their match, despite having earlier been jealous of the time Hogg had spent with Jane.|$|E
5|$|Judy Garland's {{four-year}} {{contract for}} the series called for 26 weekly shows, for which Garland's corporation, Kingsrow Enterprises, would be paid $140,000 per episode. Of that Garland was guaranteed between $25,000 and $30,000 per show. Kingsrow Enterprises would also retain ownership of the tapes, allowing Garland to sell the series into syndication. Although Garland had said as early as 1955 <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> do a weekly television series, in the early 1960s {{she was in a}} financially precarious situation. Garland was several hundred thousand dollars in debt to the IRS, having failed to pay taxes in 1951 and 1952, and the commercial disappointment of the film A Star is Born meant that her share of any profits from that film would be eaten up immediately. A successful run on television would secure Garland's financial future.|$|E
60|$|She went rather reluctantly. Her {{marriage}} {{was more or}} less fixed for the twenty-eighth of the month. They were to sail for India on September the fifth. One thing she knew, in her subconsciousness, and <b>that</b> was, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> sail for India.|$|R

6000|$|One {{thing was}} quite sure; that all joy {{had gone out}} of her life. It was {{possible}} that love was still there--she did not know--she was too young to understand the complex sensations which suddenly had made a woman of her ... but it was a joyless love now: and all <b>that</b> <b>she</b> knew of a certainty about her own feelings at the present was <b>that</b> <b>she</b> hoped <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have to gaze into her lover's face again ... and ... Heaven help her! ... that he might never touch her again with his lips.|$|R
5|$|As {{she grew}} older Betsy {{suffered}} from numerous illnesses, the exact natures {{of which are}} not recorded but which {{are known to have}} caused William great concern. William began to become paranoid that Betsy would marry and leave his service, in 1835 going as far as to have her sign an affidavit <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> leave him. In 1843 his older brother Charles, a successful planter in Java, returned to England after over 30 years abroad. William became deeply suspicious that Betsy was becoming too close to Charles, a suspicion intensified when Charles took her on a visit to Holland and the Rhine; Charles returned to Java in 1845. In around 1844 Betsy struck up a close relationship with the pen manufacturer and art collector Joseph Gillott, one of William's regular customers who owned some of his pictures. Gillott was married with children, and the closeness of their relationship caused William concern. In 1848, William retired to York leaving Betsy alone in his London apartment; although aware that Betsy was considering marriage he was confident that he could persuade her to come to York and live with him in his retirement. Betsy did eventually join him in York, and was present at his death.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} {{not as good as}} the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland {{to spend the rest of}} her life in a convent; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} the {{agreement}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have to see her father again, Elisabeth Fritzl gave videotaped testimony before Austrian prosecutors and investigators on 11 July 2008.|$|E
60|$|Harriet and Aurelia had {{divested}} {{themselves of}} their finery before Betty came in, and they assisted her operations, Harriet preferring a complaint <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> tell them anything.|$|R
5000|$|An archaic English {{term for}} a woman who has never married is a spinster, while a woman who is {{divorced}} is a divorc√©e, and a woman whose spouse has died is a widow. [...] "Spinster" [...] often implied that the woman was older than the age when most women traditionally marry and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>never</b> marry; a more derogatory term was [...] "old maid".|$|R
60|$|The quarrel ended, as usual, by Mary's {{bursting}} into {{a fit of}} tears, and by my aunt's repeating the assertion {{that it was not}} too late, she trusted; and from <b>that</b> day forth <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> never leave me.|$|R
25|$|Since her {{daughter}} was starting school in Austria in September 2007, Bammer decided to plan her season so <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be {{away from home for}} more than a month at any one time.|$|E
25|$|Warsaw {{was another}} {{significant}} work by King from this period, a small sculpture whose inspiration comes from her {{response to the}} events in Europe. Having completed it, King knew <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> make another work like it.|$|E
25|$|Jameson {{announced}} her retirement from pornography at the 2008 AVN Awards, stating <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> {{return to the}} industry. Although she no longer performs in pornographic films, she has been working as a webcam model since 2013.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Rooth, at this, cried {{shame on}} her daughter's wanton humour, professing <b>that</b> <b>she</b> herself <b>would</b> <b>never</b> accept {{so much from}} Nick's good nature, and Miriam settled it that at any rate he was some day and {{in some way to}} do her mother, really do her, and so make her, as one of the funniest persons that ever was, live on through the ages.|$|R
60|$|Her voice {{died away}} with the last notes, and she fell into a slumber, from which the {{experienced}} attendant assured them <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> awake at all, or only in the death agony.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} her feet very carefully. There was nothing near them but a big round stone that was {{about the size of}} her head, and a prickly thistle <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> step on if she could {{possibly}} help it.|$|R
25|$|Realising <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be queen, Cl√©mentine {{turned her}} efforts to instilling in Ferdinand, her {{favorite}} child, the idea that, as a descendant not only of Louis-Philippe but of the Sun King, he deserved to be a king, of which country was not an important matter.|$|E
25|$|Elisabeth did {{not provide}} police with more details until they promised her <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have to see her father again. Over the next two hours, she {{told the story of}} her 24 years in captivity. Elisabeth told the police that her father raped her and forced her to watch pornographic videos. To humiliate her, he made her reenact scenes from the videos with him in front of her children. Shortly after midnight, police {{officers}} completed the three pages of minutes of the interrogation. Josef Fritzl, aged 73, was arrested on 26 April 2008 on suspicion of serious crimes against family members.|$|E
25|$|Her popular {{breakthrough}} {{came when}} she began singing on All India Radio (AIR) in Peshawar and Lahore from 1937. Producer Dilsukh Pancholi wanted her to act as well in a film he was producing. Begum readily agreed, gave a screen test and was selected. Her father became angry {{when he found out}} and warned her that she {{would not be allowed to}} sing if she continued to harbour a desire to act. Begum promised her father <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> appear before the camera. She continued to sing songs on radio. She never posed for photographs, and few people saw her picture between 1933 and the 1970s.|$|E
60|$|Maitre Gardon heard {{little more}} of the discourse, indeed he would have {{followed}} at once had he not feared to increase the sensation and the scandal. He came home to find Rayonette's tears long ago dried, but her mother furious. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> leave Montauban <b>that</b> minute, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> set foot in a heretic conventicle again, to have her fatherless child, daughter of all the Ribaumonts, struck by base canaille. Even her uncle {{could not have done}} worse; he at least would have respected her blood.|$|R
5000|$|Miranda Navas: Via's friend. Via, Miranda, and Ella were friends. Miranda had {{recently}} cut her {{hair into a}} bob and dyed it pink, and dressed in a manner <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>never</b> dressed before. Via is shocked by Miranda's new look, and the two former friends slowly drift apart. Miranda took care of August and {{thought of him as}} her own [...] "little brother;" [...] when she went to summer camp, Miranda lied and told everyone August was her brother.|$|R
6000|$|She {{said with}} solemn {{breathlessness}} {{that they had}} seen something {{very different from what}} they had hoped to see, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> for one <b>would</b> <b>never</b> attempt such unholy ceremonies again.

25|$|The Irish {{physician}} and inventor, William Reid Clanny, {{who had moved}} to nearby Sunderland, introduced Jane to Sir Robert Peat, a sycophantic chaplain of the Prince Regent. Peat {{was said to be}} supportive of a match with Jane to use her relationship (albeit distant) to the prince's unofficial wife, to further advance himself in royal favour and also to repay his gambling debts. Jane was taken {{with the idea of a}} title if she were to marry Peat, but was afraid to put her wealth at the disposal of a husband. When Sir Robert proposed to Jane, he was heard to have said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> marry as long as Herrington House still stood.|$|E
25|$|Wilson then remembers about Amelia's father, Lawrence; a drunk who {{has been}} overprotective of his {{daughter}} since her mother died. Lawrence hated Wilson, fearing that he will take away his daughter some day. After arriving at the river, Wilson recalls many summers he spent here, along with Amelia and Frank Dodd. The three often discussed their future, with Wilson and Frank both wanting to become pilots, and Amelia wanting to dance on Broadway. Years later Amelia asks Wilson to do the honorable thing and marry her, but fears what her father will do {{to him when he}} found out. Wilson is surprised about her request, as he always thought <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> marry him, but he is determined to make her dream become a reality.|$|E
25|$|Dina Matos and McGreevey {{separated}} {{after he}} {{revealed that he}} was homosexual, and in late 2005 McGreevey and Australian-American executive Mark O'Donnell began a relationship. The two lived in Plainfield, New Jersey. On March 14, 2007, the Associated Press reported that McGreevey was seeking custody of Jacqueline and filing for child support. Matos demanded $600,000 plus alimony. The divorce trial started on May 6, 2008. On August 8, the divorce was granted. McGreevey received joint custody and pays child support. They will also be using a parenting coordinator. Matos was denied alimony. In her memoirs, Matos wrote <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have married McGreevey if she had known he was homosexual, nor would she have chosen to have a homosexual man father her child.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> knew <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>would.</b> It was {{something}} apart from her reason. It {{would not even}} listen to her. It bade or forbade as if one were a child without any right to a will of one's own. It was decidedly exasperating.|$|R
6000|$|... "Though the Fixed Period {{does seem}} to be horrible, I would have {{swallowed}} all that at your bidding. But you can see how I tumbled into it, and how Eva egged me on, and how the nearer the thing came the more I was bound to fight.
