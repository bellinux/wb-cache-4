5|$|Suter and Heisman turned away. 'Can {{you beat}} that?' Suter asked the Auburn coach. Heisman didn't say anything, I guess {{he thought a}} great deal.

5|$|As if {{struck by}} a blow, one {{suddenly}} recognizes the scientific futility, the biological senselessness, and the social noxiousness of views and institutions, which until <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> had seemed altogether natural and self-evident. It {{is a kind of}} eschatological experience so frequently encountered in a pathological form in schizophrenics. I might even voice the belief that the schizophrenic form of psychic illness is regularly accompanied by illuminating insight into the irrationalism of social and political mores.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} of his directorial debut Vandemataram (1939) at Hampi, Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy visited the Virupaksha Temple to capture {{the beauty of the}} monuments, which {{reflected}} the taste and artistic outlook of Krishnadevaraya, king of the Vijayanagara Empire. At the heart of the temple, Narasimha Reddy felt that he was standing exactly at a place where Krishnadevaraya had once stood and offered prayers to the deity. From <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> Reddy decided to make a film in which Krishnadevaraya would be the main character, and he began working on the script.|$|E

5|$|Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight short, simple words....For {{a part of}} {{a second}} I glimpsed my mother and my sisters moving away to the right.

5|$|Faced {{with the}} Kutrigur invasion, Justinian {{activated}} his alliance against the invaders, mobilizing the neighbouring Utigurs, {{who in turn}} asked for help from the allied Crimean Tetraxites. The latter invaded the Kutrigur homeland, {{taking advantage of the}} fact that many warriors were employed at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> in the Balkans. Informed of the attack, the Kutrigurs were forced to leave the Balkans to defend their homeland on the north-western shore of the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b> When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

5|$|In fact, Squall and {{the heroes}} do help Ultimecia start Time Compression, {{but they do}} so to confront her in her own time. After Squall and his party defeat Sorceress Adel, Adel {{transfers}} her power to Rinoa, then Ultimecia possesses Rinoa again, and Ellone uses her power to send their consciousness to the past, at which point Ultimecia starts Time Compression. At <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> the heroes are able to travel to Ultimecia's distant future and defeat her. After the final battle, the defeated Ultimecia transfers her powers to Edea.|$|E

5|$|Singapore's LTA {{together}} with IBM, ran a pilot from December 2006 to April 2007, with a traffic estimation and prediction tool (TrEPS), which uses historical traffic data and real-time feeds with flow conditions from several sources, {{in order to}} predict the levels of congestion {{up to an hour}} in advance. By accurately estimating prevailing and emerging traffic conditions, this technology is expected to allow variable pricing, {{together with}} improved overall traffic management, including the provision of information in advance to alert drivers about conditions ahead, and the prices being charged at <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} {{the signing of the}} 1972 treaty, Libyan troops moved into the Strip and {{established}} an airbase just north of Aouzou, protected by surface-to-air missiles.

5|$|Unexpectedly, this weak push by Młokosiewicz {{and his men}} {{probably}} {{forced the}} Russians to reconsider their plans and postpone any further attacks until the following day. At <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> Paskevich was {{not sure what the}} Poles would do. He feared a Polish counter-attack would retake the forts of Wola, or strike a wedge between his I and II Corps. He ordered all offensive actions in Wola halted. His artillery continued to duel with the Poles, but infantry was withdrawn and Paskevich himself left his forces to look for the Corps of General Muraviev to the south, somewhere between Szczęśliwice and the Jerozolimskie Gate.|$|E

5|$|After {{the start}} of World War II, Gheorghe Tătărescu {{initiated}} a move to rally political forces in opposition to Ion Antonescu's dictatorship, and sought an alliance with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). He was twice expelled from the PNL, in 1938 and 1944, creating instead his own group, the National Liberal Party-Tătărescu, and representing it inside the Communist-endorsed Petru Groza cabinet. In 1946-1947, {{he was also the}} President of the Romanian Delegation to the Peace Conference in Paris. After <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> relations between Tătărescu and the PCR began to sour, and he was replaced from the leadership of both his own party and the Foreign Ministry when his name was implicated in the Tămădău Affair. Following the Communist takeover, he was arrested and held as a political prisoner, while being called to testify in the trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu. He died soon after his release from prison.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, the two {{follow the}} cloud to a castle. There, the cloud {{condenses}} into a demonic form, presumably Hunson Abadeer. While {{running through the}} castle, Finn and Jake find a portal back to Ooo, and the two jump in, with Abadeer in pursuit. Finn wounds the demon with his sword. At <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> it is revealed that the demon is not Hunson Abadeer, but rather Marceline, who has for some unknown reason, {{been transformed into a}} hideous demon. She musters enough strength to forbid Finn and Jake from coming back to the Nightosphere, and, after the two are teleported back to their dimension, she closes the portal.|$|E
