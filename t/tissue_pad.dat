40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effect of vibrotactile feedback in a needle-insertion task using a surgical robot. Four participants performed the task by hand (using a manual needle driver instrument) and by using a surgical robot, with or without vibrotactile feedback. The vibrotactile feedback signal indicated the deviation in force direction, with the signal amplitude modulated by the force magnitude. Visual feedback was always available in all experimental conditions. The participants ’ task was to insert a hooked needle into a simulated <b>tissue</b> <b>pad</b> at a premarked entrance point and drive {{it out of the}} <b>tissue</b> <b>pad</b> at a corresponding pre-marked exit point. The participants were instructed to hold the hooked needle in an orientation that minimized side-loading on the simulated <b>tissue</b> <b>pad</b> and prevented needle rotation in the needle driver. The forces exerted by the needle on the simulated <b>tissue</b> <b>pad</b> were recorded. The results indicated that the vibrotactile display was useful in reducing the overall force-direction deviation during the needle-insertion task, but it increased task completion time. It generally took twice as long to perform the task with the robot than with the hand. One participant who was experienced with the surgical robot consistently applied less force with the robot than with the hand. The vibrotactile feedback reduced the magnitude of the force component that was perpendicular to the suturing surface, but not the forces along the suturing surface. We compare our results to those reported in the literature and discuss the challenges we faced in assessing haptic feedback in a skilled surgical task such as the one used in the present study...|$|E
40|$|Full {{energy balance}} {{studies have been}} {{performed}} for 9 weeks on four groups of four adult female rats housed in a continuously running indirect calorimeter; for four weeks two of the groups received highly palatable foods {{in addition to a}} standard pelleted diet. A further sixteen groups, of which eight received the palatable foods, provided additional carcass composition data. All practicable precautions were taken to measure energy exchange accurately. Comparison of 'start-to-finish' apparent energy balance with carcass composition changes showed a systematic error of approx. + 3 % of energy throughput. This was most probably caused by losses of energy in food and excreta, which led to over-estimation of energy intake. Variations among individual balance periods added a standard error of approx. +/- 1 %: the source of error here was probably imperfect matching of animals analysed at intermediate stages. The rats offered the palatable foods increased their metabolizable energy (m. e.) intake by 106 kJ/day, 51 % of the control groups' intake, {{in the first week of}} supplementation. Over the whole 4 weeks of supplementation the increase was 64 kJ/day, or 31 %. Withdrawal of the palatable foods led to an immediate fall in intake to about two-thirds of control level, and a return to control level over the next 2 - 3 weeks. Energy expenditure rose more slowly than intake, reaching a fairly steady level ca. 5 days after introduction of the palatable foods. Expenditure was then ca. 22 kJ/day above control level; an increase of 12 % above control expenditure or, allowing for systematic and random errors, 33 - 37 % of the additional m. e. intake. Expenditure returned to control level over the 2 weeks after ceasing supplementation. The experimental groups gained weight at a declining rate throughout the period of supplementation. The gain in live body weight at the end was ca. 32 g, but this comprised a carcass weight gain of 37 g and a loss of 5 g gastrointestinal tract contents. The carcass weight gain comprised 27 g fat (i. e. ca. 70 % of the weight gained), 9 g lean tissue and 1 g additional water. The gain of carcass energy was 1100 kJ. There was a small increase in body length, an increase in liver weight, and an increase in the weight of the interscapular brown adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>pad.</b> Regression analysis showed that the increase in the weight of the interscapular brown adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>pad</b> reflected the increase in total body fat.

To examine these competing pathways, we analyzed {{data from a}} multisite, multiethnic cohort of 1924 women, premenopausal or early perimenopausal at baseline. Obesity was defined as baseline body mass index (BMI) [*]>[*] 30 [*]kg/m 2. Composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to fall impact forces were constructed from DXA‐derived bone size, BMD and body size. Incident fractures were ascertained annually during a median follow‐up of 9 years. In multivariable linear regression adjusted for covariates, higher BMI was associated with higher BMD but with lower composite strength indices, suggesting that although BMD increases with greater skeletal loading, the increase {{is not sufficient to}} compensate for the increase in fall impact forces. During the follow‐up, 201 women had fractures. In Cox proportional hazard analyses, obesity was associated with increased fracture hazard adjusted for BMD, consistent with greater fall impact forces in obese individuals. Adjusted for composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to fall impact forces, obesity was associated with decreased fracture hazard, consistent with a protective effect of soft <b>tissue</b> <b>padding.</b> Further adjustment for hip circumference, a surrogate marker of soft <b>tissue</b> <b>padding,</b> attenuated the obesity–fracture association.

40|$|In a {{study of}} 82 lumbar zygapophysial joints three types of {{intra-articular}} structures were identified. They were adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>pads</b> and fibro-adipose meniscoids, both located at the superior and inferior poles of the joint, and connective tissue rims, located along the dorsal and ventral margins. Every lumbar zygapophysial joint contained {{at least one of}} these structures and 47 contained more than one type. Connective tissue rims are short, central projections of the joint capsule and do not enter between the articular surfaces. Adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>pads</b> are covered by synovium and fill the subcapsular space at the superoventral and inferodorsal poles of the joint. Fibro-adipose meniscoids, also covered by synovium, project from the joint capsule at the superior and inferior poles and enter between the articular surfaces. Adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>pads</b> and fibro-adipose meniscoids are probably derived from a common primitive mesenchymal meniscus which primarily differentiates into a fatty structure. The fibrous component of fibro-adipose meniscoids then secondarily develops as a result of compression of the tip of the fatty structure between the articular surfaces. The function of these intra-articular structures is not evident but may be related to protection of the articular processes as they subluxate during flexion and extension. Meniscus entrapment in the lumbar zygapophysial joints has been proposed as a cause of acute locked back, but the present morphological data are inconsistent with this view...|$|R

The constitutive model was formulated, starting from the analysis of the complex structural and micro-structural configuration of the tissues, to evaluate the relationship between tissue histology and mechanical properties. To define the constitutive model, experimental data from mechanical tests were analyzed. To obtain information about the mechanical response of the tissue so that the constitutive parameters could be established, data from both in vitro and in vivo tests were investigated.

In contrast, white adipose tissue stores energy, contributing to obesity. We investigated whether the early programming of obesity by overfeeding during lactation changes structure of interscapular brown adipose tissue in adulthood and its effects on thermogenesis. Methods: Birth of litters was considered day 0. On day 2, litter size was adjusted to normal (9 pups) and small (3 pups) litters. On day 21, the litters were weaned.

40|$|The {{peculiar}} {{structure of}} heel pad is considered {{with regard to}} its biomechanical function as a dumping and pressure resistant cushion. According to a honeycomb configuration, heel <b>pad</b> <b>tissue</b> is organized as dense strands of fibrous tissue, characterized by circular or cone-shaped septa. The septa bound chambers filled with fat cells. The chambers are reinforced by further transverse and diagonal fibers. The fibrous tissue strands are firmly attached to the underface of the calcaneum and extending to the subcutaneous tissues.

40|$|Hypothalamic neurons are {{regarded}} as essential for integrating thermal afferent information from skin and core and issuing commands to autonomic and behavioral effectors that maintain core temperature (Tc) during cold exposure and for the control of energy expenditure more generally. Caudal brain stem neurons are necessary elements of the hypothalamic effector pathway and also are directly driven by skin and brain cooling. To assess whether caudal brain stem processing of thermal afferent signals is sufficient to drive endemic effectors for thermogenesis, heart rate (HR), Tc, and activity responses of chronic decerebrate (CD) and control rats adapted to 23 °C were compared during cold exposure (4, 8, or 12 °C) for 6 h. Other CDs and controls were exposed to 4 or 23 °C for 2 h, and tissues were processed for norepinephrine turnover (NETO), a neurochemical measure of sympathetic drive. Controls maintained Tc for all temperatures. CDs maintained Tc for the 8 and 12 °C exposures, but Tc declined 2 °C during the 4 °C exposure. Cold exposure elevated HR in CDs and controls alike. Tachycardia magnitude correlated with decreases in environmental temperature for controls, but not CDs. Cold increased NETO in brown adipose tissue, heart, and some white adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>pads</b> in CDs and controls compared with their respective room temperature controls.

In the present study, we investigated the regulation of TLR- 4 and DNA-binding of nuclear factor-kappa Bp 65 (NF-kappa Bp 65) in different depots of adipose tissue in rats after exhaustive exercise. Rats were killed by decapitation immediately (E 0 group, n = 6), 2 (E 2 group, n = 6), and 6 h (E 6 group, n = 6) after the exhaustive exercise, which consisted of running on a treadmill (approximately 70 % V(O 2 max)) for 50 min and then running at an elevated rate that increased at 1 m/min, until exhaustion. The control group (C group, n = 6) was not subjected to exercise. In RPAT, TLR- 4, MYD- 88, and IkB alpha increased in the E 2 group after exercise. MYD- 88 and TRAF 6 remained increased in the E 6 group in comparison with the control group. DNA-binding of NF-kappa Bp 65 was not altered.

However, human data {{on the role of}} <b>tissue</b> AGEs in <b>PAD</b> are scarce. We aimed to study the effects of DM and CKD on accumulation of tissue AGEs in patients with PAD. Materials and methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of 486 PAD patients at the outpatient clinic of Vascular Surgery. PAD was confirmed by angiography or duplex ultrasonography. CV risk factors and CV comorbidity (coronary artery disease [CAD], cerebrovascular disease [CVD], abdominal aortic aneurysm [AAA]) were assessed.

We studied the variation of hip BMD and geometry across categories of body mass index (BMI) in a subset of postmenopausal non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Cohort (WHI-OS). The implications on fracture incidence were studied among NHWs in the entire WHI-OS. Baseline DXA scans of hip and total body from 4642 NHW women were divided into BMI (kg/m 2) categories: underweight (40). Femur BMD and indices of bone axial (cross-sectional area [CSA]) and bending strength (section modulus [SM]) were extracted from DXA scans using the hip structure analysis (HSA) method and compared among BMI categories after adjustment for height, age, hormone use, diabetes, activity level, femur neck-shaft angle, and neck length. The association between BMI and incident fracture was studied in 78, 013 NHWs from the entire WHI-OS over 8. 5 ± 2. 6 (SD) yr of follow-up. Fracture incidence (cases/ 1000 person-years) was compared among BMI categories for hip alone, central body (hip, pelvis, spine, ribs, and shoulder girdle), upper extremity (humerus and distal), and lower extremity (femur shaft and distal but not hip). Femur BMD, CSA, and SM were larger in women with higher BMI, but values scaled in proportion to lean and not to fat or total body mass. Women with highest BMI reported more falls in the 12 mo before enrollment, more prevalent fractures, and had lower measures of physical activity and function. Incidence of hip fractures and all central body fractures declined with BMI. Lower extremity fractures distal to the hip trended upward, and upper extremity incidence was independent of BMI. BMD, CSA, and SM vary in proportion to total body lean mass, supporting the view that bones adapt to prevalent muscle loads. Because lean mass is a progressively smaller fraction of total mass in obesity, femur BMD, CSA, and SM decline relative to body weight in higher BMI categories. Traumatic forces increase with body weight, but fracture rates at the hip and central body were less frequent with increasing BMI, possibly because of greater soft <b>tissue</b> <b>padding.</b> There was no evident protective effect in fracture rates at less padded distal extremity sites.

Methods. 24 S-hydroxycholesterol (24 S-HC), 25 -hydroxycholesterol (25 -HC), and 27 -hydroxycholesterol (27 -HC) were assessed in plasma and arteries with atherosclerotic plaques from 10 patients (54 - 84 years) with severe peripheral artery disease (PAD) as well as arteries free of atherosclerotic plaques from 13 individuals (45 - 78 years, controls). Results. Plasma 25 -HC was higher in PAD individuals than in controls (6. 3 [2] vs. 3. 9 [1. 9] ng/mgCol; p = 0. 004). 24 S-HC and 27 -HC levels were, respectively, five-and 20 -fold higher in the arterial <b>tissue</b> of <b>PAD</b> individuals than in those of the controls (p = 0. 016 and p = 0. 001). Plasma C-reactive protein correlated with plasma 24 -HC (r = 0. 51; p = 0. 010), 25 -HC (r = 0. 75; p < 0. 001), 27 -HC (r = 0. 48; p = 0. 015), and with tissue 24 S-HC (r = 0. 4; p = 0. 041) and 27 -HC (r = 0. 46; p = 0. 023). Conclusion. Arterial intima accumulation of 27 -HC and 24 S-HC is associated with advanced atherosclerotic disease and systemic inflammatory activity in individuals with severe PAD...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{designed}} to examine the regulation of body weight/fat by lowering body weight/fat through surgical removal of bilateral epididymal fat pads of adult male Wistar rats. Food intake during the first 4 weeks and energy expenditure on day 7 - 10 and day 28 - 31 post surgery were not different between lipectomized and sham operated rats. The carcass composition of lipectomized and sham operated rats was not significantly different 16 weeks post surgery, indicating a compensatory adipose tissue growth in lipectomized rats. The compensatory growth of adipose <b>tissue</b> was fat <b>pad</b> specific: both mesenteric and retroperitoneal fat pads, but not inguinal or perirenal fat pads were significantly heavier in lipectomized rats than in sham operated rats. Lipectomized rats had more total, small and large adipocytes at 4 weeks, and more total and large adipocytes at 16 weeks, than sham operated rats in the retroperitoneal fat depot, suggesting that both hyperplasia and hypertrophy contributed to the compensatory growth. Leptin and insuli...|$|R
40|$|Bone loss in {{microgravity}} is well documented, but it {{is difficult}} to quantify how declines in bone mineral density (BMD) contribute to an astronaut's overall risk of fracture upon return. This study uses a biomechanical approach to assessing hip fracture risk, or Factor of Risk (Phi), which is defined as the ratio of applied load to bone strength. All long-duration NASA astronauts from Expeditions 1 - 18 were included in this study (n= 25), while crewmembers who flew twice (n= 2) were treated as separate subjects. Bone strength was estimated based on an empirical relationship between areal BMD at the hip, as measured by DXA, and failure load, as determined by mechanical testing of cadaver femora. Fall load during a sideways fall was calculated from a previously developed biomechanical model, which takes into account body weight, height, gender, and soft tissue thickness overlying the lateral aspect of the hip that serves to attenuate the impact force. While no statistical analyses have been performed yet, preliminary results show that males in this population have a higher FOR than females, with a post- flight Phi of 0. 87 and 0. 36, respectively. FOR increases 5. 1 % from preflight to postflight, while only one subject crossed the fracture "threshold" of Phi = 1, for a total of 2 subjects with a postflight Phi > 1. These results suggest that men may be at greater risk for hip fracture due largely in part to their relatively thin soft <b>tissue</b> <b>padding</b> as compared to women, since soft tissue thickness has the highest correlation (R(exp 2) =. 53) with FOR of all subject-specific parameters. Future work will investigate changes in FOR during recovery to see if baseline risk levels are restored upon return to 1 -g activity. While dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the most commonly used clinical measure of bone health, it fails to provide compartment-specific information that is useful in assessing changes to bone quality as a result of microgravity exposure. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) accomplishes this by imaging transverse "slices" of the long bones. This project was a re-analysis of a 90 day bed rest study to determine if changes to cortical and trabecular compartments could be detected in the distal tibia with statistical significance using a new pQCT image analysis method. Nearly all changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and cross sectional area (CSA) measures were seen with statistical significance, with the exception of a change in cortical BMD. Total bone CSA increased by 1. 1 % (p = 0. 01), cortical CSA decreased by - 5. 6 % (p< 0. 001) and trabecular CSA increased by 1. 76 % (p= 0. 007); the combination of which suggests bone resorption occurred at the endocortical surface in response to mechanical unloading by bed rest. Furthermore, total BMD and trabecular BMD decreased (- 3. 8 %, p= 0. 001 and - 2. 8 %, p = 0. 007, respectively), while decreases in cortical BMD failed to reach significance (- 1. 2 %, p= 0. 07). Given that compartment-specific changes are seen with significance and are likely to influence bone strength, it is recommended that pQCT remain a standard measure used in bed rest because it provides a unique measure by which to better evaluate the efficacy of countermeasures to microgravity-induced bone loss...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of the suspensory and supporting structures of the bovine claw are of particular importance in the pathogenesis of claw lesions since both must function optimally to prevent soft tissue compression and trauma. An essential component is the shock-absorbing digital cushion situated under the distal phalanx. The sound claws of 54 slaughtered cows were dissected. The digital cushion consisted of three parallel pads [...] axial, middle and abaxial [...] that ran longitudinally from the heel and underneath the distal phalanx with numerous transverse finger-shaped branches that connected the axial and abaxial pads cranial to the flexor process of the distal phalanx. The middle fat pad frequently ended just at the apical end of the flexor process of the distal phalanx, which may result in an inferior cushioning effect under the distal phalanx and {{increase the likelihood of}} ulcers. There were differences {{in the structure of the}} digital cushion with age and loose connective <b>tissue</b> in heifers' <b>pads</b> was first replaced by fat which, after the third lactation, was gradually supplanted by collagenous connective tissue...|$|R
40|$|Presentation by MHC {{molecules}} of peptides bearing posttranslational modifications can elicit highly specific T cell responses, specu-lated to be {{a component of}} autoimmunities. The T cells usually recognize the modified residue {{in the framework of}} the unmodified TCR contact residues of the peptide (Anderton, 2004; Engelhard et al., 2006; Petersen et al., 2009). One of the most compelling findings linking posttranslationally modified self-proteins to autoimmunity is the antibody response to citrullinated proteins in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The presence of citrulline in proteins is caused by the enzymatic deimination of arginine residues; citrulline is not a natural amino acid encoded in DNA. The conver-sion from peptidylarginine to peptidylcitrul-line is catalyzed by the peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) family of enzymes, which differ in <b>tissue</b> expression. <b>PAD</b> 2 and PAD 4 are both expressed by cells of the immune system. In RA, the antibodies are found early in disease, at levels that correlate with sever-ity (Klareskog et al., 2008; Wegner et al., 2010). Moreover, there is a strong correlation between antibody reactivity and the presence of RA-susceptible HLA alleles (de Vries et al., 2006; van der Helm-van Mil and Huizinga, 2008). Citrullinated peptides were shown to bind with higher affinity to the RA-susceptible HLA allele DR 4 {{as a result of the}} more favor-able interaction of the citrulline side chain with the positively charged P 4 pocket (Hill et al., 2003). We previously reported that immuniza-tion with the protein hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) gave rise to T cells that recognized different sets of HEL peptides presented by class II MHC molecules (Ireland et al., 2006). In this study, we correlate the response of a T cell that exclusively recognizes the chemically dominant HEL peptide, 48 – 62 (DGSTDYGILQINSRW), with a citrulline to arginine change at residue 61 (48 – 62 -Cit 61) to autophagy...|$|R
40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} numerical approach {{is used to}} investigate the interaction phenomena occurring between foot and footwear during the heel strike phase of the gait. Two force platforms are utilised to evaluate the ground reaction forces of a subject in bare and shod walking. The reaction forces obtained from the experimental tests are assumed as loading conditions for the numerical analyses using three dimensional models of the heel region and of the running shoe. The heel pad region, as fat and skin tissues, is described by visco-hyperelastic and fibre-reinforced hyperelastic formulations respectively and bone region by a linear orthotropic formulation. Different elastomeric foams are considered {{with regard to the}} outsole, the midsole and the insole layers. The mechanical properties are described by a hyperfoam formulation. The evaluation of the mechanical behaviour of the heel <b>pad</b> <b>tissues</b> at the heel strike in bare and shod conditions is performed considering different combinations of materials for midsole and insole layers. Results allow for the definition of the influence of different material characteristics on the mechanical response of the heel pad region, in particular showing the compressive stress differentiation in the bare and shod conditions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the viscoelastic behaviour of the human heel pad by comparing the stress– relaxation curves obtained from a compression device used on an in vivo heel pad with those obtained from a threedimensional computer-based subject-specific heel pad model subjected to external compression. The three-dimensional model was based on the anatomy revealed by magnetic resonance imaging of a 31 -year-old healthy female. The calcaneal fat <b>pad</b> <b>tissue</b> was described with a viscohyperelastic model, while a fibre-reinforced hyperelastic model was formulated for the skin. All numerical analyses were performed to interpret the mechanical response of heel tissues, with loading conditions and displacement rate in agreement with experimental tests. The heel tissues showed a non-linear, viscoelastic behaviour described by characteristic hysteretic curves, stress–relaxation and viscous recovery phenomena. The reliability of the investigations was validated by the interpretation of the mechanical response of heel tissues under the application of three pistons with diameter of 15, 20 and 40 mm, at the same displacement rate of about 1. 7 mm/s. The maximum and minimum relative errors were found to be less than 0. 95 and 0. 064, respectively...|$|R
