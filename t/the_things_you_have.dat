2500|$|Dr. Boscaglia {{had talked}} to Madame [...] for a while, and though he conceded all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{discovered}} in the sky, {{he said that the}} motion of the earth was incredible and could not be, particularly since Holy Scripture obviously was contrary to such motion.|$|E
2500|$|Kasey Kahne {{took the}} lead on the second Green-White-Checker attempt and held off Matt Kenseth to score his first win of the season. [...] "Yeah, man, it took a lot," [...] said Kahne. [...] "We {{were all over the}} place during the race but the guys stayed with me and worked hard. On those restarts– I didn't know what would happen because I had great restarts all night and I {{struggle}} with restarts a lot. That's big, because that is one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be good at and it worked really well tonight. Yeah, we are locked in and I hate it comes down to this Atlanta or Richmond just about every year for me," [...] said Kahne. [...] "Sometimes we are in, sometimes we are out. But thankful that now at HMS I have been in all three years now." [...] "Those last two laps were really intense," [...] Kenseth said. [...] "Things are looking up. I'm looking forward to the next 11." [...] "I couldn't capitalize, couldn't get the restarts and couldn't accelerate," [...] Denny Hamlin said. [...] "We just came up short. Third is about the place car we had tonight." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{seemed to}} me that you did not care for dancing," [...] said Gwendolen. [...] "I thought it might be one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> left off." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "What do you expect," [...] {{she almost}} screamed, [...] "from <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made of me? Do you expect honour and self-respect, {{or any other}} virtue in a hype?" ...|$|R
60|$|ROPER. [To JACK.] Say {{nothing at}} all! Don't put {{yourself}} in a false position. The man stole <b>the</b> <b>things</b> or <b>the</b> woman stole <b>the</b> <b>things,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing to do with}} it. You were asleep on the sofa.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{showed me}} some rather {{good things in}} New York," [...] he went on, [...] "but really <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> here seem to be awfully good things." ...|$|E

5000|$|LIEBELER: Did you form any {{opinion about}} the {{direction}} from which the shots came by the sound, or were you just upset by <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> seen?ZAPRUDER: No, {{there was too much}} reverberation. There was an echo which gave me a sound all over. In other words that square is kind of—it had a sound all over.|$|R
6000|$|... "Speak, Lodbrog, speak!" [...] she commanded. [...] "You {{are strong}} and unafraid. You are all man. I know you despise the vermin who would destroy Him. You, you alone can save Him. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> {{but to say}} the word and <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> is done; and I will well love you and always love <b>you</b> for <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chris echoed his brother's {{sentiment}} in the March 1996 issue of Guitar World magazine. [...] "Everyone goes through changes," [...] he stated. [...] "The trick is trying to remember that and keep it together, and having respect for everyone and not judging people because you're all goin' through changes. Perseverance is <b>the</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> to get your ego in place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Back so soon!" [...] cried Miriam. [...] "See {{what a lot}} of {{raspberries}} we have picked. I will take them into the house, and then come out and get <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> brought." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Johnny Chuck has it," [...] said Old Mother West Wind. [...] "It {{is being}} happy with <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{and not wanting}} things which some one else has. And it is called Con-tent-ment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In what way?" [...] she demanded. [...] "I judge {{only by the}} facts, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> said to me, your {{accusations against}} Captain Granet. Why should you go {{out of your way}} to {{investigate}} cases of suspected espionage?" ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{valuable}} result of all education {{is the ability to}} make yourself do <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do, when it ought to be done, {{whether you like it or}} not; it is the first lesson that ought to be learned; and, however early a man's training begins, it is probably the last lesson that he learns thoroughly.|$|R
6000|$|Opee-Kwan rose to {{his feet}} [...] "And now, O Nam-Bok, the feast is ended, and we would listen {{concerning}} <b>the</b> strange <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Several of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> told {{me about}} your life in Canada {{interest}} me. It must have been bracing to feel that you depended upon your own efforts and stood on your own feet, free from the hampering customs that are common here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> told me," [...] she said, [...] "I don't think I {{could bear}} {{to have him}} take your money to-day. I can't quite do as you wish; but what you have said shall make a difference, I promise you. I can't say more. Please drive me home now." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her again; and then, very gently, [...] "No I will not avoid you," [...] he replied; [...] "but I will leave you, for the present, to yourself. I think you will remember--after a while--some of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> forgotten. I think you {{will come back to}} me; I have great faith in that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, Fool!" [...] said Asti, [...] "you {{should have}} buried it. Know that with <b>the</b> enchanted <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> burned away <b>the</b> life of Pharaoh also." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know how}} heartily I admire your courage, and your devotion to my unfortunate son," [...] she said. [...] "You know {{by this time}} that I don't cant. But I cannot see you attempt to perform impossibilities; I cannot let you uselessly risk your {{reputation}} and your happiness without warning you {{before it is too}} late. My child, <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got it in your head to do is not to be done by you or by anybody. Give it up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>the</b> other <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> just learned," [...] she continued, [...] "has led to as {{erroneous}} deductions as {{the first}} you are little richer in knowledge than you were before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me {{more about}} it," [...] he said, [...] "tell me all about yourself. I feel all these things have passed away, {{all these things are}} to be changed for ever. [...] . You won't be what you have been from this time forth. All <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done--don't matter now. To us, at any rate, they don't matter at all.

60|$|You've money; if you'd manners too you'd shame To boast your {{weakness}} or your baseness name.

6000|$|... "There {{has never}} been a man whose touch has been {{pleasant}} to me;--but I could revel in yours. Kiss you? I could kiss your feet at this moment, and embrace your knees. Everything belonging to you is dear to me. <b>The</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> touched have been made sacred to me.

6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} {{looks like}} that," [...] {{said one of}} the others, gloomily. [...] "Still, you might give us your reasons for counting on <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{matters of}} law your opinion has from our first {{acquaintance}} entirely guided me, and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> assured me I might depend upon as law, have few of them escaped my memory, though I have had but little conversation with you since you first appeared in Parliament and moved the House to resolve, That it is the indispensable duty of the judges of this kingdom to go through their circuits; nor have I had any since you fell sick and was made solicitor-general.|$|E
6000|$|The trader laughed. [...] "There were," [...] he said. [...] "Well, I'm {{willing to}} admit that I have once or twice pitched a nigger who was a trifle impudent over the veranda rails. It's one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do, {{and if you do}} it in one way they don't seem to mind. No doubt they {{understand}} it's only natural the climate and the fever should make you a trifle hasty.

6000|$|... "No, I don't think it's that," [...] {{she said}} dispassionately. [...] "I prefer {{to put it}} down, that part of it, to a {{fundamental}} difference of ideas.
