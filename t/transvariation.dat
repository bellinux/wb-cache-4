40|$|Gini {{inequality}} index decomposition into {{within and}} between inequality components arises since a long time a controversial, wide and interesting discussion. The measurement of inequality between is traditionally obtained {{in the framework of}} analysis of variance as a function of only the means of the subgroups. An alternative methodology to measure inequality between states the possibility to take into account all differences between subgroups distributions. By referring to this new approach, the paper introduces a relevant simplification of the measurement of inequality between and of the <b>transvariation</b> contribution for the case of a population divided in two subgroups. Without <b>transvariation,</b> inequality between can be obtained as the difference of the poor share in the population and the poor share in the variable of interest. Also for the case of two overlapping subgroups simple and straightforward expressions for the <b>transvariation</b> contribution and inequality between are derived...|$|E
40|$|The {{damage and}} the {{recurrence}} of financial crises {{have increased the}} concern of investors and policymakers {{on one hand and}} the interest of macroeconomists on the other. This paper presents an original non parametric methodology, whose aim is to give a very intuitive and rigorous method for variable selection in order to analyse financial crises. <b>Transvariation</b> analysis compares the distributions of two different groups of countries (sound and distressed) with respect to a single macroeconomic variable and selects the indicators {{on the basis of a}} low <b>transvariation</b> probability index. The current account deficit to GDP ratio, differently from other studies on financial crises, seems to be a suitable variable in discriminating distressed countries from sound ones, and the case of Argentina and Turkey confirms this finding...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{understand}} currency crises by selecting the macroeconomic fundamentals with a high predictive power, defining the latter as the variable ability of discriminating between two groups of countries: the sound and the distressed. We consider a sample of over one hundred countries which experienced a currency crash, following Frankel and Rose (1996) and we apply the statistical methodology, <b>transvariation</b> analysis, which measures the amount of overlap between the distributions of the sound and the distressed countries. The result of this methodology is a ranking of the groups of variables who tend to better distinguish the two groups. In order to test the informative power of the selected indicators, we calculate the leave one out predictive error using a <b>transvariation</b> based linear discriminant function. Our results seem to outperform Frankel and Rose (1996) probit analysis...|$|E

ABSTRACT: This document performs profile analysis of income inequalities in Cameroon, between 1996 and 2001. It concerns origin determination and the components of inequalities in Cameroon. The study is structured around the new subgroup decomposition of the Hirschman-Herfindahl index. The economic and empirical pertinence of this indicator holds on its tridecomposition into three components: the within group’s, the between group’s net and the between group’s <b>transvariation.</b> Inequalities are evaluated by grouping and lead to differents interpretations. The selected data for analysis are from the two Cameroonian Surveys to Households ECAM I and ECAM II. The dependent variable (total expenses per head), the independent variables (sex, place of residence and standard of living) and also the method (simulator H-H) have a particular interest in our work. The analyses results indicate that households present a very strong inequality of expenses on considered period. Heterogeneity is very important between groups while, homogeneity is quite considerable within the different groups. The contribution of the <b>transvariation</b> (or overlapping) to the total inequality revealed itself to be incontestable and varies depending on the dependent variable studied. Households directed by women are more victims o...|$|E
40|$|Corrado Gini (1884 - 1964) may be {{considered}} the greatest Italian statistician. We believe that his important contributions to statistics, however mainly limited to the univariate context, may be profitably employed in modern multivariate statistical methods, aimed at overcoming the curse of dimensionality by decomposing multivariate problems {{into a series of}} suitably posed univariate ones. In this paper we critically summarize Gini’s proposals and consider their impact on multivariate statistical methods, both reviewing already well established applications and suggesting new perspectives. Particular attention will be devoted to classification and regression trees, multiple linear regression, linear dimension reduction methods and <b>transvariation</b> based discrimination...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{the changes in}} family assets between 2002 and 2012, and measures {{the changes in the}} degree of inequality using Gini coefficient. Futhermore we try to identify which social groups  (classes) have gained by these changes, using the decomposition procedure of the Gini concentration ratio proposed by Dagum. The results show that the Great Recession has mainly manifested itself as an increase in the concentration of family assets, whch grows much more than income concentration. The dispersion of values of the assets within social groups has increased, {{and at the same time}} so has the <b>transvariation</b> between distributions...|$|E
40|$|Although {{a priori}} company {{screening}} is a constitutive feature of Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) funds, {{it is not}} easy to substantiate that such screening effectively differentiates between companies on the basis of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) calibre. Fundamentally, this is because CSR comprises several dimensions for which an undisputed aggregative model is lacking. We assess the robustness of companies' CSR rankings with respect to several modelling assumptions. We then build on Gini's <b>transvariation</b> concept to select/reject specific companies in the SRI eligible universe of assets. We illustrate our approach with some specific screening issues as confronted by the ethical advisory committee of a large Belgian bank.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to deduce and analyse a new decomposition of the Gini index, and to present and analyse a decomposition of the generalized entropy inequality measure, deducing from the latter the particular cases corresponding to Theil, Hirschman-Herfindahl, and Bourguignon indexes. While the generalized entropy index is decomposed into its two conventional components of the inequality within and between subpopulations, the Gini index is decomposed into the following three components: (I) the Gini index within subpopulations; (II) the Gini index between subpopulations; and (III) the income <b>transvariation</b> between subpopulations. The Gini, Theil, Hirschman-Herfindahl and Bourguignon inequalities are applied to the 1995 italian family income distribution disaggregated by territorial area...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPreviously, we {{introduced}} a distance (similarity) -based mapping for the visualization of high-dimensional patterns and their relative relationships. The mapping preserves exactly the original distances from all points to any two reference patterns {{in a special}} two-dimensional coordinate system, the relative distance plane (RDP). We extend the RDP mapping’s applicability from visualization to classification. Several of the classifiers use the RDP directly. These include the standard linear discriminant analysis (LDA), nearest neighbor classifiers, and a <b>transvariation</b> probabilities-based classification method that is natural in the RDP. Several reference directions can also be combined to create new coordinate systems in which arbitrary classifiers can be developed. We obtain increased confidence in the classification results by cycling through all possible reference pairs and computing a misclassification-based weighted accuracy. The classification results on several high-dimensional biomedical datasets are compared...|$|E
40|$|Gini and {{concentration}} indexes {{are well known}} useful tools in analysing redistribution and re-ranking effects of taxes {{with respect to a}} population of income earners. Aronson, Johnson and Lambert (1994), Urban and Lambert (2008) decompose Gini and re-ranking indices to analyse potential redistribution effects and the unfairness of a tax systems. Urban and Lambert (2008) consider contiguous income groups which are created by dividing the pre-tax income parade according to the same bandwidth. However, earners may be very often split into groups characterized by social and demographic aspects or by other characteristics: in these circumstances groups can easily overlap. In this paper we consider a more general situation that takes into account overlapping among groups; we obtain matrix compact forms for Gini {{and concentration}} indexes, and consequently, for redistribution and re-ranking indexes. In deriving formulae the so called matrix Hadamard product is extensively used. Matrix algebra allows to write indexes aligning incomes in a non decreasing order either with respect to post-tax income or to pre-tax incomes. Moreover, matrix compact formulae allow an original discussion for the signs of the within group, across group, between and <b>transvariation</b> components into which the Atkinson-Plotnick-Kakwany (Plotnick, 1981) re-ranking index can split.
