40|$|International audienceThe {{ability of}} fibrous media to {{mitigate}} sound waves {{is controlled by}} their <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> that are themselves greatly affected by the geometrical characteristics of their microstructure such as porosity, fiber radius, and fiber orientation. Here, the influence of these geometrical characteristics on the anisotropic <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> of random fiber structures is investigated. First, representative elementary volumes (REVs) of random fiber structures are generated for different triplets of porosity, fiber radius and fiber orientation. The fibers are allowed to overlap and are motionless (rigid-frame assumption). The fiber orientation is derived from a second order orientation tensor. Second, the transport equations are numerically solved on the REVs which are seen as periodic unit cells (PUCs). These solutions yield the <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> governing the sound propagation and dissipation in the respective fibrous media.

The fibers that are commonly used in industry, such as 1 % steel, 0. 5 % polypropylene (PP), and 0. 75 % polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers, were evaluated. The addition of PP, PVA, and steel fibers, as they have been known, had little or no effect on compressive and tensile strengths but significantly affected postcracking behaviors and the critical transport mechanisms. The change of the permeable pores seems to depend on the material property of fibers between the fiber and the matrix interface. Among the fiber types used in this study, hook end steel fibers showed the best performance for both the mechanical and <b>transport</b> <b>properties.</b> Generally, as the permeable pore spaces increased, the strength as well as the resistance of <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> also decreased.

40|$|The <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> of {{concrete}} are important parameters governing {{the durability of}} reinforced concrete structures. As the opening of cracks can significantly degrade the <b>transport</b> <b>properties,</b> the crack control ability of materials is also important for maintaining high durability under practical situations. This study focuses on the water permeability and chloride diffusivity of pseudo-ductile cementitious composites (PDCC), which exhibits strain-hardening behavior in tension accompanied by the formation of closely spaced cracks with very small opening., Concrete structures with a surface layer of PDCC can potentially exhibit excellent durability. However, former work related {{to the design of}} PDCC has focused on the achievement of pseudo-ductility, so good <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> at the un-cracked state are not guaranteed. In this investigation, water permeability and chloride diffusivity tests are carried out together with direct tensile test on a number of PDCC compositions. The effect of various mix design parameters (including pozzolan/cement ratio, pozzolan type, sand/binder ratio, percentage of rubber particles and dosage of pore blocking admixture) on both the pseudo-ductility and the <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> can hence be studied. From the results, we have identified PDCC compositions with (i) tensile ductility over 0. 9 % and excellent control of crack opening, and (ii) <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> similar to high performance concrete. The findings pave the way for optimizing PDCC mix design for both mechanical performance and long-term durability. As part of our study, the <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> of cracked PDCC specimens are also measured. The PDCC has good crack width control capability and a large number of fine cracks instead of a single main crack are formed under tensile loading. With <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> measured from both cracked and un-cracked specimens, the effect of cracking can be quantified. The results show that the crack width is the key factor that affects the <b>transport</b> <b>properties,</b> as a tiny increase of the crack width can lead to a large increase of transport through the crack. For the same deformation, the crack opening in PDCC is much less than that in normal concrete, so the change in <b>transport</b> <b>properties</b> is also much smaller. According to {{the results of the present}} investigation, PDCC has a high potential for practical application as a surface layer or permanent formwork for the construction of durable concrete structures...|$|R
