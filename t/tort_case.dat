25|$|Tort law is {{different}} from criminal law in that: (1) torts may result from negligent as well as intentional or criminal actions and (2) tort lawsuits have a lower burden of proof such as preponderance of evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. Sometimes a plaintiff may prevail in a <b>tort</b> <b>case</b> even if the person who allegedly caused harm was acquitted in an earlier criminal trial. For example, O. J. Simpson was acquitted in criminal court of murder but later found liable for the tort of wrongful death.|$|E

25|$|Almost all {{civil work}} is {{dealt with by}} either the High Court or County Courts. Prior to the Act, there was a simple {{financial}} boundary to decide which cases would go to which court—any contract or <b>tort</b> <b>case</b> valued at less than £5,000 {{would go to the}} County Courts, while any case valued at more than that would go straight to the High Court. Section 1 of the Act allows the Lord Chancellor to change the financial boundaries after consultation with senior judges such as the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls, and also allows the Lord Chancellor to create categories based on things other than the financial value of the case, such as the complexity involved or the importance of any legal question likely to be raised. An exception to this rule is that the Lord Chancellor cannot ask a County Court to hear any case of judicial review.|$|E
500|$|The {{bottom line}} is that {{withdrawing}} the Krayoxx Case would cause Finley & Figg to be sued for both defense costs and malpractice, which would completely ruin the small firm. There is no choice for Finley & Figg but to give up their motion to withdraw the <b>tort</b> <b>case</b> and prepare to go through the motions of a [...] jury trial which they have absolutely no chance of winning. Moreover, going through the motions is quite expensive: in order to present any kind of case they must bring experts to testify against Krayoxx and even disreputable experts, the only ones who can be found charge fees {{in the tens of thousands}} of dollars.|$|E

EWCA Civ 5 (15 June 1964) |publisher=BAILII|accessdate=6 May 2009}} Mrs Letang, on holiday in Cornwall, decided {{to lie down}} and rest in grass outside a hotel. Cooper drove into the hotel car park and, not seeing Letang, ran over her legs. More than {{three years after the}} events, Letang brought a <b>tort</b> <b>case</b> against Cooper, claiming damages for her injuries. The standard tort for personal injuries is that of negligence, which has a three-year statute of limitations, and Letang instead claimed damages under the tort of Trespass to the Person. In his judgment, Denning stated that the tort of Trespass could only be used if the injury was inflicted intentionally; if it was unintentionally, only negligence could be used.|$|E

Oscar shoots him and adds an unnecessary debilitating shot that shatteres his leg. He is sued for using excessive force.|$|E

40|$|After {{establishing}} {{the importance of}} knowledge of settlement rates, this article first shows that different research questions can yield different settlement rates. Using data gathered from about 3, 300 federal cases in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (EDPA) and the Northern District of Georgia (NDGA), differing measures of settlement emerge depending on whether one is interested in (1) settlement {{as a proxy for}} plaintiffs’ litigation success, or (2) settlement as a measure of litigated disputes resolved without final adjudication. Using settlement as a proxy for plaintiff success, we estimate the aggregate settlement rate across case categories in the two districts to have been 66. 9 percent in 2001 – 2002. Regardless of the method of computing settlement rates, no reasonable estimate of settlement rates supports an aggregate rate of over 90 percent of filed cases, despite frequent references to 90 percent or higher settlement rates. The aggregate rate for the EDPA alone was 71. 6 percent and for the NDGA alone was 57. 8 percent, suggesting significant interdistrict variation, which persists even within case categories. We report separate settlement rates for employment discrimination, constitutional tort, contract, and <b>tort</b> <b>cases</b> in the two districts. The highest settlement rate was 87. 2 percent for <b>tort</b> <b>cases</b> in the EDPA and the lowest was 27. 3 percent for constitutional <b>tort</b> <b>cases</b> in the NDGA. Our results suggest a hierarchy of settlement rates. Of major <b>case</b> categories, <b>tort</b> <b>cases</b> tend to have the highest settlement rates, then contract cases, then employment discrimination cases, followed by constitutional <b>tort</b> <b>cases.</b> Attorney fee structure {{and the nature of the}} parties may explain settlement rate variation. Our findings provide no evidence of a material change in aggregate settlement rates over time...|$|R
