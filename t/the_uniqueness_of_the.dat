5|$|If {{dropping}} {{the requirement for}} <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, {{but they can be}} completed to more than one solution grid. Removal of any clue increases the number of the completions and from this perspective none of the 41 clues is redundant. With slightly more than half the grid filled with givens (41 of 81 cells), <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution constraint still dominates over the minimality constraint.|$|E
5|$|Two {{important}} {{consequences of}} the group axioms are <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identity element and the uniqueness of inverse elements.

5|$|Large-scale {{limestone}} quarrying {{has been}} a particular area of contention. Most of the mineral extraction licences were issued by national government for 90 years in the 1950s, and remain legally binding.

5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body. The terminology used describes this motion according to its direction relative to the anatomical position of the joints.

5|$|The {{fortress}} contained barracks, granaries, headquarters, military baths, and {{an unusual}} elliptical building which {{had it been}} finished may have been intended to act as the governor of Britain's headquarters. Several factors including <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elliptical building, the method of construction, and the unusual size of the fortress– 20% larger than other Roman fortresses in Britain– suggest {{that it may have}} been intended as the base for a potential invasion of Ireland, and perhaps eventually to become the capital of the unified British Isles under Rome.|$|E
5|$|Cantor's {{theory of}} transfinite numbers was {{originally}} regarded as so counter-intuitive – even shocking – that it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L. E. J. Brouwer, while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections. Cantor, a devout Lutheran, believed the theory had been communicated {{to him by}} God. Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's work {{as a challenge to}} <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> absolute infinity in the nature of God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected.|$|E

25|$|During the Meiji {{restoration}} the Nihonjinron philosophy took prevalence. It emphasizes <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese.

25|$|In the 4th century, this {{uniqueness}} of the circumstances related to the Nativity of Jesus, and their interplay with {{the mystery of the}} incarnation became a central element in both the theology and hymnody of Saint Ephrem the Syrian.

25|$|This {{can be used}} to show <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jordan form. Let J1 and J2 be two Jordan normal {{forms of}} A.

The procedure outlined in the previous paragraph {{can be used to}} determine the structure of these matrices. Since the rank of a matrix is preserved by similarity transformation, there is a bijection between the Jordan blocks of J1 and J2. This proves the uniqueness part of the statement.|$|E
25|$|The {{process for}} {{choosing}} which images the museum acquires is simple {{but can be}} contentious. Potential acquisitions are vigorously and informally discussed at length by researchers, historians, and the curatorial departments. Some of the criteria used {{in the decision-making process}} are: The number of existing portraits of the individual already in the collection, the quality of the potential portrait, <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential portrait, the reputation of the portrait's author, and the cost of the portrait. Formal decisions to acquire a portrait are made at monthly curatorial meetings, then ratified by the National Portrait Gallery Commission.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, as {{a result}} of the war and the lessons that were learned about the {{potential}} of airpower in the region, following the war, the Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Hugh Trenchard, proposed controlling the frontier by air power alone. This plan had proved highly successful in Mesopotamia, Aden and the Transjordan, however, due to <b>the</b> <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North-West Frontier and also due to inter-service politics the plan was not accepted until later. In 1937, it was eventually decided that should another war break out with Afghanistan, or in the event of a major tribal uprising, the RAF would take the offensive, while the ground forces would act defensively.|$|E
