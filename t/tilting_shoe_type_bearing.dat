40|$|Purpose: To {{observe the}} {{relative}} change in foot-strike pattern, pressure characteristics, surface electromyography (sEMG) recordings, and stride characteristics in forefoot strike runners wearing both minimalist and traditional shoes during a 50 -km run. Methods: Four experienced minimalist runners {{were enrolled in}} this study. Each runner ran a 50 -km simulated run in both minimalist shoes and traditional shoes. Pressure data, sEMG recordings, and limited 3 D motion capture data were collected during the initial 0. 8  km and final 0. 8  km for each trial. Results: Three runners in the traditional <b>shoe</b> <b>type</b> condition and one runner in the minimalist <b>shoe</b> <b>type</b> condition demonstrated a more posterior initial contact area (midfoot strike (MFS) pattern) after the 50 -km run, which was supported by increased activity of the tibialis anterior in the pre-contact phase (as per root mean square (RMS) values). In addition, in both pre- and post-run conditions, there were increased peak pressures in the minimalist <b>shoe</b> <b>type,</b> specifically in the medial forefoot. Muscle fatigue as defined by a decreased median frequency observed in isometric, constant force contractions did not correspond with our hypothesis {{in relation to the}} observed foot strike change pattern. Finally, step rate increased and step length decreased after the 50 -km run in both <b>shoe</b> <b>type</b> conditions. Conclusion: More runners adopted a more posterior initial contact area after the 50 -km run in the traditional <b>shoe</b> <b>type</b> than in the minimalist <b>shoe</b> <b>type.</b> The runners who adopted a more posterior initial contact area were more closely associated with an increased median frequency of the medial gastrocnemius, which suggests there may be a change in motor unit recruitment pattern during long-distance, sustained velocity running. The increased peak pressures observed in the medial forefoot in the minimalist <b>shoe</b> <b>type</b> may predispose to metatarsal stress fractures in the setting of improper training...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Kinesiology: Exercise Science, 2014 Runners {{have been}} shown to {{experience}} a high rate of injury. Research suggests excessive rearfoot eversion may be implicated. The current model of running shoe prescription follows that runners are provided a <b>shoe</b> <b>type</b> with the proper level of stability based on their rearfoot posture. Distance runners were measured for static rearfoot posture. Also, subjects reported the number of injuries sustained in the last year and the associated shoe brand and model of shoe. Four groups were constructed from the subjects??? foot posture and <b>shoe</b> <b>type.</b> A 2 -way factorial ANOVA was used to determine differences between groups on the rate of injury. Mean injury rates were also compared between subjects with a matched foot posture-shoe type combination and those with a non-matched combination. Statistically significant main effects were not observed for foot posture, <b>shoe</b> <b>type,</b> or foot posture across <b>shoe</b> <b>type.</b> Differences in injury rate were not observed between matched and non-matched subjects. The lack of statistical significance may be attributed to the influence of other training, anatomical, and biomechanical variables. In conclusion, shoe prescription based on rearfoot posture does not appear to prevent the development of injury in distance runners...|$|R

[Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the effects of {{different}} <b>shoe</b> <b>types</b> on lower extrem-ity muscle activity in healthy young women by using electromyography. [Subjects and Methods] Fifteen healthy young women in their 20 s were included in this single-group repeated measures study. The subjects were divided into three groups: Converse sneakers, rain boots, and combat boots. The subjects walked on a treadmill at 4 km/h for 30 min, during which six muscles were examined using electromyography: the rectus femoris, vastus medialis, semimembranosus, tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and medial head of the gastrocnemius. Between switching <b>shoe</b> <b>types,</b> a 24 -h rest period was instated to prevent the fatigue effect from treadmill walking. [Results] One-way analysis of variance used to compare electromyography results among the three groups showed that the main effect of group differed significantly for the vastus medialis. Vastus medialis activity was higher in the rain boots group than the Converse sneakers group, and it was higher in the combat boots group than rain boots group.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to test if there is a {{significant}} change in the foot loading in a shoe with an unstable construction to flat soled shoes. Measurements were performed in a group of ten healthy women. Interaction between the sole and the insole was observed when using PEDAR-x system. Measurements were carried out on the treadmill (velocity: 5 and 7 km h- 1, inclination: 0 and 10 %). Measured variables were: peak pressure, maximum force in the vertical direction, maximum force in the vertical direction in the area below the heel bone, stride and stance. Peak pressure in unstable shoes is smaller in comparison to normal shoes. For maximal vertical force the dependence on both the speed and on the slope was found to be positive and significant. No significant dependence on the <b>shoe</b> <b>type</b> was proven. Maximal vertical force under the heel was detected as strongly statistically dependent on the velocity; the dependence on the slope and <b>shoe</b> <b>type</b> was significant (negative) too. Stride and stance duration are dependent on the <b>shoe</b> <b>type.</b> No significant dependence on the slope was proven.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that running shoe {{architecture}} may {{play a major role}} in lower extremity injury prevention (Wiegerinck, et al). It has been hypothesized that shoes with added support are more effective at preventing injury, due to the greater force dampening effect that the increased stability provides. Initial studies tested this hypothesis by measuring the in-shoe force data in the heel region of two running <b>shoe</b> <b>types</b> from two different companies. The two running <b>shoe</b> <b>types</b> were classified as flexible and stability where the flexible shoes provided a lower level of support than the stability shoes. The recorded walking trials yielded consistent results supporting the hypothesis; increased stability acts as a dampener in the heel region. This current study expands upon the previous work by gathering data from additional subjects and including the effects of impact forces on the mid-foot region during the gait cycle. Ten subjects walked in the two <b>shoe</b> <b>types</b> from each of the two companies using a treadmill to dictate a constant walking speed across all of the subjects. Impact forces were recording utilizing a Tekscan Fscan in-shoe pressure mapping system. The data was filtered and grouped to isolate the heel and midfoot regions throughout 25 gait cycles per shoe per subject. Of the ten subjects recorded, eight subjects displayed a statistically significant reduction in peak forces from the flexible shoes to the stability shoes across both regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{difference}} in plantar loading between two different running <b>shoe</b> <b>types.</b> We hypothesized that a higher maximum force, peak pressure, and contact area would exist beneath the entire foot while running in a racing flat when compared to a training shoe. 37 athletes (17 male and 20 female) were recruited for this study. Subjects had no history of lower extremity injuries in the past six months, no history of foot or ankle surgery within the past 3 years, and no history of metatarsal stress fractures. Subjects had to be physically active and run at least 10 miles per week. Each subject ran on a 10 m runway 7 times wearing two different running <b>shoe</b> <b>types,</b> the Nike Air Pegasus (training shoe) and the Nike Air Zoom Katana IV (racing flat). A Pedar-X in-shoe pressure measurement system sampling at 50 Hz was used to collect plantar pressure data. Peak pressure, maximum force, and contact area beneath eight different anatomical regions of the foot as well as beneath the total foot were obtained. The results of this study demonstrated a significant difference between training shoes and racing flats in terms of peak pressure, maximum force, and contact area. The significant differences measured between the two shoes can be of importance when examining the influence of <b>shoe</b> <b>type</b> on the occurrence of stress fractures in runners.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain a {{fundamental}} understanding of how running shoe midsole foam thickness contributes to footwear degradation using the heel and forefoot regions of traditional (TS) and minimalist (MS) running shoes. We hypothesized that ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) foam midsole material properties and footwear degradation performance under a biofidelic mechanical ageing protocol would differ as a function of <b>shoe</b> <b>type</b> and thickness. Attenuated totalreflectance Fourier transform infrared spectra indicated that the foam chemical compositions were similar and confirmed that all midsoles were composed of EVA copolymer. Differences in density and cell size were detected between shoes and thicknesses. MS foam was uniformly high density (rMS D 240 kg/m 3), while TS foam consisted of two co-molded layers with forefoot density (rTS-FF D 250 kg/m 3) greater than heel (rTS-H D 160 kg/m 3). Relative density and cell size values were generally proportional and inversely proportional to density, respectively. Degradation from mechanical ageing was greatest in the first 2 km of ageing, with the full ageing (21 km) resulting in an average 54 % loss of energy absorption. Regardless of <b>shoe</b> <b>type</b> or foam microstructure, thicker and softer heel foams absorbed 83 % more energy but degraded ata 49 % faster rate. The fact that the heel degraded more rapidly than forefoot caused the drop to decrease at an equivalent rate for both <b>shoe</b> <b>types.</b> Overall, thickness was a greater predictor of average performance than microstructure variables for the present footwear conditions. However, the apparent drawback of thicker foam was exemplified by heel samples, which underwent a 1. 4 mm greater loss of thickness and lost 550 mJ more energy absorption than forefoot samples...|$|R

Surprisingly, neither group showed lower working memory performance when walking than when sitting, irrespective of <b>shoe</b> <b>type.</b> However, high-heel experts adapted walking regularity more flexibly to <b>shoe</b> <b>type</b> and cognitive load than novices, {{by reducing the}} variability {{of time spent in}} the single-support phase of the gait cycle in high heels when cognitively challenged.
