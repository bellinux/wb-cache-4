25|$|Retirement {{oriented}} taxes, such as Social Security {{or national}} insurance, also are a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> tax, though not generally {{referred to as}} such.

25|$|Personal {{income tax}} is often {{collected}} on a pay-as-you-earn basis, with small corrections made {{soon after the}} end of the tax year. These corrections take one of two forms: payments to the government, for taxpayers who have not paid enough during the tax year; and tax refunds from the government for those who have overpaid. Income tax systems will often have deductions available that lessen the total tax liability by reducing total taxable income. They may allow losses from one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> to be counted against another. For example, a loss on the stock market may be deducted against taxes paid on wages. Other tax systems may isolate the loss, such that business losses can only be deducted against business tax by carrying forward the loss to later tax years.|$|E

2500|$|Proudhon {{originated}} mutualism, an anarchist {{school of}} thought, envisioning {{a society where}} each person might possess a means of production, either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market. Integral to the scheme was {{the establishment of a}} mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at an interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration. Mutualism is based on a labor theory of value which holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying [...] "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility". Some mutualists believe that if the state did not intervene, as a result of increased competition in the marketplace, individuals would receive no more income than that in proportion to the amount of labor they exert. Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving income through loans, investments, and rent, as they believe these individuals are not laboring. Some of them argue that if state intervention ceased, these types of incomes would disappear due to increased competition in capital. Though Proudhon opposed this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>income,</b> he expressed: [...] "... I never meant to ... forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I believe that all these forms of human activity should remain free and optional for all." ...|$|E
