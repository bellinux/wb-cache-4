5|$|North from Nethermost Pike is the {{depression}} of Swallow Scarth, above {{the head of}} Nethermost Cove. From here the ridge climbs again, turning to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>as</b> the long plateau of Helvellyn top is reached. Southwards the ridge steps down over High Crag, and narrows as it swings east around Ruthwaite Cove to Dollywaggon Pike. A heavily eroded path runs along the ridge, but actually bypasses the top of Nethermost Pike to <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>as</b> it leads to Helvellyn.|$|E
5|$|Subduction, having ceased at the {{existing}} zone, eventually reinitiated further to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>as</b> the current Cascadia subduction zone. Volcanism {{from the new}} subduction zone (such as the Grays River Volcanics and Northcraft Volcanics) reached the surface about 42 Ma, thereby initiating {{the rise of the}} ancestral Cascade Range.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm developed on November23 about 460mi (740km) northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles. It moved northeastward, strengthening to peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) on November24. It later turned sharply to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>as</b> it began a weakening trend, {{followed by a}} curve to the north. The cyclone dissipated on November26 about 450mi (725km) east-northeast of Bermuda, without ever affecting land.|$|E
5|$|After 1970, as Fort Lauderdale became {{essentially}} built out, {{growth in}} the area shifted to suburbs to <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> <b>As</b> cities such as Coral Springs, Miramar, and Pembroke Pines experienced explosive growth, Fort Lauderdale's population stagnated, and the city actually shrank by almost 4,000 people between 1980, when the city had 153,279 people, and 1990, when the population was 149,377. A slight rebound brought the population back up to 152,397 at the 2000 census. Since 2000, Fort Lauderdale has gained slightly over 18,000 residents through annexation of seven neighborhoods in unincorporated Broward County.|$|E

In his subsequent confessions to police, Fred would refer to Mott as [...] "the girl from Newent".|$|R
5|$|Despite the debacle, Reshef {{remained}} {{determined to}} seize the junction, giving the task to the division's reconnaissance battalion attached to his brigade. To achieve surprise, the battalion maneuvered to attack at 3:00 AM from <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>as</b> the Egyptians were preparing for further attacks {{from the south and}} east. As the Israelis attacked, Lieutenant Colonel Brom was killed barely thirty meters from Egyptian positions, disrupting his battalion's assault. The Israelis sustained losses, but managed to retreat. Soon after, a tank company attacked the crossroads at 4:00 AM on October 16, but also withdrew after losing three tanks.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} 1750–1761, British {{defeated}} the French East India company in India, and by 1793 they were firmly established in Bengal {{in the east}} and Madras in the south.

5|$|For the North Vietnamese, the Route 9 – Southern Laos Victory, {{was viewed}} as a {{complete}} success. The military expansion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail to the west which had begun in 1970 at the expense of Laotian forces, was quickly accelerated. Laotian troops were soon withdrawing toward the Mekong River and a logistical artery 60 miles in width was soon expanded to 90 miles. Another result of the operation was a firm decision by the Politburo to launch a major conventional invasion of South Vietnam in early 1972, paving the way for the Nguyễn Huệ Offensive, known in <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>as</b> the Easter Offensive.|$|E

5|$|Historians see {{the growing}} Roman {{influence}} over the east, as with <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>as</b> {{not a matter of}} intentional empire-building, but constant crisis management narrowly focused on short-term goals within a highly unstable, unpredictable, and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies. With some major exceptions of outright military rule, the Roman Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms (with varying degrees of independence, both de jure and de facto) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire. It was not until the time of the Roman Empire that the entire Roman world was organized into provinces under explicit Roman control.|$|E
5|$|In early September, a trough was {{identified}} {{along the western}} coast of Africa. Moving towards <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of a}} strong Azores High, the disturbance passed over Cape Verde on September2. Observations from weather stations evidenced cyclonic rotation in the region. An airplane belonging to Panair do Brasil passed within the vicinity of the vorticity and as a result reported the formation of a tropical storm. In HURDAT—the official database listing all known Atlantic tropical cyclones since 1851—the system was listed to have reached tropical depression intensity at 0600 UTC that day.|$|E
5|$|Marcinkus was posthumously {{mentioned}} in despatches in the 1944 King's Birthday Honours, he also received the 1939–45 Star, the Air Crew Europe Star, and the War Medal 1939–1945. British authorities attempted to contact his relatives in Lithuania, but Lithuania—as a Soviet Socialist Republic— {{was behind the}} Iron Curtain, and they were advised to stop these attempts since his relatives might suffer negative consequences. At the time Soviet authorities saw those people who maintained contacts with <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>as</b> untrustworthy.|$|E

5|$|Recent evidence,shows that bloomeries {{were used}} in China, {{migrating}} in from <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>as</b> early as 800 BC, before being supplanted by the locally developed blast furnace. Supporting this theory was the discovery of 'more than ten' iron digging implements found in the tomb of Duke Jing of Qin (d. 537 BCE), whose tomb is located in Fengxiang County, Shaanxi (a museum exists on the site today).|$|E
5|$|Shanghai's first {{building}} boom {{occurred in the}} 1920s and 1930s, during the city's heyday as a multinational center of business and finance. The city's international concessions permitted foreign investment, and with it came architectural styles from <b>the</b> <b>West,</b> <b>as</b> seen today {{in areas such as}} the French Concession and the Bund. After the Communist takeover in 1949 the city's development was stifled, punished for its earlier capitalist excesses. After economic reforms beginning in the 1980s, the city is undergoing its second construction boom to fulfill its desire to regain its status as an important global financial center.|$|E

5|$|The concept {{work for}} Muramasa began {{during the middle}} of {{development}} on Odin Sphere. Along with improving on the action gameplay over Odin Sphere, a great deal of effort was put into making the game's setting authentic to the period. Kamitani created the story based on kabuki theatre, incorporating Japanese folklore and Buddhist theology. When the game released in the West, it retained its Japanese voicetrack to preserve its atmosphere. It released to moderate sales and positive reviews. The Vita port, released in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>as</b> Muramasa Rebirth, released to strong sales and similar reception to its original version.|$|E
5|$|The federal government's {{strategy}} {{in both the}} West Triangle and Western China in general is to provide large amounts of monetary investment {{in order to provide}} an industrial and infrastructure base, which would then attract foreign investment.

Over RMB 1 trillion has been spent on <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>as</b> a whole.|$|E
5|$|The prime {{motivation}} behind Magnús' {{cooperation with}} Ælfgar is uncertain.

In so doing, Magnús may have backed the cause of a local faction that opposed Echmarcach. Certainly, the thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann records that Ímar's apparent son, Gofraid Crobán (died 1095)a future ruler of Dublin and the Islesbacked the Norwegian invasion of England led by Magnús' father in 1066.|$|E
