This movement, although not authorized by me, has assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty, as the executive of this Sate, to interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the State and the Federal troops under your command. I therefore demand in the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the Arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the State authorities, to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next.|$|E

500|$|As his {{plantation}} {{became more}} productive, Breckinridge {{became interested in}} ways to sell his excess goods. On August 26, 1793, he became a charter member of the Democratic Society of Kentucky, which lobbied {{the federal government to}} secure unrestricted use of the Mississippi River from Spain. Breckinridge was elected chairman, Robert Todd and John Bradford were chosen as vice-chairmen, and Thomas Todd and Thomas Bodley were elected as clerks. Breckinridge authored a tract entitled Remonstrance of the Citizens West of the Mountains to the President and Congress of the United States and may have also written To the Inhabitants of the United States West of the Allegany (sic) and Apalachian (sic) Mountains. He pledged funding to French minister Edmond-Charles Genêt's proposed military operation against Spain, but Genêt was recalled before it could be executed. Although alarmed that frontier settlers might initiate war with Spain, President George Washington made no immediate attempt to obtain use of the Mississippi, which the society maintained was [...] "the natural right of <b>the</b> <b>citizens</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> Commonwealth". The resistance of the eastern states, particularly Federalist politicians, caused Breckinridge to reconsider his support of a strong central government.|$|E
500|$|.....a {{great number}} of citizens, {{in various parts of}} the United States, are preparing, and many have {{actually}} emigrated to this Territory, to get free from a Government which does tolerate slavery ... And although it is contended by some, that, at this day, there is a great majority in favor of slavery, whilst the opposite opinion is held by others, the fact is certainly doubtful. But when we take into consideration the vast emigration into this Territory, and of citizens, too, decidedly opposed to the measure, we feel satisfied that, at all events, Congress will suspend any legislative act on this subject until we shall, by the constitution, be admitted into the Union, and have a right to adopt such a constitution, in this respect, as may comport with the wishes of a majority of the citizens.... The toleration of slavery is either right or wrong; and if Congress should think, with us, that it is wrong, that it is inconsistent with the principles upon which our future constitution is to be formed, your memorialists will rest satisfied that, at least, this subject will not be by them taken up until the constitutional number of <b>the</b> <b>citizens</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> Territory shall assume that right.|$|E
500|$|In Harpole's third term, councilmembers {{expressed}} {{the need to}} improve relationships between each other. On June 6, 2016, Harpole expressed concern about controversial Facebook posts, which contained ethnic and sexual slurs, by Sandra McCartt. She was a candidate to fill Harpole's former seat on the city council after his successor, Brian Eades, announced his resignation. The next day, Harpole walked out of a City Council executive session, accusing a councilmember of leaking the rankings of candidates to fill the position. He also alleged that councilmembers chastised him for changing the process for selecting Eades' replacement when he suggested bypassing the scheduled questioning of McCartt by the council, and ending her candidacy. Councilman Randy Burkett then admonished Harpole for publicly criticizing McCartt. Councilman Elisha Demerson said Harpole [...] "owes it to <b>the</b> <b>citizens</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> community to be present", while Councilman Mark Nair criticized the mayor for not letting the selection process play out. Harpole defended himself, saying, [...] "I am not going to be ruled by the process. I am ruled by my constituents". In November 2016, Interim City Manager Terry Childers called the city's politics [...] "toxic" [...] and [...] "frustrating". These remarks followed his resignation after being caught denigrating a citizen speaker on a hot mic that month, and berating 911 dispatchers in February.|$|E

In October 2014, the ANU Council announced that it would divest from seven companies, two of which, Santos and Oil Search, performed poorly in an independent review undertaken by the Centre for Australian Ethical Research.

These attacks, which The Canberra Times editorial described as [...] "verging on hysterical" [...] was joined by members of the cabinet of the Abbott Government, with the Treasurer Joe Hockey stating that the ANU Council is [...] "removed from the reality of what is helping to drive the Australian economy and create more employment," [...] Education Minister Christopher Pyne calling it [...] "bizarre" [...] and Prime Minister Tony Abbott calling it [...] "stupid."
