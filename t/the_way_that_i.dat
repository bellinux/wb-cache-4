500|$|In retrospect, Swift {{has stated}} that the song was {{something}} typical of her to say in her teenage years and that it exemplified how she processed emotion at the time, adding [...] "I didn't know anything then." [...] She explained, [...] "I had this song called 'Picture to Burn,' that's talking about how 'I hate your truck,' and 'I hate that you ignored me,' 'I hate you.' Now, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would say that and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would feel that kind of pain is a lot different." [...] Despite her evolving {{on a personal level}} and as a songwriter, she claimed not to be regretful of [...] "Picture to Burn", rather happy she was able to demonstrate [...] "those emotions that when you're so angry, you hate everything. It's like recording your diary over the years, and that's a gift", she said.|$|E
500|$|In 1976, at age 16 and as {{a member}} of the Melbourne punk rock band Young Charlatans, Howard wrote [...] "Shivers". Discussing the song's origins, Howard said that [...] "Shivers" [...] was [...] "intended as an ironic comment on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt that people I knew were making hysterical things out of what were {{essentially}} high school crushes". He further explained that the emotional responses of people he knew who were in relationships seemed [...] "incredibly insincere and blown out of proportion" [...] and inspired the cynical lyrics of the song.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The New York Times, Sarsgaard stated that he followed Catholicism, saying: [...] "I like the death-cult aspect of Catholicism. Every religion is interested in death, but Catholicism takes it to a particularly high level. [...] Seriously, in Catholicism, you're supposed to love your enemy. That really impressed me as a kid, and it has helped me as an actor. [...] <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> view the characters I play is part of my religious upbringing. To abandon curiosity in all personalities, good or bad, is to give up hope in humanity." ...|$|E

500|$|So {{this song}} is about me {{basically}} saying that just because {{all of those things}} are there [...] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath. And then, also that these veils, they are really just protecting me from the thing that I held the most sacred, which is my creativity ... My Aura is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> deal with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.|$|E
500|$|Often {{described}} by the media as [...] "America's Sweetheart", Swift insists that [...] "I don't live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel like, and {{that makes me feel}} very free". She refuses to take part in overly sexualized photo-shoots, although Bloomberg L.P. views her as a sex symbol. Swift was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011. In 2014 she topped People annual best dressed list. In 2015, she was named Woman of the Year at the Elle Style Awards, and ranked first in Maxim Hot 100 list.|$|E
500|$|Bartley recounts {{a revelation}} that Erhard {{said he had}} {{experienced}} in March 1971 while driving into San Francisco, California to work at Grolier Society. Erhard described to Bartley what the revelation experience felt like: [...] "What happened had no form. It was timeless, unbounded, ineffable, beyond language." [...] He told Bartley that he realized: [...] "I had to 'clean up' my life. I had to acknowledge and correct the lies in my life. I saw that the lies that I told about others — my wanting my family, or Ellen (his second wife), or anyone else, {{to be different from}} the way that they are -- came from lies that I told about myself -- my wanting to be different from <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was." ...|$|E

500|$|Monáe {{has said}} about the {{recording}} sessions [...] "Over {{the last year and}} a half when we were recording the ArchAndroid I went through a very transformative period in my life". Monáe completed the album in Atlanta at the Wondaland Studios and the famous asylum The Palace of the Dogs. Monáe has stated that the album signifies [...] "breaking the chains that enslave minorities of all types". She has said of recording the album, [...] "Overall, this music came from various corners of the world—from Turkey to Prague to Atlanta—places we were on tour. While recording, we’d experiment with different sounds. Once we became engulfed in the sound, we all had an emotional connection to the album. It has definitely transformed my way of thinking, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> approach the stage and overall, my life".|$|E
500|$|... "That song -- {{the last}} one I wrote for the record -- is {{definitely}} the most representative of me now, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel. If we're talking about the 'new me,' that's it and why it's {{at the end of}} the record. You have to go through those things and make the changes you have to make and be there and go, 'Okay, I did it.' It doesn't come that easy. [...] I just didn't hold back this time, and writing that way has made me feel really purified, like I've actually gotten a chance to break through instead of just wallowing in all of my problems. It's not about all the times that I've been afraid and tormented and sad, it's about looking at those situations and stomping them out. It feels really good to sing these songs now." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{described}} the recording process as challenging {{because she was}} provided with little visual aid, explaining, [...] "All I had to work off were a few sketches ... {{but it was also}} fun because it allows you to go into the depths of your imagination." [...] She also revealed that creating Rapunzel's voice was simply a process of [...] "let go". Moore was often required to re-record a single line a total of four times before the directors finally heard a version with which they were satisfied. After watching the completed film for the first time, Moore was disappointed with her own performance because she felt that her voice sounded [...] "shrill". According to composer Alan Menken, Moore's musical background made her [...] "a delight to work with". Moore found the practice of performing in character challenging in comparison to recording her own original music, explaining, [...] "I can't just be like Mandy and sing something <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want to necessarily, because you know, you sort of have to stick to certain guidelines." [...] She found recording [...] "When Will My Life Begin" [...] particularly difficult due to the speed at which she had to say certain words, and cites both Menken and discovering Rapunzel herself as a character with guiding her through the process.|$|E

[...] Haley, who was in Conway to talk about hurricane safety, emphasized that the incidents do not reflect the state as a whole. The previous day, Atlantic Beach Mayor Jake Evans said the event would not be cancelled; he pointed out that the vast majority of bikers are good people. Chief Warren Gall of the Myrtle Beach Police Department, however, believed the shooting was related to the rally.|$|E
2500|$|The band's {{influences}} include Social Distortion, Wu-Tang Clan, Fugees, Faith No More, Queen, and Led Zeppelin. Jacoby Shaddix acknowledges Faith No More {{and their}} vocalist Mike Patton {{as a major}} influence, stating [...] "Mike Patton {{is one of my}} favorite singers. Faith No More, one of my favorite bands of all time. Very inspiring to me. I fell in love with that band at a very young age, and I saw them a few times growing up. I was bummed out when they parted ways , but they're doing shows again, which is awesome. As far as influence, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> sing, I definitely was inspired by Mike Patton, but lyrically, I approach my songs very differently than Mike Patton does. He comes from a place of a bit more sarcasm... a lot more sarcasm. Whereas I come from that heart and soul kind of place." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} has been raised whether the ancient view of this command prohibits images of Yahweh. Some scholars have proposed that the golden calf made by Aaron (while Moses was on the mountain receiving the Ten Commandments) was supposed to represent Yahweh, or perhaps a throne or steed on which the people were to envision Yahweh. According to Exodus 32:7-8, in a divine speech to Moses, Yahweh reveals the events {{going on at the}} base of Mt. Sinai to Moses, judging the golden calf to be a violation of the recently revealed law: [...] "They have turned aside quickly from <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> commanded them". Others point out that the golden calf episode leads to the breaking of the tablets of the Decalogue, something that implies that the covenant had been violated. This event and the plurality of the language used in the second commandment leads many scholars to conclude that it prohibits the making of any image of Yahweh as well as any image of a created thing to which divinity would be ascribed.|$|E
2500|$|Cradle of Filth's {{particular}} genre {{has provoked}} {{a great deal}} of discussion, and their status as a black metal band or otherwise has been in debate since near the time that the group rose to fame. The band have openly cited first wave black metal acts such as Bathory, Celtic Frost and Mercyful Fate among their influences, but Dani Filth, in a 1998 interview for BBC Radio 5 for example, said [...] "I use the term 'heavy metal', rather than 'black metal', because I think that's a bit of a fad now. Call it what you like: death metal, black metal, any kind of metal...". Gavin Baddeley's 2006 Terrorizer interview states that [...] "few folk, the band included, call Cradle black metal these days." [...] In a 2006 interview with Terrorizer magazine, former guitarist Paul Allender said, [...] "We were never a black metal band. The only thing that catered to that was the make-up. Even when The Principle of Evil Made Flesh came out—you look at Emperor and Burzum and all that stuff—we didn't sound anything like that. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> see it is that we were, and still are now, an extreme metal band." ...|$|E

2500|$|Powell {{donated the}} maximum {{allowable}} amount to John McCain's {{campaign in the}} summer of 2007 and in early 2008, his name was listed as a possible running mate for Republican nominee McCain's bid during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. However, on October 19, 2008, Powell announced his endorsement of Barack Obama during a Meet the Press interview, citing [...] "his ability to inspire, because of the inclusive nature of his campaign, because he is reaching out all across America, because of who he is and his rhetorical abilities", in addition to his [...] "style and substance." [...] He additionally referred to Obama as a [...] "transformational figure". Powell further questioned McCain's judgment in appointing Sarah Palin as the vice presidential candidate, stating that {{despite the fact that she}} is admired, [...] "now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks, I don't believe she's ready to be president of the United States, which is the job of the vice president." [...] He said that Obama's choice for vice-president, Joe Biden, was ready to be president. He also added that he was [...] "troubled" [...] by the [...] "false intimations that Obama was Muslim." [...] Powell stated that [...] " [...] is a Christian—he's always been a Christian... But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America." [...] Powell then mentioned Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan, a Muslim American soldier in the U.S. Army who served and died in the Iraq War. He later stated, [...] "Over the last seven weeks, the approach of the Republican Party has become narrower and narrower [...] I look at these kind of approaches to the campaign, and they trouble me." [...] Powell concluded his Sunday morning talk show comments, [...] "It isn't easy for me to disappoint Sen. McCain in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have this morning, and I regret that [...] I think we need a transformational figure. I think we need a president who is a generational change and that's why I'm supporting Barack Obama, not out of any lack of respect or admiration for Sen. John McCain." [...] Later in a December 12, 2008, CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, Powell reiterated his belief that during the last few months of the campaign, Palin pushed the Republican party further to the right and had a polarizing impact on it.|$|E
