5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1999, a geopolitical dispute with the global Islamic {{community}} and Jewish groups in the United States and Israel arose over an Israeli franchisee opening stores in the Israeli-occupied territories. When Burger King franchisee in Israel, Rikamor, Ltd., opened a store in the West Bank settlement of Ma'aleh Adumim in August of that year, Islamic groups, including <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>League</b> and American Muslims for Jerusalem, argued that international Burger King parent Burger King Corporation's licensing of the store helped legitimize the illegal settlement. Beyond the called-for Islamic boycott of the company, <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>League</b> also threatened the revocation of the business licenses of Burger King's primary Middle Eastern franchise in the 22 countries {{that are part of}} the League's membership.|$|E
5|$|The revolutionary army {{established}} various large-scale {{public works}} programmes, including the Mogadishu Stadium.

5|$|Chad's {{official}} {{languages are}} Arabic and French, but over 100 languages and dialects are spoken.

5|$|A {{battle for}} Mogadishu {{followed}} {{in the first half}} of 2006 in which the ARPCT confronted the ICU. However, with local support, the ICU captured the city in June of the year. It then expanded its area of control in south-central Somalia over the following months, assisted militarily by Eritrea. In an effort at reconciliation, TFG and ICU representatives held several rounds of talks in Khartoum under the auspices of <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>League.</b> The meetings ended unsuccessfully due to uncompromising positions retained by both parties. Hardline Islamists subsequently gained power within the ICU, prompting fears of a Talibanization of the movement.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli {{opposed the}} {{proposed}} partition of the British Mandate of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, {{arguing that the}} plan, which would allocate 56% of Palestine to the Jewish state, violated {{the rights of the}} Palestinian Arab majority. The proposal passed the UN vote and Syria made war preparations soon afterward, including co-founding the Arab Liberation Army (ALA). Quwatli had proposed the creation of the ALA as a volunteer force to attract fighters from throughout the Arab world and {{to take the place of}} Arab regular armies. The ALA's establishment was sponsored by <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>League</b> following the UN partition vote and Fawzi al-Qawuqji, a Syrian commander who played leading roles in the Great Syrian Revolt and the 1936 revolt in Palestine, was appointed its commander. Quwatli did not believe the armies of Syria and the Arab world were ready to successfully confront Jewish forces and as war drew near in early 1948, he petitioned Abdel Rahman Azzam, head of <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>League,</b> to not enter Arab armies into Palestine. Instead, Quwatli offered to provide local Palestinian Arab fighters arms and funding. Azzam was not swayed and continued his effort of rallying Arab governments to dispatch their armies. On 15 May, after the establishment of Israel was announced, Quwatli ordered the Syrian Army to enter Palestine immediately.|$|E
5|$|Arab {{countries}} politically supported China in the OIC with especially Saudi Arabia and Egypt helping China squash {{any potential}} anti-Chinese motion by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation on the Uyghurs, Egypt viewed {{its own internal}} sectarian problems like China's and Sudan was also concerned about external interference in its internal problems as well, while Indonesia {{had to deal with}} its own internal Islamists and emphasized that there was no religious conflict but instead ethnic based disturbances in Xinjiang to calm the situation down. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt helped China kill off a statement on the Xinjiang situation in the OIC. There has been no public reaction by <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>League,</b> Saudi Arabia and Iran on the situation and China has built stronger relations with Iran and Saudi Arabia due to their influence in the Islamic world.|$|E

5|$|On 15 August 1971, {{though the}} Shah of Iran was {{claiming}} historical sovereignty over Bahrain, he accepted a referendum {{held by the}} United Nations and eventually Bahrain declared independence and signed a new treaty of friendship with the United Kingdom. Bahrain joined the United Nations and <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>League</b> later in the year. The oil boom of the 1970s benefited Bahrain greatly, although the subsequent downturn hurt the economy. The country had already begun diversification of its economy and benefited further from the Lebanese Civil War in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bahrain replaced Beirut as the Middle East's financial hub after Lebanon's large banking sector was driven {{out of the country}} by the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Arafat and {{his closest}} companions {{migrated}} to Syria—a country sharing a border with Israel—which had recently seceded from its union with Egypt. Fatah had approximately three hundred members by this time, but none were fighters. In Syria, {{he managed to}} recruit members by offering them higher incomes to enable his armed attacks against Israel. Fatah's manpower was incremented further after Arafat decided to offer new recruits much higher salaries than members of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), the regular military force of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which was created by <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>League</b> in 1964. On 31 December, a squad from al-Assifa, Fatah's armed wing, attempted to infiltrate Israel, but they were intercepted and detained by Lebanese security forces. Several other raids with Fatah's poorly trained and badly-equipped fighters followed this incident. Some were successful, others failed in their missions. Arafat often led these incursions personally.|$|E
