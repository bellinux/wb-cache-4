The theoretical part is devoted to matters of functional joint stability, its control and it provides review of assessment options. Also inertial measurement unit function and application for human motion tracking are discussed. The last chapter covers American football considering the research group in the study. The experimental part is in form of study, which uses inertial sensor-based parameters to evaluate functional joint stability that are placed on four body segments {{and the results are}} compared with functional test results. We evaluated one-legged stance and single-leg hop test. One-legged stance, bear position and squat were chosen for the functional tests.

Totally 144 white toms were divided into 3 groups (Pasture- 1, Pasture- 2 and Control) with 6 replicates, randomly. Pature- 1 (P 1) and Pasture- 2 (P 2) had outdoor access from 42 and 49 days old till end of the trail, respectively, while control group was kept indoor. All birds consumed commercial turkey breeding feed. At the end of trial, no significant differences were observed in terms of body weight but the best one was the control group. The lower feed consume and the best feed to gain was observed in P 1 (3. 06) and P 2 (3. 56) then Control group (3. 73), which was significantly different (p< 0. 05). Outdoor access did not have significant effect on carcass weight, breast meat and legs (<b>Thights</b> + drumstick) but it differed the wings (p< 0. 05). As a result, {{it has been said that}} Big- 6 heavy Turkeys have to be fed inside without outdoor access so far. According to results of present study, one may say that Big- 6 white turkey could be grazed with no deleterious effect on growth performance. However, more study is needed to determine age of access to outdoor and growth performance of Big- 6 white turkeys at different grazing fields...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to clarify the expressional {{features}} of Okinawan classical dance, the Takadera-Manzai, from the aesthetic and kinematic points of view. The following steps were taken in this study; 1) filming the performance of the Takadēra-Manzai (8 mm, 16 mm, and 35 mm). The performer is Mr. Kōyū Shimabukuro, who is one of famous dancer in Okinawa. He performed the dance with a) full costumed style and b) no costumed but <b>thights</b> style. 2) tracing the figures of dance movements by means of profile projector, and 3) making the flow figures of overlapping shapes of dance movements. The Takadēra-Manzai, one of the Otoko-Odori, is composed of four songs, that is, 1. Michiyuki Kuduchi, 2. Manzai-Kōshi-Bushi, 3. Ufunsyari-Bushi, and 4. Sensuru-Bushi. In dancing to Michiyuki-Kuduchi, the performer put on their straw hats, weare on black kimono and leggings, and walk with sticks. This style symbolize that the characters are away from home and pursues the murder of their father. The each characters have a mask of lion, and dance to Manzai-Koshi-Bushi. They dance to Ufunsyari-Bushi and Sen-Suru-Bushi with no properties. In this scene of the dance they are waiting the chance to kill the enemy, and take revenge for their father's death. And it represents the spectacular scene of this dance. The Takadera-Manzai is composed with three parts of moving tempo, that is, static, fairly dynamic, and extremely dynamic. The patterns of effort shape of Takadēra-Manzai were classfied as following; 1) glide-direct, 2) press-direct with strong, 3) wring-strong, 4) dab-direct with quick, 5) flick-quick, and 6) punchi-quick. What is called kihon-dachi is the basic standing position of this dance, and performer begins his motion from the kihon-dachi in rubbing the floor with his sole of a foot, then returnes to kihon-dachi, Takadēra-Manzai is characterized as its techniques, Nidan-Bane, Niju-Gamaku, Ryo-Ashi-Keriage-Tobi, Ryo-Ashi-Fumikiri-Tobi...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} simple recta-level {{inference}} architecture for implementing nested contexts. Based on an explicit non ground representation of both object and control knowledge, it treats contexts as constructs embodying a <b>thight</b> coupling between theories and inference rules. Processing is done via {{an extension of}} the traditional "vanilla " interpreter for logic programs allowing one to hop up and down the hierarchy of control clauses representing inference rules. An iterative deepening search of the corresponding state space prevents infinite recursion and ensures successful termination whenever possible. The resulting computational system resembles very much the tower architecture defined for functional programming, whereby each level represents a recta-level operating on the p~g one. The expressive power of this system is illustrated with a set of working Prolog examples, including McCarthy’s model of theory lifting, the processing of nested beliefs, and the access of data and/or knowledge bases using generic procedural knowledge. 1...|$|E

Radiation induced pathological alterations {{of the small}} intestine (gastrointestinal radiation syndrome) are related to altered ZO-mediated paracellular transport. We carried out a quantitative morphological evaluation of the murine jejunal epithelial tight junctional structure in freeze fracture replicas as changed upon whole body X-ray irradiation and low energy microwave exposition.

Also, {{an increase in}} particulate fraction-associated phos-pholipid-independent kinase {{activity was}} observed upon stimulation with these activa-tors.

Purified protein kinase C activity was stimulated by OAG and PMA, whereas no stimulation was observed using A 23187 or opsonized zymosan.

I. LINEAR ADVECTION PROBLEM As a preliminary to the full Euler and MHD system addressed below, it is instructive to focus on a seemingly trivial problem at first, namely the numerical solution to the advection equation in 1 spatial (x) dimension given by ∂tρ + v∂xρ = 0. (1) Under a constant given velocity v, an initial density pulse ρ(x, t = 0) = ρ 0 (x) will merely be advected at the constant speed, such that ρ(x, t) = ρ 0 (x − vt). Analytically, we are done. Numerically, we need to discretize the problem both spatially and temporally, {{and come up with a}} recipe to advance the discrete solution ρ n i on grid cells in-dexed by i from time level tn to tn+ 1.
