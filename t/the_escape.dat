5|$|The Maze Prison escape (known to Irish {{republicans}} as the Great Escape) {{took place on}} 25 September 1983 in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. HM Prison Maze (also known as Long Kesh) was a maximum security prison considered {{to be one of}} the most escape-proof prisons in Europe, and held prisoners convicted of taking part in armed paramilitary campaigns during the Troubles. In the biggest prison escape in UK history, 38 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners escaped from H-Block 7 (H7) of the prison. One prison officer died of a heart attack as a result of <b>the</b> <b>escape</b> and twenty others were injured, including two who were shot with guns that had been smuggled into the prison. <b>The</b> <b>escape</b> was a propaganda coup for the IRA, and a British government minister faced calls to resign. The official inquiry into <b>the</b> <b>escape</b> placed most of the blame onto prison staff, who in turn blamed <b>the</b> <b>escape</b> on political interference in the running of the prison.|$|E

30|$|In Fig. 1, our {{result is}} plotted with {{numerical}} result reported in Newman et al. (1999). From Fig. 1 {{we can see}} that their computation time is not enough for <b>the</b> <b>escaping</b> mass to level off. It is possible that these researchers calculated the flow at the very early stage, during which the shock wave plays a dominant role in atmospheric acceleration. In such an early stage, a larger portion of the vapor cloud, which has most of the momentum, remains near the planetary surface. Also, our calculation shows that <b>the</b> <b>escaping</b> vapor cloud accounts for a large fraction of <b>the</b> total <b>escaping</b> mass. Though they did not distinguish <b>the</b> <b>escaping</b> vapor from <b>the</b> <b>escaping</b> atmosphere, it is speculated that <b>the</b> total <b>escaping</b> mass in Newman et al. (1999) mainly represents <b>the</b> <b>escaping</b> mass not of the atmosphere, but of the vapor cloud.|$|R

5|$|The {{leadership}} of the Polish Jews was aware that Bełżec and Treblinka had been closed, dismantled and all remaining prisoners {{had been sent to}} the gas-chambers and they suspected that Sobibor would be next. There was a great urgency in coming up with a good escape plan, and Pechersky, with his army experience, was their best hope. <b>The</b> <b>escape</b> had to also coincide with the time when the Sobibor's deputy commandant Gustav Wagner went on vacation, since the prisoners felt that he was sharp enough to uncover <b>the</b> <b>escape</b> plan.|$|E
5|$|The raid was {{preceded by}} <b>the</b> <b>escape</b> of seven POWs on 30 August 1944. The organisers of <b>the</b> <b>escape</b> were Private Ralph Frederick Churches, an Australian Army {{infantry}} soldier of the 2/48th Battalion {{who had been on}} temporary duty with Headquarters ANZAC Corps when he was captured during the Allied withdrawal from Greece in April–May 1941, and Driver Leslie Arthur Laws, a British Army soldier of the 127th (Dorset) Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Royal Engineers. By August 1944, Churches had already attempted to escape on two occasions and had learned about the surroundings from those experiences. He realised that he had to escape while the prisoners were in an environment hostile to the Germans. Churches had learned to speak passable German during his captivity, and had been the camp leader of the work camp for eighteen months when he resigned the role so he could be involved in <b>the</b> <b>escape.</b>|$|E
