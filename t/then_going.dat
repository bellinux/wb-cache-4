5|$|After rehearsing with Strummer {{for less}} than a month, the Clash made their debut on 4 July 1976, {{supporting}} the Sex Pistols at the Black Swan in Sheffield.

The Clash would not play {{in front of an audience}} again for another five weeks. Levene was becoming disaffected with his position in the group. At the Black Swan, he approached the Sex Pistols' lead singer, John Lydon (<b>then</b> <b>going</b> by Johnny Rotten), and suggested they form a band together if the Pistols broke up.|$|E

Howard Hughes, Hepburn's partner at the time, sensed that the play could be her ticket back to Hollywood stardom and bought her the film rights before it even debuted on stage. The Philadelphia Story first toured the United States, to positive reviews, and then opened in New York at the Schubert Theatre on March 28, 1939.
