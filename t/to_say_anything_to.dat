25|$|Emma Lockhart as Gwen Stanton Will's sister, {{the only}} girl of the Stanton family {{and the only one}} to give Will a proper present on his birthday. A kind girl, she is the first of his family to unintentionally witness his power as he takes her to a Viking battle where she rescues a lost kitten.

25|$|Otto Berman, {{the oldest}} and least {{physically}} fit of the four men, {{was the first to}} die, at 2:20 that morning. At the hospital, Landau and Rosencrantz waited for surgery and refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> the police until Schultz arrived and gave them permission; even then, they provided the police with only minimal information. Abe Landau died of exsanguination eight hours after the shooting. Meanwhile, Rosencrantz was taken into surgery; the doctors, incredulous that Rosencrantz was still alive despite voluminous blood loss and ballistic trauma, were unsure of how to treat him. He survived for 29 hours after the shooting before succumbing to his injuries.|$|E
500|$|It is then {{revealed}} that Kylie has a son, Max (Harry McDermott), {{who is in}} foster care. Lane said that this happened because Kylie [...] "was drinking with his dad and not looking after him". Kylie loves Max but is too [...] "young and naive" [...] too cope with motherhood. Kylie snatches Max while on a visit; Lane opined it was a {{spur of the moment}} decision, but [...] "she couldn't bear to lose him". Becky helps Kylie regain custody of him. The [...] "turning point" [...] in the storyline was attributed to scenes in which Kylie stands up in court and vows to change. Lane said that they were [...] "touching" [...] scenes, which included a rare moment in which Kylie applauds Becky for being [...] "a great sister". Lane stated that when she gets Max back, Kylie takes advantage of Becky. In another storyline Kylie makes a pass at Steve. Gregson who plays him opined that in Kylie's mind she thought [...] "that fat bald guy wants a bit". He also said that Steve was [...] "extremely shocked" [...] but was not interested. Steve decides not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> Becky because he doesn't trust Kylie and knows that she will take Max away from Becky. Gregson said that in Steve's opinion [...] "she's been trouble from the start and he's sure that's not going to change." ...|$|E

2500|$|In emailed {{comments}} to the Wall Street Journal in January 2014, Gülen said that [...] "Turkish people ... are upset {{that in the last}} two years democratic progress is now being reversed", but he denied being part of a plot to unseat the government. Later, in January 2014 in an interview with BBC World, Gülen said [...] "If I were <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> people I may say people should vote for those who are respectful to democracy, rule of law, who get on well with people. Telling or encouraging people to vote for a party would be an insult to peoples' intellect. Everybody very clearly sees what is going on." ...|$|E
2500|$|King Arthur {{begins to}} give up hope of ever putting on the Broadway musical and laments that he is alone, even though Patsy has been with him the entire time ("I'm All Alone"). The Lady Of The Lake appears and tells Arthur {{that he and the}} Knights have been in a Broadway musical all along. Patsy also reveals he is half Jewish, but didn't want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> Arthur because [...] "that's not really the sort of thing you say to a heavily armed Christian." [...] All that's left is for King Arthur to find the Grail and marry someone. After picking up on some not-too-subtle hints, Arthur decides to marry the Lady Of The Lake after he finds the Grail ("Twice in Every Show").|$|E
2500|$|Cobb {{was having}} a {{tremendous}} year in 1911, which included a 40-game hitting streak. Still, [...] "Shoeless" [...] Joe Jackson led him by [...]009 points in the batting race late in the season. Near {{the end of the}} season, Cobb's Tigers had a long series against Jackson's Cleveland Naps. Fellow Southerners Cobb and Jackson were personally friendly {{both on and off the}} field. Cobb used that friendship to his advantage. Cobb ignored Jackson when Jackson tried <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> him. When Jackson persisted, Cobb snapped angrily back at him, making him wonder what he could have done to enrage Cobb. Cobb felt that it was these mind games that caused Jackson to [...] "fall off" [...] to a final average of [...]408, twelve points lower than Cobb's [...]420, a twentieth-century record which stood until George Sisler tied it and Rogers Hornsby surpassed it with [...]424, the record since then except for Hugh Duffy's [...]438 in the nineteenth century.|$|E
