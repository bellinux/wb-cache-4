5|$|The novel extrapolates Balzac's {{analysis}} of desire {{from the individual}} to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due to material excess and misguided priorities. In the gambling house, the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines this dilemma in various contexts. <b>The</b> <b>lust</b> for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; the gorgeous but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, many priests {{take part}} in <b>the</b> <b>lust</b> for the flesh: feasting and banqueting, vain conversation, sports, plays, hunting, and hawking. They are “drowned in the delights of this world” and “patronize those who cater for their pleasure”.|$|E

Wetti was most terrified to see emperor Charlemagne, bound and completely unharmed, except for an animal tearing at his genitals. His shock came from the idea that Charlemagne was a pious, good-natured Christian king, but the angel revealed that all Charlemagne's good deeds had been negated by <b>the</b> <b>lust</b> and debauchery which dominated his later life. Yet he would eventually be forgiven because of his actions on behalf of Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1990s {{during which}} time she also wrote and {{produced}} films, such as <b>The</b> <b>Lust</b> In His Eye: Visions of James Wilson Morrice and Borduas and Me and Artemisia there was much speculation that Clarkson would soon be given a high level appointment by the Queen-in-Council. This was finally realized in 1995 when Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and then Minister of Canadian Heritage Michel Dupuy advised Governor General Roméo LeBlanc to appoint Clarkson {{as chair of the}} board of the Canadian Museum of Civilization, and later, to the Canadian War Museum as well, all while she continued to host her show. It was during this time that the War Museum announced the decision to build the structure which now houses its collection, and which Clarkson opened as Governor General in May 2005.|$|E
25|$|After God and the archangels {{successfully}} battled the Darkness to submission at {{the beginning}} of creation, God sealed the latter inside a metaphysical cage, whose seal was handed over to Lucifer for safekeeping. However, the Darkness' influence was as such that Lucifer was corrupted by it, eventually becoming the first fallen angel after refusing to honor humans. Lucifer then offered the seal to Cain, which empowered a blade made from the jawbone of a donkey that he used to kill and send his brother, Abel, to Heaven. Whenceforth, the seal was known by the moniker of the Mark of Cain, while the blade was dubbed the First Blade. Wielders of the Mark are corrupted by the Darkness so they would have <b>the</b> <b>lust</b> for power and bloodbath. This power in turn activates the First Blade, otherwise useless when wielded by other people, to become an invincible weapon capable of killing everything, even angels and higher demons. If killed, wielders of the Mark are resurrected as demons, as shown by Dean in the finale of the ninth season. At the start of the series, Cain had thrown the First Blade {{to the bottom of the}} Marianas Trench, only to take it back and give it as well as the Mark to Dean as part of the latter's quest to kill Abaddon. However, this gives Dean the attendant problems of the Mark, which slowly corrupts him, as releasing the Mark requires an arduous ritual, and if not transferred to someone else would release the Darkness from her cage.|$|E

500|$|The volume {{contains}} {{a number of}} arguments. However, four themes have {{a central role in}} the overall work. The first theme given treatment in the analysis is that <b>the</b> <b>lust</b> for power is a part of human nature. Second, the work emphasises that there are different forms of social power, and that these forms are substantially interrelated. Third, Power insists that [...] "organisations are usually connected with certain kinds of individuals". Finally, the work ends by arguing that [...] "arbitrary rulership can and should be subdued".|$|E

Other critics further found influences of African and Latin music in its instrumentation and rhythms. [...] "La Mordidita" [...] contains a soccer chant during its bridge. Rapper Yotuel has a short rap contribution in the song. Lyrically, [...] "La Mordidita" [...] which translates to [...] "The Nibble" [...] in English, talks about <b>the</b> <b>lust</b> felt for a desired person.|$|E
500|$|Gaga's songs {{have covered}} {{a wide variety}} of concepts; The Fame {{discusses}} <b>the</b> <b>lust</b> for stardom, while the follow-up The Fame Monster expresses fame's dark side through monster metaphors. The Fame is an electropop and dance-pop album that has influences of 1980s pop and 1990s Europop, whereas The Fame Monster displays Gaga's taste for pastiche, drawing on [...] "Seventies arena glam, perky ABBA disco, and sugary throwbacks like Stacey Q". Born This Way has lyrics in English, French, German, and Spanish and features themes common to Gaga's controversial songwriting such as sex, love, religion, money, drugs, identity, liberation, sexuality, freedom, and individualism. In the album, she explores new genres, such as electronic rock and techno.|$|E

He courted her {{for a few months}} in 1932, despite being married to Marica Sion. His private notes show that he {{struggled}} with <b>the</b> <b>lust</b> for Băicoianu, which he believed was impairing his judgment, and declared himself outraged that the object of his affection had a [...] "scandalous liaison" [...] with another man. He ultimately decided not to persevere, basing himself on the principle that [...] "business is business." [...] In his final years, Caragiale was weighing in the probability of his still fathering a male son, and, although he concluded that it was not likely, laid out a [...] "Family Law" [...] for his potential descendants to abide by.|$|E
500|$|The Indonesian {{literary}} critic Jakob Sumardjo likewise notes money {{as the central}} issue of Allah jang Palsoe, writing that the play shows individuals doing anything to earn it—even sacrificing their values. He writes that the corrupting nature of money remains present {{in the best of}} times, and considers Kwee Tek Hoay's message to have been too heavily based in morality rather than considerations of social and human factors. As a result, he writes, readers are brought to understand <b>the</b> <b>lust</b> for money as a [...] "human illness" [...] which must be overcome: they should follow the example of Tan Kioe Gie, not Tan Kioe Lie. John Kwee of the University of Auckland, citing Gie's departure from Kamadjoean, suggests that this was a challenge directed at the Chinese Malay press, then becoming increasingly commercial.|$|E
500|$|Saruman [...] "was great once, of a noble {{kind that}} we should not dare raise our hands against" [...] but decays as the book goes on. Patricia Meyer Spacks calls him [...] "one of the main case {{histories}} [...] of the gradual destructive effect of willing submission to evil wills". Paul Kocher identifies Saruman's use of a palantír, a seeing-stone, as the immediate cause of his downfall, but also suggests that through his study of [...] "the arts of the enemy", Saruman was drawn into imitation of Sauron. According to Jonathan Evans and Spacks, Saruman succumbs to <b>the</b> <b>lust</b> for power, while Shippey identifies Saruman's devotion to goals of knowledge, organization and control as his weakness. Tolkien writes that the Istari's chief temptation (and that to which Saruman fell) is impatience, leading to a desire to force others to do good, and then to a simple desire for power.|$|E

500|$|Critics also {{consider}} Steinbock important {{because of his}} artistic genius. Like Louis Lambert and Lucien Chardon in Illusions perdues, he is a brilliant man– just as Balzac considered himself to be. Before he is nurtured and directed by Bette, however, Steinbock's genius languishes under his own inertia and he attempts suicide. Later, when he leaves Bette's circle of influence, he fails again. Thus he demonstrates Balzac's conviction that genius alone is useless without determination. Bellos organizes Steinbock and Bette into a duality of weakness and strength; whereas the Polish artist is unable to direct his energies into productive work, Bette draws strength from her virginity and thus becomes powerful by denying <b>the</b> <b>lust</b> to which Steinbock falls prey. Steinbock's drive is further eroded by the praise he receives for his art, which gives him an inflated sense of accomplishment. One critic refers to the artist's downfall as [...] "vanity... spoiled by premature renown".|$|E
500|$|Throughout his writings, Du Bois {{supported}} women's rights,Donaldson, Shawn, [...] "Women's Rights", in Young, pp. 219–221. but {{he found}} it difficult to publicly endorse the women's right-to-vote movement because leaders of the suffragism movement refused to support his fight against racial injustice. A Crisis editorial from 1913 broached the taboo subject of interracial marriage: although Du Bois generally expected persons to marry within their race, he viewed the problem as a women's rights issue, because laws prohibited white men from marrying black women. Du Bois wrote [...] " [...] laws leave the colored girls absolutely helpless for <b>the</b> <b>lust</b> of white men. It reduces colored women {{in the eyes of the}} law to the position of dogs. As low as the white girl falls, she can compel her seducer to marry her... We must kill [...] not because we are anxious to marry the white men's sisters, but because we are determined that white men will leave our sisters alone."Du Bois quoted in Lubin, Alex (2005), Romance and Rights: The Politics of Interracial Intimacy, 1945–1954, University Press of Mississippi, pp. 71–72.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} added Justin's sister Iris as {{a supporting}} {{character in the}} revised series, and established a sexual {{tension between the two}} characters early on. While reviewers were unsure what to make of it, Daniel Knauf advertised the relationship as [...] "just as warped and incestuous as ever" [...] in the new season. Clancy Brown (Brother Justin) and Amy Madigan (Iris) acknowledged <b>the</b> <b>lust</b> between their characters but assumed their relationship had not been consummated in the first season. They were not in favor of their characters getting together like HBO had wanted, as [...] "that's really not what they're about." [...] Per Brown, the sibling relationship informs Brother Justin's and Iris's character and motives, and continued tension frightens the audience more if it is never resolved. Although Brown and Madigan wanted to leave the status of their characters' relationship as lovers open, they deliberately played their kisses more intimate and familiar than most people would consider comfortable. Several characters intervene the siblings' relationship during the show's run. The writers had planned a sexual innuendo between Iris and Tommy Dolan, a news reporter who investigates in the arson case, but Robert Knepper (Dolan) later felt his character might just have been a pawn between Brother Justin and Iris as siblings, making Brother Justin jealous. The Crowes also regularly hire new maids, which Knauf explained as Iris lining up surrogate women to relieve Brother Justin's sexual pressure.|$|E
