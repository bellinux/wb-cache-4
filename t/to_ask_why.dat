5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E
25|$|At the 1945 general {{election}} Thomas was easily re-elected. When {{he saw the}} list of Government Ministers appointed by Clement Attlee, Thomas took {{the unusual step of}} writing to the new Prime Minister <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> his own name had not appeared on it. Attlee decided to find Thomas an appointment, and made him Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Civil Aviation on 10 August 1945. He was the Ministry's spokesman in the House of Commons as the Minister was Lord Winster. Thomas took over responsibility for the building of London Heathrow Airport, then known as 'Heath Row', which had been started by the Royal Air Force during the war.|$|E
25|$|Igor Volk {{was planned}} to be the {{commander}} of the first manned Buran flight. There were two purposes of the Soyuz T-12 mission, one of which was to give Volk spaceflight experience. The other purpose, seen as the more important factor, was to beat the United States and have the first spacewalk by a woman. At the time of the Soyuz T-12 mission the Buran programme was still a state secret. The appearance of Volk as a crew member caused some, including the British Interplanetary Society magazine Spaceflight, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> a test pilot was occupying a Soyuz seat usually reserved for researchers or foreign cosmonauts.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 24 June, the six RMPs of 156 Provost Company, were in Majar al-Kabir {{as part of the}} {{training}} programme for the local Iraqi police. The NCO in charge of the RMP section was Sergeant Simon Hamilton-Jewell, who had informed his Royal Military Police chain of command that he was leaving and where he and his section would be going. Despite a Standing Order that everyone be issued with a satellite phone for communication, Hamilton-Jewell was informed that none were available. The RMPs had gone to Majar al-Kabir <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> the local police force had not intervened in a stoning two days earlier. The RMPs left Camp Abu Naji at 9:10am local time and arrived in Majar al-Kabir twenty to thirty minutes later between 9:30 and 9:40am. They were due to move on to other locations at Qalat Salih and Al Uzayr (at 14:00 to meet a senior British officer) before returning to their base around 17:00. When they arrived at the police station, their Iraqi interpreter was waiting for them and all seemed calm.|$|E

500|$|As Radiohead's six-album {{contract}} with EMI ended after the 2003 release of Hail to the Thief, Radiohead recorded In Rainbows without a record contract. In 2005, Yorke told Time: [...] "I {{like the people}} at our record company, but the time is at hand when you have <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> anyone needs one.

500|$|In {{the next}} round of the competition, Berg {{attempted}} another jump but was not as fortunate this time: he fell out of the air, just as before, and crashed almost identically to Findeisen. One of Berg's skis, which had come loose after impact and was still attached to his foot, flailed around and hit him in the face – exposed due to his goggles detaching – as he was sliding to a stop. His injuries, including concussion and a broken ACL, were career-ending. At this point, Trautwig began calling into question the nature of the sport: [...] "Jeff, we talk about the fear and why the ski flyers are scared... I'm really starting <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>why</b> we're here and why they're doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|Whitehead {{makes the}} startling {{observation}} that [...] "life is comparatively deficient in survival value." [...] If humans can only exist {{for about a}} hundred years, and rocks for eight hundred million, then one is forced <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> complex organisms ever evolved in the first place; as Whitehead humorously notes, [...] "they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them." [...] He then observes that the mark of higher forms of life {{is that they are}} actively engaged in modifying their environment, an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living, living well, and living better. [...] In other words, Whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction. [...] Without such a goal, he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible.|$|E

500|$|After {{the first}} rumour circulated, Joe Goddard created a reverse rumour, saying that Minogue {{had written a}} track for Hot Chip. He told NME, [...] "Kylie wrote a song for us, She sent it through our {{management}} to us– it was totally bizarre. It was {{the beginnings of a}} track– I think she wrote it and just thought, 'This would be perfect for Hot Chip', or possibly for a collaboration. It's a crazy song. It's industrial and clanging and even has farmyard animal noises on it. It's the kind of music you'd never normally associate with Kylie. When I'm allowed to send it around it's going to change a few people's ideas about her. Maybe it's one for our next album, after Made in the Dark." [...] Taylor later admitted that it was a joke created to fool people because the band were tired of people phoning them up <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> Minogue had apparently rejected a song she did not hear. Goddard said, [...] "We've been telling lots of lies and rumours about it because we found it quite funny." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{described}} {{the book as}} both convincing and not. The New Yorker wrote that skeptical readers would find the book convincing. Crutis (The Times Literary Supplement) thought the book would lead readers <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> [...] "the principles of progressive education" [...] were not more accepted in England. Reisman (The Phi Delta Kappan) wrote that even the sections dedicated to the origins of neuroses were [...] "still noteworthy, challenging, and provocative". He wrote that the book's impact is in its [...] "realistic demonstration of how children can be helped to become happy people" [...] without guilt, hate, and fear. On the other hand, the Saturday Review doubted children wanted or benefitted from lack of adult authority. Hartup (Contemporary Psychology) thought that the book, while stimulating, left questions as to its actual contribution past an [...] "experiment in applied psychoanalysis", with [...] "clinical procedure ... alternatively inspired, naive, and hair-raising". He called Neill [...] "an excellent devil's advocate for educators" [...] but unhelpful in resolving the ailments of mass education.|$|E
500|$|While Labour {{distributed}} ballot packs to its members, {{the trade}} unions {{were responsible for}} sending out literature relating to the contest to their members, leading to concerns from each side {{about the content of}} the other's election material. After Labour included only the endorsements of parliamentarians in an information booklet sent to individual members, the Unite union wrote to Iain McNicol, the party's general secretary, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> details of support from organisations, such as trade unions, was omitted. Unite said that the decision unfairly favoured Murphy, and the union suggested that it and other unions would make a formal complaint, if necessary. Pat Rafferty, secretary of Unite's Scottish branch, described the incident as [...] "a gross error of judgment". On 30 November, Sunday Herald journalist Paul Hutcheon reported that along with voting packs, Unite had also sent its members a [...] "mock ballot paper" [...] instructing them to vote for Findlay and Clark, while the GMB union had also included material endorsing Findlay and Clark as their preferred candidates. Hutcheon quoted an unnamed senior Labour Party source, who described the actions as [...] "absolutely desperate stuff from Unite".|$|E

500|$|Tiridates reacted {{by sending}} envoys <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> {{he was under}} attack, since hostages had been given. To this, Corbulo reiterated the demand to seek the {{recognition}} of his crown from Nero. Eventually, the two sides agreed on a meeting. Tiridates {{announced that he would}} bring 1,000 men to the meeting, implying that Corbulo should bring the same number of men [...] "in peaceful fashion, without breastplates and helmets". Tacitus suggests that Tiridates intended to overwhelm the Romans, as the Parthian cavalry would be superior to an equal number of Roman infantry in any case. At any rate, in a show of force Corbulo decided to take with him the larger part of his force, not only IV Ferrata, but also 3,000 men from III Gallica plus the auxiliaries. Tiridates also appeared at the agreed site, but, seeing the Romans in full battle array, and in turn distrusting their intentions, he did not come closer and withdrew during the night. Tiridates then resorted to a tactic that had worked well a century earlier against Mark Antony: he sent forces to raid the Roman army's supply route, which stretched over the mountains back to Trapezus in the Black Sea. They failed however, since the Romans had taken care to secure the mountain routes by a series of forts.|$|E
500|$|The next morning, {{everyone}} who drank Snake Juice is extremely hungover (except Ron (Nick Offerman)), and Leslie deeply regrets how she treated Ann. Ben visits Ann {{at her home}} and asks her to forgive Leslie. Ann, who also regrets the fight, is touched by Ben's gesture and reveals that Leslie likes him. Ann decides to attend the job interview, during which she and Leslie apologize to each other. After a second interview with Chris, Ann is given the job in a part-time basis, which also would allow her to continue {{her work as a}} nurse. Tom reluctantly decides to sell his Snakehole Lounge shares. Tom sells his shares the next morning to Jean-Ralphio, while Donna tries to comfort Tom, causing him <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> Chris did not make her sell her shares, to which she replies that Chris does not know that she owns shares. She then tells Jean-Ralphio that [...] "nitches get stiches." [...] Ron attempts to convince Chris to let him keep the shares, and defends Tom's efforts to branch out by claiming the move was not unethical, but Chris is not persuaded. Instead, Ron comforts Tom by building him a special case to hold a bottle of Snake Juice. At the same time, April tries to reprise her role of Janet Snakehole and have Andy reprise Burt Macklin, but a hungover Andy says that [...] "...Burt Macklin died last night after the 10th shot of Snake Juice." [...] However, after seeing a sad April walk away, Andy creates himself a new role: Kip Hackman, Burt Macklin's brother and chases after Janet, although he vomits as this happens.|$|E
500|$|The doctors alerted Brent {{police and}} social services, {{and she was}} placed under police {{protection}}, with a 72-hour protection order preventing her from leaving hospital. Kouao told the doctors that she had scabies, and that the injuries were self-inflicted. Many doctors and nurses suspected that the injuries were non-accidental. However, Ruby Schwartz, the consultant paediatrician and named child protection doctor at the hospital, diagnosed scabies and {{decided that it was}} scratching that caused the injuries. She made the diagnosis without speaking to Climbié alone. Schwartz later admitted that she made a mistake. Another doctor, one of Schwartz' juniors, misleadingly wrote to social services saying there was no child protection issue. When Michelle Hine, a child protection officer at Brent council, received a report notifying her of Climbié's injuries, she planned to open an investigation into the case. However, the next day she heard of Schwartz' diagnosis and downgraded Climbié's level of care, trusting Schwartz' judgement. She later expressed regret over her actions. Schwartz said in the inquiry that she expected social services to follow up the case. Neil Garnham QC, counsel to the inquiry following Climbié's death, later said to her, [...] "there is a terrible danger here—is there not, doctor—of social services {{on the one hand and}} you on the other each expecting the other to do the investigation, with the result that nobody does". The police officer allocated to Climbié's case for the Brent Child Protection team, Rachel Dewar, decided to lift the police protection, allowing Climbié to return home, when told by a social worker that she had scabies. Under the Children Act 1989, Dewar was obliged to see Climbié and tell her she was under police protection, but she did not do this. She also failed to see Kouao or Manning. At the time of the decision, Dewar was attending a seminar on child protection. Garnham later said, [...] "we will need <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> it was thought more important for her to attend a seminar to learn how to deal with child protection cases than deal with the real child protection case for which she was responsible at the time". Kouao took Climbié home on 15 July 1999.|$|E
