The result of the game was another 0–0 tie, making it the seventh time in nine games the Panhandles were held scoreless. Chris Willis stated this tie was {{not as bad as}} the previous weeks because the Athletics had old players from the Akron Indians, a winning team in the Ohio League.|$|E
5|$|The next day, the K Foundation's publicist, Mick Houghton, {{claimed that}} the voting for the K Foundation's award was {{supposed}} to produce a <b>tie,</b> <b>to</b> illustrate the hypocrisy of the Turner award committee, but that strangely the result had been a huge margin of victory for Whiteread. He speculated that the few thousand voters had just liked or rather disliked {{the sound of her}} name.|$|E
5|$|Following further {{disputes}} and delays, {{it was reported}} in March 2010 that Edinburgh Council was considering cancelling the contract with Bilfinger Berger. By June 2010, the project's cost had risen to £600 million. Council project managers were reported to be in crisis talks, considering options including: borrowing £55 million to fund the increased costs; phasing {{the introduction of the}} tram line, so that trams would initially run between the airport and Haymarket; and terminating the contract with Bilfinger Berger. The council asked <b>TIE</b> <b>to</b> draw up costs for truncating the line at four places: Haymarket station, York Place, the foot of Leith Walk or Ocean Terminal.|$|E

40|$|In many {{countries}} governments not only regulate business activities, but also {{become involved in}} the corporate governance of individual firms through ownership and board ties. While existing studies usually focus either on benefits of political connections or on costs of government influence, a political embeddedness perspective helps us consider both advantages and constraints associated with <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> the government. In particular, firms with direct <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> the government will experience significant costs associated with government officials' involvement in the corporate governance process. In contrast, firms with <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are connected to the government indirectly and thus, while getting access to state-owned resources, avoid costs associated with the government's interventions. This study compares the performance consequences of board and ownership <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> the government with the consequences of board and ownership <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> SOEs. I find that <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> SOEs are associated with higher profitability, while no significant differences are discovered for firms with direct <b>ties</b> <b>to</b> the government.

5|$|On 25 October 2007, {{the council}} {{approved}} the final business case. Approval was given on 22 December 2007 for <b>TIE</b> <b>to</b> sign contracts with CAF to supply vehicles and BBS (a consortium of Bilfinger Berger and Siemens) {{to design and}} construct the network. Contract negotiations finished in April 2008, and construction started in June 2008. By this stage {{the cost of the}} project was estimated at £521 million. Funding problems and political disputes led to the scaling back of the original plans. In April 2009, the council cancelled phase 1b, citing revenue shortfall created by the economic slowdown to save an estimated £75 million. The Granton extension was also cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The club {{finished}} in 12th {{place in their}} first season back in the Premier League but Lambert resigned within a month of the season's close. He was replaced by Chris Hughton for the 2012–13 season. Hughton's reign started poorly, but the bad run of form {{was followed by a}} club record unbeaten run in the Premier League and Norwich secured their third consecutive year in the Premier League. A 1–0 home defeat to Luton Town that season resulted in Norwich becoming the first English top-flight team to lose a FA Cup <b>tie</b> <b>to</b> a non-league side in 24 years.|$|E

5|$|Their first-ever {{appearance}} at Wembley Stadium saw the Eagles facing Alex Ferguson's Manchester United. Gary O'Reilly opened the scoring and Ian Wright then equalised immediately after coming onto the pitch {{as a substitute}} to take the <b>tie</b> <b>to</b> extra time, before scoring again early in the extra period. Mark Hughes scored a third for United to leave the game drawn 3–3 and requiring a replay. In the replay the Eagles wore a new one-off yellow and black striped shirt because the club {{did not have time}} to find their away strip. The replay saw United left-back Lee Martin cap a 40-yard run by slotting past Martyn to win the Cup for the Red Devils.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} video games have been {{developed}} that <b>tie</b> <b>to</b> the Yu Yu Hakusho series, most {{of which have been}} produced for and released exclusively in Japan. Prior to the launch of the franchise in North America, games were released on the Game Boy, Super Famicom, Sega consoles, and various platforms. North America only saw three video game releases. Two releases for the Nintendo's Game Boy Advanced handheld console, and one release for Sony's PlayStation 2 console. A single Mega Drive game, Yū Yū Hakusho: Makyō Tōitsusen, was published in Brazil by Tectoy in 1999 under the title Yu Yu Hakusho: Sunset Fighters. When Atari gained publishing rights to Yu Yu Hakusho video games in 2003, the company created and released three games in these regions: , an action-adventure game for the Game Boy Advance; , a tactical role-playing game also for the Game Boy Advance; and , a 3D fighting game for the PlayStation 2.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Birmingham, Doyle soon linked up with Championship club Nottingham Forest on a short-term loan deal in December 2004. The loan was then extended {{to keep him}} at the City Ground {{for the rest of}} the season. Doyle made his first-team debut for Forest in a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur on 20 February 2005. As the match approached half-time, Doyle gifted Tottenham the lead as a Jermain Defoe free kick bounced out of his hands and into the net, but Forest were able to equalise in the second half to take the <b>tie</b> <b>to</b> a replay. Even though Doyle only played in a further three league matches for Forest, he said he was glad to be able to play regular reserve-team football and the loan spell had exceeded his expectations. He was rumoured to be {{returning to}} Forest on loan for the following season, a move which did not occur.|$|E

5|$|Following their {{championship}} win, Palace {{started their}} second {{season as a}} club in the Southern League First Division, placing 19th {{at the end of}} the season but enjoying better form in the FA Cup. Beating Rotherham County in a qualifying tie, Palace were then drawn away to Newcastle United in the First Round proper. Newcastle had played in the previous two FA Cup Finals, were league champions in 1905 and were on their way to another championship. In what still stands as one of the club's greatest ever wins, Crystal Palace scored through Horace Astley against the run of play and then held off Newcastle to come away with a shock 1–0 win. The second and third rounds saw Palace dispose of Fulham and Brentford respectively, the latter after a replay, and the quarter-finals saw Palace drawn at home to First Division club Everton, currently flying high in second place. In front of a record crowd of 35,000, Palace took the lead, but their opponents equalised taking the <b>tie</b> <b>to</b> a replay, where Everton proved too strong, running out 4–0 winners.|$|E
5|$|Lokvenc joined 1. FC Kaiserslautern of the German Bundesliga in 2000, {{agreeing to}} the move before the 2000 European Championship. Around the same time, a {{daughter}} was born to Lokvenc in May 2000. He scored six goals in an 11–1 friendly match win against an amateur side {{before the start of}} the season. In December 2000 Lokvenc scored in the UEFA Cup against Rangers, helping his team qualify for the last 16 of the competition. In the following round Kaiserslautern were paired with Slavia Prague; after the first match had finished goalless, Lokvenc scored the only goal in the second leg of their two-legged <b>tie</b> <b>to</b> eliminate the Czech team. He scored a hat-trick in the 2002–03 DFB-Pokal quarter-final against Bochum, a game which finished 3–3 but was won by Kaiserslautern after a penalty shoot-out. Lokvenc played in the final of the competition at the end of May 2003, but his side were beaten 3–1 by league winners Bayern Munich as the latter claimed the double.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City's {{third round}} tie {{was against the}} amateur club Corinthians at Crystal Palace. The third round was the furthest Corinithians had ever progressed, though until 1923 the club never entered the cup due to club rules {{preventing}} them from entering any competition with a prize. Manchester City went behind and only equalised three minutes from time. The Corinthians goalkeeper, Benjamin Howard Baker collided with a teammate, causing him to take more than four steps with the ball. From the resulting free kick, Frank Roberts scored in a goalmouth melee to take the <b>tie</b> <b>to</b> a replay, held the following Wednesday. The rematch proved less even. Manchester City won 4–0 courtesy of goals by Austin (twice), Hicks and Johnson. After his goal, Hicks {{had to leave the}} field as he had sustained an injury while performing a celebratory somersault. In the fourth round, City faced league champions Huddersfield Town and again won 4–0. The crowd of 74,799 was by far the highest of the round, and only 1,200 short of the club record.|$|E

5|$|Rapid, however, appealed, {{citing the}} alleged injury to their player. The initial appeal was {{dismissed}} by UEFA, but a second appeal {{from the club}} was upheld and a replay was ordered to take place at least 150 kilometres (90 miles) from Glasgow. The Celtic board acquiesced to this decision in spite of considered opinion that Celtic should withdraw from the tournament on principle. As such, the match at Parkhead was declared void and a third match was held in Manchester at Old Trafford. Celtic lost 0–1, the goal coming on 18 minutes when after Roy Aitken had hit the post with an effort for Celtic, Rapid immediately caught Celtic on the break to score the only goal of the game. Worse, two Celtic fans assaulted Rapid Wien players; one fan running onto the pitch and accosting the goalkeeper during the game, whilst at full-time another Rapid player was kicked by a fan. UEFA fined Celtic and ordered their next home European <b>tie</b> <b>to</b> take place behind closed doors.|$|E
5|$|The Football Association bought Aker's {{share of}} the stadium during the 1930s, and in 1945 also part of Lyn's share. From 1948, the Cup Final was held at Ullevaal, and has been held there since. Other {{activities}} held during the first decades included boxing, and a revival meeting hosted by Billy Graham in front of 40,000 people in 1955. In 1960, NFF bought more shares from Lyn and became the majority shareholder with 50.7%, while Lyn retained 44.2%. The reason was the planned expansion could not receive public grants with such a strong <b>tie</b> <b>to</b> a single club, but the state {{was willing to give}} grants to the stadium if it was controlled by the federation. In 1967, a new South Stand was opened, and the following year NFF moved into offices at the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The Football Association chose St Andrew's to {{host the}} 1907 FA Cup {{semifinal}} between The Wednesday and Woolwich Arsenal; Wednesday won 3–1, {{and went on to}} win the tournament. This was the first FA Cup <b>tie</b> <b>to</b> be played at the ground, as Birmingham had lost their opening match away from home. Three more semifinals took place at St Andrew's before the Second World War, in 1911, 1924 and 1934. The club bought the freehold of the ground in 1921 for a price believed to be less than £7,000 (£ today). In the 1930s, roofs were erected over the Kop and Railway End terraces, and in February 1939, the ground attendance record, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341, was set at the fifth-round FA Cup tie against Everton.|$|E
