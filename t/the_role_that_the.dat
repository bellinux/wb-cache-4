5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Stalin's Soviet Union {{was no longer}} {{satisfied}} {{with the status quo}} in its relations with Finland.

The Soviets considered the old Empire to have had an optimal balance of security and territory, and their thoughts were shaped by a historical precedent: as the Treaty of Nystad of 1721 was intended to protect Tsarist Saint Petersburg from the Swedes, the re-acquisition of Finland would protect the now Bolshevik Leningrad from the rising power of Nazi Germany. While in 1938 Sweden was no longer a major threat against Russia, the Soviets had not forgotten <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Finnish-controlled Åland islands had played as a base of operations for the German Expeditionary Force in the Finnish Civil War.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to scar-inducing factors, like those discussed above, astrocytes up regulate {{the production of}} chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Astrocytes are a predominant type of glial cell in {{the central nervous system}} that provide many functions including damage mitigation, repair, and glial scar formation. The RhoA pathway is involved. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) {{have been shown to be}} up regulated in the central nervous system (CNS) following injury. Repeating disaccharides of glucuronic acid and galactosamine, glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs), are covalently coupled to the protein core CSPGs.

25|$|Chief J.E.

He asserted that the kingdoms of Egbe Oba (Ikole) and Ijero gave Ado-Ekiti continual support in playing a leadership role.

Jackson led one faction, which insisted upon judicial self-restraint and insisted courts should defer to the policymaking prerogatives of the White House and Congress. Hugo Black and William O. Douglas led the opposing faction; they agreed the court should defer to Congress in matters of economic policy, but felt the judicial agenda had been transformed from questions of property rights to those of individual liberties, and in this area, courts should play a more activist role. Warren's belief that the judiciary must seek to do justice placed him with the activists, {{although he did not}} have a solid majority until after Frankfurter's retirement in 1962.|$|E

25|$|The 1st Independent Company {{was formed}} in May/June 1941 and was trained at the No. 7 Infantry Training Centre at Tidal River on Wilsons Promontory in Victoria. Originally the company was raised {{to serve in the}} Middle East although, at that time there was {{uncertainty}} about <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company would fill there. Indeed, within the Australian Army there was a section that saw no need for the independent companies, believing that they would prove {{to be more of a}} drain on resources than anything else. However, later in 1941, as the threat of war with Imperial Japan loomed, the main body of the company was sent to Kavieng, New Ireland, to protect Kavieng airfield whilst other sections were sent to Namatanai on New Ireland, Vila in the New Hebrides, Tulagi on Guadalcanal, Buka on Bougainville, and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers and provided medical treatment to the inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|Formed in October 1941 as the 2/3rd Independent Company, {{the unit}} {{undertook}} {{training at the}} Guerrilla Warfare Camp at Foster, Victoria. After completing training, the 2/3rd was transported north to Katherine, Northern Territory, where it carried out various garrison duties. During {{this time there was}} considerable debate within the high command of the Australian Army about <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 2/3rd and the other independent companies would fill. However, following Japan's entry into World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor and British forces in Malaya, it was decided to use the independent companies in the islands to the north of Australia, where it was necessary to establish outposts that could warn of the approach of the Japanese. With this in mind, the 2/3rd Independent Company was sent to New Caledonia in December 1941 as a gesture of goodwill to the Free French and in order to defend against a possible Japanese attack.|$|E
25|$|A further {{limitation}} of the correlation {{is that it does}} not necessarily imply that the causality runs from income to health. It could actually be that better health, as proxied by life expectancy, contributes to higher incomes, rather than vice versa. Better health can increase incomes because healthier individuals tend to be more productive than sick ones; on average they work harder, longer and are more capable of focusing efficiently on production tasks. Furthermore, better health may affect not just the level of income but also its growth rate through its effect on education. Healthier children spend more time at school and learn faster, thus acquiring more human capital which translates into higher growth rates of incomes later in life. Diseases such as malaria can short circuit these processes. Likewise there is evidence that more healthy individuals save more and thus contribute to the faster accumulation of physical capital of an economy. Jeffrey Sachs in particular has emphasized <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> disease burden has played in the impoverishment of countries located in the tropical zones.|$|E

25|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} her dissertation, the research of Anna Christensen came {{to concentrate on the}} law of Welfare Society, i.e. those parts of the legal system that are developed to protect everyday life of the common men and women; Labour Law, Housing Law and Social Security Law were all to become her domain and main fields of research. In Disqualification from Unemployment Benefits (Avstängning från arbetslöshetsförsäkring), from 1980, Christensen studied the Swedish rules on disqualification from unemployment benefits on the ground of refusal of work and other self-imposed unemployment. The main {{purpose of the study was}} to disclose the control and steering of the citizens that is built into the Swedish social security system. According to Christensen, there was a strong interest on the part of the state to conceal <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Job Service played in the system. Furthermore, Christensen meant that the state had an interest in concealing how the behavior-steering and repressive functions of the social security system were inseparably associated with the supportive functions of the system – a fact that contradicted the ideology surrounding the Welfare State. The study represented an important shift in Christensen’s research towards a more theoretical, social-science-oriented and critical approach.|$|E

Although this was not a universal experience, overall it affected the morale of the CMF and, coupled with the decision by the government not to activate CMF units for service in Vietnam, this led to a decline in genuine voluntary enlistment. To a large extent also, the government's decision to not use the CMF during this time highlighted the organisation's increasing structural irrelevance, and questions about <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> CMF had to play in the defence of Australia would remain until following the end of the Vietnam War.
