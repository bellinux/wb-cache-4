50|$|Many tops, {{including}} <b>turtlenecks,</b> mock <b>turtlenecks,</b> {{and similar}} sweaters, have back zippers. The zippers {{do not need}} to be open in order for the top to be pulled over. But the zipper allows the top to be widely open when being pulled over in order to not disturb one's hair style. These tops are usually marketed to older adults, who are more likely to have delicate hair styles that can be damaged by pulling a garment over.|$|R
25|$|Rudi Gernreich's minimalist costume was {{considerably}} modified {{from the original}} unisex design to include an optional skirt and leather boots for women and much more detail work on the tunic portion, including <b>turtleneck</b> collars, coloured stitching, patches and photo ID badges.

25|$|For {{the second}} series, the Moonbase uniforms were updated and {{coloured}} decorative stitching and <b>turtleneck</b> collars were added, as were various badges and patches. Red, navy, or dark-green jackets also appeared, originally on just the senior staff, then {{on many of}} the male extras.

25|$|Fashionable {{clothing}} {{in the early}} 1980s included both unisex and gender-specific attire. Widespread fashions {{for women in the}} early 1980s included sweaters (including <b>turtleneck,</b> crew neck, and v-neck varieties); fur-lined puffer jackets; tunics; faux-fur coats; velvet blazers; trench coats (made in both fake and real leather); crop tops; tube tops; knee-length skirts (of no prescribed length, as designers opted for choice); loose, flowy, knee-length dresses (with high-cut and low-cut necklines, varying sleeve lengths, and made in a variety of fabrics including cotton, silk, satin, and polyester); high-waisted loose pants; embroidered jeans; leather pants; and designer jeans. Women's pants of the 1980s were, in general, worn with long inseams – a style carried over from the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|In New Nightmare, Freddy's {{appearance}} is updated considerably, {{giving him a}} green fedora that matched his sweater stripes, skin-tight leather pants, knee-high black boots, a <b>turtleneck</b> version of his trademark sweater, a dark blue trench coat, and a fifth claw on his glove, which also has a far more organic appearance, resembling the exposed muscle tissue of an actual hand. Freddy also has fewer burns on his face, though these are more severe, with his muscle tissue exposed in numerous places. Compared to his other incarnations, this Freddy's injuries are more like those of an actual burn victim. For the 2010 remake, Freddy is returned to his iconic attire, but the burns on his face are intensified with further bleaching of the skin and exposed facial tissue on the left cheek, more reminiscent of actual third degree burns than in the original series.|$|E
25|$|Trench coats have {{remained}} fashionable {{in the decades}} following World War II. Their original role {{as part of an}} army officer's uniform lent the trench coat a businesslike respectability, although many prefer to tie the belt in front (rather than use the buckle) to project a more casual look than strict military dress. Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine from Casablanca and Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau wore the trench coat in the public eye. Often, a fedora or an ushanka (during colder weather) was also worn. In the 1960s, radical intellectuals wore trench coats over black <b>turtleneck</b> sweaters, while some Mods wore trench coats as fashionable overcoats, {{as an alternative to the}} fishtail parka or crombie. Streakers and flashers often prefer trench coats since they conceal the wearer's lack of undergarments and can be opened quickly when the exhibitionist is ready to expose him or herself.|$|E

25|$|Zamasu is a green-skinned {{humanoid}} with grey {{eyes and}} a white Mohawk. He is seen wearing a violet long-sleeved shirt under a gray coat with yellow trimming, itself under a light blue sash. He also wears dark blue pants and white boots. The Zamasu who stole Goku's body originally had an appearance identical to his counterparts. He gains Goku's appearance after switching bodies with him, the only physical differences being a slightly darker skin tone and sterner eyes, along with a somewhat skinnier physique after the switch. His attire consists of a sleeveless dark grey uwagi, a long-sleeved black undershirt with a <b>turtleneck,</b> a red sash, black pants and white boots. He wears a single gold and green Universe 10 Supreme Kai Potara earring on his left ear.

25|$|Back in the 1940s {{there were}} many members {{that were in the}} military. During that time period it was not easy for all of the members to get {{together}} for meetings because of gas rationing. On May 27 and 28, 1944 the first formal convention was held. This meeting was led by Jane Farrow and Jo Folden in Columbus, Ohio. The first Regional Meeting was held later that year in Plainfield, New Jersey. From this came the decision on the colors and the logo for Motor Maids. It was decided that royal blue and silver gray would make up the colors and a shield would represent the logo. Another thing that came from this meeting was the uniform for the group. At the start the uniforms were tailor-made of silver-gray gabardine with royal blue piping. This soon changed and the uniform became gray slacks, royal blue over-blouse with white boots, and a tie. Down the road in 2006, the group voted to change the uniform again. It was then changed to what it is in present day. It consists of black pants and boots, royal blue mock neck long sleeved shirt with a white cotton vest, and white gloves. White gloves were added in 1941 when Howard Foley went to the motor maids with the idea of parading at the Charity Newsies Race. During this parade, the Motor Maids wore white gloves making them known as the “Ladies of the White Gloves”. They continued to parade for this event each year up until 1979. The Motor Maids are required to wear royal blue mock <b>turtleneck</b> and white cotton vest, jet-black slacks, and clean black footwear. For parades white gloves are added. The rest are required at a convention for the parade, formal group picture, and banquet.|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Suttirat Anne Larlarb {{says the}} real Jobs never wore his trademark <b>turtleneck</b> jumper {{at any of}} the launches: [...] "The <b>turtleneck</b> was the off book decision. In those 3 actual launches, in real life, he never wore that. In the 1998 portion of the film, in real life he was wearing a dark greyish/brownish suit. We made it for him as a back up idea in case we needed to adhere to it. As we got closer to the time of filming, I thought we'd set up rules for 1984, we'd set up rules for 1988 – there's so much of the film that's about design and he was about design." [...] Fassbender also remarked that the historically inaccurate black <b>turtleneck</b> for the third act was intentional, believing that wearing the attire [...] "felt like I had arrived at [...] vision, that the person had arrived." [...] Fassbender later added that he and Danny Boyle decided on this look during filming, and wanted to [...] "give the audience kind of a payoff." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{designing}} Sasuke's {{appearance in}} Part II, Kishimoto's main {{objective was to}} make him look cool. For this, he tried several outfits, such as wrapping him in Shimenawa to evoke the design Orochimaru, then Sasuke's master. He also tried other clothing such as a <b>turtleneck</b> and a military uniform to show [...] "cleanliness". However, he ended up choosing Japanese-style clothes with a Chokutō-style sword.
