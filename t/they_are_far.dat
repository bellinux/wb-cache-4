The annual global export value of {{pharmaceutical}} plants in 2012 was over US$2.2 billion. In many countries there is little regulation of traditional medicine, but the World Health Organization is coordinating a network to encourage safe and rational usage. Medicinal plants face both general threats such as climate change and habitat loss, and the specific threat of over-collection to meet market demand.|$|E
5|$|Katherine Marlowe is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. She is the coldly calculating leader of a secret society whose roots date back over four hundred years {{to the court of}} Queen Elizabeth I. She has a long-standing rivalry with Nathan Drake over Sir Francis Drake’s ring – something they both contend is rightfully theirs and is also the key to an ancient mystery. Katherine Marlowe is a much more cerebral enemy than Drake has confronted in the past, using both psychological and physical tactics to get what she is after. Marlowe also has the assistance of her team of highly trained agents in this secret society – <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> more elusive and dangerous than the hired guns Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan have faced before. She treats her subordinates with slight disdain, getting annoyed with Talbot for hiring Charlie Cutter. Marlowe appears to have studied Nathan's past and reveals that he's not actually the direct decedent of Sir Francis Drake - he was merely in an orphanage named after the great explorer. She first meets a teenage Drake in Colombia, forcing him to give her the Cipher disk he had just stolen from a museum to her but fails to get Sir Francis Drakes ring when he runs off. Twenty years later, she meets with Drake in an Alleyway and steals his ring. However, she soon discovers it's a fake and promptly loses both the disc and the ring when Drake steals both. Marlowe then sends Talbot and her agents to France and Syria, successfully getting the clues to the location of Ubar. She then captures Nate and Sully and leaves for the lost city. Nathan eventually finds her using a winch to drag out King Solomon's hallucinogenic Talisman from the lakes in Ubar and destroys the foundations of the city, causing Marlowe to fall into a pool of quicksand. Though Drake attempts to save her, Marlowe submerges and dies.|$|E

25|$|While a few mares may be {{somewhat}} more distractible or irritable when in heat, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> less easily distracted than a stallion at any time. Solid training usually minimizes hormonal behavior. For competitive purposes, mares are sometimes placed on hormone therapies, such as the drug Regumate, to help control hormonally based behavior. Some riders also use various herbal remedies, most of which have not been extensively tested for effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Heating by {{low-energy}} cosmic rays: The first mechanism {{proposed for}} heating the ISM was heating by low-energy cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are an efficient heating source able to penetrate {{in the depths}} of molecular clouds. Cosmic rays transfer energy to gas through both ionization and excitation and to free electrons through Coulomb interactions. Low-energy cosmic rays (a few MeV) are more important because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> more numerous than high-energy cosmic rays.|$|E

25|$|Terminal alkynes {{have the}} formula RC2H. An example is methyl{{acetylene}} (propyne using IUPAC nomenclature). Terminal alkynes, like acetylene itself, are mildly acidic, with pKa values of around 25. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> more acidic than alkenes and alkanes, which have pKa values of around 40 and 50, respectively. The acidic hydrogen on terminal alkynes {{can be replaced}} by a variety of groups resulting in halo-, silyl-, and alkoxoalkynes. The carbanions generated by deprotonation of terminal alkynes are called acetylides.|$|E

For example, in the Test series between Australia and England in 2010-11, there were 258 extras in five matches, of which 76 were byes (29.4% of the extras).

25|$|In the Solar System, {{the inner}} planets are terrestrial, {{and the outer}} ones are gas giants, but discoveries of extrasolar planets suggest that this {{arrangement}} may not be at all common: numerous Jupiter-sized bodies {{have been found in}} close orbit about their primary, disrupting potential HZs. However, present data for extrasolar planets is likely to be skewed towards that type (large planets in close orbits) because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> easier to identify; thus {{it remains to be seen}} which type of planetary system is the norm, or indeed if there is one.|$|E
25|$|One-quarter of the Soviet Union {{consisted}} of mountains or mountainous terrain. With the significant exceptions of the Ural Mountains {{and the mountains}} of eastern Siberia, the mountains occupy the southern periphery of the Soviet Union. The Urals, because they have traditionally been considered the natural boundary between Europe and Asia {{and because they are}} valuable sources of minerals, were the most famous of the country's nine major ranges. In terms of elevation (comparable to the Appalachians) and vegetation, however, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> from impressive, and they do not serve as a formidable natural barrier.|$|E

He argues that the presence and authority of women in public spaces corrupts the male youth, turning them effeminate and void of patriotic passion.

25|$|Like early {{programming}} languages such as Fortran, Algol, Cobol and Lisp, assemblers {{have been}} available since the 1950s and the first generations of text based computer interfaces. However, assemblers came first as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> simpler to write than compilers for high-level languages. This is because each mnemonic along with the addressing modes and operands of an instruction translates rather directly into the numeric representations of that particular instruction, without much context or analysis. There have also been several classes of translators and semi automatic code generators with properties similar to both assembly and high level languages, with speedcode as {{perhaps one of the}} better known examples.|$|E
25|$|Unlike dynamic {{metabolic}} simulation, FBA {{assumes that}} the internal concentration of metabolites within a system stays constant over time and thus is unable to provide anything other than steady-state solutions. It is unlikely that FBA could, for example, simulate the functioning of a nerve cell. Since the internal concentration of metabolites is not considered within a model, {{it is possible that}} an FBA solution could contain metabolites at a concentration too high to be biologically acceptable. This is a problem that dynamic metabolic simulations would probably avoid. One advantage of the simplicity of FBA over dynamic simulations is that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> less computationally expensive, allowing the simulation of large numbers of perturbations to the network. A second advantage is that the reconstructed model can be substantially simpler by avoiding the need to consider enzyme rates and the effect of complex interactions on enzyme kinetics.|$|E
25|$|HPV- and HPV+OPC are {{distinguishable}} at {{the molecular}} level. The naturally occurring (wild type) p53 is widely involved in cellular processes, including autophagy, response to DNA damage, cell cycle regulation and senescence, apoptosis and the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. The gene encoding p53 is inactivated by E6 at the protein level and is found as the wild type in HPV+OPC but mutated in HPV-OPC. In HPV+OPC p53 protein undergoes accelerated degradation by E6, drastically reducing its levels, while in HPV-OPC it undergoes genetic mutation, which may result in synthesis of an abnormal p53 protein, that may not only be inactive as a tumour suppressor, but can also bind and inactivate any non-mutated wild type p53, {{with an increase in}} oncogenic activity. Although p53 mutations occur in HPV+OPC, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>far</b> less common than in HPV-OPC (26% vs 48%), and do not appear to affect clinical outcome.|$|E
