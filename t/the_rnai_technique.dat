40|$|Caenorhabditis elegans is {{an ideal}} {{organism}} {{for the study of}} the molecular basis of fundamental biological processes such as germ-line development, especially because of availability of the whole genome sequence and applicability of the RNA interference (RNAi) technique. To identify genes involved in germ-line development, we produced subtracted cDNA pools either enriched for or deprived of the cDNAs from germ-line tissues. We then performed differential hybridization on the high-density cDNA grid, on which about 7, 600 nonoverlapping expressed sequence tag (EST) clones were spotted, to identify a set of genes specifically expressed in the germ line. One hundred and sixty-eight clones were then tested with <b>the</b> <b>RNAi</b> <b>technique.</b> Of these, 15 clones showed sterility with a variety of defects in germ-line development. Seven of them led to the production of unfertilized eggs, because of defects in spermatogenesis (4 clones), or defects in the oocytes (3 clones). The other 8 clones led to failure of oogenesis. These failures were caused by germ-line proliferation defect (Glp phenotype), meiotic arrest, and defects in sperm–oocyte switch (Mog phenotype) among others.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of lepidopterans, about 90 %, are moths. Some moths, particularly their caterpillars, are major agricultural and forestry pests {{in many parts of}} the world. However, some other members of moths, such as the silkworm Bombyx mori, are famous for their economic value. Fire et al. in 1998 initially found that exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can silence the homolog endogenous mRNA in organisms, which is called RNA interference (RNAi). Soon after, <b>the</b> <b>RNAi</b> <b>technique</b> proved to be very promising not only in gene function determination but also in pest control. However, later studies demonstrate that performing RNAi in moths is not as straightforward as shown in other insect taxa. Nevertheless, since 2007, especially after 2010, an increasing number of reports have been published that describe successful RNAi experiments in different moth species either on gene function analysis or on pest management exploration. So far, more than 100 peer-reviewed papers have reported successful RNAi experiments in moths, covering 10 families and 25 species. By using classic and novel dsRNA delivery methods, these studies effectively silence the expression of various target genes and determine their function in larval development, reproduction, immunology, resistance against chemicals, and other biological processes. In addition, a number of laboratory and field trials have demonstrated that RNAi is also a potential strategy for moth pest management.

To support the ability of this new method to generate a model for a disease, we created an ABCA 1 -deficient mouse line that mimics Tangier disease under controlled conditions. Thus, it should now be possible to rapidly establish human genetic diseases as a whole animal model without the use of embryonic stem cell and gene targeting.

40|$|Abstract RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) silences {{gene expression}} by guiding mRNA degradation in a sequence-specific fashion. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), an intermediate of the RNAi pathway, {{has been shown}} to be very effective in inhibiting virus infection in mammalian cells and cultured plant cells. Here, we report that Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) could inhibit tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA accumulation by targeting the gene encoding the replication-asso-ciated 126 kDa protein in intact plant tissue. Our results indicate that transiently expressed shRNA efficiently interfered with TMV infection. The interference observed is sequence-specific, and time- and site-dependent. Transiently expressed shRNA corresponding to the TMV 126 kDa protein gene did not inhibit cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), an unrelated tobamovirus. In order to interfere with TMV accumulation in tobacco leaves, it is essential for the shRNA constructs to be infiltrated into the same leaves as TMV inoculation. Our results support the view that RNAi opens the door for novel therapeutic procedures against virus diseases.

However, the role of Op-iap 3 during OpMNPV infection has not been previously examined. To determine the function of the Op-IAP 3 protein during OpMNPV infection, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to silence Op-iap 3 expression during OpMNPV infection of Ld 652 Y cells. Infected cells treated with Op-iap 3 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) did not accumulate detectable Op-iap 3 mRNA, confirming that the Op-iap 3 gene was effectively silenced. Op-IAP 3 protein was found to be a component of the budded virion; however, in OpMNPV-infected cells treated with Op-iap 3 dsRNA, the Op-IAP 3 protein that was introduced by the inoculum virus decreased to almost undetectable levels by 12 h after dsRNA addition. Apoptosis was observed in infected cells treated with Op-iap 3 dsRNA beginning at 12 h, and by 48 h, almost all of the cells had undergone apoptosis.

40|$|Phosphoenolpyruvate {{carboxylase}} (PEPC) is a {{key enzyme}} of primary metabolism in bacteria, algae, and vascular plants, and {{is believed to be}} cytosolic. Here we show that rice (Oryza sativa L.) has a plant-type PEPC, Osppc 4, that is targeted to the chloroplast. Osppc 4 was expressed in all organs tested and showed high expression in the leaves. Its expression in the leaves was confined to mesophyll cells, and Osppc 4 accounted for approximately one-third of total PEPC protein in the leaf blade. Recombinant Osppc 4 was active in the PEPC reaction, showing Vmax comparable to cytosolic isozymes. Knockdown of Osppc 4 expression by <b>the</b> <b>RNAi</b> <b>technique</b> resulted in stunting at the vegetative stage, which was much more marked when rice plants were grown with ammonium than with nitrate as the nitrogen source. Comparison of leaf metabolomes of ammonium-grown plants suggested that the knockdown suppressed ammonium assimilation and subsequent amino acid synthesis by reducing levels of organic acids, which are carbon skeleton donors for these processes. We also identified the chloroplastic PEPC gene in other Oryza species, all of which are adapted to waterlogged soil where the major nitrogen source is ammonium. This suggests that, in addition to glycolysis, the genus Oryza has a unique route to provide organic acids for ammonium assimilation that involves a chloroplastic PEPC, and that this route is crucial for growth with ammonium. This work provides evidence for diversity of primary ammonium assimilation in the leaves of vascular plants...|$|E

RegIV is associated with regeneration, and cell growth, survival, adhesion and resistance to apoptosis. We aimed to study RegIV expression in pancreatic cancer {{and its relationship to}} GLI 1. Methods: GLI 1 and RegIV expression were evaluated in tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissues of pancreatic cancer patients and 5 pancreatic cancer cell lines by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the correlation between them. The GLI 1 -shRNA lentiviral vector was constructed and transfected into PANC- 1, and lentiviral vector containing the GLI 1 expression sequence was constructed and transfected into BxPC- 3. GLI 1 and RegIV expression were evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Finally we demonstrated RegIV to be the target of GLI 1 by chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Results: The results of IHC and qRT-PCR showed that RegIV and GLI 1 expression was higher in pancreatic cancer tissues versus adjacent normal tissues (p, 0. 001). RegIV expression correlated with GLI 1 expression in these tissues (R = 0. 795, p, 0. 0001).

Several proteins, including odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and odorant receptors (ORs), are involved in this process. Odorant receptors are ion channels formed by a binding unit OR and an odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco). The main goal of this study was to characterize the Orco gene of Rhodnius prolixus (RproOrco) and to infer its biological functions using gene silencing. The full-length RproOrco gene sequence was downloaded from VectorBase. This gene has 7 introns and is located in the genome SuperContig GL 563069 : 1, 017, 713 – 1, 023, 165. RproOrco encodes a protein of 473 amino acids, with predicted 7 transmembrane domains, and is highly expressed in the antennae during all R. prolixus developmental stages. <b>The</b> <b>RNAi</b> <b>technique</b> effectively silenced RproOrco, reducing the gene's expression by approximately 73 %. Interestingly, the effect of gene silencing persisted for more than 100 days, indicating a prolonged effect of dsRNA that was maintained even after molting. The phenotypic effects of silencing involved the following: (1) loss of the ability to find a vertebrate host in a timely manner, (2) decreased ingested blood volume, (3) delayed and decreased molt rate, (4) increased mortality rate, and (5) decreased egg laying. Our data strongly suggest that dsOrco disrupts R. prolixus host-finding behavior, which is further reflected in the blood ingestion, molting, mortality, and egg laying data. This study clearly demonstrates that Orco is an excellent target for controlling triatomine populations.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) silencing on the malignant biological behavior of MCF- 7 breast cancer cells. COX- 2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and unassociated sequences were synthesized and a shRNA lentiviral vector was constructed. The vector was transfected into MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, in which clones with stable expression were screened out. The expression of COX- 2 mRNA and protein was silenced using RNA interference (RNAi). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, a mononuclear cell direct cytotox-icity assay (MTT assay), a cell invasion assay and scratch tests were performed to investigate the downregulation of COX- 2 mRNA and protein expression, the proliferative activity and growth rate of MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) penetrating capacity, the cell movement and migratory capacity, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -A and VEGF-C protein expression. The results revealed that the sequence-specific shRNA significantly downregulated the expression of COX- 2 at the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, the downregulation of COX- 2 expression markedly decreased the invasive and metastatic capacities of the cells, suppressed the proliferation, decreased the rate of growth, decreased the capacity of GBM penetra-tion and migration, and decreased the protein expression of VEGF-A and VEGF-C, the two key factors that regulate tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. In conclusion, <b>the</b> <b>RNAi</b> <b>technique</b> effectively silenced COX- 2 gene expression and inhibited MCF- 7 breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis by decreasing VEGF-A and VEGF-C expression, which regulates tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.

These results were verified for protein (R =  0. 939, p =  0. 018) and mRNA expression (R =  0. 959, p =  0. 011) in 5 pancreatic cancer cell lines. RegIV mRNA and protein expression was decreased (94. 7 ± 0. 3 %, 84. 1 ± 0. 5 %; respectively) when GLI 1 was knocked down (82. 1 ± 3. 2 %, 76. 7 ± 2. 2 %; respectively) by <b>the</b> <b>RNAi</b> <b>technique.</b> GLI 1 overexpression in mRNA and protein level (924. 5 ± 5. 3 %, 362. 1 ± 3. 5 %; respectively) induced RegIV overexpression (729. 1 ± 4. 3 %, 339. 0 ± 3. 7 %; respectively). Moreover, CHIP and EMSA assays showed GLI 1 protein bound to RegIV promotor regions (GATCATCCA) in pancreatic cancer cells.

40|$|E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, {{which is}} {{essential}} for the maintenance of the architecture and integrity of epithelial tissues, is often lost during carcinoma progression. To better understand the nature of alterations of cell-cell interactions at the early stages of neoplastic evolution of epithelial cells, we examined the line of nontransformed IAR- 2 epithelial cells and their descendants, lines of IAR- 6 - 1 epithelial cells transformed with dimethylnitrosamine and IAR 1170 cells transformed with N-RasG 12 D. IAR- 6 - 1 and IAR 1170 cells retained E-cadherin, displayed discoid or polygonal morphology, and formed monolayers similar to IAR- 2 monolayer. Fluorescence staining, however, showed that in IAR 1170 and IAR- 6 - 1 cells the marginal actin bundle, which is typical of nontransformed IAR- 2 cells, disappeared, and the continuous adhesion belt (tangential adherens junctions (AJs)) was replaced by radially oriented E-cadherin-based AJs. Time-lapse imaging of IAR- 6 - 1 cells stably transfected with GFP-E-cadherin revealed that AJs in transformed cells are very dynamic and unstable. The regulation of AJ assembly by Rho family small GTPases was different in nontransformed and in transformed IAR epithelial cells. As our experiments with the ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 and the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin have shown, the formation and maintenance of radial AJs critically depend on myosin II-mediated contractility. Using <b>the</b> <b>RNAi</b> <b>technique</b> for the depletion of mDia 1 and loading cells with N 17 Rac, we established that mDia 1 and Rac are involved in the assembly of tangential AJs in nontransformed epithelial cells but not in radial AJs in transformed cells. Neoplastic transformation changed cell-cell interactions, preventing contact paralysis after the establishment of cell-cell contact and promoting dynamic cell-cell adhesion and motile behavior of cells. It is suggested that the disappearance of the marginal actin bundle and rearrangements of AJs may change the adhesive function of E-cadherin and play an active role in migratory activity of carcinoma cells...|$|E

This study used RNAi technique to explore the interfering effect of COX- 2 geneexpression and the influence on the malignant proliferation of A 2 cells after quenching COX- 2 in vitro. Methods Three COX- 2 siRNA expression vectors with human U 6 promoter were constructed. The COX- 2 siRNA vectors and the vacant vector (pEGFP) were transfected into A 2 cells with lipofectamine respectively. The cell strains transfected were selected. The change of COX- 2 expression levels was examined by Western blot and RT-PCR. The effects on the proliferationof A 2 cells after silencing COX- 2 were detected by cell growth curve and clonogenic assay in vitro. Results The three siRNA and U 6 promoter cloned into pEGFP plasmid were validated by PCR, restriction endonucleases identification, DNA sequencing and BLAST alignment. The cell strains transfected were coded as A 2 - 3, A 2 - 7, A 2 - 10 and A 2 -p respectively. Green fluorescence was seen in A 2 -p cells and not in A 2 - 3, A 2 - 7 and A 2 - 10 cells in 24 h, 48 h and 72 hafter transfected. The results of RT-PCR and Western blot showed the three siRNA expression vectors acted effectively and the expression of COX- 2 was inhibited in different extent. In contrast to A 2 cells, COX- 2 mRNA levels of A 2 - 3, A 2 - 7 and A 2 - 10 cells were reduced 15. 6 %, 20. 4 % and 64. 2 % respectively, and COX- 2 protein expressions of them were reduced 23. 7 %, 36. 7 % and 60. 2 % respectively. The results of cell growth curve and clonogenic assay showed the growth of A 2 - 10 cell slowed and the clonal formation rate was reduced. However the growth of A 2 - 3 and A 2 - 7 cells had no obvious changes vs controls (A 2 and A 2 -p).

40|$|Follicle {{stimulating}} hormone (FSH) {{is known}} as the key hormone capable of causing proliferation of granulosa cells in the ovary. The classical receptor belongs to the G protein-coupled superfamily and is designated FSHR- 1. A variant in the FSH receptor {{has been shown to be}} functional in mouse ovaries. The variant receptor is designated as FSHR- 3, and when bound by FSH activates a pathway that shares similar characteristics to the growth factor type I receptor pathway, with no increase in cAMP. The FSHR- 3 variant activates MAPK upon binding to FSH, and causes proliferation of cells on which it is known to be expressed. For example ID 8 mouse ovarian surface epithelium cells (MOSEC), a cell line that when introduced in immunocompetent mice causes tumors similar to human ovarian cancer and which also express FSHR- 3, proliferated in response to FSH.

We took the transgenic approach, in combination with <b>the</b> RNA interference (<b>RNAi)</b> <b>technique,</b> to elucidate <b>the</b> role of mosquito REL 1, a homolog of Drosophila Dorsal, in regulation of Toll immune pathway in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. By transforming the mosquitoes with ΔREL 1 -A or a double-stranded RNA construct of REL 1 driven by the female fat body-specific vitellogenin (Vg) promoter with the pBac[3 xP 3 -EGFP, afm] vector, we generated two different transgenic mosquito strains, one with overexpressed AaREL 1 and the second with AaREL 1 knockdown. Both strains had a single copy of the respective transgene, and the expression in both transgenic mosquitoes was highly activated by blood feeding. Vg-ΔREL 1 -A transgenic mosquitoes activate Toll immune pathway in the fat body by blood feeding. The overexpression of both isoforms, AaREL 1 -A and AaREL 1 -B, in Vg-ΔREL 1 -A transgenic mosquitoes resulted in the concomitant activation of Aedes Spätzle 1 A and Serpin- 27 A, independent of septic injury. The same phenotype was observed in <b>the</b> mosquitoes with <b>RNAi</b> knockdown of an Aedes homolog to Drosophila cactus, an IκB inhibitor of Drosophila Toll pathway. The effect of <b>the</b> transgenic <b>RNAi</b> knockdown of AaREL 1 on mosquito innate immunity was revealed by increased susceptibility to the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana and the reduced induction of Spz 1 A and Serpin- 27 A gene expression after fungal challenge.

40|$|Many of {{the wild}} and some {{cultivated}} species of potato are true diploids {{and are therefore more}} amenable for genetic studies than the majority of tetra ploid cultivars. However, the use of these diploid Solanum species is complicated by almost universal self-incompatibility (51). In Solanum, 51 is gametophytic and pistil specificity is controlled by a polymorphic ribonuclease (S-RNase), as found in other members of the Solanaceae. The genetic engineering of self-compatible (SC) diploid potato lines would benefit potato breeding in genera l and allow inbred lines to be established for the first time. This would facilitate genetic analyses including that of complex traits such as drought resistance or yield. The aim of this thesis is to downregulate the expression of S-RNases in diploid potatoes using <b>the</b> <b>RNAi</b> <b>technique</b> and established procedures for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. This approach to engineering self-compatibility has already been successfully demonstrated in SI Petunia infiata (Lee et al., 1994) and other species of the Solanaceae. To date just a handful of S-RNase sequences are available for potato species. The characterization of S-RNases in targeted diploid Solanum species was an initial requirement for our approach, To develop the tools, S-alleles have initially been characterized in both Petunia infiata and p, hybrida cv Mitchell both phenotypically (by pollination tests using a diallel cross) and/or genotypically (by RT-PCR). This approach was then transferred to three diploid potato species, specifically accessions of Solanum stenotomum, Solanum phureja and Solanum okadae. These wild species are important sources of new traits studied by The James Hutton Institute (formally the Scottish Crop Research Institute). The approach taken to amplify partial S-RNase sequences from pistil RNA was RT-PCR using a degenerate primer. PCR products were cloned using a TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. For two alleles full length sequences were obtained by 5 'RACE. Database searches with t hese sequences, revealed sixteen S-RNases several of which are novel. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out with the cloned S-RNases together with selected published S-RNase and S- like RNase sequences of solanaceous species. The S-RNases revealed extensive trans-generic evolution and are clearly distinct from and distantly related to S-like RNases. For two alleles (501 and 502), S-RNase gene expression profiling was performed to check the developmental expression of the S-RNase gene, t issue-specific expression and also test whether t hese S-RNases (e. g. Sor and SorRNases) are expressed at a similar level. Wide variation in S-RNase gene expression levels {{have been reported in the}} literature. An RNAi construct has been designed to down-regulate two speCific 5 - RNases in an SOl/S 02 heterozygote of S. okadae. To increase the chance of silencing, the RNAi construct has been designed to use a chimeric 5 - RNase gene involving the 5 ' end of the SorRNase and the 3 ' end of the SoyRNase. The correct chimeric S-RNase construct (Sol/SorRNase) has now been identified and inserted into an RNAi vector (pHellsgate 8) using Gateway~ technology. This RNAi construct (pHG 8 -S 01 / So. 2) is now a valuable resource for use in S-RNase gene silencing in potato leading to the development of self-compatible diploid potato lines and ultimately the development of the first inbred lines of S. okadae.

40|$|Insulin analogues {{have been}} {{developed}} with the aim to provide better glycaemic control to diabetic patients. They are generated by modifying the insulin backbone which, however, may alter relevant biochemical characteristics such as the affinity to insulin receptor and type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR), and the insulin receptor dissociation rate. As a result insulin analogues may exhibit stronger mitogenic potency than regular insulin. Normal mammary epithelial cells show high expression of insulin receptor and IGF-IR and mammary cancer cells frequently even show overexpression of both receptors, thus suggesting mammary epithelial cells to be a sensitive target for insulin analogue - mediated proliferation. Indeed, treatment of female Sprague-Dawley rats with the insulin analogue B 10 Asp resulted in strong increase {{in the incidence of}} mammary tumours. Of all the insulin analogues available nowadays for therapeutical use, a standard two-year carcinogenicity study has been performed only for Insulin Glargine (Lantus®). The study showed similar incidence of mammary tumours in rats treated with Insulin Glargine or normal insulin. However, this study reported a very high mortality rate in all experimental groups thus raising questions on the conclusions drawn. In vitro studies on the effect of insulin analogues on mammary cell lines are scarce and lack comprehensiveness. In addition, the biochemical mechanism of the proliferative effect of the insulin analogues has not been clarified. This thesis aimed to study and compare in detail the proliferative potency of insulin analogues available for therapeutical use in insulin responsive mammary epithelial cell lines and to clarify the molecular and biochemical mechanism behind the proliferative potency. The role of insulin receptor, IGF-IR and related signalling pathways was analysed for the insulin analogue showing the strongest proliferative effect in comparison to regular insulin. Among a panel of seven mammary epithelial cell lines, MCF 7 (a tumour cell line) and MCF 10 A (a benign cell line) showed the strongest insulin response. Proliferation assays on MCF 10 A cells demonstrated equipotency of four insulin analogues (Insulin Aspart, Insulin Lispro, Insulin Glargine and Insulin Detemir) to regular insulins (human and bovine insulin). However, proliferation assays performed in MCF 7 cells revealed that Insulin Glargine induced significantly stronger proliferation than regular insulin and the other three insulin analogues. This finding was corroborated by BrdU incorporation studies in MCF 7 cells. Activation of the two insulin-related signalling pathways - PI 3 K and MAPK pathway - was determined by studying the phosphorylation status of key signalling molecules (Akt and GSK 3 α/β for PI 3 K and Erk 1 / 2 for MAPK pathway). In MCF 10 A cells, all insulin analogues were equipotent to regular insulin in inducing phosphorylation of GSK 3 α/β and Erk 1 / 2. Interestingly, Insulin Glargine induced significantly higher phosphorylation of Akt in comparison to regular insulin in MCF 10 A cells. On the contrary, in MCF 7 cells, Insulin Glargine induced strong phosphorylation of the three signalling molecules studied. The signalling potency of Insulin Glargine was significantly stronger than that of regular insulin and all other insulin analogues. Use of specific inhibitors showed that MAPK is the major proliferation pathway activated by Insulin Glargin in MCF 7 cells. In order to determine the contribution of insulin receptor and IGF-IR to the strong mitogenic potency of Insulin Glargine, <b>the</b> <b>RNAi</b> <b>technique</b> was utilized to specifically target insulin receptor and IGF-IR. Study of signalling pathways and proliferation under knockdown conditions clearly demonstrated the activation of IGF-IR by Insulin Glargine whereas the other compounds activated the insulin receptor. Thus, the increased proliferative ability of Insulin Glargine in comparison to regular insulin is the result of IGF-IR activation. IGF-IR immunoprecipitated from cells treated with Insulin Glargine or regular insulin showed much higher tyrosine phosphorylation levels in the Insulin Glargine - treated cells, which substantiates the findings from the knockdown experiments. Moreover, analysis of expression levels of cyclin D 1, an IGF-I responsive gene, by quantitative RT-PCR showed higher expression levels in MCF 7 cells treated with Insulin Glargine than in cells treated with regular insulin, again corroborating the strong activation of IGF-IR by Insulin Glargine. In order to clarify the potential activation of the established cross-talk between insulin receptor/IGF-IR and estrogen receptor-α (ERα) by insulin analogues, we determined the activation of ERα by analysing the phosphorylation status of Ser 118 at ERα as well as ERE-dependent luciferase gene expression. In comparison to regular insulin, Insulin Glargine induced significantly stronger phosphorylation of ERα at Ser 118 and slightly higher luciferase activity. However, since ERα was only weakly activated by Insulin Glargine, modulation of ERα activity is unlikely to play a strong role in rendering high proliferative ability to Insulin Glargine. Finally, the possible tumour-promoting potential of Insulin Glargine was studied by wound healing, transwell and matrigel assays. The assays demonstrated similar migration-inducing potential of Insulin Glargine and regular human insulin in MCF 7 cells. In summary, this study shows that different from regular insulin and other insulin analogues studied, which activate the insulin receptor and the PI 3 K pathway, Insulin Glargine activates the IGF-IR and the MAPK pathway too, and is a strong mitogen in breast cancer cells showing high IGF-IR expression. Insulin Glargine may therefore be of risk for patients with breast cancer or as yet undetected (pre-) cancerous lesions...|$|E
40|$|Many genes have several, {{sometimes}} divergent functions during development. Therefore, {{timing of}} gene knockdown for functional analysis during development {{has to be}} done with precise temporal control, as loss of a gene's function at early stages prevents its analysis later in development. RNAi, in combination with the accessibility of chicken embryos, is an effective approach for temporally controlled analysis of gene function during neural development. Here, we describe novel plasmid vectors that contain cell type-specific promoters/enhancers to drive the expression of a fluorescent marker, followed directly by a miR 30 -RNAi transcript for gene silencing. These vectors allow for direct tracing of cells experiencing gene silencing by the bright fluorescence. The level of knockdown is sufficient to reproduce the expected pathfinding defects upon perturbation of genes with known axon guidance functions. Mixing different vectors prior to electroporation enables the simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes in independent regions of the spinal cord. This permits complex cellular and molecular interactions to be examined during development, in a fast and precise manner. The advancements of <b>the</b> in ovo <b>RNAi</b> <b>technique</b> that we describe will not only markedly enhance functional gene analysis in the chicken, but also could be adapted to other organisms in developmental studie...|$|R

The arrested cells became elongated at the posterior end like the G 1 -phase cells generated by knockdown of CycE 1 /CYC 2 in a previous study. However, ∼ 5 % of the G 1 cells {{in the current study}} also possessed multiply branched posterior ends, which have not previously been observed in T. brucei. DAPI and immunofluorescence staining showed a single nucleus, kinetoplast, basal body, and flagellum in the anterior portion of each G 1 cell. The split and grossly extended posterior ends were heavily stained with antibodies to tyrosinated α-tubulin, suggesting an accumulation of newly synthesized microtubules. A significant population of anucleate cells (zoids), apparently derived from kinetoplast-dictated cytokinesis and cell division of the G 1 cells, also had extended and branched posterior ends filled with newly synthesized microtubules. This continued posterior extension of microtubules in the G 1 cells and zoids suggests that CRK 1 and CRK 2 exert a coordinated control on G 1 /S passage and the limited growth of the microtubule corset toward the posterior end. This connection may provide a new insight into the mechanism of morphological maintenance of an ancient protist during its cell cycle progression...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background High amylose starch has {{attracted}} particular interest {{because of its}} correlation {{with the amount of}} Resistant Starch (RS) in food. RS plays a role similar to fibre with beneficial effects for human health, providing protection from several diseases such as colon cancer, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. Amylose content can be modified by a targeted manipulation of the starch biosynthetic pathway. In particular, the inactivation of the enzymes involved in amylopectin synthesis can lead to the increase of amylose content. In this work, genes encoding starch branching enzymes of class II (SBEIIa) were silenced using <b>the</b> RNA interference (<b>RNAi)</b> <b>technique</b> in two cultivars of durum wheat, using two different methods of transformation (biolistic and Agrobacterium). Expression of RNAi transcripts was targeted to the seed endosperm using a tissue-specific promoter. Results Amylose content was markedly increased in the durum wheat transgenic lines exhibiting SBEIIa gene silencing. Moreover the starch granules in these lines were deformed, possessing an irregular and deflated shape and being smaller than those present in the untransformed controls. Two novel granule bound proteins, identified by SDS-PAGE in SBEIIa RNAi lines, were investigated by mass spectrometry and shown to have strong homologies to the waxy proteins. RVA analysis showed new pasting properties associated with high amylose lines in comparison with untransformed controls. Finally, pleiotropic effects on other starch genes were found by semi-quantitative and Real-Time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Conclusion We have found that the silencing of SBEIIa genes in durum wheat causes obvious alterations in granule morphology and starch composition, leading to high amylose wheat. Results obtained with two different methods of transformation and in two durum wheat cultivars were comparable. </p...|$|R
