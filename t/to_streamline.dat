By then, Norway was the only country with a territorial claim to Antarctica to not have an all-year research station on the continent.

To ease logistics, Norway took the initiative to establish Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN), a cooperation between the countries with bases in Queen Maud Land <b>to</b> <b>streamline</b> transport costs.

The first flight that was a preliminary to DROMLAN was made in 2000 from Cape Town, South Africa, to Henriksenskjera, where a Twin Otter was used onwards to Troll.|$|E
5|$|To expand {{upon the}} concept of Reserve {{component}} and National Guard components, the First Army activated Division East and Division West, two commands responsible for reserve units' readiness and mobilization exercises.

Division East took control of reserve units in states east of the Mississippi River, eliminating the need for the 24th Infantry Division headquarters.

Carney touted humanitarian successes of U.S. policy in Haiti, including success in preventing the spread of AIDS and providing lunch money to upwards of 500,000 Haitian students each school day.

5|$|In March 1942, Bush sent {{a report}} to Roosevelt {{outlining}} work by Robert Oppenheimer on the nuclear cross section of uranium-235. Oppenheimer's calculations, which Bush had George Kistiakowsky check, estimated that the critical mass of a sphere of uranium-235 was {{in the range of}} 2.5 to 5 kilograms, with a destructive power of around 2,000 tons of TNT. Moreover, it appeared that plutonium might be even more fissile. After conferring with Brigadier General Lucius D. Clay about the construction requirements, Bush drew up a submission for $85 million in fiscal year 1943 for four pilot plants, which he forwarded to Roosevelt on June 17, 1942. With the Army on board, Bush moved <b>to</b> <b>streamline</b> oversight of the project by the OSRD, replacing the S-1 Section with a new S-1 Executive Committee.|$|E

Asymmetrical distribution function that converts randomness in zero-field <b>to</b> <b>streamlined</b> {{one in a}} very high electric field is employed. The ultimate drift velocity {{is found to be}} appropriate thermal velocity for a given dimensionality for non-degenerately doped nanostructure. However, the ultimate drift velocity is the Fermi velocity for degenerately doped nanostructures. Quantum and high-field effects controlling the transport of carrier in nanostructures are described.
