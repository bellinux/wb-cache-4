40|$|Abstract- Evolution of {{autonomous}} cooperation pulls away the traditional centralized approaches towards the decentralized approaches in logistic networks. In this concept, knowledge and decisions are distributed {{among the participants}} of the logistic process. Vehicles and goods become intelligent, interactive, and capable of deciding about how to achieve their aims. Software agent technology provides a means of bringing about autonomy by information sharing and decision-making capabilities. This paper presents the approach of integrating agent technology and knowledge management approaches like clustering techniques to ensure robust and efficient planning and scheduling in the transportation domain. Logistic entities are represented as software agents, where {{the objective is to}} cluster these entities which have common goals – like packages having the same destination, same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages,</b> etc. The approach of autonomy through software agents and clustering techniques is expected to significantly decrease the communication demand imposed upon the logistic network for a set of required tasks to be performed. An enhanced clustering algorithm has been applied on a logistic scenario and compared with the original algorithm in terms of effective cluster formation with less iteration. This approach identifies challenges in the area of communication that arise from the distributed decision process and the interacting components. raw materials are acquired, transformed, produced and delivered to the end customer.

40|$|This {{current study}} aims to {{identify}} the most feasible <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> for fresh oranges, produced and commercialized in the São Paulo state. In order to do so, three studies of specific cases were considered, under the context of multi cases. It was aimed to determine the cost of processing, packaging and transporting related to the orange commercialization aimed at customers such as wholesalers, supermarkets and Supplying Centers (CEASA’s), from a Packing-House. The results presented and analyzed in this study allowed to indicate that, in general terms, there is no package more feasible economically speaking, considering its use. What was really observed was {{that there is a}} package that is more feasible for each producer considering his specific characteristics, such as: forms of freight negotiations with the customer, the payment of taxes related to transportation, loss levels related to the use of determined packages in long distances, variations of the fruit prices sold to the customer and to the industry, values related to the processing, arbitrage and taxes of financial discounts (according to the type of supermarket). Based on the spreadsheet the producer {{will be able to use}} a tool to help make decisions related not only to the most feasible package to be used, but also as an instrument in defining the best sale price for their fruit (R$/kg), from which profits can be forecasted in all levels of refusals.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{study on}} {{development}} {{and testing of}} packages for transportation of guava fruits was undertaken to evaluate the effect {{of different types of}} packages and vibration level during transportation of guava fruits under ambient storage temperature. Guava fruits were packed in CFB box, plastic crate, wooden box and bamboo basket each. CFB box with cushioning material was also used and fruits packed in respective boxes and tested for the simulation vibration at two levels of 150 rpm and 200 rpm each for two levels and time period of 3 hours and 6 hours each. The quality of guava fruits was observed in terms of physiological loss in weight, acidity, firmness, ascorbic acid and total soluble solids. In all the treatments; physiological loss in weight increased with storage duration, intensity and duration of vibration, where as ascorbic acid and firmness decreased with increasing storage period. Total soluble solids increased steadily during storage. Based upon above parameters, among four types of packages CFB box was found to be best packaging material for maintaining the fruits more fresh and healthy during the simulated vibration treatments in an ambient storage conditions with the minimum losses. The CFB was most suitable package in all respect. Cushioning material as paper cuttings has positive correlation with the quality parameters of fruits packed in CFB box.

40|$|This {{project is}} {{developed}} to recommend {{the health insurance}} package that might suitable to the client regarding the client preferences by implementing Fuzzy Logic Technique. Allianz Insurance Berhad (AMB) is chosen as stakeholder for this project. Allianz provides several types of insurance which are General Insurance, Business Insurance and Life Insurance. There are three (3) different user for this system which are the head of branch which has the role as admin in the system, the insurance agent and the potential client that might use the system to view which health insurance package recommended. Currently, the insurance agent are having a problem to recommend the best package to their customer due to every customer has their different preferences {{that will lead to}} different <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages.</b> Therefore, several objectives had been identified in order to minimize the problem. This insurance recommendation system helps the insurance agent and potential customer to check their suitable package by providing the benefit and the percentage of recommendation on the insurance package according to the client uncertainty client preferences such as age, monthly payment and other risks. Fuzzy expert system is implemented in this project because it is more suitable {{in order to determine the}} percentage of suitable insurance package based on customer preferences. By using this technique, it is easier to identify and explicit the knowledge to determine suitable insurance package that involved which imprecise and vague data. Sugeno-style inferences are used in the fuzzy expert system because it is well suited for mathematical analysis. As the fuzzy expert system prototype have been developed, the combination of health insurance processed data which is the benefits and package characteristic and rules would produce results based on user’s input which are the client preferences. The result of this project depends on the variety of inputs by the user to recommend the suitable insurance package and which is the most recommended. In the future, the system should be improve a lot more widen scope by add other types of insurance package such as properties, travel and transportation package. With the improvement, the system will have much more features that are not limited and can be used in wider perspective...|$|E
40|$|Advancing age {{is leading}} to changes in {{consumer}} needs, desires and aptitude. One need which is continuous, regardless of age, {{is the need for}} food. For some consumer’s [sic] age associated change can consequently limit their ability in grocery shopping and opening of food packages. Openability of food packaging for aged consumer is seen to be a major problem because some types of packages are difficult to open. As a consequence there is an actual need to provide elderly consumers with more supportive environment when grocery shopping and supportive instrument when using the packages by providing sufficient packaging functions. This research is in grocery shopping behaviour and attitude of older consumer (60 +) in different culture associated with various different types of food packaging and packaging utilisation. The aim of this research was to determine the different culture of consumers in grocery shopping behaviour and experience of elder consumers in Bangkok, Thailand with the aged from 60 years and over. Data collection involved quantitative (Questionnaire survey) and qualitative (Focus group) with elder consumers aged from 60 years. The quantitative findings are collected from a consumer questionnaire (n= 100), which mainly focused on consumer grocery shopping behaviour related to packaging utilisation and problems encountered. The result of questionnaire collections were then analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 15. Next, qualitative Focus groups defined in depth the grocery shopping experience as well as packaging utilisation. Each focus group consisted of six or seven adults and was carried out in a familiar social setting. Both the qualitative and quantitative results have identified shopping patterns and motivations for purchase decisions among this age group, and show that elderly consumer interface with both positive and negative experiences when accessing food products. The result shows that the majority of elder people in Bangkok normally go grocery shopping on a weekly basis in one of the multiple food retailers. Most of the participants had already retired from work and they are commonly living with their family member but they do their own house work. However, living situation did not have any affect [sic] in grocery shopping or packaging utilisation. Education and income could be factors that affect purchase decisions and packaging used. Packaging labels seems to be a major problem for aged consumers, as they find them difficult to read. In terms of packaging utilisation, most problems occurred with the packaging closure rather than packaging itself. Consumer health can affect packaging utilisation and openability of some <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> which could lead to injury.
