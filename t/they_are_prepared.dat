5|$|Samarium forms a cyclopentadienide Sm(C5H5)3 and its chloroderivatives Sm(C5H5)2Cl and Sm(C5H5)Cl2. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> by {{reacting}} samarium trichloride with NaC5H5 in tetrahydrofuran. Contrary to cyclopentadienides of {{most other}} lanthanides, in Sm(C5H5)3 some C5H5 rings bridge each other by forming ring vertexes η1 or edges η2 toward another neighboring samarium atom, thereby creating polymeric chains. The chloroderivative Sm(C5H5)2Cl has a dimer structure, which is more accurately expressed as (η5-C5H5)2Sm(µ-Cl)2(η5-C5H5)2. There, the chlorine bridges can be replaced, for instance, by iodine, hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by CN groups.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds {{prepared}} as gemstones are sold on diamond exchanges called bourses. There are 28 registered diamond bourses in the world. Bourses are the final tightly controlled {{step in the}} diamond supply chain; wholesalers and even retailers are able to buy relatively small lots of diamonds at the bourses, after which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> for final sale to the consumer. Diamonds can be sold already set in jewelry, or sold unset ("loose"). According to the Rio Tinto Group, in 2002 the diamonds produced and released to the market were valued at US$9billion as rough diamonds, US$14billion after being cut and polished, US$28billion in wholesale diamond jewelry, and US$57billion in retail sales.|$|E

25|$|Until the {{development}} of agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago, Homo sapiens employed a hunter-gatherer method as their sole means of food collection. This involved combining stationary food sources (such as fruits, grains, tubers, and mushrooms, insect larvae and aquatic mollusks) with wild game, which must be hunted and killed {{in order to be}} consumed. It has been proposed that humans have used fire to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus. Around ten thousand years ago, humans developed agriculture, which substantially altered their diet. This change in diet may also have altered human biology; with the spread of dairy farming providing a new and rich source of food, leading to the evolution of the ability to digest lactose in some adults. Agriculture led to increased populations, {{the development}} of cities, and because of increased population density, the wider spread of infectious diseases. The types of food consumed, {{and the way in which}} <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared,</b> have varied widely by time, location, and culture.|$|E

On 21 March, with the press furore over the [...] "missing witness" [...] at its height, the party changed its stance. During a House of Commons debate, Wigg used parliamentary privilege to ask the Home Secretary to categorically deny the truth of rumours connecting [...] "a minister" [...] to Keeler, Rice-Davies and the Edgecombe shooting. He did not name Profumo, who was not in the House. Later in the debate Barbara Castle, the Labour MP for Blackburn, referred to the [...] "missing witness" [...] and hinted at a possible perversion of justice. The Home Secretary, Henry Brooke, refused to comment, adding that Wigg and Castle should [...] "seek other means of making these insinuations if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>prepared</b> to substantiate them".|$|E
500|$|The {{team found}} it {{difficult}} to fill the remaining places in the company with Asian performers, especially in the chorus. [...] Four other shows with Asian themes had opened or were in rehearsal in New York, and the demand for the few Asian actors was strong. [...] Kelly and the show's choreographer, Carol Haney, journeyed to cities across the country to seek out talent. [...] Agents were sent to other cities; in Honolulu, they found nightclub singer and native Hawaiian Ed Kenney, who would originate Wang Ta. [...] Meanwhile, in New York, the three producers were visiting dance schools. [...] An advertisement in New York Chinatown newspapers received one response. [...] No formal audition was held in San Francisco's Chinatown, and the only find was Forbidden City nightclub comedian Goro [...] "Jack" [...] Suzuki (who soon changed his name to Jack Soo), who was cast as Frankie Wing, comedian at Sammy Fong's Celestial Bar. [...] The role of Fong proved difficult to cast. [...] Initially, it was given to Larry Storch, a nightclub comic, but during the Boston tryouts, it was given to another Caucasian, Larry Blyden, who was married to Carol Haney, the show's choreographer. [...] The role of Madam Liang, Master Wang's sister-in-law, fell to Juanita Hall, a light-skinned African American who had played a Tonkinese (Vietnamese) woman, Bloody Mary, in South Pacific. Another African-American performer, Diahann Carroll, was considered for the cast but not hired. [...] Rodgers later wrote, [...] "what was important was that the actors gave the illusion of being Chinese. [...] This demonstrates one of the most wonderful things about theatre audiences. [...] People want to believe what they see on a stage, and they will gladly go along with whatever is done to achieve the desired effect.
