5|$|As {{with all}} the stops on the Westside MAX, {{displays}} of public artwork {{were included in the}} construction of the stop. Overall the artwork at the station reflects the gathering and dispersal of people and the harvest. Christine Bourdette, a sculptor, working with the architects from OTAK designed some of the artwork at Hatfield Station. Described as a “clash of sensibilities” and “organically abstract”, items include sculptures of bronze baskets and granite balls installed at the southern end of the station. Attached to the station's building is a bronze work entitled “Gathering Rail” which resembles <b>twine</b> woven together and is intended to represent the various themes of the community coming together.|$|E
50|$|<b>Twining</b> Models of Northampton, England, {{was founded}} in 1920 by Ernest W. <b>Twining.</b> The firm had its origins in work <b>Twining</b> was doing as a {{sub-contractor}} to Bassett-Lowke's. It undertook, mostly for Bassett-Lowke's, (though never a formal part of that company), the manufacture of high quality glass-case models, which were often marketed under Bassett-Lowke's name. <b>Twining</b> sold out in 1940, and the firm was run until 1967 as <b>Twining</b> Models (E. H. Clifton) Ltd.. E. H. Clifton had been a director of <b>Twining</b> Models, having started working for <b>Twining</b> as a school-leaver before <b>Twining</b> Models was first established.|$|R
40|$|Although some {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} {{on the extent of}} handedness bias in <b>twining</b> vines, the proximate and ultimate causes of handedness preference in the plant kingdom have long remained unexplained. Studies on the distribution of <b>twining</b> handedness have shown a nearly universal preference for unidirectional, species-specific <b>twining,</b> the majority of which is counter clockwise (CCW). To investigate the origin of the CCW bias, the evolution of <b>twining</b> direction was studied. Additionally, the potential advantages to CCW <b>twining</b> and the effects of environmental cues and regional variation on <b>twining</b> were probed using a vine facultative in <b>twining</b> direction, Solanum dulcamara (Solanaceae, Nightshade Family). To determine the causes of handedness in <b>twining</b> vines, the relationships between chiral cellular components, other plant enantiomorphies and <b>twining</b> were investigated. Mapping of <b>twining</b> handedness onto an angiosperm phylogeny revealed multiple evolutionary origins of <b>twining</b> habit and handedness, potentially indicating multiple determinants of handedness. CCW <b>twining</b> plants were shown to have tighter coils than clockwise (CW) <b>twining</b> plants, and the choice of <b>twining</b> habit, though not direction, was influenced by the location of seed Oligin. Finally, the direction of circumnutation (rotational growth pattern observed in developing seedlings and shoots), spiral phyllotaxy (leaf arrangement), xylem helices, and cortical microfibrils (cytoskeletal elements known to form helices) were not associated with the handedness of the vine...|$|R

They believe that the bird that clawed her body {{is one of the}} animals being treated there, and confiscate the practice's files in order to locate the owners of birds being treated there. They learn that the scratches have been caused by a myna, and that drug smuggler Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) owns one. They raid Renault's home, interrupting Briggs, who is planting Johnson's bloodied shirt. He flees, undetected; however, the shirt is recovered as evidence.|$|E
5|$|Depression Quest is a 2013 {{interactive}} fiction game {{dealing with}} the subject of depression. It was developed by Zoë Quinn using the <b>Twine</b> engine, with writing by Patrick Lindsey and music by Isaac Schankler. It was first released for the web on February 14, 2013, and for Steam on August 11, 2014. The game {{tells the story of}} a person suffering from depression and their attempts to deal with their affliction. It was created to foster greater understanding about depression. Depression Quest can be played for free, and has a pay-what-you-want pricing model. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline receives part of the proceeds.|$|E
5|$|The Wujing Zongyaos first {{recorded}} gunpowder formula {{used in these}} bombs held a potassium nitrate level of 55.4% to 55.5%, sulfur content of 19.4% to 26.5%, and carbonaceous content of 23% to 25.2%. The first step for making gunpowder is to powder and mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using hemp <b>twine.</b> Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp.|$|E

5|$|When collected, {{the skin}} of the cap is left intact, and dirt is brushed off the surface. Pores are left unless old and soft. Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on <b>twine,</b> then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E
5|$|Sam and Max, the Freelance Police, are two {{comic book}} {{characters}} created by Steve Purcell, who act as private detectives and vigilantes. Sam & Max Hit the Road follows the pair {{on a case}} that takes them from their office in New York City across the United States. The game starts {{in a similar way}} to many of the comic stories, with Sam and Max receiving a telephone call from an unseen and unheard Commissioner, who tells them to go to a nearby carnival. At the carnival, they are told by the owners that their star attraction, a frozen bigfoot called Bruno, has been set free and fled taking their second attraction, Trixie the Giraffe-Necked Girl. Sam and Max set off to find Bruno and Trixie and bring them back. As the duo investigate the carnival, they learn that Bruno and Trixie are in love and that Trixie freed Bruno. The Freelance Police leave the carnival to pursue leads at various tourist traps throughout the country, such as The World's Largest Ball of <b>Twine,</b> a vortex controlled by giant subterranean magnets and bungee jumping facilities at Mount Rushmore.|$|E
