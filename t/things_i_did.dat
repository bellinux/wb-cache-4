To Keppel, {{he confessed to}} all eight of the Washington and Oregon homicides {{for which he was}} the prime suspect. He described three additional previously unknown victims in Washington and two in Oregon whom he declined to identify (if indeed he ever knew their identities). He said he left a fifth corpse—Donna Manson's—on Taylor Mountain, but incinerated her head in Kloepfer's fireplace. ("Of all the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> to ," [...] he told Keppel, [...] "this is probably the one she is least likely to forgive me for. Poor Liz.") ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1974, Kennedy {{was sold}} to Liverpool for a club record £200,000. Manager Bill Shankly {{resigned}} {{on the same day}} as the transfer was made, though had admired Kennedy for years and stated that [...] "maybe it will be said that one of the last <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> at this club was to sign a great new player". Shortly after the move Kennedy got back in touch with his estranged wife, and the pair began living together in Ainsdale. New manager Bob Paisley handed Kennedy his debut in place of John Toshack against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 31 August 1974, and it took Kennedy just 22 minutes to open his goalscoring account as the Reds went on to record a comfortable 3–0 win. Liverpool ended the 1974–75 season as runners-up to Derby County in the league. Kennedy featured just 25 times in the league as Toshack formed an effective combination with Kevin Keegan up front, and started to become frustrated and disillusioned in the club.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{her early}} career {{is filled with}} near misses in casting, as she was up for {{significant}} roles in films such as 1997's The Postman and The Devil's Advocate and 2000's Meet the Parents, which eventually went to other actresses. In an interview in 2012, Watts said, [...] "I came to New York and auditioned {{at least five times}} for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'." [...] Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, [...] "It is a tough town. I think my spirit has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. Knowing that you have something to offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit." [...] Watts studied the Meisner Technique.|$|E
500|$|On 7 January 2009, Barton was {{questioned}} by the Indian media on why she chose to sign on the project to which she responded [...] "I'm interested {{in all kinds of}} <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> this film for moral reasons. Also, I felt the story needed to be told, I feel {{that this is going to}} be an important film." [...] Benjamin Wallfisch, an Emmy and Ivor Novello-nominated composer, composed music for the movie Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain. The film was slated to release in 2010 but the lack of response from the distributors delayed the release. On the 30th anniversary of the Bhopal Gas Disaster, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh attended the film's premiere in Bhopal and after watching the film he announced that the state government would not charge any tax on the film's earning. Chouhan called the film [...] "very sensitive" [...] and praised the [...] "heart-rending" [...] performance given by actors. To promote awareness about the tragedy a NGO The Bhopal Medical Appeal and the film's director collaborated with mobile commerce portal Paytm and the online shopping website Snapdeal. As part of the partnership Paytm and Snapdeal offered their customers a chance to donate money in form of online coupons to the disaster victims.|$|E

[...] Unlike Gary, however, Lindsay said that he preferred to remember [...] "all the good <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with my dad and forget the times that were rough." [...] Dennis asserted that the book was [...] "Gary's business" [...] and a result of his [...] "anger," [...] but would not deny the book's claims. Bing's younger brother, singer and jazz bandleader Bob Crosby, recalled at the time of Gary's revelations that Bing was a [...] "disciplinarian," [...] as their mother and father had been. He added, [...] "We were brought up that way." [...] In an interview for the same article, Gary clarified that Bing was abusive as a means of administering punishment: [...] "He was not out to be vicious, to beat children for his kicks." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gonzales enjoyed broad {{bipartisan}} support {{in connection with}} his nomination, including the support of former Democratic HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros and Colorado Democratic Senator Ken Salazar. [...] One writer noted, [...] "A senator from Pennsylvania said, 'I have always found him [...] to be completely forthright, brutally honest – in some cases telling me <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not want to hear}} but always forthright, always honest, sincere, serious. [...] This is a serious man who takes the responsibilities that have been given to him as a great privilege and a great honor which he holds very carefully and gently in his hands.' [...] Said another senator, this one from Kentucky, 'Judge Gonzales is proof that in America, there are no artificial barriers to success. [...] A man or woman can climb to any height that his or her talents can take them. [...] For Judge Gonzales, that is a very high altitude indeed. [...] And luckily for his country, he is not quite finished climbing yet.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Kampusch's {{official}} statement after her escape, she and Přiklopil {{would get up}} early each morning to have breakfast together. Přiklopil gave her books, so she educated herself. Later, when explaining that in general she did not feel she had missed anything during her imprisonment, she noted, [...] "I spared myself many <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not start smoking or drinking and I did not hang out in bad company". But she also said: [...] "I always had the thought: surely I didn't come into the world so I could be locked up and my life completely ruined. I give up in despair about this unfairness. I always felt like a poor chicken in a hen house. You saw my dungeon {{on television and in}} the media. Thus you know how small it was. It was a place to despair." [...] She was given a television and radio to pass the time with, although she was initially only allowed to watch taped programmes and listen to foreign radio stations so she would not be aware of the publicised search for her. At one point, she tried to escape by jumping out of a car.|$|E
2500|$|The {{unsolicited}} screenplay {{was written}} by two novice writers, actor Gregory Fleeman and documentarian Robert T. Megginson. Producer Jack Wiener read their script, which was submitted as a low-budget television movie, and felt {{that it should be}} made into a theatrical release. Wiener and his co-producer Dodi Fayed hired Robert Mandel, an Off-Broadway director. They did not want to hire an action director, but instead wanted a director who would bring a realistic touch to the film and make the audience care about the main character. Mandel accepted the job because he wanted to dispel the perception that he was a [...] "soft, arty director". Initially he was not impressed with the film's screenplay, which he felt was not well-crafted but felt that it provided for [...] "a lot of action and a lot of <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not have under my belt". In preparation for the film's action sequences, Mandel studied chase scenes from Bullitt and The French Connection. To pull off the film's special effects, the producers hired John Stears, who had worked on the first eight James Bond films and shared a special effects Academy Award for [...]|$|E

Ringer said of his role, [...] "My {{goal is to make}} sure I keep {{producing}} each chance I get and try to make sure I am being productive, And just continue to do what I can to get better." [...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's got a sense and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ... I am asking questions and they've been very helpful with me." [...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ... (It's) just making sure I let him know some of the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> to learn the playbook quickly." ...|$|E
