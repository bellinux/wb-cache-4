To move units, players can shift <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> to select units on the main map, move to the unit menu to select an action, {{and then back to}} the main map or minimap to specify the target area; but shortcut keys can eliminate the middle mouse action in this cycle.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{thought the}} {{enhancements}} {{made to the}} gamepad control scheme were smart and welcomed additions like controls groups. However, in some cases reviewers still regarded the gamepad as a suboptimal control method, {{largely due to the}} nature of analog sticks being imprecise in comparison to a mouse. This led to some frustration among several writers as they were unable to avoid enemy attacks because maneuvering units was slow with a gamepad. While <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> and keyboard controls were seen as superior for performing precise actions quickly, some reviewers considered the control method to be unpolished and believed that concessions had been made for the gamepad. The unresponsive minimap, unintuitive default keybindings, and unfitting radial menus were highlighted as problems with <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> and keyboard controls.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is similar}} to most other visual novels for the PC, with the {{controls}} limited to <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> and the only interactions being clicking to forward the game's narrative or to choose between multiple plot choices.

The save button can be employed at any point during the game, which also features several pages of save slots, allowing gameplay to be easily picked up from prior to a choice the player made. An arrow button in the upper right corner also allows the player to skip dialogue and interactions they have already experienced.|$|E

5|$|In normal development, {{endogenous}} sonic hedgehog signaling stimulates rapid {{proliferation of}} cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) {{in the external}} granule layer (EGL). Cerebellar development occurs during late embryogenesis and the early postnatal period, with CGNP proliferation in the EGL peaking during early development (postnatal day 7 in <b>the</b> <b>mouse).</b> As CGNPs terminally differentiate into cerebellum granule cells (also called cerebellar granule neurons, CGNs), they migrate to the internal granule layer (IGL), forming the mature cerebellum (by post-natal day 20 in <b>the</b> <b>mouse).</b> Mutations that abnormally activate Sonic hedgehog signaling predispose to cancer of the cerebellum (medulloblastoma) in humans with Gorlin Syndrome and in genetically engineered mouse models.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} visual feedback effects and human performance in <b>the</b> foot <b>mouse</b> control. Background: Generally, computer mouse tasks are controlled by visual feedback. In order to understand the characteristics of a foot mouse control, it is important to investigate the patterns of visual feedback involved in foot-mouse control tasks. Human performance of foot mouse control is also an important factor to understand <b>the</b> foot <b>mouse</b> control. Method: Three types of mouse control were determined to investigate visual feedback effects and human performance in <b>the</b> foot <b>mouse</b> control. Visual feedback effects in <b>the</b> foot <b>mouse</b> control were compared with those of a typical hand <b>mouse.</b> <b>The</b> cursor movement speed and mental workload were measured in the three types of tasks and two types of mouses. Results: Mouse control tasks with an element of homing-in to the target were more quickly performed by <b>the</b> hand <b>mouse</b> than <b>the</b> foot <b>mouse.</b> Mental workload was also higher in <b>the</b> foot <b>mouse</b> than <b>the</b> hand <b>mouse.</b> However, in <b>the</b> steering movement, human performance of <b>the</b> foot <b>mouse</b> control was not lower than that of <b>the</b> hand <b>mouse</b> control. Visual feedback in <b>the</b> foot <b>mouse</b> control was less required than in <b>the</b> hand <b>mouse</b> control. Conclusion: <b>The</b> foot <b>mouse</b> was not efficient in <b>the</b> most <b>mouse</b> control tasks, compared to <b>the</b> hand <b>mouse.</b> However, <b>the</b> foot <b>mouse</b> was efficient in the steering movement, moving...|$|R
5|$|Mice {{have been}} used as an {{experimental}} system to investigate possible mechanisms by which levels of sex steroid hormones might regulate nervous system function. During the part of <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> estrous cycle when progesterone is highest, the level of nerve-cell GABA receptor subtype delta was high. Since these GABA receptors are inhibitory, nerve cells with more delta receptors are less likely to fire than cells with lower numbers of delta receptors. During the part of <b>the</b> <b>mouse</b> estrous cycle when estrogen levels are higher than progesterone levels, the number of delta receptors decrease, increasing nerve cell activity, in turn increasing anxiety and seizure susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|The Florida mouse is nocturnal, and {{is active}} {{throughout}} the year except on especially cold nights. <b>The</b> <b>mouse</b> can climb, but is primarily a terrestrial species.

5|$|The in-game {{features}} and controls {{in the port}} were generally well received.

Extended Plays Andrew Bub appreciated the addition of a custom radio station, as well as the availability of custom skins. Daniel Morris of PC Gamer praised the gameplay tweaks provided by the port, but criticised the lack of major additional features, such as an overhead map of the in-game city.|$|E

It is possible Potter's carelessness {{in the details of}} Mrs. Tittlemouse can be attributed to a desire on her part to simply display her ability to draw from nature or to her interest in book production being supplanted by a growing interest in farming and local life and politics in Sawrey.|$|E
5|$|Animals used by {{laboratories}} {{are largely}} supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied {{from a few}} main stock centers. For vertebrates, sources include breeders and dealers like Covance and Charles River Laboratories who supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade in wild animals such as Nafovanny; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply the laboratories directly.

Some actions are binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon to use an item, needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E
