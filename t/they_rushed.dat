5|$|Travis assumed {{command of}} the Alamo {{garrison}} on February 11, when Neill was granted a furlough. On February 23, Santa Anna arrived in Béxar {{at the head of}} approximately 1500 Mexican troops. The 150 Texian soldiers were unprepared for this development. As <b>they</b> <b>rushed</b> to the Alamo, Texians quickly herded cattle into the complex and scrounged for food in nearby houses. The Mexican army initiated a siege of the Alamo and raised a blood-red flag signalling no quarter. Travis responded with a blast from the Alamo's largest cannon.|$|E
5|$|Another {{part of the}} 5th Division had {{gathered}} unseen below Courtnay's Post, which was held by the 14th Battalion, and at 04:00 <b>they</b> <b>rushed</b> the trench, throwing hand grenades. The post was only defended by an Australian section, two of whom were killed and another two wounded; as the Turks occupied {{that part of the}} post the surviving Australians retreated. The Turks were now in a position to observe and bring fire down on Monash Valley. However, from another section of the post Private Albert Jacka led a small group of men in a counter-attack on the Turks. Jacka shot five of the Turks, bayoneted another two, and chased the rest out of the post. For this feat he was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{originally}} planned to create {{many of the}} aliens with computer graphics, but those {{that would be more}} cost-effectively realized with masks and animatronics were created by Nick Dudman's creature effects team. These included the Neimodians, background characters in Mos Espa, the Jedi Council, and the Galactic Senate. Dudman's team was told where the creatures would be required six months before principal photography begun, and <b>they</b> <b>rushed</b> the production. The Neimodian suits, which were originally intended as digital characters, were delivered one day before they would be required on set. Dudman traveled to Skywalker Ranch to see the original creatures that could be reused, and read the script for a breakdown of scenes with practical creatures, leaving only the more outlandish designs to be created using CGI.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantine army {{retreated from}} the Sofia Valley towards Ihtiman where it stopped for the night. The rumours that the Bulgarians had barred the nearby {{mountain}} routes stirred commotion among {{the soldiers and}} {{on the following day}} the retreat continued in growing disorder. When the Bulgarians under Samuil and probably Roman saw that, <b>they</b> <b>rushed</b> to the enemy camp and the retreat turned to flight. The Byzantine advance guard managed to squeeze through slopes which were not yet taken by the Bulgarian attackers. The rest of the army was surrounded by the Bulgarians. Only the elite Armenian unit from the infantry managed to break out with heavy casualties and to lead their Emperor to safety through secondary routes. Enormous numbers of Byzantine soldiers perished in the battle; the rest were captured along with the Imperial insignia.|$|E
25|$|At {{first the}} crowd fell deathly silent, unable to fathom how England had {{collapsed}} so dramatically. Then as the fine bowling display sank in, <b>they</b> <b>rushed</b> {{onto the field}} to congratulate Spofforth and Boyle for their remarkable achievement.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{contract}} was signed, Barnum started a publicity campaign to prepare the public for Nutt's debut. He let reporters think {{he was trying to}} hire the dwarf.

25|$|On {{that night}} the Bulgarians {{gathered}} their troops and tightened the belt around the trapped enemy. At dawn <b>they</b> <b>rushed</b> down and started to kill the panicked and totally confused Byzantines. The tagmata {{were the first to}} be attacked. The Byzantines fruitlessly resisted for a short time and perished. Upon seeing their comrades' fate, the next units immediately ran away.|$|E
25|$|Hans Wittmann found Berthold's {{body in the}} street. His {{remains were}} taken to the Wandsbeke hospital, in a Hamburg suburb. Two of his old fliers, former Leutnants Tiedje and Lohmann, lived in Hamburg. When they heard of Berthold's death, <b>they</b> <b>rushed</b> to the hospital. They stayed with Berthold until Franziska arrived from Berlin. Berthold's Pour le Merite, Iron Cross First Class, and Pilot's Badge were rescued from a garbage dump in Harburg before she arrived.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} with banks was over-issuance of banknotes. These were redeemable in specie (gold or silver) upon presentation to the chief cashier of the bank. When people lost trust in a bank <b>they</b> <b>rushed</b> to redeem its notes, and because banks issued more notes than their specie reserves, the bank couldn't redeem the notes, often causing the bank to fail. In 1860 there were over 8,000 state chartered banks issuing notes. In 1861 the U.S. began issuing United States Notes as legal tender.|$|E
5000|$|The next {{exercise}} {{is using the}} Smith Gun (an artillery piece unique to the Home Guard) to repel an assault by Ramsey's regular troops. The ammunition for the gun lies behind {{the same type of}} electrified fence the platoon were meant to have learnt how to scale in the previous test. Meanwhile, Hodges and the Verger have finally got the key to Jones's van from Walker, and <b>they</b> <b>rush</b> off to transfer the onions to Hodges's van. The platoon suddenly realise that they could use the onions instead of the ammunition for the Smith Gun. <b>They</b> <b>rush</b> to Hodges's van with Mainwaring demanding the onions [...] "in the name of the King", but is forced to buy them off Hodges. <b>They</b> <b>rush</b> back to the Smith Gun, load and fire the onions at the advancing troops, who retreat in confusion. The platoon are jubilant. Ramsey returns and congratulates Mainwaring, saying he has never seen such initiative displayed by a Home Guard unit and awards them 12 stars outright. <b>They</b> all then <b>rush</b> to retrieve the fallen onions.|$|R

25|$|The {{dilapidated}} {{fortress of}} Spandau fell on 25 October to General of Division Louis Gabriel Suchet's division of Lannes' corps. The commandant Major Benekendorf was discussing {{terms with the}} French when <b>they</b> <b>rushed</b> the gate and broke into the fortress. Altogether, 71 cannon and 920 soldiers, including the 3rd battalion of the König Infantry Regiment # 18, three companies of soldiers unfit for field duty, and 65 gunners were surrendered, the garrison being released on parole. In 1808, Benekendorf was hauled before a court-martial and condemned to be shot, but the king commuted his sentence to life in prison.|$|E
25|$|During November 1950, the United Nations 8th Army reeled southwards along Korea's western coast. X Corps fought its way {{south along}} the country's eastern coast. The UN retreat was {{supported}} by all-out tactical air operations. Task Force 77 (TF 77) began liaison with the 5th Air Force Joint Operations Center, though inadequate communications hampered naval aviation efforts. The Chinese ground forces, having never before fought an enemy supported by an air force, exposed themselves to air attacks en masse as <b>they</b> <b>rushed</b> after the retreating UN troops. During early December, air power alone opposed communist progress, as air strikes inflicted severe casualties on their troops advancing in the open.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{distress}} rockets were overlooked by the SS Uganda, {{some of the}} Troubridge locals saw them. <b>They</b> <b>rushed</b> {{to the beach and}} gave assistance to many of the surviving crew. The locals also began searching for other survivors on the beach and were shocked by the terrible loss of life they found along the shoreline. Some bodies that were found were battered beyond recognition. Only 36 of the missing bodies were found, which were buried in Edithburgh Cemetery. The five British officers were buried in the main section and the 31 Lascar crew were buried in a mass grave {{at the rear of the}} cemetery.|$|E

25|$|The {{lighthouse}} keeper Durmuş Arıkan {{noticed the}} airliner's ditching, however, {{neither he nor}} his supervisor could sight it in the pitch-dark night. Only sometime later, with the beginning of twilight, could they see the aircraft and the victims on the sea surface. <b>They</b> <b>rushed</b> to the accident site by boat, rescuing some passengers, including flight attendant Rospars, who held a five-month old infant girl Roxane on her lap, and the baby's mother, to the island shore. Meanwhile, crew members and some passengers tried to swim the distance to the island in order to call for relief. Alerted by the lighthouse keeper, customs officers and fishermen sailed towards the scene, picking survivors on the water.|$|E
25|$|Spring 1860 {{found them}} in Lugano, Switzerland, from where <b>they</b> <b>rushed</b> to Genoa {{to be part of}} the second wave of volunteers going to Sicily to join Garibaldi in his lightning-fast conquest of the Bourbon-controlled {{southern}} half of Italy. Alberto was on Garibaldi’s staff and Jessie was nurse to the wounded, doing whatever was needed. This included tightly holding a boy while his arm was amputated without anaesthesia. Skills learned and refined during this war were used again in 1866 in the war against the Austrians west of Venice; in 1867 at Monterotondo and Mentana, north of Rome; and in the 1870-71 Franco-Prussian War when Garibaldi led an army against the Germans in eastern France.|$|E
25|$|During this expedition, Frémont trekked {{into the}} Mojave Desert. His party met a Mexican man and boy. The two told Carson that Native Americans had ambushed their party of {{travelers}}. The male travelers were killed; the women travelers were staked to the ground, sexually mutilated, and killed. The murderers then stole the Mexicans' thirty horses. Carson and a mountain man friend named Alexis Godey {{went after the}} murderers. They took two days to find them. <b>They</b> <b>rushed</b> into their camp, killing and scalping two of the murderers. The stolen horses were recovered {{and returned to the}} Mexican man and boy. This deed brought Carson even greater fame. It confirmed his status as a western hero {{in the eyes of the}} American people.|$|E

25|$|At 07:45 on 1 April as the rearguard of Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment {{passed through}} the village the 2nd (Wellington West Coast) Squadron was {{attacked}} by Circassians who suddenly opened fire from a mill and adjacent caves, from houses and from behind rocks on the nearby hills. Firing at very close range {{with a variety of}} firearms they wounded men and horses; horses rearing up, bolted, screaming joined the numerous riderless horses galloping across the hillsides. Remnants of the 2nd Squadron galloped clear of the village, dismounted and counter-attacked with the other two squadrons attacking from the ridges above the village. <b>They</b> <b>rushed</b> the mill and its occupants were killed. No prisoners were taken; the 2nd Squadron suffered 18 casualties.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prolific}} fish such as herrings and sardines are abundant in given waters {{only in their}} season so keeping them for use out of season required salting or smoking them. This permitted their sale in inland markets too but fresh fish tasted better {{so long as it}} really was fresh. There was therefore a premium on fresh fish in this top end of the market. The medieval chasse-marée merchants catered to this originally by carrying fish in pairs of baskets on pack ponies, as far as possible, overnight. <b>They</b> <b>rushed</b> la marée (the batch from a particular landing) to market but the distance coverable before the fish deteriorated was limited. Another problem was that every lord through whose manor the road led wanted his toll so that if the road was too long, the enterprise became less economic.|$|E
