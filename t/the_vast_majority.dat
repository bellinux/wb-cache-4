As <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majorities</b> were built decades ago, without sealing and drainage measures, runoff water infiltrates in the tailings mass, this results in contamination of soil, subsoil and groundwater as result of exfiltrations. A first step in evaluating the contamination degree is to assess the amount of rainfall water infiltrating through and outflowing from the tailing pond. The paper presents a possible approach for this assessment, using numerical modeling for two case studies of tailing ponds: one without sealing measures and one having a lining system...|$|R

Information forjudging attractiveness {{can be derived from}} any sensory input however the greater part of the research concerning the subject has primarily focused on visual information, specifically the face and its physical characteristics. On a basic evolutionary level the physical characteristics of an attractive face, such as averageness or symmetry, can indicate the ability of that individual to tolerate environmental or genetic stressors making them a potentially desirable partner. However the evaluation of multiple sensory inputs as well as evaluation of non-physical information allows for a greater understanding of how attractiveness judgements are formed in reality...|$|R
