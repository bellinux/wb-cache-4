5|$|From Almaty in Kazakhstan, {{the railway}} extends to Tashkent and Samarkand, Uzbekistan {{and then to}} Tejen, <b>Turkmenistan.</b> From Tejen, another line {{continues}} to Ashgabat, the capital of <b>Turkmenistan.</b> After Ashgabat, the line ends at Türkmenbaşy, <b>Turkmenistan,</b> a port on the Caspian Sea. (After a direct rail link between Kazakhstan and <b>Turkmenistan</b> opened, it became possible for the freight to bypass Uzbekistan, which has poor relations with its neighbors).|$|E

5|$|Extradition {{requests}} {{had been}} granted in the past (For example, in 2002 Murad Garabayev has been handed to <b>Turkmenistan.,</b> Garabayev's extradition was later found unlawful by the Russian courts and he was awarded 20,000 Euros in damages to be paid by the Russian government by the European Court of Human Rights.) Article 63 does not explicitly mention Russian citizens, and therefore {{does not apply to}} them, but only to foreign nationals living in Russia. Article 61 supersedes it for the people holding the Russian citizenship.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the cheetah ranged across vast {{stretches}} of Asia: from the Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula {{in the west}} to the Indian subcontinent in the east, and as far north as the Caspian and Aral Seas. However, the cheetah has disappeared from the majority of its historic range, save for Iran and possibly a few areas in Afghanistan, the Indian subcontinent, and <b>Turkmenistan.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are 11 {{recognised}} tiger subspecies. Two, the Trinil and Japanese tigers, became {{extinct in}} prehistoric times. The remaining subspecies all survived at least into the mid-20th century; {{three of these}} are also considered extinct. Their core historical range in South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan), Eastern Asia (China, Mongolia, North Korea, Siberia, South Korea) and South East Asia, including three Indonesian islands, is severely constricted today, notwithstanding key extinct populations in the Black Sea (Iran, Georgia, Southern Russia, Turkey) and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, <b>Turkmenistan,</b> Uzbekistan).|$|E
5|$|Whereas Hecatompylos {{had served}} as the first Parthian capital, Mithridates {{established}} royal residences at Seleucia, Ecbatana, Ctesiphon and his newly founded city, Mithradatkert (Nisa, <b>Turkmenistan),</b> where the tombs of the Arsacid kings were built and maintained. Ecbatana became the main summertime residence for the Arsacid royalty. Ctesiphon may not have become the official capital until the reign of Gotarzes I of Parthia (r. c.90–80BC). It became {{the site of the}} royal coronation ceremony and the representational city of the Arsacids, according to Brosius.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old. Females enter oestrus (typically five days long) from January to March. In males, {{spermatogenesis}} occurs mainly in February and March. In southern <b>Turkmenistan,</b> mating occurs from January to early February. The mating season is marked by noisy fights among males for dominance. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Vocalisations and flehmen are prominent during courtship. After a successful copulation, the female gives out a loud cry and reacts with aversion towards her partner. The pair then separate.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are monogamous {{and will}} remain with the one partner until death. Female jackals have only one {{breeding}} cycle each year. Breeding occurs from October to March in Israel and from February to March in India, <b>Turkmenistan,</b> Bulgaria, and Transcaucasia, with the mating period lasting up to 26–28 days. Females undergoing their first estrus are often pursued by several males that may quarrel among themselves. Mating results in a copulatory tie that lasts for several minutes, as it does with all other canids. Gestation lasts 63 days, and {{the timing of the}} births coincides with the annual abundance of food.|$|E
5|$|Kerson Hadley {{represented}} the Federated States of Micronesia as its only male swimmer {{competing in the}} Beijing Olympics. Hadley {{took part in the}} men's 50meters freestyle race. He was born in May 1989, and was 19 years old when he appeared in Beijing for his races. Hadley had not previously competed at any Olympic games. The preliminary round for the men's 50meters freestyle took place on August 14, with Hadley in the eight-person fifth heat. With a time of 25.34seconds, Hadley finished fifth, displacing John Kamyuka of Botswana (25.54seconds) but falling behind Andrey Molchanov of <b>Turkmenistan</b> (25.02seconds). The heat was led by Cameroon's Alain Brigion Tobe (24.53seconds) and Sidni Hoxha of Albania (24.56seconds). Of the 97 people who competed in the event's preliminary round, Hadley ranked 70th. He did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|The Marwari is {{descended from}} native Indian ponies crossed with Arabian horses. The ponies {{were small and}} hardy, but with poor conformation; the {{influence}} of the Arabian blood improved the appearance without compromising the hardiness. The Arabians possibly came ashore from a cargo ship wrecked off India's west coast. Legend in India states that the Arabian ship, containing seven Arabian horses of good breeding, was shipwrecked off the shore of the Kachchh District. These horses were then taken to the Marwar district and used as foundation bloodstock for the Marwari. There is also the possibility of some Mongolian influence from the north. The breed probably originated in northwest India on the Afghanistan border, as well as in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and <b>Turkmenistan,</b> and takes its name from the Marwar region (also called the Jodhpur region) of India.|$|E
5|$|The tiger was {{historically}} widespread throughout eastern Eurasia, {{with the}} Pontic Caspian steppe, Eastern Turkey and Mesopotamia {{serving as the}} westernmost fringe of their range, and the coasts between eastern Siberia and the Indonesian islands of Java, Bali and Sumatra acting as the frontier to the Pacific Ocean. In between, tigers roamed what is today Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Georgia, southern Russia, Syria, Turkey and eastern Ukraine (as part of the Black Sea region), Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Nepal (comprising South Asia), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, <b>Turkmenistan,</b> and Uzbekistan (composing Central Asia) China, Mongolia, North Korea, Siberia and South Korea (constituting East Asia) and South East Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam).|$|E
5|$|Three {{subspecies}} are recognised, differing in {{the overall}} tone of their plumage and in the head striping of the female. The subspecies ammodendri occurs in {{the west of the}} saxaul sparrow's range, while stoliczkae and nigricans occur in the east. This distribution falls into six probably disjunct areas across Central Asia, from central <b>Turkmenistan</b> to northern Gansu in China. A bird of deserts, the saxaul sparrow favours areas with shrubs such as the saxaul, near rivers and oases. Though it has lost parts of its range to habitat destruction caused by agriculture, it is not seriously threatened by human activities.|$|E
5|$|In South Asia {{the golden}} jackal inhabits Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In Central Asia it inhabits Tadjikistan, <b>Turkmenistan,</b> and Uzbekistan. In Southeast Asia it inhabits Myanmar and Thailand. There {{have been two}} {{reported}} sightings from Cambodia, three from southern Laos, and two from Vietnameach sighting made only in lowland, open deciduous forest, and no specimens were presented. In Southwestern Asia it inhabits Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. In Europe it inhabits Albania, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, the Baltic states, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Kosovo, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Turkey, and the Ukraine. It has been sighted in Belarus, the Czech Republic, and Germany. It {{has been reported in}} the media in Denmark and the Netherlands, but it is unclear if this jackal was an escapee from a private zoo.|$|E
5|$|When Russia {{invaded the}} Turkish Balkans in 1853, fears of Russian {{dominance}} in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities. The ensuing Crimean War (1854–56), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica and was a resounding defeat for Russia. The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and <b>Turkmenistan.</b> For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with {{the signing of the}} Anglo-Russian Entente. The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese at the Battle of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 also limited its threat to the British.|$|E
5|$|Across its Central Asian distribution, the saxaul sparrow {{occurs in}} six {{probably}} disjunct areas, and {{is divided into}} at least three subspecies. The nominate subspecies Passer ammodendri ammodendri inhabits three of these areas, one in the Syr Darya basin of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and another {{to the south of}} Lake Balkhash and the north of Almaty, where it is only common in the valley of the Ili River. In a third area, sometimes recognised as a subspecies korejewi, ammodendri birds breed sporadically in parts of central <b>Turkmenistan,</b> Iran, and possibly Afghanistan, migrating to the south during the winter. The subspecies stoliczkae was named after Ferdinand Stoliczka in 1874 by Allan Octavian Hume, from specimens Stoliczka collected in Yarkand. This subspecies is separated from the other two subspecies by the Tian Shan mountains. It is found across a broad swath of China from Kashgar east to the far west of Inner Mongolia, through the areas around the Taklamakan Desert (but probably not in the inhospitable desert itself), and through the east of Xinjiang, northern Gansu, and the fringes of southern Mongolia. In the extreme west of the Gobi Desert a disjunct population separated from the other stoliczkae birds by the Gurvan Saikhan Uul mountains occurs, which is sometimes separated as a subspecies timidus. The subspecies nigricans, described by ornithologist L. S. Stepanyan in 1961, is found in northern Xinjiang's Manasi River valley.|$|E
5|$|On the battlefield, the king's commanders led the troops. The empire's war {{strategy}} rarely involved massive invasions; {{more often}} it employed small scale {{methods such as}} attacking and destroying individual forts. The empire {{was among the first}} in India to use long range artillery commonly manned by foreign gunners (those from present day <b>Turkmenistan</b> were considered the best). Army troops were of two types: The king's personal army directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army under each feudatory. King Krishnadevaraya's personal army consisted of 100,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalrymen and over 900 elephants. This number was only a part of the army numbering over 1.1 million soldiers, a figure that varied as an army of two million has also been recorded along with the existence of a navy as evidenced by {{the use of the term}} Navigadaprabhu (commander of the navy). The army recruited from all classes of society (supported by the collection of additional feudal tributes from feudatory rulers), and consisted of archers and musketeers wearing quilted tunics, shieldmen with swords and poignards in their girdles, and soldiers carrying shields so large that no armour was necessary. The horses and elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their tusks to do maximum damage in battle.|$|E
5|$|The Zoroastrians {{moved to}} India in {{successive}} migrations in the Islamic period. The initial migration following the conquest {{has been characterized}} as a religious persecution by invading Muslims. According to the account, the Zoroastrians suffered at their hands {{and in order to}} protect themselves and safeguard their religion, fled first to northern Iran, then to the island of Hormuz and finally to India. This generally accepted narrative of migration emphasises Muslim persecution while identifying Parsis as religious refugees. Recently, scholars have questioned this explanation of Iranian origins. There is a scarcity of sources about the migration. Historians are forced to rely exclusively on Qissa-i Sanjan written in 1599 by a Parsi Priest and Qissah-ye Zartushtian-e Hindustan written more than 200 years later. This is {{complicated by the fact that}} there were already Zoroastrians in India in the Sasanian period. According to the legend, at the beginning of the 10th century a small group of Zoroastrians living around the town of Nyshapour and Fort of Sanjan in the province of (greater) Khorasan, decided that Iran was no longer safe for Zoroastrians and their religion.The refugees accepted the conditions and founded the settlement of Sanjan (Gujarat), which is said to have been named after the city of their origin (Sanjan, near Merv, in present-day <b>Turkmenistan).</b>|$|E
