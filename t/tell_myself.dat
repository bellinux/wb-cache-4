500|$|... "Dog Eat Dog" [...] is a style {{parody of}} the Talking Heads. Described as a [...] "tongue-in-cheek look at office life", the song was {{inspired}} by Yankovic's past experience of working in the mailrooms {{as well as the}} traffic department at Westwood One radio station. He noted, [...] "At first I thought [...] was kinda cool that I had a phone and a desk and a little cubicle to call my own, but after a while I felt like my soul had been sucked out of me." [...] The song features a line directly parodying the Talking Heads song [...] "Once In a Lifetime": [...] "Sometimes I <b>tell</b> <b>myself,</b> this is not my beautiful stapler/Sometimes I <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> this is not my beautiful chair!" [...] This mirrors a similar line in the Talking Heads song: [...] "You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful house/You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful wife".|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Princeton in 1971, Berg decided {{to expand the}} thesis into a {{full-length}} biography, thinking it would take around nine months. He also formulated a career plan at this time, and later recalled: [...] "I did <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> early on: I {{think it would be}} interesting, perhaps, to spend a career writing a half-dozen biographies of twentieth-century American cultural figures—each one, as I often use as my metaphor, a different wedge of the great apple pie." [...] The Perkins biography, Max Perkins: Editor of Genius, took longer than Berg anticipated and was eventually published in 1978, winning a National Book Award in Biography. In 2016, The New Yorker credited Berg with [...] "almost single-handedly rescu Maxwell Perkins from the anonymity he desired." ...|$|E
500|$|Both {{managers}} {{approached the}} match {{with a view}} to win, in spite of the Shield's friendly feel. Arsenal manager George Graham opined [...] "Winning is a good habit, so why not start early?" [...] Graham lambasted those who found his team's playing style tedious: [...] "The criticism that we don't pass the ball and we don't have flair is overdone. We won two championships and in the second lost one game out of 38." [...] However, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said [...] "Winning means keeping your job, and it can be a delicate situation. But I <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> I'm not going to fail in this game." [...] Ferguson spoke in glowing terms of new signing Roy Keane, a midfielder who gave United [...] "unbelievable options, a real edge to the squad".|$|E

500|$|Lautner {{was born}} on February 11, 1992 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the son of Deborah and Daniel Lautner. His mother works for a {{software}} development company, while {{his father was a}} Midwest Airlines pilot. He has one younger sister named Makena. Raised as a Roman Catholic, Lautner has Austrian, Dutch, English, French, German, Irish, and Swiss ancestry, and has stated that he has [...] "distant" [...] Native American ancestry (specifically Ottawa and Potawatomi) through his mother. He grew up in Hudsonville, Michigan, a town near Grand Rapids. He has stated that he was bullied in school because he was an actor. He commented, [...] "I just had to <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> I can't let this get to me. This is what I love to do. And I'm going to continue doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Variable" [...] was the {{hundredth}} {{episode of the}} show to be produced and aired on television. Josh Holloway, who {{plays the role of}} Sawyer, said, [...] "Just statistically speaking, to hit a hundred episodes doesn't happen very often, especially on a show where everyone is saying 'Lost on an island? What are you gonna do after a season or two?', so the fact that we've lasted not only a season or two but flourishing still at this time... it's shocking... it's amazing to me." [...] In an interview with The News & Observer, Lindelof recalled meeting with the ABC executives in 2004 to pitch the idea of a plane crash and survivors stranded on an island full of mystery and danger. When Lindelof was asked by the executives where the Lost saga would stand in the future, he replied, [...] "We're probably not going to get past episode thirteen. Let's all be honest about that up front." [...] Lindelof added that if he had [...] "traveled back in time to <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> after that meeting {{that we were going to}} make it to a hundred and still have a season beyond that, I would have laughed in my face." [...] The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by the cast and crew on location in Oahu, Hawaii. Duff Goldman and his crew from the Food Network's American television show Ace of Cakes made a special Lost cake for the party to commemorate the milestone. The cake featured replicas of a Dharma beer bottles, the computer from the Swan station, a suitcase and a miniature Oceanic Flight 815. The Ace of Cakes episode ("LOST in Hawaii") featuring the making of the cake aired on the Food Network in the United States on May 9, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Irwin {{described}} {{a late night}} conversation at a Waffle House that he had with Cyndi Craven (a friend, musician and Irwin's website designer):... and I was talking about what I have to <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> {{all the time when}} I'm afraid about doing something that hasn't been done before because it really is frightening to step out and do something different. So I will <b>tell</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "Don’t be afraid to be amazing". Cyndi said, [...] "Where did you get that?" [...] I said, [...] "I made it up". [...] Craven subsequently posted the quotation on the internet and it now appears on hundreds of websites.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, Aragonés told an interviewer, [...] "I'm {{thinking}} and laughing all day long. Every time I {{think of a}} joke, I'm also <b>telling</b> <b>myself</b> a new joke. It's {{a great way to}} live." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "Chicoine {{has also}} charged that Schuckardt was sexually {{involved}} {{with some of}} his male assistants. He said he has several sworn statements." [...] The article quotes Chicoine: [...] "I have in my possession sworn statements by several persons whom Bishop Schuckardt told personally that he was the Pope. These persons were told not to <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> or other priests and clerics since we did not have the grace to accept it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Häkkinen {{remained}} at McLaren for 1999, with Coulthard partnering {{him for the}} upcoming season. The team suffered problems with their car, the McLaren MP4/14, during pre-season testing, resulting in a lack of preparation. Despite these setbacks, Häkkinen was confident going into the season, saying: [...] "I've gained confidence and experience and am more relaxed. With this title I {{no longer have to}} <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> every morning I can win, to put pressure on myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for the New Statesman magazine in June 2000, Tebbit praised Hague's right-ward shift and revealed that he had [...] "never been a [...] Portillo fan". He also mused on not standing for the Conservative leadership after Thatcher's resignation: [...] "When I {{look at what happened}} to the party, I <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> that perhaps I failed in a duty. I suppose I am one of those who have it on my conscience that I allowed Mr Blair to become Prime Minister". When asked if he regretted also allowing Major to become Prime Minister, Tebbit responded: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I {{have been}} <b>telling</b> <b>myself,</b> papa, all along; but, {{now that the}} day has come, and I have seen what jealousies, and competitions, and vanities, and disappointments it has produced--not even poor little Blanche allowed any comfort--I am almost sick at heart with {{thinking}} Cocksmoor was the excuse!" ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{pulled the}} two quills with sharp jerks {{out of my}} hand, pushed all the others through my coat sleeve, and turned to Unk Wunk again, sucking my wounded hand, which pained me intensely.

2500|$|The Buccaneers {{defeated}} the St. Louis Cardinals, only recently eliminated from playoff contention, {{for their first}} home victory. Gary Huff completed 7 of 12 passes, including 61- and 62-yarders to Morris Owens, {{the first of which}} went for a touchdown. The improved offensive line allowed no sacks. Huff's average of 14.3 yards per pass attempt is the third-best in Buccaneer history, and stood as the record until broken by Vinny Testaverde in 1992. Said Coach McKay following the victory: [...] "I’m going to go home, take a shower, and <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> what a great coach I am". Fans tore down the goalposts after the game, and a vendor outside the stadium began stamping the word [...] "Don’t" [...] {{at the top of the}} [...] "Throw McKay in Tampa Bay" [...] T-shirts he had been selling. The fifty points the Bucs scored in their final two games were nearly as many (53) they had put up in the entire rest of the season (twelve games). They had scored only three points at home until this game, being shut out in five consecutive home games.|$|E
2500|$|The Emperor and Empress both {{decided to}} send Nicholas and George on a nine-month-long trip to Japan in 1890. George would go as a naval cadet and Nicholas to {{complete}} his education by seeing something of the world. Their mother hoped the warm sun and the sea air would improve George's health. They left Gatchina on 4 November 1890. The Empress had never been separated from her sons {{for such a long}} time and she missed them terribly. [...] "You cannot imagine how sad and hard it is to be without you, my angel, and how dreadfully it hurts to think of this long separation", she wrote sadly. Nicholas and George first went by warship to Athens where they were joined by their cousin, Prince George of Greece, known as [...] "Greek Georgie". From there, they traveled to Egypt. From [...] Bombay in India, Nicholas telegraphed that his brother George had to remain on ship because he had trouble with his leg. Although George assured his parents that he was perfectly well, they were suddenly informed he had a fever and would have to return home. The Empress was alarmed. [...] "You can't imagine in what anguish I have passed these last few days", she wrote. [...] "In spite of all the reasoning ... I had to take things calmly, and to <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> that it ... is only this horrible malaria that will pass with a change of air ..." [...] George, in fact, had acute bronchitis and was sent back to Athens where he could be examined by the Imperial doctors. The Empress was distressed for both brothers: George, whose disappointment she felt deeply and Nicholas, who was now deprived of his brother's company.|$|E

I ended up <b>telling</b> <b>myself</b> to cut that shit out." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tori Amos: [...] "After {{this period}} of failure and rejection, I began chasing success. At that point it became more {{important}} for me to make it than to be a musician.

5000|$|Starley said [...] "I {{wrote this}} song when I {{was at a}} low {{point in my life}} (…) It became a way of <b>telling</b> <b>myself</b> {{it was going to be}} ok, almost like an encouragement.
