25|$|In high beta conditions, {{the machine}} may operate with cusp confinement. This is an {{improvement}} over the simpler magnetic mirror. The MaGrid has six point cusps, each located {{in the middle of}} a ring; and two highly modified line cusps, linking the eight corner cusps located at cube vertices. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these two line cusps are much narrower than the single line cusp in magnetic mirror machines, so the net losses are less. The two line cusps losses are similar to or lower than the six face-centered point cusps.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{while men}} and women are equally {{effective}} foragers, mothers carrying dependent children are not effective hunters. They must thus depend on male hunters. This favors a system in which males have exclusive sexual access to females, and females can predict that their sexual partner will provide food for them and their children. In most mammalian species the result is a system of rank or sexual competition that results in either polygyny, or lifelong pair-bonding between two individuals who live relatively independent of other adults of their species; in both cases male aggression {{plays an important role in}} maintaining sexual access to mate(s).|$|E
25|$|The Keys to the Kingdom {{are seven}} objects of power {{given to the}} Trustees along with command over their demesnes. It is unknown whether, but implied that, control of <b>the</b> <b>Key</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> which gives one control over a demesne and its namesake day in the Secondary Realms. The Key will bond to the {{rightful}} owner of a Key, and protect him or her from harm, somewhat from pain but not at all from discomfort. A rightful owner of a Key is an Heir, the Trustee to whom it was originally entrusted, or a Steward. Over time, {{the use of a}} Key will irreparably turn a mortal into a Denizen, though it is mentioned that after a few centuries, this process may reverse a little. Because the presence of a Denizen in the Secondary Realms is inimical to mortal life, Arthur attempted to use the Keys as little as possible, as he wishes to remain mortal and return to his family; however, he later realizes that without the keys he would not be alive, and used the powers to protect the Lower House and his home town.|$|E

"One {{does not}} give {{something}} for nothing," [...] said the old woman, so she began fumbling about in her pocket until she found an old rusty <b>key.</b> And <b>the</b> best part of <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> whenever one looked through the ring of it, one saw everything just as it really was and not as it seemed to be.|$|R

2500|$|This {{equation}} {{is the foundation}} of vibration analysis for multiple degree of freedom systems. A similar type of result can be derived for damped systems. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the modal mass and stiffness matrices are diagonal matrices and therefore the equations have been [...] "decoupled". [...] In other words, the problem has been transformed from a large unwieldy multiple degree of freedom problem into many single degree of freedom problems that can be solved using the same methods outlined above.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the modern}} game, the Sri Lankan pace bowler Lasith Malinga {{has a very}} {{distinctive}} action which is authentic roundarm. This has earned him the name [...] "Slinga Malinga". There are some who question the legality of this action, but it is legal, because his arm does not straighten from a bent position as he bowls. This is the strict definition of bowling vis-à-vis throwing. In fact, many bowlers bowl with a slightly bent arm; <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they do not straighten it as they bowl.|$|E
2500|$|This {{is where}} {{statistical}} mechanics come into play, and where physicists begin to require rather unintuitive mental models: A particle's path simply cannot be exactly specified in its full quantum description. [...] "Path" [...] is a classical, practical attribute in our every day life, but one which quantum particles do not meaningfully possess. The probabilities discovered in quantum mechanics do nevertheless arise from measurement (of the perceived {{path of the}} particle). As Stephen Hawking explains, the result is not traditional determinism, but rather determined probabilities. In some cases, a quantum particle may indeed trace an exact path, and the probability of finding the particles in that path is one (certain to be true). In fact, as far as prediction goes, the quantum development {{is at least as}} predictable as the classical motion, but <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it describes wave functions that cannot be easily expressed in ordinary language. As far as the thesis of determinism is concerned, these probabilities, at least, are quite determined. These findings from quantum mechanics have found many applications, and allow us to build transistors and lasers. Put another way: personal computers, Blu-ray players and the internet all work because humankind discovered the determined probabilities of the quantum world. None of that should be taken to imply that other aspects of quantum mechanics are not still up for debate.|$|E

50|$|The {{starting}} point of ProgramByDesign is the observation that students act as computers ingrade school courses on arithmetic and middle/high school courses onpre/algebra.

50|$|Although fluoromethane is {{a special}} case, the above {{argument}} {{can be applied to}} any structure with a central atom and 2 or more substituents. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> concentrating atomic s character in orbitals directed towards electropositive substituents is more favorable than removing s character from orbitals directed towards electronegative substituents.|$|E
50|$|Evidence {{for each}} process exists, but <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these are unusual phenomena.

For example, the carbon isotopic composition of carbonatites is mantle-like and not like sedimentary limestone.|$|E
50|$|Bodin {{studied the}} balance of liberty and authority. He had no {{doctrine}} of separation of powers and argued in a traditional way about royal prerogative and its proper, limited sphere.

50|$|Beyond {{the five}} acts above, the {{paralegal}} can perform practically any other task, including legal research, legal writing, factual investigation, preparation of exhibits, and the day-to-day tasks of case management. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> attorneys are entirely {{responsible for the}} actions of their paralegals, and, by signing and filing court documents drafted by paralegals (or law clerks), attorneys make those documents their own.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of interface injection is that dependencies can be completely ignorant {{of their clients}} yet can still receive {{a reference to a}} new client and, using it, send a reference-to-self back to the client.

50|$|A feature {{much less}} commented-on than {{the order of}} <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> do not form a {{rectangular}} grid, but rather each column slants diagonally.

Some keyboards, such as the Kinesis or TypeMatrix, retain the QWERTY layout but arrange <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> in vertical columns, to reduce unnecessary lateral finger motion.|$|R

50|$|The SAE's {{magazine}} is produced quarterly, {{but given the}} club's shoestring budget and somewhat peripatetic nature, this was always goal rather than a promise. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a membership lasted until four issues were received; until the fourth arrived, membership continued unabated, so {{in a certain sense}} it was advantages for members not to receive a magazine. The first magazine was published in 1977 and No. 95 in 2010, an average of just under three magazines per year. Membership is now done on a yearly basis and isn't keyed to magazine production.|$|R
