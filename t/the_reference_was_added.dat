The research was done in 1988, and reported in the Dutch Language in a Research Paper of the University of Eindhoven (The Netherlands). As preparation for a comparable larger study in 2013, the original material is reprocessed, updated and presented here in the English language. The basis for this analysis is a group of 76 definitions from the period 1952 – 1988 (and Schumpeter’s definition from 1934). They resulted from a total of 300 manuscripts covering the subject Innovation. This population had been classified according to eight variables that were created from the keywords found in {{the definition}}s themselves. Variables like ‘’Subject’, ‘Stimulus’, ‘Moment’, ‘Novelty’, ‘Change’, ‘Object’, ‘Reference’,’ Success’. Of each of the definitions the year, nation and field of origin was registered. This paper consists out of five segments. In the Prologue we describe why we initiated the survey and the method used for searching for definitions of the word ’Innovation’. In the second part we describe the way we classified the found definitions. In the third part we present our observations for both the individual variables and for the definition profiles. In the fourth part we define and falsify the hypotheses. Finally in the Epilogue we try to reach an overall conclusion about what could be considered the abstract version of a definition. The Addendum gives all the definitions and their citations. ________________________________________________________________________________ This internal report presents the findings of a prelimenary survey on the definitions of the word 'innovation' in schoalrly literature till 1988.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{algorithms}} for the modelling of seismic wave propagation in 3 -D models with vertical {{as well as}} lateral variations of elastic parameters today. These algo-rithms normally make use of grid methods, as for example the finite-difference modelling. The decomposition of the models into different sub-domains and the usage of modern si-multaneous computers allows to considerably reduce run times for large 2 -D or 3 -D grids. Nevertheless up to now computations of wave propagation in 2 -D and 3 -D models require a high computational effort. Thus {{it is not possible}} to calculate numerous models within a short time, that is necessary for the application of inversion algorithms. To investigate scattered seismic waves at small-scale structures, we therefore developed an algorithm for the modelling of wave propagation in 3 -D media that applies the Born approximation.

40|$|Cascade decays {{of heavy}} flavor hadrons to states with neutral kaons are {{discussed}} {{as an instrument}} for detailed studies of the heavy hadron properties. For neutral flavored mesons the well-known kaon oscillations provide a unique experimental possibility of relating lighter/heavier eigenstate masses to (approximate) even/odd eigenstate CP-parities and to longer/shorter eigenstate lifetimes. As a result, they allow to eliminate sign ambiguities of CP-violating parameters and, therefore, to check the Standard Model (or to find New Physics). Specifically for charmed hadrons, both neutral/charged mesons and baryons, the secondary kaon oscillations permit unambiguous separation of Cabibbo-allowed and doubly-suppressed decay amplitudes, including measurement of their relative phases. For neutral $D$-meson decays the kaon oscillations can also discriminate, again unambiguously, between effects of $D$-meson mixing and interference of suppressed/allowed amplitudes. Another problem discussed is the influence of kaon CP-violation on the amplitude structure and on phenomenology of CP-violation in heavy hadron decays. Comment: LATEX, 6 pages, no figures.

The coherence of the theory imposes strong constraints upon the commutation relations of the modes of the fields.

30|$|The {{well-known}} {{properties of}} decorrelation and broadband of chaotic signals make them good candidates {{to be used}} in direct sequence spread spectrum systems [1, 9]. So, the chaos-based communication systems offer advantages as resistance to jamming, robustness in multi-path environments [7, 10], low probability of interception [11]. In addition, the complex-like behavior of chaotic signals propitiates secrecy in a physical level, and the easy-to-generate property of these signals offers a potential solution to implement low-cost systems [2, 12, 13]. Several coherent and non-coherent chaotic modulation schemes have been proposed in the literature. In the case of coherent modulation, the system requires a perfect knowledge of the chaotic sequence to demodulate the received signal. The detection is performed by using correlator-type receivers and this implies in a more complex communication system. Some well-known coherent modulations schemes are chaos shift keying (CSK) [11] and chaos-based DS-CDMA [14], where chaotic sequences are used to spread data signals. On the other hand, non-coherent modulation mitigates synchronization problems of chaotic oscillators at the receiver. This less complex nature leads to intense study of this modulation scheme such as differential chaos shift keying (DCSK) [11]. In DCSK systems, each transmitted symbol is represented by two consecutive chaotic samples. The first one <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> sample and <b>the</b> second one, which carries the data, <b>is</b> exactly <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> sample or its inverse, according to the information symbol to be transmitted. Other non-coherent modulation schemes have been proposed to overcome the decrease of the data rate and to improve the system performance. In the quadratic chaos shift keying (QCSK) [15], the system modulate digital information using orthogonal chaotic basis functions. In high efficiency DCSK (HE-DCSK) [16], the receiver recycles each reference sample to carry two bits of data when one data sample is modulated. The bandwidth efficiency is increased and the system becomes more robust to interception. Multi-carrier DCSK (MC-DCSK) [17] is a generalization of the DCSK to multiuser systems. An alternative solution, called OFDM-DCSK, was proposed in [18]. In the improved DSCK (I-DCSK) [19], <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> signal <b>is</b> <b>added</b> to <b>the</b> data carrier signal after time reversal in order to decrease the duration of the transmitted symbol by half of time and improve the spectral efficiency. Another recently proposed scheme <b>is</b> short <b>reference</b> DCSK (SR-DCSK) [20], which uses reference samples of reduced size when compared to DCSK to increase data rate and enhance energy efficiency of the system.|$|R
40|$|From March 2007 to April 2012 one of {{the main}} craters of Mt. Etna volcano, the South East Crater, was {{frequently}} active with spectacular, even though low dangerous, eruptions mainly in form of lava fountains. Thirty-three eruptive episodes occurred at that crater, encompassing thirty-two paroxysmal lava fountains (seven in 2007 - 2008 and twenty-ﬁve in 2011 - 2012), and a lava emission, started on 13 May 2008 and ended on 6 July 2009, along the upper eastern ﬂank of the volcano. From the seismic point of view, the onset of all these eruptions was heralded by changes in the spectral characteristics of volcanic tremor recorded by digital broadband stations, which permanently monitor the volcanic region. On the basis of the tremor data collected between 2007 and 2009, some of us (Messina and Langer) developed a software which, combining unsupervised classiﬁcation methods based on Kohonen Maps and the fuzzy cluster analysis, allows to identify transitions from pre-eruptive to eruptive activity through the classiﬁcation of the tremor characteristics (i. e. amplitude and frequency content). Since 2010 an on-line version of this software is adopted at the Osservatorio Etneo as {{one of the}} automatic alerting tools to identify early stages of eruptive events. The software carries out the analysis of the continuous data stream of two key seismic stations, for which <b>reference</b> datasets <b>were</b> elaborated taking into account the tremor data recorded during the eruptive episodes from 2007 to 2009. The numerous paroxysmal eruptions occurred in 2011 - 2012 and the improved network density, in particular on the summit crater area, after 2009, lead us to extend the application of automatic volcanic tremor classiﬁcation by using a larger number of stations at different elevation and distance from the summit craters. Datasets have been formed for the new stations, while for the previous key stations, <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> datasets <b>were</b> updated <b>adding</b> new patterns of the tremor signal. We discuss the performances of the classiﬁer for the various stations in terms of timing of the early variations and spatial distribution of the stations...|$|R
