The defeated warrior has a stronger body, a face more {{in keeping with the}} conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while <b>the</b> <b>victorious</b> man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness.

5|$|His {{allegiance}} to the Lancastrian regime remained strong {{enough for him to}} take arms against the House of York, and eventually cost him his life.
