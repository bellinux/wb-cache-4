5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are {{sensitive}} to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls before going off to forage. Just before dawn, they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. <b>Their</b> <b>eye</b> shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads up and down and from side to side.|$|E
5|$|In the Carnian {{stage of}} the Late Triassic (228.0 - 216.5 Mya), capitosauroids were joined by the superficially very similar Metoposauridae. Metoposaurids are {{distinguished}} from capitosauroids by the positioning of <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> sockets {{near the front of}} their skulls. Another group of stereospondyls, the plagiosaurs, had wide heads with external gills, and adapted to life at the bottom of lakes and rivers. By this time, temnospondyls had become a common and widespread component of semiaquatic ecosystems. Some temnospondyls, such as Cryobatrachus and Kryostega, even inhabited Antarctica, which was covered in temperate forests at the time.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have been}} hunting mammals in Asia {{for at least}} 40,000years, but until recently, slow lorises were only hunted at a {{sustainable}} level. However, hunting pressure since the 1960s has become increasingly unsustainable, leading to overexploitation, because of growing demand, decreased supply, and the subsequent increased value of the marketed wildlife. In 1985, large wildlife markets {{began to appear in}} Phnom Penh and Sen Monorom, Cambodia, followed quickly by the development of networks of hunters, traders, and middlemen. Bright flashlights make spotting slow lorises much easier at night because of <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> shine, and in the 1990s, large-scale commercial harvesting of slow lorises began as improved batteries for spotlights became available.|$|E

5000|$|When {{they are}} first born, <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> are {{on both sides}} of their body like other fish. However, when the pacific sand sole starts to mature, one of <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> starts to migrate to either the left or the right side of their body, just like a {{flounder}} when <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> migrate. From that point, <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> will stay that way. They will live {{on the bottom of the}} ocean, on the sand, lying on one side of their body, while both of <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> are on top of their body.|$|R

5|$|The Zelda team, however, had {{exhausted}} its {{ideas for}} this style and format. Aonuma hated the demo, finding it derivative of past Zelda games. The team explored other directions until designer Yoshiki Haruhana created a cartoonish {{drawing of a}} young Link that caught <b>their</b> <b>eye.</b> Design manager Satoru Takizawa drew up an enemy Moblin in a similar style, and the team seized on the new gameplay and combat possibilities afforded by the stylized cartoon aesthetic. To achieve this look, they used cel shading on 3D models, giving the look of an interactive cartoon. The developers built the game with Alias/Wavefront's Maya 3D tool and a custom game engine.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV is a massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game (MMORPG) {{in which}} the player controls a customized Adventurer avatar {{from one of the}} five playable races. Each race has two tribes, and all but two allow for the selection of male or female characters. The avatar can have <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> and hair color, facial features, and skin tone customized, and features such as birthmarks and scars can be added. Their chosen tribe, along with their chosen patron deity, affect their stats and elemental attributes. The game's opening varies depending on which starting location is chosen. Two different types of quests are available for players: story quests, which are unlocked as characters accumulate experience points (EXP) and raise their experience level while unlocking new abilities; and Levequests (leves), side quests accessed through the Adventurers' Guilds. Leves are broken down into multiple types, focusing on gathering or combat. Levequests are associated with particular non-playable characters (NPCs). As the player completes leves, they gain favor with three different factions and unlock new abilities, with rewards only coming from the NPCs within the factions who issued the quest. Gaining favor also unlocks a new type of level called Faction leves, which deplete a character's favor when completed.|$|E
5|$|Narrow/closed angle {{glaucoma}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} inheritable trait in the breed. It {{is a leading}} cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the eye. If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough, or slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle glaucoma. Symptoms can include redness in the eye, the eye itself looking cloudy, sensitivity to light and the dog may rub at <b>their</b> <b>eye,</b> or even rub it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful. Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited glaucoma appears in one eye then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually.|$|E

5|$|Strepsirrhines {{are defined}} by their wet nose or rhinarium. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large {{olfactory}} lobes for smell, a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> sockets include a ring of bone around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the front, {{lower part of the}} mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms. Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms possessed grooming claws.|$|E

25|$|During mating rituals, {{mantis shrimp}} {{actively}} fluoresce, and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> pigments. Females are only fertile during certain {{phases of the}} tidal cycle; the ability to perceive the phase of the moon may therefore help prevent wasted mating efforts. It may also give mantis shrimp information {{about the size of}} the tide, which is important to species living in shallow water near the shore.|$|E
25|$|Barn funnel weavers {{are active}} and agile hunters, relying on both their vision and {{movement}} speed {{as well as}} web mechanisms. <b>Their</b> <b>eye</b> configuration, with six out of eight sighting forward, allows them to distinguish even the smallest movement {{in front of them}} and either follow it, or retreat, if the movement is too large. These spiders are also known to be photosensitive, i.e. moving to or fleeing from the light, depending on situations.|$|E
25|$|Pile disliked {{school and}} thus {{received}} little education. He {{was put to}} work very young. His character was more practical than theoretical, trusting more to <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> than the plan. He constantly watched {{the progress of the}} ships he had built, corresponding with their captains. His custom was to seek information where he thought it was to be got, and to get it he used periodically to visit the largest ports of the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Sunglasses or sun {{glasses are}} a visual aid which feature lenses that are {{coloured}} or darkened to prevent strong light {{from reaching the}} eyes. For centuries, Chinese judges had routinely worn smoke-colored quartz lenses to conceal <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> expressions in court. However, these were not intended for blocking sunlight from eyes. It wasn't until the 20th century that what is now considered to be sunglasses were invented. In 1929, Sam Foster invented and mass-produced the first tinted eyewear pieces solely intended to block out sunlight.|$|E
25|$|Menegele's {{experiments}} included placing {{subjects in}} pressure chambers, testing drugs on them, freezing them, attempting to change <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> color by injecting chemicals into children's eyes, and amputations and other surgeries. Other experiments {{took place at}} Buchenwald, Dachau, Natzweiler, Neuengamme, Ravensbrück, Sachsenhausen, and elsewhere. Some dealt with sterilization of men and women, the treatment of war wounds, ways to counteract chemical weapons, research into new vaccines and drugs, and survival of harsh conditions. At least 7000 prisoners were subjected to these experiments; most died during them or afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Floaters {{are able}} to catch and refract light in ways that {{somewhat}} blur vision temporarily until the floater moves to a different area. Often they trick persons who are troubled by floaters into thinking they see {{something out of the}} corner of <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> that really is not there. Most persons come to terms with the problem, after a time, and learn to ignore their floaters. For persons with severe floaters it is nearly impossible to completely ignore the large masses that constantly stay within almost direct view.|$|E

25|$|Several {{species of}} mantis shrimp, which are stomatopod crustaceans, {{including}} Lysiosquillina glabriuscula, have yellow fluorescent markings along their antennal scales and carapace (shell) that males present during threat displays to predators and other males. The display involves raising {{the head and}} thorax, spreading the striking appendages and other maxillipeds, and extending the prominent, oval antennal scales laterally, which makes the animal appear larger and accentuates its yellow fluorescent markings. Furthermore, as depth increases, mantis shrimp fluorescence accounts for a greater part of the visible light available. During mating rituals, mantis shrimp actively fluoresce, and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> pigments.|$|E
25|$|The {{jumping spider}} family (Salticidae) {{contains}} over 600 described genera {{and more than}} 5800 described species, making it the largest family of spiders with about 13% of all species. Jumping spiders {{have some of the}} best vision among arthropods and use it in courtship, hunting, and navigation. Although they normally move unobtrusively and fairly slowly, most species are capable of very agile jumps, notably when hunting, but sometimes in response to sudden threats or crossing long gaps. Both their book lungs and tracheal system are well-developed, and they use both systems (bimodal breathing). Jumping spiders are generally recognized by <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> pattern. All jumping spiders have four pairs of eyes, with the anterior median pair being particularly large.|$|E
25|$|Another {{distinctive}} feature {{of both the}} Porajmos and the Holocaust was the extensive use of human subjects in medical experiments. The most notorious of these physicians was Dr. Josef Mengele, {{who worked in the}} Auschwitz concentration camp. His experiments included placing subjects in pressure chambers, testing drugs on them, freezing them, attempting to change <b>their</b> <b>eye</b> color by injecting chemicals into children's eyes and various amputations and other brutal surgeries. The full extent of his work will never be known because the truckload of records he sent to Dr. Otmar von Verschuer at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was destroyed by von Verschuer. Mengele's own journals, consisting of some 3,300 pages, are likely never to be published, and they are suspected to contain denials of the Holocaust. Subjects who survived Mengele's experiments were almost always killed and dissected shortly afterwards.|$|E
