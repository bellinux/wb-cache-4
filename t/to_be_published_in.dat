5|$|In 1981, The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson was published. Using the {{physical}} evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>published</b> <b>in</b> their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W.

Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems {{to be more than}} chronological or convenient.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the experiment in American Medicine, physician Augustus P. Clarke criticized the experiment's validity. Clarke noted {{that at the time of}} death there is a sudden rise in body temperature as the lungs are no longer cooling blood, causing a subsequent rise in sweating which could easily account for MacDougall’s missing 21 grams. Clarke also pointed out that, as dogs do not have sweat glands, they would not lose weight in this manner after death. Clarke's criticism was published in the May issue of American Medicine. Arguments between MacDougall and Clarke debating the validity of the experiment continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>published</b> <b>in</b> the journal until at least December that year.|$|E

In 2011 Network Rail began work on gathering evidence for its study, beginning with cutting away vegetation on track sections to examine the condition of rails and track bedding.
