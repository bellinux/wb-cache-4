40|$|AbstractObjective: The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify the {{anatomic}} variations of the intrathoracic nerve of Kuntz, and this should help delineate the resection margins during video-assisted thoracic sympathectomy. Methods: Sixty-six <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chains of 39 adult Korean cadavers were dissected on both sides of the thorax in 27 cadavers (54 sides) and on one side in 12 cadavers (12 sides). Results: The intrathoracic nerve was observed in 45 (68. 2 %) sides and was present bilaterally in 48. 1 % of cadavers. No intrathoracic nerve or ascending ramus communicans arising from the second thoracic nerve was observed in only 5 (7. 6 %) sides. The diameter of the intrathoracic nerve was 1. 25 ± 0. 55 mm on average. The arising point of the intrathoracic nerve from the second thoracic nerve was 7. 3 mm on average from the sympathetic trunk. Presence of the stellate ganglion was noted in 56 (84. 8 %) sides, and 6 (9. 1 %) sides showed a single large ganglion formed by the stellate and the second <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> ganglia. The second <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> ganglion was most commonly located (50 %) in the second intercostal space. Conclusion: The anatomic variations of the intrathoracic nerve of Kuntz and the second <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> ganglion were characterized in human cadavers. It is hoped that this study will help to improve the recurrence of symptoms caused by the intrathoracic nerve in an upper thoracic sympathectomy for hyperhidrosis.

40|$|ObjectiveThe study {{objectives}} were to assess 1) postoperative satisfaction and {{the occurrence of}} compensatory sweating after endoscopic <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> clipping in a consecutive series of patients and 2) the reversibility of adverse effects by removing the surgical clips. MethodsBetween June 1998 and March 2006, 727 patients undergoing bilateral endoscopic <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> clipping for hyperhidrosis or facial blushing were prospectively followed for postoperative satisfaction and subjective compensatory sweating. The effect of removing the surgical clips was assessed in 34 patients who underwent a subsequent reversal procedure after endoscopic <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> clipping. Satisfaction and compensatory sweating were assessed using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the highest degree. ResultsFollow-up was complete in 666 patients (92 %). The median age was 26. 9 years, and 383 (53 %) were men. The level of sympathetic clipping was T 2 in 399 patients (55 %), T 2 + 3 in 55 patients (8 %), and T 3 + 4 in 273 patients (38 %). Median follow-up was 10. 4 months (range 0 – 83 months). Excellent satisfaction (8 – 10 on visual analogue scale) was seen at last follow-up in 288 (74 %) of the T 2 group, 33 (62 %) of the T 2 + 3 group, and 184 (85 %) of the T 3 + 4 group. Postoperative satisfaction was significantly higher in the T 3 + 4 group {{when compared with the}} T 2 or T 2 + 3 groups (P <. 01). Severe compensatory sweating (8 – 10 on the visual analogue scale) was reported in 42 (13 %) of the T 2 group, 11 (28 %) of the T 2 + 3 group, and 17 (8 %) of the T 3 + 4 group. Postoperative compensatory sweating was significantly lower in the T 3 + 4 group when compared with the T 2 or T 2 + 3 groups (P <. 05). Thirty-four patients have subsequently undergone removal of the surgical clips after endoscopic <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> clipping. Follow-up was complete in 31 patients. The reasons for removal included severe compensatory sweating in 32 patients, anhydrosis of the upper limb in 4 patients, lack of improvement or recurrence of hyperhidrosis in 5 patients, and other adverse symptoms in 5 patients. The reversal procedure was done after a median time of 11. 0 months (range 1 – 57 months) after endoscopic <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> clipping. The initial level of clipping was T 2 in 21 patients, T 2 + 3 in 7 patients, and T 3 + 4 in 6 patients. There was a trend toward fewer subsequent reversal procedures in the T 3 + 4 group when compared with the T 2 or T 2 + 3 groups (P =. 06). Fifteen patients (48 %) reported a substantial decrease in their compensatory sweating (5 – 10 on the visual analogue scale) after reversal. Thirteen patients (42 %) reported that their initial hyperhidrosis or facial blushing has remained well controlled (8 – 10 on the visual analogue scale) after reversal. There was no significant relationship between the original level of clipping and the interval between endoscopic <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> clipping and the subsequent reversal and reversibility of symptoms. ConclusionWhen compared with endoscopic <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> clipping at the T 2 or T 2 + 3 levels, endoscopic <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> clipping at the T 3 + 4 level was associated with a higher satisfaction rate, a lower rate of severe compensatory sweating, and a trend toward fewer subsequent reversal procedures. Subjective reversibility of adverse effects after endoscopic <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> clipping was seen in approximately half of the patients who underwent endoscopic removal of surgical clips. Although yet to be supported by electrophysiologic studies, reversal of sympathetic clipping seems to provide acceptable results and should be considered in selected patients...|$|E
40|$|Background : Unilateral lumbar sympathectomy {{involved}} {{that increased}} skin temperature on the ipsilateral foot and simultaneously decreased temperature on contralateral foot. In the neurolyzed extremity, blood flow increased {{at the expense}} of contralateral blood flow. The compensatory distribution of blood is called “borrowing-lending”　phenomenon (DeBakey. 1947), on which few reported on the account of <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> neurolysis, hence effects of volume preload on the phenomenon were elucidated under radiofrequency neurolysis of <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> ganglion in anesthetized dogs. Method : The 30 dogs were divided into three groups following pre-neurolysis level of right atrial pressure (RA) : 1) hypovolemic group (n= 10) : RA< 3 mmHg, 2) normovolemic group (n= 10) : 3 mmHg≦RA≦ 6 mmHg, 3) hypervolemic group (n= 10) : 6 mmHg<RA. Skin temperature on the bilateral costal arch region and hemodynamic variables were measured before and after neurolysis. Results : No significant changes of hemodynamic variables were observed in all groups. Regional skin temperature of the neurolyzed side increased significantly 5 and 20 minutes after neurolysis. The contralateral skin temperature simultaneously decreased in hypovolemic and normovolemic groups, but we found no change of temperature in hypervolemic group. Conclusion : These results suggest that volume loading plays an important role to antagonize the “borrowing-lending”　(Compensatory phenomenon) produced by　radiofrequency neurolysis of <b>thoracic</b>　<b>sympathetic</b> ganglions...|$|E

40|$|To {{define the}} role of artemin in {{sympathetic}} neurone development, we have studied the effect of artemin on the generation, survival and growth of sympathetic neurones in low-density dissociated cultures of mouse cervical and <b>thoracic</b> paravertebral <b>sympathetic</b> ganglia at stages throughout embryonic and postnatal development. Artemin promoted the proliferation of sympathetic neuroblasts and increased the generation of new neurones in cultures established from E 12 to E 14 ganglia. Artemin also exerted a transient survival-promoting action on newly generated neurones during these early stages of development. Between E 16 and P 8, artemin exerted no effect on survival, but by P 12, as sympathetic neurones begin to acquire neurotrophic factor independent survival, artemin once again enhanced survival, and by P 20 it promoted survival as effectively as nerve growth factor (NGF). During this late period of development, artemin also enhanced the growth of neurites from cultured neurones more effectively than NGF. Confirming the physiological relevance of the mitogenic action of artemin on cultured neuroblasts, there was a marked reduction {{in the rate of}} neuroblast proliferation in the sympathetic ganglia of mice lacking the GFRalpha 3 subunit of the artemin receptor. These results indicate that artemin exerts several distinct effects on the generation, survival and growth of sympathetic neurones at different stages of development...|$|R

Twelve subjects underwent three 60 degrees upright tilts: (1) with the neck flexed from 0 degrees to 30 degrees {{relative to the}} body during 60 degrees tilt, such that the head moved from horizontal to 90 degrees above horizontal (0 to 1 Gz otolith stimulation); (2) with the head and body aligned, such that they tilted together to 60 degrees (0 to 0. 87 Gz otolith stimulation); and (3) with the neck flexed 30 degrees relative to the body during supine conditions, and the neck then extended to - 30 degrees during 60 degrees body tilting, such that the head remained at 30 degrees above horizontal throughout body tilting (constant 0. 5 Gz otolith stimulation). All three tilt procedures increased <b>thoracic</b> impedance, <b>sympathetic</b> nerve activity (N = 8 of 12), arterial pressure, and heart rate relative to supine conditions (all P < 0. 04). Within the first 20 s of tilt, arterial pressure increased most obviously in the 0 to 1 Gz otolith condition. Thoracic impedance tended to increase more in otolith-constant conditions, but no dependent variable differed significantly between tilt conditions, and no significant time x tilt interactions emerged. Otolith inputs may contribute to early transient adjustments to orthostasis. However, lack of significant main effects of tilt condition and time x tilt interactions suggests that potential otolith effects on the variables we studied are relatively subtle and ephemeral, or that other mechanisms compensate {{for a lack of}} change in otolith input with orthostasis...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} {{experiments on}} the isolated gut of the guinea pig and the rabbit, it was demonstrated that certain sulfur containing compounds such as sodium sulfathiazole, sodium sulfamerazine and sulfanilamide (1) {{as well as}} thiamine hydrochloride and thiazole (2) inhibit the contraction of smooth muscles induced by stimulation of the sympathetic synapses with nicotine. The action is reversi-ble and is not caused by a preceding paralysis of the ganglia.

40|$|SUMMARY:The {{present study}} reports an {{anomalous}} branching {{pattern of the}} <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chain. At the level of T 3 ganglion, an anomalous branch i. e accessory sympathetic chain (ASC) descended anteromedial to the main sympathetic chain (MSC). The MSC and the ASC communicated with {{each other at the}} level of T 9, T 10 and T 11 ganglion, indicating the absence of classical pattern of greater, lesser and least splanchnic nerves on the right side. However, on the left side, the sympathetic chain displayed normal branching pattern. We opine that the ASC may be representing a higher origin of greater splanchnic nerve at the level of T 3 ganglion and the branches from MSC at T 9, T 10 and T 11 ganglion may be the lesser and least splanchnic nerves, which further joined the ASC (i. e presumably the greater splanchnic nerve) to form a common trunk. This common trunk pierced the right crus of diaphragm to reach the right suprarenal plexus after giving few branches to the celiac plexus.

40|$|ObjectiveEndoscopic {{thoracic}} sympathectomy {{is performed}} to treat primary hyperhidrosis. The {{second and third}} <b>sympathetic</b> <b>thoracic</b> ganglia excised also innervate the heart. Some studies have shown decreased heart rate but have not been conclusive regarding other cardiac effects of sympathectomy. We studied the cardiac autonomic effects of endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy {{in a group of}} patients with primary hyperhidrosis. Heart rate variability is a simple, noninvasive electrocardiographic marker reflecting the activity and balance of the sympathetic and vagal components of the autonomous nervous system. MethodsWe performed a prospective study in 38 patients with primary hyperhidrosis with 24 -hour Holter recordings obtained before endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy and 6 months later. ResultsWe found statistically significant differences (P <. 05) in both time and frequency domains. Parameters that evaluate global cardiac autonomic activity (total power, SD of normal R-R intervals, SD of average normal R-R intervals) and vagal activity (rhythm corresponding to percentage of normal R-R intervals with cycle greater than 50 ms relative to previous interval, square root of mean squared differences of successive normal R-R intervals, high-frequency power, high-frequency power in normalized units) were statistically significantly increased after sympathectomy. Low-frequency power in normalized units, reflecting sympathetic activity, was statistically significantly decreased after sympathectomy. Low-/high-frequency power ratio also showed a significant decrease, indicating relative decrease in sympathetic activity and increase in vagal activity.

We developed a novel approach for thoracic sympathectomy in patients with palmar hyperhidrosis through the umbilicus, using an ultrathin gastroscope. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the continuing efficacy and patient satisfaction of this innovative surgery. MethodsAll procedures were performed under general anesthesia and the patients were intubated with a dual-lumen endotracheal tube. After a 5 -mm umbilical incision, the muscular parts of the diaphragmatic dome were incised with a needle-knife and the nasal gastroscope was advanced into the <b>thoracic</b> cavity. The <b>sympathetic</b> chain was identified at the desired thoracic level and ablated with hot biopsy forceps. All patients were followed up for at least 1 year after the procedure through clinic visits or telephone/e-mail interviews. ResultsFrom April 2010 to August 2011, a total of 35 patients underwent a transumbilical thoracic sympathectomy. Fifty-seven percent were male patients, with a mean age of 21. 2 years (range, 16 - 33 years). The success rate after 12 months was 97. 1 % (34 of 35) for isolated palmar hyperhidrosis and 72. 2 % (13 of 18) for axillary hyperhidrosis. Compensatory sweating was reported in 28. 6 % of patients at the 1 -year follow-up evaluation. There was no mortality, no diaphragmatic hernia, and no Horner syndrome was observed. Quality of life related to hyperhidrosis improved substantially in 27 (77. 1 %) patients, and improved in 4 (11. 4 %) patients at 12 months after surgery. A total of 94. 3 % of patients were satisfied with the excellent cosmetic results of the surgical incision.

40|$|<b>Thoracic</b> and lumbar <b>sympathetic</b> ganglia from donor guinea-pigs were transplanted {{to the bed}} of an excised {{superior}} cervical ganglion in host animals. Homotopic transplants {{of superior}} cervical ganglia served as controls. In this way {{the same set of}} preganglionic axons (the cervical sympathetic trunk) was confronted with ganglia from different levels of the sympathetic chain. Re-innervation of the transplants was studied after 3 - 5 months. 1. Neurones in ganglia transplanted from different levels of the sympathetic chain were re-innervated to about the same over-all degree by the preganglionic axons of the host's cervical sympathetic trunk. Thus, the mean amplitude of post-synaptic potentials, the estimated number of innervating axons, and the number of spinal segments providing innervation to each neurone were similar in transplanted thoracic, lumbar and superior cervical ganglion cells. 2. Neurones in transplanted mid-thoracic ganglia, however, were re-innervated more frequently, and more strongly, by axons arising from more caudal thoracic segments than neurones in transplanted superior cervical ganglia. Stimulation of axons arising from the fourth thoracic spinal segment (T 4), for example, elicited post-synaptic potentials that on average were twice as large in transplanted fifth thoracic ganglion cells as in transplanted superior cervical ganglion cells; conversely, axons arising from T 1 re-innervated neurones in the superior cervical ganglion about 2 - 3 times more effectively than fifth thoracic ganglion cells. This difference in the re-innervation of the fifth thoracic and the superior cervical ganglion is {{in the same direction as}} (although less pronounced than) the normal difference in the segmental innervation of these ganglia. 3. Transplanted lumbar ganglia were also re-innervated more effectively by relatively caudal segments compared to re-innervated cervical ganglia, but this difference was no greater than that observed for transplanted thoracic ganglia. 4. We conclude that preganglionic axons can distinguish (or be distinguished by) ganglia derived from different levels of the sympathetic chain. Our findings are consistent with the view that ganglion cells have some permanent property that biases the innervation they receive...|$|R

After CIH, awake rats (n = 14) exhibited higher levels of mean arterial pressure than controls (101 ± 3 versus 89 ± 3 mmHg, n = 15, P < 0. 01). Recordings of phrenic, <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic,</b> cervical vagus and abdominal nerves were performed in the in situ working heart–brainstem preparations of control and CIH juvenile rats. The data obtained in CIH rats revealed that: (i) abdominal (Abd) nerves exhibited an additional burst discharge in late expiration; (ii) <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nerve activity (tSNA) was greater during late expiration than in controls (52 ± 5 versus 40 ± 3 %; n = 11, P < 0. 05; values expressed according to the maximal activity observed during inspiration and the noise level recorded {{at the end of}} each experiment), which was not dependent on peripheral chemoreceptors; (iii) the additional late expiratory activity in the Abd nerve correlated with the increased tSNA; (iv) the enhanced late expiratory activity in the Abd nerve unique to CIH rats was accompanied by reduced post-inspiratory activity in cervical vagus nerve compared to controls. The data indicate that CIH rats present an altered pattern of central sympathetic–respiratory coupling, with increased tSNA that correlates with enhanced late expiratory discharge in the Abd nerve. Thus, CIH alters the coupling between the central respiratory generator and sympathetic networks that may contribute to the induced hypertension in this experimental model...|$|E

During development, sympathetic axons grow from <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> ganglia along rib periosteum to reach the sternum. All sympathetic axons displayed catecholaminergic properties {{when they reached the}} sternum, but these properties subsequently disappeared. Many axons lacked detectable immunoreactivities for vesicular acetylcholine transporter and vasoactive intestinal peptide whe...|$|E
40|$|Neurotrophin- 4 (NT- 4) {{is perhaps}} the still most enigmatic member of the {{neurotrophin}} family. We show here that NT- 4 is expressed in neurons of paravertebral and prevertebral sympathetic ganglia, i. e., the superior cervical (SCG), stellate (SG), and celiac (CG) ganglion. Mice deficient for NT- 4 showed a significant reduction (20 – 30 %) of preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the intermediolateral column (IML) of the thoracic spinal cord. In contrast, neuron numbers in the SCG, SG, and CG were unchanged. Numbers of axons in the <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> trunk (TST) connecting the SG with lower paravertebral ganglia were also reduced, whereas axon numbers in the cervical sympathetic trunk (CST) were unaltered. Axon losses in the TST were paralleled by losses of synaptic terminals on SG neurons visualized by electron microscopy. Furthermore, immunoreactivity for the synaptic vesicle antigen SV 2 was clearl...|$|E
40|$|The steal {{phenomenon}} {{between the}} bilateral sides following unilateral sympathetic denervation can {{be influenced by}} intravascular blood volume. We studied the changes in skin temperature {{as an indicator of}} this phenomenon induced by unilateral lumbar or <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> ganglion blockade in dogs under various hemodynamics. Each of 30 dogs in lumbar and thoracic experiments, which were divided into three groups according to mean right atrial pressure (RAP, mmHg) as hypovolemic (RAP＜ 3; n= 10), normovolemic (3 ≦RAP≦ 6; n= 10) and hypervolemic (RAP＞ 6; n= 10), underwent'unilat- eral high-frequency thermocoagulation in lumbar (L 5 -L 7) or thoracic (Th 7 -Th 11) sympathetic ganglia. Skin temperature at planta of both hindlimbs or bilateral costal arches was compared among three groups for 60 minutes following･either blockade. Ipsilateral skin temperature rose in all groups (p＜ 0. 05). Contralateral skin temperature fell significantly only in the hypovolemic and the normovolemic groups (p＜ 0. 05), but not in the hypervolemic group. After lumbar sympathetic blockade, the changes is the contralateral skin temperature for 60 minutes, expressed {{as a percentage of the}} respective control value, were significantly larger (p＜ 0. 05) in the hypovolemic (- 6. 4 ± 1. 8 %) and the normovolemic (- 6. 0 ± 2. 2 %) groups than that in the hypervolemic group (+ 0. 1 ± 1. 7 %). After <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> blockade, this percentage change was significantly differ- ent (p＜ 0. 05) among the hypovolemic (- 1. 2 ± 0. 7 %), the normovolemic (- 0. 7 ± 0. 6 %) and the hypervolemic (+ 0. 0 ± 0. 4 %) groups. We conclude that the steal phenomenon may be influenced by intravascular volume. Therefore, it is necessary to sufficiently understand the patient's systemic hemodynamics or peripheral circulation in performing unilateral sympathetic ganglion blockade. Further- more, a pretreatment such as a preoperative volume loading can be beneficial, especially for the hypovolemic patient who has bilateral vascular disorders...|$|E
40|$|In insects, {{octopamine}} {{is present}} in neurohaemal regions of the <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nervous system, but its cellular source is unknown. We describe a dorsal unpaired median neurone (DUM 1 b) in the locust metathoracic ganglion that forms a meshwork of varicose, presumably neurohaemal, endings on the surfaces of sympathetic nerves. Other targets include several ventral longitudinal muscles, the spiracle closer muscle, tissue remnants of degenerated nymphal muscles and the salivary glands. Using an established antiserum, DUM 1 b is shown to be octopamine-immunoreactive, and its target muscles to be covered with octopamine-immunoreactive varicosities. Octopamine influences one of these muscles in essentially {{the same way that}} another well-described octopaminergic neurone, DUMEti, modulates the extensor tibiae muscle of the hind leg. We propose that DUM 1 b is an octopaminergic modulator of muscle contractions and may also influence numerous other body functions by releasing octopamine as a hormone from sympathetic neurohaemal areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} supplies each type of target organ via separate pathways which consist of sets of pre- and postganglionic neurones with distinct patterns of reflex activity. This has been firmly established for the lumbar sympathetic nervous system to skin, skeletal muscle and viscera, for the <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> outflow to the head and for several parasympathetic systems. In principle, that was already known by Langley. The specificity of the messages that these pathways transmit from {{the central nervous system}} arises from integration within precisely organized pathways in the neuraxis. The messages travel along discrete functional pathways and are transmitted to the target tissues via close neuroeffector junctions. Integration in the periphery occurs within each pathway, both in ganglia and {{at the level of the}} effector organs. We still need to understand how the central messages get through without distortion and how they control the diverse functions of the vasculature and viscera...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrical}} {{storm is}} {{usually associated with}} catecholaminergic surge following myocardial ischaemia and manifest as recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, requiring frequent DC shocks. Delivering repeated DC shocks induces myocardial damage and further worsens the arrhythmias, which are resistant to the antiarrhythmic drugs. Cardiac sympathetic blockade abates the excessive catecholaminergic drive and help pacifying the malignant ventricular arrhythmias. We treated the electrical storm in a 52 -year-old male with ultrasound-guided left sympathetic ganglion block followed by surgical left cardiac sympathetic denervation. The patient remained symptom-free without any incident of ventricular arrhythmias for 8 months after the surgery. The ultrasonography during blockade of the stellate ganglion enhances the success rate of the technique, reduces the quantity of local anaesthetic required to produce desired effects and prevents technical complications. Supraclavicular surgical access to the upper <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> chain obviates the necessity for one lung ventilation and lateral decubitus during surgery, when the patient is in hemodynamically unstable condition. Sympathectomy can be performed under general anaesthesia taking cautions to avoid sympathetic stimulation in intraoperative period...|$|E
40|$|This man’s {{episodes of}} {{unilateral}} sweating (figure 1), flushing and piloerection started after heavy physical work moving 20 tons of gravel. Harlequin syndrome {{may be due}} to an underlying defect in the region of the <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> outflow as discussed in the literature. Sudomotor and vasomotor sympathetic fibres exiting the spinal cord through the second and third thoracic roots have been implicated and it is conceivable that extreme exertion may have been associated with arterial dissection and disruption of an anterior radicular artery at this level. 1 Thoracoscopic sympathectomy was considered but not performed and he did show spontaneous improvement over 3 years of follow-up. Learning points ▸ Harlequin syndrome is an unusual cause of unilateral loss of sweating, generally noticed by the patient because of contralateral flushing and hyperhidrosis. ▸ The onset can be after heavy exertion or trauma, raising the possibility of arterial dissection as the underlying cause. ▸ Harlequin syndrome is benign and may show spontaneous improvement over time, thus obviating the need for surgical intervention.

40|$|Neurolytic <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> {{ganglion}} blockade {{has only}} relatively recently been introduced as a clinical therapeutic strategy. To cast {{light on the}} efficacy of this procedure, data for 111 patients (21 - 78 years old, 132 affected extremities/sites) were analyzed. Methods : A comparative assessment was performed with fluoroscopic and contrast-radiographic observation of the blockade using chemical or thermocoagulative approaches, with anterior paratracheal or posterior paravertebral injection sites and upper-thoracic or lower-thoracic regions. Results : Chemical neurolytic sympathetic ganglion blockade was applied to patients 217 times, and radiofrequency thermocoagulation at 90 ℃ for 180 seconds a total of 64 times. Statistically, chemical neurolytiques proved longer lasting than thermocoagulation neurolytiques but {{no significant differences between}} anterior and posterior approaches were observed regarding the period of influence. Lower-thoracic injection was associated with a longer effective duration than evident with the upper-thoracic group. Complications were observed with chemical neurolytique including two cases of pneumothorax, two cases of Horner's syndrome and one case of nerve injury, despite radiographic evaluation. Conclusions : Chemical or radiofrequency thermocoagulation neurolytique can be extensively applied to patients suffering from persistent intractable pain in the cervical or thoracic regions, but performance under fluoroscopy is an absolute requiement. 個人の特定が出来ると思われる写真が掲載されているため本文PDFの登録はな...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} {{defibrillation}} is to rapidly restore blood flow and tissue perfusion following ventricular fibrillation and shock delivery. We tested the hypotheses that (1) {{a series of}} 1 -msec pulses of various amplitudes, delivered before the defibrillation shock, can improve hemodynamics following the shock and (2) this hemodynamic improvement is due to stimulation of cardiac or <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nerves. Methods and Results: Part 1 : In ten anesthetized pigs, a burst of either 15 or 30 1 -msec pulses ranging from 0. 1 to 10 Amps in strength were given during ventricular fibrillation after which defibrillation was performed. ECG, arterial blood pressure and left ventricular pressure were recorded. Defibrillation shocks and burst pulses were delivered from a right ventricular coil elec-trode to superior vena cava coil and left chest wall electrodes. After an initial series of trials, sympathetic blockade was induced with timolol, 1 mg/kg, and the trials were repeated. Part 2 : The {{first half of the}} above protocol was repeated in two animals that were pretreated with reser-pine. Part 1 : Heart rate following 1, 2, 5, and 10 Amp pulses was significantly higher tha...|$|E
40|$|Alphaherpesvirus {{reactivation}} from <b>thoracic</b> <b>sympathetic</b> ganglia (TSG) and transaxonal {{spread to}} target organs cause human visceral disease. Yet alphaherpesvirus latency in TSG {{has not been}} well characterized. In this study, quantitative PCR detected varicella-zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV- 1), and HSV- 2 DNA in 117 fresh TSG obtained postmortem from 15 subjects. VZVDNAwas found in 76 (65 %) ganglia from all subjects, HSV- 1 DNAwas found in 5 (4 %) ganglia from 3 subjects, and no HSV- 2 was found. After primary infection, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) becomeslatent in cranial nerve ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, and auto-nomic ganglia along the entire neuraxis (1 – 7), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV- 1) DNA becomes latent in cranial nerve, dorsal root, and autonomic ganglia (2, 5 – 10), and HSV- 2 DNA becomes latent primarily in sacral ganglia {{as well as in}} cranial nerve and other dorsal root ganglia (5, 9). Alphaherpesvirus reactivation from tho-racic sympathetic ganglia (TSG) and transaxonal spread to target organs cause human visceral disease. However, latency in TSG has not been well characterized because earlier studies used formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. To assess autonomic gan...|$|E
