40|$|<b>Trimming</b> fat off <b>meat</b> is {{recommended}} for reducing intake of saturated fat. This paper reviews trends over 20 years that have influenced the red meat supply in response to consumer and health professional demands for lean meat, drawing on published survey data, marketing information, analysis of meat content and qualitative research commission by Meat and Livestock Australia. Separable fat is the greatest determinant of the saturated fat in Australian red meat, and changes in processing and butchering practices have combined <b>to</b> produce red <b>meat</b> today with significantly lower saturated fat. Nutrient analyses in 2002 showed that the separable fat on raw retail samples was up to 38 % less than in comparable cuts in 1983. Further trimming by consumers prior to consumption is also increasing. In 2007, 89 % of consumers reported buying <b>trimmed</b> <b>meat</b> or removing some or all fat prior to consumption. The 1995 National Nutrition Survey showed that red meat contributed less than 10 % of dietary saturated fat intake in Australia, and continues to make {{an important contribution to}} intake of iron, zinc, omega- 3 and vitamin B 12, as well as encouraging consumption of vegetables. Deitary messages and strategies for reducing saturated fat have increased fat trimming practices by retailers as well as consumers. Consequently, <b>trimmed</b> red <b>meat</b> is not a major source of saturated fat in the Australian diet. To avoid overestimating total and saturated fat intake, dietary advice and analyses should ensure data reflects red meat as consumed rather than as purchased...|$|R

50|$|Meat hanging is {{a culinary}} process, used in beef aging, that {{improves}} {{the flavor of}} meats by allowing the natural enzymes in the <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> break down the tissue through dry aging.

40|$|ABSTRACT Broiler {{carcasses}} {{are often}} trimmed during evisceration to remove damaged {{areas of the}} carcass. Be-cause deboning before rigor mortis development can toughen <b>meat,</b> <b>trimming</b> during evisceration may toughen the meat. This study evaluated the effects of trimming on the tenderness of broiler breast <b>meat.</b> <b>To</b> evaluate the effect of wing removal on tenderness, breast halves from 2 flocks were collected after chilling at a commercial plant. One-third were untrimmed controls, one-third had small amounts of breast meat removed with wing (WMin), and one-third had large amounts of breast meat removed with wing (Wmax). Salvage fillets from the 2 flocks were also collected from the salvage table of the plant. Carcasses were also processed to evaluate the effect of breast blister trimming that removed a superficial amount of muscle tissue, half of which had breast blister trims, and half did not...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to characterize bruises in bovine carcasses in Uruguay and to evaluate the economic impact. Thirteen abattoirs were visited during 2 years and bruises were identified, classified, and quantified by zone and degree (depth and size). One hundred carcasses were separated and bruises were cut out and weighed separately. From a total of 15 157 carcasses observed, 60. 0 % {{had at least one}} bruise; 42. 0 % of these had bruises on both sides. The expensive butt zone was the most damaged, followed by rib, shoulder and loin, respectively. The mean weight and standard error of the condemned <b>trimmed</b> <b>meat</b> was 1602 212 g. It suppose a loss of 899 g per animal slaugtered in Uruguay. In a country sending 2. 5 million heads of cattle to be slaughter yearly, this indicates an important financial loss. Improving transport conditions and personnel skills will probably result in a better welfare for the animals as well as better financial profit...|$|R

40|$|Automated {{mechanical}} systems are being utilized by the pork industry to efficiently and economically recover meat remaining on bones after fabrication. The recovered <b>meat,</b> referred <b>to</b> as pork trim-finely textured (PTFT), has unique properties {{which must be}} understood to best use this lean meat source. This research characterized the chemical and physical properties of PTFT, determined incorporation levels in ground pork and studied the storage and shelf-life-stability of products containing PTFT. Chemical and physical properties of PTFT were compared <b>to</b> knife <b>trimmed</b> <b>meat</b> (KT) and 80 percent lean ground pork (GP). PTFT had higher iron, calcium, total pigment and cholesterol than GP or KT. Moisture and fat content of PTFT {{did not differ from}} GP. When PTFT (0, 5, 10 and 15 percent) was incorporated into ground pork patties (10 percent and 20 percent fat), redness and sensory juiciness increased and hardness and cohesiveness decreased at all levels of incorporation. Storage stability of patties containing up to 15 percent PTFT displayed for four days under retail conditions were not affected by PTFT as measured by lipid oxidation, microbial counts and pH. PTFT obtained by mechanical recovery appears to be an exceptional substitute for pork trim in ground pork formulations. PTFT does not negatively influence, and may enhance, the attributes of ground pork when added below 15 percent. Utilization of PTFT contributes to the profitability of the pork industry which is already recognizing the benefits of mechanical recovery due to a reduction in repetitive motion syndrome, which is typically associated with knife trimming...|$|R

40|$|In the {{laboratory}} situation {{the preferences of}} dogs and cats for food seem to be relatively uniform. Cats prefer fish and commercial cat food to rats. Dogs prefer beef, pork and lamb to chicken, liver and horsemeat and strongly prefer <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> cereal diets. They prefer canned <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> fresh <b>meat,</b> ground <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> cubed <b>meat</b> and cooked <b>meat</b> <b>to</b> raw <b>meat.</b> Canned or semimoist preparations are preferred to dry ones. Pet dogs have much more variable preferences according to their owner's subjective evaluation. A variety of factors seem to be related in an as yet unknown way to some flavor preferences of pet dogs, i. e. the dog's sex/reproductive status, weight and relationship to owners {{and the content of}} the dog's meals. The complicated interaction between (a) a pet's taste, texture and olfactory sensation, (b) its owner's perception of the pet and its preferences and (c) its physical and social environment deserves further investigation...|$|R
