5|$|Although {{sufficient}} for the Southern Railway's needs, the Nclass was an ideal <b>test-bed</b> for experiments with new steam technology. The first experiment entailed fitting a Worthington feed pump to No.A819 in 1924. The trial was moderately successful, and the pump remained in use until removal in 1927. In June 1930, No.A816 was withdrawn from service {{for the application of}} experimental Anderson steam conservation equipment at Eastleigh Works. This was designed by a Scottish marine draughtsman, Mr. A.P.H. Anderson, who proposed the use of a fan system to condense spent steam and improve draughting of the fire on long-distance runs in regions with poor access to water.|$|E

Work on the machine began in 1947, and on 21 June 1948 the computer successfully ran its first program, consisting of 17 instructions written to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218 − 1 downwards. The program ran for 52minutes before producing the correct answer of 131,072.|$|E
5|$|The {{upcoming}} {{generation of}} extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will require sophisticated adaptive optics {{in order to}} be used to their full capability. Because the WHT has an advanced adaptive optics system already operating, it is receiving attention from the various ELT programs. The European Southern Observatory's European-ELT (E-ELT) project has begun a programme to utilise the WHT as a <b>test-bed</b> for its adaptive optics system, and will receive several nights per year for on-sky testing. The project involves construction of new optical experiments at one of the Nasmyth foci, and is called CANARY. CANARY will demonstrate the multi-object adaptive optics (MOAO) required for the EAGLE instrument on the E-ELT.|$|E

40|$|In seismically active, densely {{populated}} areas, buildings within a city block interact {{with one another}} during an earthquake. This phenomenon, whereby two adjacent buildings interact with each other through the surrounding soil during an earthquake, is often called structure-soil-structure interaction (SSSI). SSSI effects are less understood than soil-foundation-structure interaction (SFSI) effects. There are a lack of high-quality case histories that clearly show SSSI, which is a key reason that SSSI is less understood than SFSI. SSSI effects can potentially be detrimental and lead to more damage within the soil-foundation-structure system. Accordingly, {{it is important to understand}} when SSSI effects are important, and include them in engineering analysis and design when necessary. This dissertation describes three centrifuge tests designed to simulate SSSI and SFSI case histories. All centrifuge test described within this dissertation were performed at the University of California at Davis Center for Geotechnical Modeling (UCD-CGM). The first test, Centrifuge <b>Test-</b> 1, examined two inelastic moment-resisting frame structures atop a bed of dry, dense sand. One frame structure represented a prototypical three-story moment-resisting frame structure founded on spread footings. The other frame structure represented a prototypical nine-story moment-resisting frame structure founded on a three-story basement. The two structures were located a significant distance apart, and thus, SSSI effects were masked. Accordingly, the purpose of <b>Test-</b> 1 was to examine SFSI effects of inelastic frame structures and to serve as a baseline test (i. e., a control test). The second test, Centrifuge <b>Test-</b> 2, examined the same two structures atop a bed of dry, dense sand. In <b>Test-</b> 2, however, the two structures were located adjacent to each other. Therefore, the purpose of <b>Test-</b> 2 was to examine SSSI effects. By comparing results from <b>Test-</b> 1 with results from <b>Test-</b> 2, insights into SSSI effects were made. The third test, Centrifuge <b>Test-</b> 3, examined three structures atop a bed of dry, dense sand. Two of the structures were identical, and represented prototypical three-store moment-resisting frame structures founded on spread footings. These structures were nearly identical to the three-story structures used during <b>Test-</b> 1 and <b>Test-</b> 2. The third structure was a rigid rocking wall founded on a large mat foundation, which was identified as the transmitter structure. One frame structure, which was identified as the receiver structure, was located adjacent to the transmitter structure. The other frame structure, which was identified as the control structure, was located a significant distance away from the transmitter-receiver pair of structures. The design goal of the transmitter-receiver pair was to maximize interaction between the two structures. By comparing the seismic response of the control structure with the seismic response of the receiver structure, insights into SSSI were made. The earthquake motions employed during the three centrifuge tests described within this dissertation are critically important. A preliminary centrifuge test (<b>Test-</b> 0) was performed after an earthquake motion selection process. The purpose of <b>Test-</b> 0 was to calibrate a suite of earthquake motions that could be used at the UCD-CGM. This dissertation describes an earthquake motion selection and calibration process that future researchers can use to create test-specific earthquake motions for their research projects. Kinematic SFSI and SSSI effects were examined during <b>Test-</b> 1 and <b>Test-</b> 2. Specifically, the earthquake motions recorded in the free-field at the surface, which is the earthquake motion most often used by practicing engineers for dynamic analyses, was compared to the earthquake motion recorded under the basement, in the soil. Because of kinematic interaction effects, which include base slab averaging and embedment effects, the earthquake motion recorded under the basement has smaller amplitude and smaller high-frequency content than the earthquake motion recorded in the free-field at the surface. This is an established observation, and <b>Test-</b> 1 and <b>Test-</b> 2 data corroborate with current kinematic interaction estimation procedures. When comparing the results from <b>Test-</b> 2 with <b>Test-</b> 1, however, it was seen that basement-level earthquake motion differed less from the free-field surface motion during <b>Test-</b> 2. This result indicates that kinematic interaction effects may be masked in urban environments. The seismic responses of the shallowly embedded frame structure footings were also examined during <b>Test-</b> 1, <b>Test-</b> 2, and <b>Test-</b> 3. More specifically, the vertical displacement (settlement and uplift), horizontal displacement (sliding), and rocking were examined. By comparing results from <b>Test-</b> 2 with results from <b>Test-</b> 1, it was seen that the deeply embedded basement "restrains" the adjacent footings. In other words, the adjacent footings displace and rotate less than the footings that are not adjacent to the basement (i. e., the free footings). This asymmetrical footing response leads to additional demands on the superstructure, which may be unacceptable. In addition, the seismically-induced column moments measured above the restrained footings are larger than those measured above the free footings. Therefore, SSSI effects were seen to be potentially detrimental (i. e., lead to more superstructure damage) during <b>Test-</b> 2. During <b>Test-</b> 3, the same footing restraining effect observed in <b>Test-</b> 2 was found to be not as large. However, there is evidence that the transmitter structure affected the seismic response of the adjacent receiver structure. More specifically, as the transmitter structure rocked and settled during the higher-intensity earthquake motions, the adjacent footings of the receiver structure did uplift, and this caused asymmetry in the superstructure. A general observation from <b>Test-</b> 3 is that the seismic footing response of frame structures founded on shallowly-embedded footings is erratic. Future work in this area will examine possible explanations for the observed erratic response...|$|R

5|$|The Southern Railway {{operating}} department undertook trials to improve fleet efficiency. When built, Eastbourne-based No. A629 was fitted with an experimental pulverised fuel burner of German design; {{the experiment was}} terminated when a minor explosion {{was caused by the}} powdered coal coming into contact with sparks thrown from the blastpipe. The experiment also proved that pulverised coal was a false economy, as much of the fine dust was sucked through the chimney without combustion taking place. The locomotive was returned to normal coal burning in 1935. In 1947 the class became a <b>test-bed</b> for a government-backed scheme regarding fuelling arrangements in anticipation of a coal shortage. Two of the class, Nos. 1625 and 1797, were converted to oil burning, with more set to follow suit; but the project was abandoned and the two oil burners were reverted to coal-firing before this could take place.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} on Criterion's proprietary game engine RenderWare. The graphics engine was improved to give between 50–100% faster rendering than in Burnout 2. The increased performance {{allowed them to}} add features like real-time radiosity lighting and better environment mapping effects on vehicles. Programmers at the studio were adamant about making the game run at a frame rate of sixty frames per seconds to offer instant response and feedback while driving fast. Since the crash sequences were slower, the higher frame rate was less considered less critical than the spectacle of the vehicle collisions. They opted to run the game at thirty frames per second during these instances and dramatically {{increased the number of}} particles and debris that were rendered. From an early stage in development, the team wanted to include support for online network play in Burnout 3. They had never explored online play before, so they used Burnout 2 as a <b>test-bed</b> for the feature before integrating it into Burnout 3.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, {{the station}} {{became one of}} the UK's least {{efficient}} power stations. In 1998, plans were announced to use the station as a <b>test-bed</b> for clean coal technology, but the plans did not come to fruition. In 1999, then owners Innogy plc decided to take Blyth A out of operation, while Blyth B began operating only at times of peak demand, because the stations had become surplus to their generating needs. From 1 April 2000 onwards the station was taken out of service for the summer months, because of the low demand for electricity at that time of year. However, staff were retained to maintain the station. Innogy plc then began looking for a buyer for the station, to decide the site's future. They had been in talks with American based NRG Energy, over a £410million purchase of the station, along with the Killingholme Power Station in North Lincolnshire. There had also been rumours that a deal had been made to convert the station into a waste-to-energy plant. However, any plans to save the station fell through and the generation of electricity at the station ceased on 31 January 2001, after 43years of operating, resulting in the loss of 131jobs.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{determine}} the bioequivalence of three different preparations of florfenicol using non-drugged broiler chickens. A total of 28 broiler chickens aging 30 -day were divided into four equal groups; these were Group I, II, III, and IV. The birds of Group I (for effective substance) were given intravenous (i. v.) administration of florfenicol dosed at 40 mg/kg body weight (b. wt.). The birds of Group II (for reference drug), Group III (for <b>test-</b> 1 drug), and Group IV (for <b>test-</b> 2 drug) received florfenicol preparations with water (dosed at 40 mg/kg b. wt.) through intracrop administration. Blood samples were collected periodically from the birds of all four groups, and blood plasma was separated. Levels of florfenicol and its metabolite (florfenicol amine) in the plasma were measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). In this study, the limit of detection (LOD) for florfenicol and florfenicol amine were recorded as 0. 017 and 0. 78 µg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, the recovery of florfenicol and florfenicol amine were 83. 4 - 84. 6 and 82. 2 - 83. 8 %, respectively.

Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate the <b>test-</b> retest reliability of the HS-SOT in a non-concussed, athletic sample. Design: A prospective, time series, cohort design was used. Setting: University research laboratory. Participants or Other Participants: Twenty (8 F, 12 M) healthy intercollegiate athletes (age 19. 95 ± 1. 28 years, height 175. 55 ± 13. 57 cm, weight 74. 73 ± 17. 59 kg). Interventions: Postural stability was assessed at two time intervals (9 days apart). Subjects completed all 6 testing conditions of the SOT and the 2 testing conditions for the HS- SOT. Results: Excellent <b>test-</b> retest reliability was demonstrated for the SOT composite equilibrium scores (ICC 1, 1 =. 83). Moderate <b>test-</b> retest reliability was observed for the SOT equilibrium scores for conditions 2 (. 66) and 5 (. 65); somatic (. 58), visual (. 65), and vestibular sensory analyses (. 68); and sensory analysis preference (. 66).
