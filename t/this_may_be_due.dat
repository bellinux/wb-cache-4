5|$|In rare individuals, {{paracetamol}} toxicity {{can result}} from normal use. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to individual ("idiosyncratic") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes {{in one of the}} metabolic pathways that handle paracetamol (see paracetamol's metabolism).|$|E

5|$|Among ectoparasites, bats carry fleas and mites, {{as well as}} {{specific}} parasites such as bat bugs and bat flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae). However, {{they are one of}} the few non-aquatic mammalian orders that do not host lice. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to competition from more effective, specialized parasites which occupy the same niche.|$|E

Círdan {{appeared to be}} aged himself, since he is described as looking old, save for the stars in his eyes; <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to all the sorrows he had seen and lived through since the First Age. Also, the people of Gwindor of Nargothrond had trouble recognizing him after his time as a prisoner of Morgoth.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is an {{oxidizing}} agent. Depending on the reaction, <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to the Pb2+(aq) ion, {{which has}} a standard reduction potential (E0) of −0.125V, or the nitrate ion, which under acidic conditions has an E0 of +0.956V. The nitrate would function at high temperatures or in an acidic condition, while the lead(II) works best in a neutral aqueous solution.|$|E
5|$|Only one runestone {{mentioning}} the Byzantine Empire {{has been found}} on Gotland. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> both {{to the fact that}} few rune stones were raised on Gotland in favour of image stones, {{as well as to the}} fact that the Gotlanders dealt mainly in trade, paying a yearly tribute to the Swedes for military protection.|$|E

5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> {{to the fact that the}} medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} (C. melanopterus) and the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus), the grey reef shark {{is one of the}} three most common sharks inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs. They {{actively}} expel most other shark species from favored habitats, even species larger in size. In areas where this species co-exists with the blacktip reef shark, the latter species occupies the shallow flats, while the former stays in deeper water. Areas with a high abundance of grey reef sharks tend to contain few sandbar sharks (C. plumbeus), and vice versa; <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to their similar diets causing competitive exclusion.|$|E
5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
30|$|Occasionally, pseudohypertrophy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>due</b> to partial {{averaging}} {{of normal}} structures. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>due</b> to a prominent moderator band, which may give a false impression of septal hypertrophy (Movies 1 and 2).|$|R

5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due {{to the number of}} freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{emission}} {{also reveals}} {{the presence of}} un-ionised material such as molecular hydrogen (H2) and argon. In many planetary nebulae, molecular emission is greatest at larger distances from the star, where more material is un-ionised, but molecular hydrogen emission in NGC 6543 seems to be bright at the inner edge of its outer halo. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to shock waves exciting the H2 as ejecta moving at different speeds collide. The overall appearance of the Cat's Eye Nebula in infrared (wavelengths 2–8μm) is similar in visible light.|$|E
5|$|Lundomys molitor {{has been}} found as a living animal only in Uruguay and nearby Rio Grande do Sul; records of live {{specimens}} from eastern Argentina and Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, have not been confirmed. It is rarely encountered, and has been collected in only one location in Rio Grande do Sul, but <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to insufficient efforts to locate it, rather than genuine rarity. Its distribution is generally limited to areas with mean winter temperatures over , mean annual temperatures over , annual rainfall over , and a long rainy season averaging over 200 days. It is usually found in swamps or near streams.|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} use of supplemental vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D or vitamin E does not {{reduce the risk}} of lung cancer. Some studies suggest that people who eat diets with a higher proportion of vegetables and fruit tend to have a lower risk, but <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to confounding—with the lower risk actually due to the association of a high fruit/vegetables diet with less smoking. Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk, although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show benefit from a healthy diet.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Homunculus {{is the ability to}} measure the {{spectrum}} of the central object at different latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes. These clearly show a polar wind where the stellar wind is faster and stronger at high latitudes thought to be due to rapid rotation causing gravity brightening towards the poles. In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane. By implication the outer envelope of Eta Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the gravity darkening. The current axis of rotation of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to interaction with Eta Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds.|$|E
5|$|Habitats {{change over}} time. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to a violent event {{such as the}} {{eruption}} of a volcano, an earthquake, a tsunami, a wildfire or a change in oceanic currents; or the change may be more gradual over millennia with alterations in the climate, as ice sheets and glaciers advance and retreat, and as different weather patterns bring changes of precipitation and solar radiation. Other changes come {{as a direct result}} of human activities; deforestation, the ploughing of ancient grasslands, the diversion and damming of rivers, the draining of marshland and the dredging of the seabed. The introduction of alien species can have a devastating effect on native wildlife, through increased predation, through competition for resources or through the introduction of pests and diseases to which the native species have no immunity.|$|E

5|$|Hume {{notes that}} the skull of the Rodrigues {{starling}} {{was about the same}} size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The maxilla of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible. Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was sexually dimorphic. Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study {{by researchers at}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. The findings from this study suggest that, in comparison to the typical American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the risk of death from Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male. The study also compared mortality risks from speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to the increased momentum of collisions from speed players.|$|E
5|$|Nestling {{birds are}} common prey, being taken more often from nests in trees {{rather than on}} the ground. Grey jays find them by moving from perch to perch and {{scanning}} surroundings. Avian nest predation by grey jays is not necessarily higher in fragmented versus unfragmented forest. Evidence from studies in the Pacific Northwest suggest a moderate increase in nest predation in logged plots adjacent to mature conifer forest, which is the grey jay's preferred habitat. Studies of nest predation by grey jays in Quebec have shown that the birds prefer preying on nests in open forest with high prominence of jack pine, and greater rates of predation in riparian forest strips and green-tree retention stands versus clearcuts. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to increased availability of perch sites for avian predators such as the grey jay. Grey jays are suspected but not proven to prey on nests of the threatened marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) in coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
50|$|Type B adipsia {{occurs when}} {{vasopressin}} responses are at decreased {{levels in the}} presence of osmotic stimuli. Although minimal, there is still some secretion of AVP. <b>This</b> type <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> to some elimination of osmoreceptors.|$|R
