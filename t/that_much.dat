5|$|A third species, L. consors, was {{established}} by Marsh in 1894 for YPM 1882, which consists of most of one articulated skeleton and part {{of at least one}} other individual. The skull was only partially preserved, {{and the fact that the}} vertebrae were represented only by centra suggests a partially grown individual. Galton (1983) notes <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of the current mounted skeleton was restored in plaster, or had paint applied.|$|E
5|$|Bacliff, like San Leon, and Bayview, {{originated}} as {{a fishing}} community. In 2012 T.J. Aulds of the Galveston County Daily News stated <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of the area's economic influence {{moved to the}} corridor along Texas State Highway 146, and that the economy adjusted {{with the growth of}} retail food service outlets and bars. Like San Leon and Bayview, many residents in Bacliff commute to work in Houston.|$|E
5|$|Because Faulks felt <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of {{the extant}} World War I {{literature}} was deeply influenced by World War II literature, he deliberately avoided research with secondary documents, such as historical monographs, instead focusing on veteran interviews and period primary sources.|$|E

5|$|Built between 1077 and 1521, St Albans Cathedral {{is unique}} among the cathedrals in <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of it, {{including}} the large Norman tower, is built of bricks salvaged from the Roman town of Verulamium. Both internally and externally, the tower {{is the most}} significant feature. St Albans also retains some medieval wall paintings, as well as a painted wooden roof of the late 13th century.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 20th century, {{scholars}} doing {{research into the}} Haymarket affair were surprised to learn <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of the primary source documentation relating to the incident (beside materials concerning the trial) was not in Chicago, but had been transferred to then-communist East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in areas}} where {{mortality}} was low, so many were incapacitated <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that the health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places.|$|E

5|$|Fairley was {{acutely aware}} <b>that</b> <b>much</b> {{remained}} unknown about malaria. In particular, {{he was interested}} in the possibility that sulphaguanidine (or a related sulphonamide) might be a causal prophylactic against malaria, as they could be manufactured in Australia, unlike atebrin and plasmoquine. Fairley decided to establish a unit in Cairns to investigate malaria. The LHQ Medical Research Unit commenced work in June 1943.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden's father {{wrote him}} to solicit the troupe {{to come to}} Odessa in Ukraine, which was then part of Imperial Russia. The timing was opportune: {{the end of the}} war meant <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of his best {{audience}} were now in Odessa rather than Bucharest; Rosenberg had already quit Goldfaden's troupe and was performing the Goldfadenian repertoire in Odessa.|$|E
5|$|In Hamden, Connecticut, the National Guard {{was called}} in to aid in cleanup and keep order, as some looting was {{reported}} in the devastated area. President George H. W. Bush declared the area a disaster area on July 18. The damage was so intense <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of the area was without power for a week, and trees were still being cleared a year later.|$|E

60|$|She felt curiously embarrassed. At {{this last}} moment hostility had weakened, {{and she was}} {{conscious}} {{of a desire to}} make amends.

5|$|It {{is likely}} <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of Morris's {{preference}} for medieval textiles was formed– or crystallised– during his brief apprenticeship with G. E. Street. Street had co-written {{a book on}} Ecclesiastical Embroidery in 1848, and was a staunch advocate of abandoning faddish woolen work on canvas in favour of more expressive embroidery techniques based on Opus Anglicanum, a surface embroidery technique popular in medieval England.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Riley-Smith {{considers}} <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of {{the popular}} understanding of the Crusades derives from the novels of Walter Scott and the French histories by Joseph François Michaud. The Crusades provided {{an enormous amount of}} source material, stories of heroism, and interest that underpinned growth in medieval literature, romance, and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|NESCo {{also argued}} that they had chosen the site to protect the city's amenities, {{in that it was}} outside the city boundary, {{partially}} surrounded by higher ground, and in the lee of prevailing winds.

5|$|On 10 May 1947, {{immediately}} after a Great Britain versus Rest of Europe match in Glasgow (Britain won 6–1), {{he made the}} move for £11,500, {{at the age of}} 32. The match itself raised £30,000 for the four Home Nations Football Associations, and since the eleven British players received £14 each, Matthews questioned where exactly this money ended up – he doubted <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of it ended up as funding for grass-roots football.|$|E
5|$|Orientalism {{proposed}} <b>that</b> <b>much</b> Western {{study of}} Islamic civilization was political intellectualism, {{meant for the}} self-affirmation of European identity, rather than objective academic study; thus, the academic field of Oriental studies functioned as a practical method of cultural discrimination and imperialist domination—that is to say, the Western Orientalist knows more about the Orient than do the Orientals.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{operation}} by the chosen units meant <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of the preparation was not completed. Adolf Hitler ordered the reinforcement of Scandinavia in March and April 1942, before Hardboiled was shelved in May. It is unclear to what extent {{the operation}} contributed to his decision. Despite its limited impact, the operation gave the LCS experience in planning deceptions, and laid the groundwork for future exploitation of Hitler's belief that Northern Europe was strategically important.|$|E

5|$|Si-vacancies {{constitute}} minor {{fraction of}} total silicon.

5|$|The castle {{earthworks}} {{were built}} up from local chalk; the ditches dug around the fortification {{would not have}} provided enough for the mound itself, and local tradition suggests <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of the earth was quarried instead from the nearby Gallows Pits in the town. The castle was constructed by hand, using workers digging with wooden shovels, and probably without pickaxes. It is estimated that the motte would have taken around 24,000 man days of effort to build.|$|E
5|$|The three vinyl LPs and booklet were housed {{inside a}} deep orange-coloured box. The 1991 CD release placed the cover photo {{on a white}} background, however, replicating {{the front of the}} {{original}} album booklet. As commentators noted in 1991, the necessary downsizing to CD dimensions meant <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of the effectiveness of the booklet photography was lost, not least because the contents had also been trimmed down to just 36 pages.|$|E
