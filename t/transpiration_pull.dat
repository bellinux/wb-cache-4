50|$|Living root cells passively absorb {{water in}} the absence of <b>transpiration</b> <b>pull</b> via osmosis {{creating}} root pressure. It is possible for there to be no evapotranspiration and therefore no pull of water towards the shoots and leaves. This is usually due to high temperatures, high humidity, darkness or drought.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{tension and}} {{capillary}} action {{are important in}} biology. For example, when water is carried through xylem up stems in plants, the strong intermolecular attractions (cohesion) hold the water column together and adhesive properties maintain the water attachment to the xylem and prevent tension rupture caused by <b>transpiration</b> <b>pull.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This {{mechanism}} {{is carried out}} without utilisation of metabolic energy. Here, only the roots act as an organ of absorption or passage. Hence, sometimes it is called water absorption 'through roots', rather 'by' roots. It occurs in rapidly transpiring plants during daytime, because of opening of stomata and the atmospheric conditions. The force for absorption of water is created at the leaf end i.e. the <b>transpiration</b> <b>pull.</b> The main cause behind this <b>transpiration</b> <b>pull,</b> water is lifted up in the plant axis like {{a bucket of water}} is lifted by a person from a well. <b>Transpiration</b> <b>pull</b> is responsible for dragging water at the leaf end, the pull or force is transmitted down to the root through water column in the xylem elements. The continuity of water column remains intact due to the cohesion between the molecules and it act as a rope. Roots simply act as a passive organ of absorption. As transpiration proceeds, simultaneously water absorption also takes place to compensate the water loss from leaf end. Most volume of water entering plants is by means of passive absorption. Passive transport is nothing different from diffusion but just explaining its meaning [...] "passive" [...] refers to requiring no input of energy. There is a free movement of molecules from their higher concentration to their lower concentration. The water will enter the plant via the root cells that {{can be found in the}} roots where mainly passive absorption occurs. Also, with the absorption of water, minerals and nutrients are also absorbed.|$|E
5000|$|The rate {{at which}} a soil can absorb water depends on the soil and its other conditions. As a plant grows, its roots remove water from the largest pores first. Soon the larger pores hold only air, and the {{remaining}} water is found only in the intermediate- and smallest-sized pores. The water in the smallest pores is so strongly held to particle surfaces that plant roots cannot pull it away. Consequently, not all soil water is available to plants. When saturated, the soil may lose nutrients as the water drains. Water moves in a draining field {{under the influence of}} pressure where the soil is locally saturated and by capillarity pull to dryer parts of the soil. Most plant water needs are supplied from the suction caused by evaporation from plant leaves and 10% is supplied by [...] "suction" [...] created by osmotic pressure differences between the plant interior and the soil water. Plant roots must seek out water. Insufficient water will damage the yield of a crop. Most of the available water is used in <b>transpiration</b> to <b>pull</b> nutrients into the plant.|$|R
50|$|Water is {{constantly}} lost through transpiration from the leaf. When one water molecule is lost another is pulled {{along by the}} processes of cohesion and tension. <b>Transpiration</b> <b>pull,</b> utilizing capillary action and the inherent surface tension of water, is the primary mechanism of water movement in plants. However, {{it is not the}} only mechanism involved. Any use of water in leaves forces water to move into them.|$|E
5000|$|The phloem {{sugar is}} removed by the cortex of both stem and root, and is {{consumed}} by cellular respiration or else converted into starch. Starch is insoluble and exerts no osmotic effect. Consequently, the osmotic {{pressure of the}} contents of phloem decreases. Finally relatively pure water is left in the phloem and this is thought to leave by osmosis or be drawn back into nearby xylem vessels by suction of the <b>transpiration</b> <b>pull.</b>|$|E
50|$|The most {{abundant}} compound in all plants, {{as in all}} cellular organisms, is water which serves an important structural role and {{a vital role in}} plant metabolism. Transpiration is the main process of water movement within plant tissues. Water is constantly transpired from the plant through its stomata to the atmosphere and replaced by soil water taken up by the roots. The movement of water out of the leaf stomata creates a <b>transpiration</b> <b>pull</b> or tension in the water column in the xylem vessels or tracheids. The pull is the result of water surface tension within the cell walls of the mesophyll cells, from the surfaces of which evaporation takes place when the stomata are open. Hydrogen bonds exist between water molecules, causing them to line up; as the molecules {{at the top of the}} plant evaporate, each pulls the next one up to replace it, which in turn pulls on the next one in line. The draw of water upwards may be entirely passive and can be assisted by the movement of water into the roots via osmosis. Consequently, transpiration requires very little energy to be used by the plant. Transpiration assists the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil as soluble salts.|$|E
30|$|Micronutrients {{have also}} been {{supplementary}} used {{for the maintenance of}} growth process of all nature of crop. Its availability from any medium has been involved for the many physiological mechanisms like photosynthesis, fertilization, xylem solute transportation, cell divisions, stomata functionalities, fruit setting, enzyme activation, carbohydrate mobility, <b>transpiration</b> <b>pull,</b> cell turgidity and immunity against disease infections (Marschner 2012). Our data in this consequence, especially, for the availability of boron and sulphate contents depicted their status (TablesÂ  9 and 10) from the mineralized produce through active participation of earth worms.|$|E
