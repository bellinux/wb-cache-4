5|$|In December 1954, 162 Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested, 95 were court martialed, and 91 {{were found}} guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1 to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass court martial of the Korean War. The Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens moved quickly to remit the {{sentences}} and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved.

5|$|A new tyrannosaurid {{specimen}} (OMNH 10131), including skull fragments, {{ribs and}} parts of the hindlimb, was reported from New Mexico in 1990 and assigned to the now-defunct genus Aublysodon. Many later authors have reassigned this specimen, along with a few others from New Mexico, to yet another unnamed species of Daspletosaurus. However, research published in 2010 showed that this species, from the Hunter Wash Member of the Kirtland Formation, is actually a more primitive tyrannosauroid, and was classified in the genus Bistahieversor. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> disagreement over the age of the Kirtland Formation, with some workers claiming a late Campanian age, while others suggest a younger age in the early Maastrichtian stage.|$|E

5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E
5|$|Last Order: Final Fantasy VII is an {{original}} video animation directed by Morio Asaka, written by Kazuhiko Inukai, and animated by Madhouse. It depicts an alternate rendition of two flashbacks found within Final Fantasy VII. It was originally released in Japan on the Advent Pieces DVD, on September 14, 2005. It {{was released in}} North America in the Limited Edition Collector's Set on February 20, 2007.

5|$|Once {{construction}} on Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway, which runs from 105th Street to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue, is completed, {{it is expected}} that construction will then take place on Phase 3. Phase 3 would extend the Second Avenue Subway south from the provisions for the line to continue further south on Second Avenue. The tracks would diverge from the tracks that continue to the BMT 63rd Street Line running south on Second Avenue. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> a large provisional cavern, or bellmouth, for this line. The line would continue down Second Avenue to Houston Street, where the third phase would end. However, no funding has been committed to this phase. After Phase 3, a new T service will operate from 125th Street to Houston Street.|$|E

5|$|The {{civil parish}} of Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge has {{responsibility}} for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) {{to cover the}} council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. In recent years the parish council has become a significant grant funder of local organisations and events. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> a debate underway about the correct disbursement and monitoring of these grants, following allegations of impropriety regarding some councillors.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is called}} Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake, {{named after the}} United States President {{who presided over the}} authorization and completion of the dam. Creation of the reservoir forced the relocation of over 3,000 people, including Native Americans whose ancestral lands were partially flooded. While the dam does not contain fish-ladders, neither does the next down-stream dam, Chief Joseph Dam. This means that no salmon ever reach the Grand Coulee Dam, rendering the possibility of added fish-ladders superfluous. Despite this, the second large dam down-stream, Rocky Reach Dam, does contains an intricate system of fish ladders to accommodate yearly salmon spawning. Being itself 473 miles upstream of the mouth of the Columbia River, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> no issue with salmon spawning that Grand Coulee or Chief Joseph dams are at fault for.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} soil where the Valley of the Kings is located are an {{alternating}} sandwich of dense limestone and other sedimentary rock (which form the cliffs {{in the valley}} and the nearby Deir el-Bahri) and soft layers of marl. The sedimentary rock was originally deposited between 35–56 million years ago {{during a time when}} the precursor to the Mediterranean Sea covered an area that extended much further inland than it does today. During the Pleistocene the valley was carved out of the plateau by steady rains. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> little year-round rain in this part of Egypt, but there are occasional flash floods that hit the valley, dumping tons of debris into the open tombs.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no state}} roads and {{virtually}} no township {{roads in the}} watershed of Hammersley Fork. However, there are dirt roads and gravel roads, and several stream crossings in the watershed. The first settlers arrived in the watershed in 1827 and the first roads in the area were constructed several years later. Industrial activities such as logging were common in the watershed in the early 20th century, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> virtually no such activity there. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream throughout its entire length. Most of the creek has a substantial riparian buffer.|$|E
5|$|While the {{district}} includes {{all of the}} cities and communities in its jurisdiction, some of these cities do not have stations on the BART system. This has caused tensions among property owners in cities like Livermore who pay BART taxes but must travel outside the city to receive BART service. In areas like Fremont, the majority of commuters do not commute in the direction that BART would take them (many Fremonters commute to San Jose, where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> no BART service). This would be alleviated with {{the completion of a}} BART-to-San Jose extension project and the opening of the Berryessa Station in San Jose.|$|E
5|$|While <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> no {{passenger}} train operation in Teaneck, train service is available across the Hackensack River at the New Bridge Landing station in River Edge {{and at the}} Anderson Street station in Hackensack.

5|$|After {{reviewing}} the drawings made by Yuu Kamiya's wife, Mashiro Hiiragi, in second light novel volume, his editor suggested the two collaborate on a manga adaptation of No Game No Life for Monthly Comic Alive. Due to Kamiya's {{work on the}} third light novel volume, the manga serialization was delayed by a volume; the volume {{it was supposed to}} premiere in contained an apology page illustrated by Hiiragi. The series premiered in the March 2013 volume of Monthly Comic Alive and since then, is published irregularly in the magazine. Media Factory collected the individual chapters for the tankōbon release; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> a single volume which was released on November 22, 2013. In March 2014, Seven Seas Entertainment announced its licensing of the manga series and released the first tankōbon volume in October 2014; the title is stylized as No Game, No Life. The series has also been localized in Brazil, Taiwan and Russia.|$|E
5|$|Although Triceratops are {{commonly}} portrayed as herding animals, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> {{little evidence that}} they lived in herds. While several other genera of horned dinosaurs are known from bonebeds preserving bones from two to {{hundreds or thousands of}} individuals, to date there is only one documented bonebed dominated by Triceratops bones: a site in southeastern Montana with the remains of three juveniles. It may be significant that only juveniles were present. Another, more recent find may reveal that Triceratops lived in small family groups. In 2012, a group of three Triceratops in relatively complete condition, each of varying sizes from a full-grown adult to a small juvenile, were found in Wyoming, near Newcastle. The remains are currently under excavation by paleontologist Peter Larson and a team from the Black Hills Institute. It is believed that the animals were traveling as a family unit, but it remains unknown if the group consists of a mated pair and their offspring, or two females and a juvenile they were caring for. The remains also show signs of predation or scavenging from Tyrannosaurus, particularly on the largest specimen, with the bones of the front limbs showing breakage and puncture wounds from Tyrannosaurus teeth.|$|E
5|$|Europa is the smoothest known {{object in}} the Solar System, lacking {{large-scale}} features such as mountains and craters. However; according to one theory, Europa's equator may be covered in icy spikes called penitentes, which may be up to ten meters high, due to direct overhead sunlight on the equator, causing the ice to sublime forming vertical cracks. The prominent markings crisscrossing Europa appear to mainly be albedo features that emphasize low topography. There are few craters on Europa, because its surface is tectonically too active and therefore young. Europa's icy crust has an albedo (light reflectivity) of 0.64, {{one of the highest}} of all moons. This indicates a young and active surface, based on estimates of the frequency of cometary bombardment that Europa likely experiences, the surface is about 20 to 180 million years old. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> no full scientific consensus among the sometimes contradictory explanations for the surface features of Europa.|$|E
