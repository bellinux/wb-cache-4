25|$|The NCTSC {{focused on}} both {{changing}} school counselor {{education at the}} graduate level and changing school counselor practice in local districts to teach school counselors how to prevent, intervene with, and close achievement and opportunity gaps. In <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>groups,</b> they found what Hart & Jacobi had indicated—-too many school counselors were gatekeepers for the status quo instead of advocates for the academic success of every child and adolescent. Too many school counselors used inequitable practices, supported inequitable school policies, and were unwilling to change.|$|E
25|$|U.S. Fleet Forces Command (FFC) {{continues}} a multi-phase {{wear test}} of improved flame resistant variant (IFRV) working uniform components for shipboard wear. FFC most recently conducted in-depth focus groups with fleet sailors aimed at refining {{the design of}} the IFRV coverall. The IFRV coverall was approved for issue on 17 January 2017. Additional feedback from <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>groups,</b> subsequently validated by a senior level working group, resulted in the preliminary design of a more professional looking two-piece utility shipboard uniform that can be worn both at sea and operational support jobs ashore. Wear tests of the prototype two-piece variants are expected to occur in 2017.|$|E
2500|$|From late 2009 {{to early}} 2012, the {{prototype}} designs {{were shown to}} 30 focus groups in Calgary, Fredericton, Montreal, and Toronto on a [...] contract by The Strategic Counsel to discover [...] "potential controversies". Feedback from <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> led to some changes to the design, and {{results of the study}} were released to the public in 2012. The report stated that themes of diversity, inclusiveness, acceptance of others, and multiculturalism had strong support in <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>groups.</b> The highest-rated images included two of children of different ethnic backgrounds building a snowman and playing hockey, and of faces of individuals from different cultures celebrating Canada Day. <b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> rejected images such as aboriginal art, ice wine, and portraits of Terry Fox, Tommy Douglas, and Lester B.

40|$|Quantitative {{management}} {{research on}} the African continent is often hampered {{by the lack of}} large data sets and the unreliability of electronic as well as conventional communication. This paper advocates the use of qualitative methods, in particular <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> technique, to overcome these difficulties. <b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> technique has been extensively used in social sciences research and in this paper its use in management research is investigated and applied. The paper further advocates the use of triangulation to improve the reliability of qualitative management research. An example of the selection of renewable energy technology in Africa is used as basis for this investigation. In this case <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> technique was used to identify thirty-eight factors during the exploratory phase of a larger research effort. <b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> technique was used in conjunction with the nominal group technique.

40|$|This {{projects}} {{main objective}} is to examine how quality can be ensured in <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> method. Through an outline we will define <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> method in general and from the epistemological branch social constructivism. In order to ensure quality in a <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> there are several methodical choices to be made. For {{the sake of a}} full understanding of <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> method, we acquired knowledge from literature. Our understanding of the method is primarily based on “Fokusgrupper” by Bente Halkier. Furthermore we gathered knowledge from performing, as well as observing a <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> ourselves. Additionally an analysis of our transcription is included. At the end of the paper, we will present our understanding of how quality is established in <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> method. Our understanding is that the researcher must present the surveys procedure as transparent as possible. To ensure transparency it is crucial to account for every methodical choice throughout ones research. Subsequently {{it is up to the}} user/client to determine the quality of <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group.</b> As a result of this our own methodical choices are accounted for in the paper...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of expanding <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> interview into <b>the</b> field of English as a Second Language (ESL), where this research methodology {{is yet to be}} thoroughly explored. Specifically, it aims to challenge popular criticisms about {{the reliability and validity of}} <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> as a qualitative research methodology. It does this by first setting up a list of five main criticisms of <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> interview drawn from current literature on research methodology within the social sciences and education. Based on transcripts of interactional data gathered from <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> interviews carried out among ESL students in a formal ESL context, it then provides a direct and detailed response to each criticism. The arguments put forward demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> interview, as a method of data collection, may be particularly relevant in gathering the viewpoints and opinions of participants who have traditionally not been well represented through the more conventional and common methods currently employed in ESL research studies. Furthermore, the paper raises conscious awareness about the potential of <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> as a viable and verifiable tool in qualitative research methodology...|$|R
2500|$|The {{first season}} of Parks and Recreation started to receive {{criticism}} before the premiere episode aired. According to a March 18, 2009 report that was leaked to writer Nikki Finke, focus groups responded poorly to a rough-cut {{version of the}} pilot. Many focus group members felt the show was a [...] "carbon copy" [...] of The Office. Some found it predictable, slow-paced, and lacking in character development; others said the show lacked strong male characters, particularly a [...] "datable" [...] lead. Schur insisted the pilot had been completely re-edited {{at least four times}} since <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> described in the report were held. Nevertheless, the early feedback left many critics and industry observers skeptical about the show's chances of success.|$|E
2500|$|Focus group {{discussion}} in qualitative method has gain huge popularity {{of this method}} across the social sciences over the past decade. Focus groups are now thoroughly assessable and familiar to the general public. Prior 1920’s and late 1970’s <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> were mainly used in marketing, tool, and studies {{in the field in}} the business. Aspects like including education, communication, media studies, feminist research, sociology and social psychology. Focused groups are also known as ‘group interviews’. The members are encouraged to interact and have discussions. The data collected by focused {{group discussion}} are seldom produced through interview and observation; it enlightens us with its power of knowledge. Focus group discussion also focuses on the process beyond the individual’s memory and desires. The richness and complexity of group dynamics should be considered. Focus group can also access to social interactional dynamics that produce particular memories, ideologies, and practices among the group members. It themselves becomes relevant, termed as units of analysis of our study. Questions, issues and topics process focus group. Through different dynamics multiple angles of vision {{can be seen in the}} new world in unexpected ways. Focus group helps us move towards constructing a ‘methodology of getting lost” and toward enacting “double practices” (lather, 2001). This seems a necessary step towards conducting qualitative research. Keeping norms and rules of groups in mind the researcher and research participants realize that interpretation of individual are situated, provisional, contingent, unstable thus it’s unchangeable. It is necessary for the researcher to have self-reflectivity that involves making the research transparent rhetorical and poetic work of the researcher in representing the object of the study. It is theoretically important to construct a mutual ground between the researcher and the research participants. The second sense of self-reflexivity is important to encourage refection on interpretive research as the dual practice of knowledge gathering and self transformation is done through self-reflection and mutual reflection. Allowing ourselves to dwell in the existing inevitable indeterminacies, we are leading ourselves in the best way of the qualitative research practice.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> is a {{frequently}} used method {{in the social}} sciences. It is particularly useful when researchers seek to discover participants' meanings and ways of understanding. In this paper we relate the history of <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> as a research tool, from its original uses by Lazarsfeld and Merton in early communications research to its decline as social science research became more strongly quantitative and experimental. We also explore the recent revival of <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>group</b> in audience reception studies. Contemporary uses of <b>focus</b> <b>groups</b> conducted within <b>the</b> critical tradition are also discussed, leading to a reappraisal of the method and its appropriateness for media and communications research.
