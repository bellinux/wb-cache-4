5|$|Gomułka, in {{his public}} speeches, criticized {{the hardships of}} Stalinism and promised reforms to democratize the country; this was {{received}} with much enthusiasm by Polish society. By mid-November, Gomułka had secured substantive gains in his negotiations with the Soviets: the cancellation of Poland's existing debts, new preferential <b>trade</b> <b>terms,</b> abandonment of the unpopular Soviet-imposed collectivization of Polish agriculture, and permission to liberalize policy towards the Roman Catholic Church. In December, the status of Soviet forces in Poland, the Northern Group of Forces, was finally regulated.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Mugabe was {{appointed}} {{chair of the}} defence arm of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Without consulting parliament, in August 1998 he ordered Zimbabwean troops into the Congo to side with President Laurent Kabila in the Second Congo War. He initially committed 3000 troops to the operation, although this gradually rose to 11,000. He also persuaded Angola and Namibia to commit troops to the conflict. Involvement in the war cost Zimbabwe an approximate US $1 million a day, contributing to its economic problems. Opinion polls demonstrated that it was unpopular among Zimbabwe's population. However, several Zimbabwean businesses profited, having been given mining and timber concessions and preferential <b>trade</b> <b>terms</b> in minerals from Kabila's government.|$|E
5|$|With {{crude oil}} as the country's primary export, Gaddafi sought to improve Libya's oil sector. In October 1969, he proclaimed the current <b>trade</b> <b>terms</b> unfair, benefiting foreign {{corporations}} {{more than the}} Libyan state, and by threatening to reduce production, in December Jalloud successfully increased the price of Libyan oil. In 1970, other OPEC states followed suit, leading to a global increase {{in the price of}} crude oil. The RCC followed with the Tripoli Agreement, in which they secured income tax, back-payments and better pricing from the oil corporations; these measures brought Libya an estimated $1 billion in additional revenues in its first year.|$|E

25|$|In <b>trade</b> <b>terms,</b> the Australian {{economy has}} had {{persistently}} large current account deficits (CADs) {{for more than}} 50 years. One single factor that undermines balance of payments is Australia's narrow export base, making it highly sensitive to the volatility of global primary product prices. In addition, due to a colonial heritage {{a lot of companies}} operating in Australia are foreign-owned and as a result, Australia's net income outlay between it {{and the rest of the}} world is always negative; this results in persistent current account deficits even during times of positive net merchandise exports.|$|E
25|$|Imitation rubies {{are also}} marketed. Red spinels, red garnets, and colored glass have been falsely {{claimed to be}} rubies. Imitations go back to Roman times and already in the 17th century {{techniques}} were developed to color foil red—by burning scarlet wool in the bottom part of the furnace—which was then placed under the imitation stone. <b>Trade</b> <b>terms</b> such as balas ruby for red spinel and rubellite for red tourmaline can mislead unsuspecting buyers. Such terms are therefore discouraged from use by many gemological associations such as the Laboratory Manual Harmonisation Committee (LMHC).|$|E
25|$|The crusade went badly {{from the}} start – Theobald died in 1201 and the army that arrived at Venice {{in the summer of}} 1202 was one third the size that had been {{anticipated}} (4,500 knights, 9,000 squires, 20,000 men at-arms expected). Consequently, there was not enough money to pay the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the aging and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially at variance with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt.). At the time, Venetian envoys were discussing <b>trade</b> <b>terms</b> with the Egyptians – but {{in the end it was}} decided that such discussions would have allowed them to deceive the Egyptians.|$|E

40|$|<b>Trade</b> credit <b>terms</b> offer firms {{contractual}} {{solutions to}} informational asymmetries between buyers and sellers. The credit period permits buyers to reduce uncertainty concerning product quality prior to payment, while the seller can reduce uncertainty concerning buyer payment intentions by prescribing payment before/on delivery or through two 2010 part payment terms and other mechanisms. Variation in <b>trade</b> credit <b>terms</b> also offers firms price discriminating opportunities. This study, {{drawing on the}} responses of 700 large firms in the US, UK and Australia, explores <b>trade</b> credit <b>terms</b> through the twin objectives of reducing information asymmetries and discriminatory pricing. Support is found for both theories...|$|R

American historian Steven C. Topik said that PedroII's [...] "quest for a trade treaty with the United States was part of a grander strategy to increase national sovereignty and autonomy." [...] Unlike the circumstances of the previous pact, the Empire was in a strong position to insist on favorable <b>trade</b> <b>terms,</b> as negotiations occurred during a time of Brazilian domestic prosperity and international prestige.|$|E

Maria then decided to appoint an unpopular pro-western Byzantine also named Alexios Komnenos, a nephew of Manuel Komnenos, to be her chief advisor in the regency.

2500|$|African delegates {{arrived in}} Yokohama {{with a number}} of their own well-thought out agendas.

[...] Drawing up a common agenda detailing the trade and investment issues would seem a plausible strategy because the nations of the continent are grappling with similar challenge which include poor infrastructure and <b>trade</b> <b>terms</b> that are weighted heavily against Africa. [...] In a sense, Thabo Mbeki embraced this continental strategy as he suggested that Africa's future economic growth should happen through trade and not aid.

[...] He also observed that [...] "market access alone does not always translate in the ability for the developing countries to penetrate competitive world markets." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{three factors}} that held back the {{development}} of the industry simultaneously underwent subtle but historic changes in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1973, Britain entered the European Economic Community, which required the ending of historic <b>trade</b> <b>terms</b> for New Zealand meat and dairy products. This led ultimately to a dramatic restructuring of the agricultural economy. Before this restructuring was fully implemented, diversification away from traditional protein products to products with potentially higher economic returns was explored. Vines, which produce best in low moisture and low soil fertility environments, were seen as suitable for areas that had previously been marginal pasture. The end of the 1960s saw the end of the New Zealand institution of the [...] "six o'clock swill", where pubs were open for only an hour {{after the end of the}} working day and closed all Sunday. The same legislative reform saw the introduction of BYO (bring your own) licences for restaurants. This had a profound and unexpected effect on New Zealanders' cultural approach to wine.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} largely {{political}} criticisms of fair trade from {{the left and the}} right. Some believe the fair trade system is not radical enough. French author Christian Jacquiau, in his book Les coulisses du commerce équitable, calls for stricter fair trade standards and criticizes the fair trade movement for working within the current system (i.e., partnerships with mass retailers, multinational corporations, etc.) rather than establishing a new fairer, fully autonomous (i.e. government monopoly) trading system. Jacquiau also supports significantly higher fair trade prices in order to maximize the effect, as most producers only sell a portion of their crop under fair <b>trade</b> <b>terms.</b> It has been argued that the approach of the FairTrade system is too rooted in a Northern consumerist view of justice which Southern producers do not participate in setting. [...] "A key issue is therefore to make explicit who possesses the power to define the terms of Fairtrade, that is who possesses the power to determine the need of an ethic in the first instance, and subsequently command a particular ethical vision as the truth." ...|$|E
