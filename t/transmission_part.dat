50|$|In both types, a {{particular}} gear combination {{can only be}} engaged when the two parts to engage (either gears or clutches) are at the same speed. To shift to a higher gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the engine allowed to slow down until the <b>transmission</b> <b>parts</b> for the next gear are at a proper speed to engage. The vehicle also slows while in neutral and that slows other <b>transmission</b> <b>parts,</b> so the time in neutral depends on the grade, wind, and other such factors. To shift to a lower gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the throttle is used {{to speed up the}} engine and thus the relevant <b>transmission</b> <b>parts,</b> to match speeds for engaging the next lower gear. For both upshifts and downshifts, the clutch is released (engaged) while in neutral. Some drivers use the clutch only for starting from a stop, and shifts are done without the clutch. Other drivers will depress (disengage) the clutch, shift to neutral, then engage the clutch momentarily to force <b>transmission</b> <b>parts</b> to match the engine speed, then depress the clutch again to shift to the next gear, a process called double clutching. Double clutching is easier to get smooth, as speeds that are close but not quite matched need to speed up or slow down only <b>transmission</b> <b>parts,</b> whereas with the clutch engaged to the engine, mismatched speeds are fighting the rotational inertia and power of the engine.|$|R

The header is termed the overhead, and instead of being transmitted before the payload, is interleaved with it during <b>transmission.</b> <b>Part</b> of the overhead is transmitted, then part of the payload, then the next part of the overhead, then the next part of the payload, until the entire frame has been transmitted.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve more {{accurate}} and reliable identification of shearer cutting state, this paper employs the vibration of rocker <b>transmission</b> <b>part</b> and proposes a diagnosis method based on a probabilistic neural network (PNN) and fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA). The original FOA is modified with a multi-swarm strategy to enhance the search performance and the modified FOA is utilized to optimize the smoothing parameters of the PNN. The vibration signals of rocker <b>transmission</b> <b>part</b> are decomposed by the ensemble empirical mode decomposition and the Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to choose several appropriate components. Forty-five features are extracted to estimate the decomposed components and original signal, and the distance-based evaluation approach is employed to select a subset of state-sensitive features by removing the irrelevant features. Finally, {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method is demonstrated via the simulation studies of shearer cutting state diagnosis and the comparison results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the competing methods in terms of diagnosis accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Since its {{inception}} in 1981, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus / Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV / AIDS) epidemic has raised challenging legal and ethical questions for public health officials, physicians, policymakers, patients, lawyers, and ethicists. Although HIV / AIDS mostly affects adults in their prime working years, it has also emerged as a pediatric health problem. Current estimates indicate that {{in the absence of}} effective maternal treatment, eight hundred thousand children worldwide born to HIV-infected mothers will be infected each year. Yet, {{one of the most significant}} advances of the epidemic has been the discovery that antiretroviral medications taken by the mother during pregnancy and delivery, and by the child after birth, can greatly reduce the risk of HIV transmission. As a result, the United States and the rest of the global community have the opportunity to take proactive steps toward the reduction and virtual elimination of perinatal HIV transmission. This Article explores the legal issues related to the reduction of perinatal HIV transmission in the United States to demonstrate that proper education, along with voluntary testing and treatment during pregnancy, can significantly reduce such <b>transmission.</b> <b>Part</b> I examines the history of this topic from a medical perspective, focusing on studies of efforts to reduce perinatal <b>transmission.</b> <b>Part</b> II looks at the evolution of recommendations, policies, and laws regarding the testing and treatment of HIV-positive pregnant women. Part III examines existing state laws regarding HIV testing and counseling, while Part IV reviews legal challenges to these and related laws. With the current medical, legal, and policy information in mind, Part V makes recommendations concerning state legal interventions to reduce perinatal HIV <b>transmission.</b> <b>Part</b> VI concludes that a carefully crafted policy of routine testing that incorporates informed consent is the key to a viable strategy to reduce HIV transmission...|$|E

30|$|In {{contrast}} to hash-less Wyner-Ziv codecs, e.g. [26], our proposed codec {{has a higher}} encoding complexity caused by the additional hash formation and coding. However, the hash-related complexity overhead is kept low, since the hash dimensions were reduced to one fourth of the original frame resolution prior to coarse H. 264 /AVC Intra frame coding. When compared to Motion JPEG, the proposed codec (although currently not optimized for speed) exhibits similar encoding time but offers superior compression performance. We remark that compared to DISCOVER or Motion JPEG, the proposed codec offers a significant reduction of the encoding rate for a given distortion level. Such a not-able rate reduction induces an important decrease in power consumption by the <b>transmission</b> <b>part</b> of wireless video recording devices, e.g., wireless capsule endoscopes.|$|E
