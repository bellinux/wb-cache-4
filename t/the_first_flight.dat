5|$|ANA was of {{the opinion}} that if a small amount of water entered a fuel tank during {{refuelling}} it would only reach the drain cocks when the aircraft was in level flight so it could not be detected immediately after re-fuelling. For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks for the presence of water was prior to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked fuel tanks for the presence of water prior to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> of the day.|$|E

5|$|Flight testing {{began with}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> {{of the second}} AH-56 (s/n 66-8827) in September 1967. During early flight tests, a rotor {{instability}} issue was discovered when the aircraft was flying at low altitude in ground effect. As the flight envelope was expanded, this instability and other minor problems were discovered and quickly addressed.|$|E
5|$|Beset {{by early}} {{construction}} problems, the first FSD aircraft {{was transferred to}} Groom Lake in May1981 inside a C-5. Further problems, this time with fuel leaks, delayed <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight.</b> Under the control of Harold Farley, the aircraft took off on 18June for its maiden flight, nine months after the July1980 first flight originally envisaged. The first production F-117A was delivered in 1982, and operational capability was achieved in October1983; the 59th and last F-117 was delivered in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Tu-80 {{began in}} November 1948, using as many Tu-4 {{components}} {{as possible to}} speed up construction, but <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> was not until 1 December 1949, after the Council of Ministers had canceled the program on 16 September 1949 {{in favor of the}} Tu-85 which was expected to have much better performance. The Tu-80 became a research aircraft, testing reversible-pitch propellers and structural deformation in heavy aircraft. It eventually became a target on a bombing and gunnery range.|$|E

5|$|Flight {{testing of}} the XF-104s began with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> in March 1954, encountering several problems, {{some of which were}} resolved; however, {{performance}} of the XF-104 proved better than estimates and despite both prototypes being lost through accidents, the USAF ordered 17 service-test/pre-production YF-104As. Production Starfighters proved popular, both with the USAF and internationally, serving with a number of countries, including Jordan, Turkey, and Japan.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{key role}} in the 1982 Falklands War, several lessons were learned from the aircraft's performance, which led to {{approval}} for an upgrade of the fleet to FRS.2 (later known as FA2) standard to be given in 1984. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> of the prototype took place in September 1988 and a contract was signed for 29 upgraded aircraft in December that year. In 1990, the Navy ordered 18 new-build FA2s, at a unit cost of around £12million, four further upgraded aircraft were ordered in 1994. The first aircraft was delivered on 2 April 1993.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been given}} top {{priority}} by the Air Force, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> {{test of the}} Bold Orion missile was conducted on May 26, 1958, from a Boeing B-47 Stratojet carrier aircraft, which launched the Bold Orion vehicle {{at the apex of}} a high-speed, high-angle climb. The zoom climb tactic, combined with the thrust from the rocket motor of the missile itself, allowed the missile to achieve its maximum range, or, alternatively, to reach space.|$|E
50|$|Flight testing {{commenced}} in 1974 at Bicycle Lake, California. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>flights</b> {{were conducted}} on battery power, using a bungee cord launch to 20 ft. On its <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> <b>the</b> aircraft reached 500 feet, before returning for a landing.|$|R

5|$|Military flights {{also used}} Fairbanks as a base. In 1920, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> from the {{continental}} United States to Alaska used Fairbanks as a base. In 1934, {{a flight of}} Martin B-10 bombers flew from Washington, D.C. to Fairbanks, ostensibly to demonstrate the feasibility of long-range bomber deployments. In reality, the bombers flew photographic missions intended to scout locations for military airfields {{to be built in}} the territory.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September 1985, the UK and Saudi Arabia {{signed the}} Al Yamamah I {{contract}} including, amongst other things, {{the sale of}} 48 IDS and 24 ADV model Tornados. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> of a RSAF Tornado IDS was on 26 March 1986, and the first Saudi ADV was delivered on 9 February 1989. Saudi Tornados undertook operations during the Gulf War. In June 1993 the Al Yamamah II contract was signed, the main element of which was 48 additional IDSs.|$|E
5|$|Prospective {{customers}} included ILFC, CIT Aerospace, Lufthansa, and Hapag-Lloyd. The latter two, however, were unimpressed {{with the}} long-range variant, preferring a shorter-range aircraft, which was {{better suited to}} their route structure. Singapore Airlines was also an expected customer because it {{was looking for a}} replacement for the A310. Airbus intended to freeze the design in late 2001, with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> scheduled for the third quarter of 2003 and entry into service within a year. The programme was later abandoned, as interest from customers was lacking.|$|E

5|$|RGIA was {{originally}} {{scheduled to open}} to commercial operations on 16 March 2008; however, the date was delayed due to protests from some airlines over the high ground handling rates at the airport. Once the rates were reduced, the launch date was set for 23 March. Although Lufthansa Flight 752 from Frankfurt {{was scheduled to be}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> to land at RGIA, two SpiceJet flights landed earlier. However, the Lufthansa flight still received the planned ceremonial welcome upon its 12:25 am arrival.|$|E
5|$|The XB-70's {{maiden flight}} was on 21 September 1964. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> test, between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine {{had to be}} shut down shortly after take-off, and an {{undercarriage}} malfunction warning meant that the flight was flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, the rear wheels of the port side main gear locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> with {{passengers}} {{after the}} accident took place on 11 September 2001, landing shortly before the World Trade Center attacks in the United States. This was not a commercial flight: all the passengers were BA employees. Normal commercial operations resumed on 7 November 2001 by BA and AF (aircraft G-BOAE and F-BTSD), with service to New York JFK, where mayor Rudy Giuliani greeted the passengers.|$|E

50|$|In the {{immediate}} postwar era, Quill continued {{as a test}} pilot, flying the latest Supermarine jets, including the Attacker and Swift. By 1947 he had made <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flights</b> and masterminded <b>the</b> development and production test flying of all 52 variants of the Spitfire - the only allied fighter to remain in full production and front-line service throughout the Second World War. He also made <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flights</b> of <b>the</b> Dumbo (an experimental variable-incidence wing torpedo bomber to S.24/37), the Spiteful, the Seafang and, on 27 July 1946, the Attacker, <b>the</b> Royal Navy's <b>first</b> jet fighter.|$|R
50|$|In 1906, {{almost three}} years after <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flights,</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Army {{rejected}} an approach from the Wrights {{on the basis that}} their proposed machine's ability to fly had not been demonstrated.|$|R
5|$|The {{first four}} Saturn I test flights were {{launched}} from LC-34, with only live first stages, carrying dummy upper stages filled with water. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> {{with a live}} S-IV was launched from LC-37. This was followed by five launches of boilerplate CSMs (designated AS-101 through AS-105) into orbit in 1964 and 1965. The last three of these further supported the Apollo program by also carrying Pegasus satellites, which verified {{the safety of the}} translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the one and}} a {{half months}} after the start of ground tests, HB1001, the first of two demonstrators, {{underwent}} tests in preparations for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight.</b> Flight instrumentation was checked first, followed by a thorough shakedown of the aircraft. In early November, two semi-trailers were parked parallel to each other outside Building 82; a camouflage net was thrown over the top to cover the demonstrator during outdoor engine runs. During the engine tests, a local resident complained about the noise, but Have Blue retained its secrecy. HB1001 received a layer of iron-coat paint; during the weekend of 12–13 November, the aircraft received a camouflage scheme devised by Alan Brown, Have Blues chief technical engineer. The scheme, consisting of three colors, each with three tones, was used to deceive any casual onlooker from recognizing the design's characteristic faceting. The aircraft was disassembled and loaded onto a C-5– on 16November, the aircraft was flown from Burbank Airport (since renamed Bob Hope Airport) to Area 51 at Groom Lake, Nevada. Upon touchdown, the aircraft was reassembled before undergoing another round of testing prior to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight.</b> After four taxi tests, HB1001 was ready for test flights.|$|E
5|$|To ease logistics, Norway {{took the}} {{initiative}} to establish Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN), a cooperation between the countries with bases in Queen Maud Land to streamline transport costs. Having an airfield at Troll allows quicker transport to the research stations in western Queen Maud Land, which are located further away from the incumbent airfields at Henriksenskjera and Novolazarevskaya. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>flight</b> that was a preliminary to DROMLAN was made in 2000 from Cape Town, South Africa, to Henriksenskjera, where a Twin Otter was used onwards to Troll.|$|E
