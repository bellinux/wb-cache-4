40|$|Today’s {{spark-ignition}} engine works {{more and more}} on knocking limit because of higher requirements on consumption, exhaust-gas limits and engine power. Heavy <b>knocking</b> can damage <b>the</b> engine permanently. Therefore it is necessary to prevent <b>knocking.</b> <b>The</b> <b>knock</b> sensor signal consists of many components. A knocking combustion creates one component in <b>the</b> <b>knock</b> sensor signal. But the signal contains also disturbing noise by normal combustion and mechanical vibration of other engine components. This disturbing noise can influence <b>the</b> <b>knock</b> detection. A false detected <b>knocking</b> doesn’t damage <b>the</b> engine, but decreases the performance. The influence of the components piston and valve on <b>the</b> <b>knock</b> detection is analysed in this paper.

500|$|Another séance on 3February saw <b>the</b> <b>knocking</b> {{continue}} unabated, {{but by then}} Parsons was in {{an extremely}} difficult—and serious—situation. [...] Keen to prove the ghost was not an imposture he allowed his daughter to be examined at a house on The Strand from 7–10February, and at another house in Covent Garden from 14February. [...] There she was tested {{in a variety of}} ways which included being swung up in a hammock, her hands and feet extended. [...] As expected, the noises commenced, but stopped once Elizabeth was made to place her hands outside the bed. [...] For two nights the ghost was silent. [...] Elizabeth was told that if no more noises were heard by Sunday 21February, she and her father would be committed to Newgate Prison. [...] Her maids then saw her conceal on her person a small piece of wood about 6by 4inches (150 by 100mm) and informed the investigators.

[...] One witness's testimony caused the court to burst into laughter, at which she replied [...] "I assure you gentlemen, it is no laughing matter, whatever you may think of it." [...] Thomas Broughton was also called, as was a priest surnamed Ross, one of those who had questioned the ghost. [...] Judge Murray asked him [...] "Whether he thought he had puzzled the Ghost, or the Ghost had puzzled him?" [...] John Moore was offered support by several esteemed gentlemen and presented Murray with a letter from Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury, who sought to intercede on his behalf.

[...] Inside the house, a member of the group positioned himself against the bed, but was asked by one of the ghost's sympathisers to move. [...] He refused, and following a brief argument the ghost's supporters left. [...] The gentleman then asked if Parsons would allow his daughter to be moved to a room at his house, but was refused. [...] For the remainder of the night the ghost made no sound, while Elizabeth Parsons, now extremely agitated, displayed signs of convulsions. [...] When questioned she confirmed that she had seen the ghost, but that she was not frightened by it. [...] At that point several of the party left, but at about 7am the next morning <b>the</b> <b>knocking</b> once more recommenced.

2500|$|On {{the basis}} of circumstantial evidence, it is speculated that the Bridewell Governors may have decided as early as 1598 to allow public {{visitors}} as means of raising hospital income. The only other reference to visiting in the sixteenth-century is provided in a comment in Thomas More's 1522 treatise, The Four Last Things, where he observed that [...] "thou shalt in Bedleem see one laugh at <b>the</b> <b>knocking</b> of his head against a post". As More occupied a variety of official positions that might have occasioned his calling {{to the hospital and}} as he lived nearby, his visit provides no compelling evidence that public visitation was widespread during the sixteenth century. The first apparently definitive documentation of public visiting derives from a 1610 record which details Lord Percy's payment of 10 shillings for the privilege of rambling through the hospital to view its deranged denizens. It was also at this time, and perhaps not coincidentally, that Bedlam was first used as a stage setting with the publication of The Honest Whore, Part I, in 1604.|$|E
