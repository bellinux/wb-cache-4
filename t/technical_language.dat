Our approach to the matter focuses on two <b>technical</b> <b>languages,</b> viz. medical and rhetorical. Methodologically, in our opinion the main attention must be paid to the philological analysis of the textual evidence, always by means of the contrast of the attested linguistic data related to different sociolects. We also suggest that this analysis must not be limited to the lexical level, as if <b>technical</b> <b>languages</b> were only determined by a special word selection. In both <b>technical</b> <b>languages,</b> medical and rhetorical, the Aristophanic comedies show a conscious borrowing and use of several terms and structures whose specialized function can be proved by texts from the Hippocratic corpus, Antiphon and the Athenian contemporary Kanzleisprache...|$|R

In this paper we apply this approach to automatically identify the areas of semantic change in the lexicon of Ancient Greek between the pre-Christian and Christian era. Distributional Semantic Models are used to identify meaningful clusters and patterns of semantic shift within a set of target words, defined through a purely data-driven approach. The results emphasize the role played by the diffusion of Christianity and by <b>technical</b> <b>languages</b> in determining semantic change in Ancient Greek and show the potentialities of distributional models in diachronic semantics...|$|R

This recognition came about with research done around the 1960s that proved that signed languages are in fact <b>technical</b> <b>languages,</b> with structure and grammar to match that of spoken language. In fact, manual and verbal languages are all indeed full languages, with common properties like syntax and grammar. They both also use the same {{area of the brain}} in the left hemisphere.

25|$|The raised voltage opened {{many more}} {{potassium}} channels than usual, {{and some of}} these do not close right away when the membrane returns to its normal resting voltage. In addition, further potassium channels open in response to the influx of calcium ions during the action potential. The potassium permeability of the membrane is transiently unusually high, driving the membrane voltage Vm even closer to the potassium equilibrium voltage EK. Hence, there is an undershoot or hyperpolarization, termed an afterhyperpolarization in <b>technical</b> <b>language,</b> that persists until the membrane potassium permeability returns to its usual value.|$|E
25|$|Although most {{electrical}} engineers will understand basic circuit theory (that is {{the interactions of}} elements such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and inductors in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, quantum mechanics and solid state physics might be relevant to an engineer working on VLSI (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even circuit theory may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use off-the-shelf components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for {{electrical engineers}} are reflected in university programs, which emphasize strong numerical skills, computer literacy, {{and the ability to}} understand the <b>technical</b> <b>language</b> and concepts that relate to electrical engineering.|$|E

Here it is proved that several different classes of regular languages are ALD. ...|$|R
