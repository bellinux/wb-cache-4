40|$|The paper {{shows how}} {{commodity}} taxes can provide insurance to consumers when the producer price is volatile. Specific and ad valorem taxes have differing roles. The optimal specific tax is positive when demand has some elasticity. The optimal ad valorem rate is zero when demand is unit-elastic, negative when demand is inelastic and positive for elastic demand. When {{both types of}} taxes are used in general the specific tax is positive and the ad valorem rate is negative. The model also applies to the problem in public utility regulation of determining how retail prices should move with wholesale or fuel prices. commodity <b>taxation,</b> <b>price</b> regulation...|$|E

40|$|The {{regulator}} of {{a natural}} monopoly that sets a two-part tariff and whose marginal cost is stochastic will generally want the price to vary less than marginal cost when the lump-sum charge in the tariff is fixed. A trade-off exists between efficient pricing and an optimal allocation of risk. Pricing at marginal cost is only optimal when the consumer`s marginal utility is independent of the price. When marginal utility increases with the price the mark-up falls monotonically as marginal cost rises. The lump-sum element of the tariff should exceed the fixed cost when demand is inelastic and equals the fixed cost only with unit elasticity. The model may also be applied to optimal commodity <b>taxation.</b> <b>price</b> risk, regulation, Ramsey pricing...|$|E
40|$|Rates of {{diabetes}} in Mexico {{are among the}} highest worldwide. In 2014, Mexico instituted a nationwide tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) {{in order to reduce}} the high level of SSB consumption, a preventable cause {{of diabetes}} and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We used an established computer simulation model of CVD and country-specific data on demographics, epidemiology, SSB consumption, and short-term changes in consumption following the SSB tax in order to project potential long-range health and economic impacts of SSB taxation in Mexico. We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model-Mexico, a state transition model of Mexican adults aged 35 - 94 y, to project the potential future effects of reduced SSB intake on diabetes incidence, CVD events, direct diabetes healthcare costs, and mortality over 10 y. Model inputs included short-term changes in SSB consumption in response to <b>taxation</b> (<b>price</b> elasticity) and data from government and market research surveys and public healthcare institutions. Two main scenarios were modeled: a 10 % reduction in SSB consumption (corresponding to the reduction observed after tax implementation) and a 20 % reduction in SSB consumption (possible with increases in taxation levels and/or additional measures to curb consumption). Given uncertainty about the degree to which Mexicans will replace calories from SSBs with calories from other sources, we evaluated a range of values for calorie compensation. We projected that a 10 % reduction in SSB consumption with 39 % calorie compensation among Mexican adults would result in about 189, 300 (95 % uncertainty interval [UI] 155, 400 - 218, 100) fewer incident type 2 diabetes cases, 20, 400 fewer incident strokes and myocardial infarctions, and 18, 900 fewer deaths occurring from 2013 to 2022. This scenario predicts that the SSB tax could save Mexico 983 million international dollars (95 % UI $ 769 million-$ 1, 173 million). The largest relative and absolute reductions in diabetes and CVD events occurred in the youngest age group modeled (35 - 44 y). This study's strengths include the use of an established mathematical model of CVD and use of contemporary Mexican vital statistics, data from health surveys, healthcare costs, and SSB price elasticity estimates as well as probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty. The limitations of the study include reliance on US-based studies for certain inputs where Mexico-specific data were lacking (specifically the associations between risk factors and CVD outcomes [from the Framingham Heart Study] and SSB calorie compensation assumptions), limited data on healthcare costs other than those related to diabetes, and lack of information on long-term SSB price elasticity that is specific to geographic and economic subgroups. Mexico's high diabetes prevalence represents a public health crisis. While the long-term impact of Mexico's SSB tax is not yet known, these projections, based on observed consumption reductions, suggest that Mexico's SSB tax may substantially decrease morbidity and mortality from diabetes and CVD while reducing healthcare costs...|$|E

It embodies a new equilibrium selection rule in the wage bargain that stabilizes the response of the wage to transitory influences, in comparison to the Nash wage bargain. The response of unemployment to changes in driving forces is much stronger with stabilized wages than with Nash wages. Using the model’s intratemporal first-order condition, I derive a time series for the most important driving force, which combines the effects of productivity changes, <b>taxation,</b> <b>prices</b> of factors other than labor, and market power.

First, the average euro area monthly frequency of price adjustment is 15 p. c., compared to about 25 p. c. in the US. Second, the frequency of price changes is characterized by substantial cross product heterogeneity - prices of oil and unprocessed food products change very often, while price adjustments are less frequent for processed food, non energy industrial goods and services. Third, cross country heterogeneity exists but is less pronounced. Fourth, price decreases are not uncommon. Fifth, price increases and decreases are sizeable compared to aggregate and sectoral inflation rates. Sixth, price changes are not highly synchronized across retailers. Moreover, the frequency of price changes in the euro area is related to several factors, such as seasonality, outlet type, indirect <b>taxation,</b> <b>pricing</b> practices as well as aggregate or product specific inflation.

Among various international policy-effect evaluation frameworks, the current study fi rst reviews <b>taxation,</b> <b>pricing,</b> and demand elasticity among car users. Second, it reviews the thinking behind the operation of rail systems, {{as well as the}} policies therein, and evaluations of their effi ciency and sustainability. In the United States, developments in train systems that took place between 1955 and 1975 -including the thruport design for freight distribution-marked the fi rst wave of this trend. Between the mid- 1990 s and 2006 in East Asia, the growth of railway patronage numbers as a proportion of public transportation highlights the importance of integrating land-use plans and low-carbon transportation systems in working towards the creation of sustainable cities. Finally, energy-saving policies within the transportation industry need to be evaluated in terms of national socioeconomic background (i. e., calculations of Taiwan's carbon emissions reductions as a result of implementing high-speed rail, both during the feasibility study stage [before 1994] and the system's business operations [after 2007]).

40|$|Increasing {{community}} and political concern about excessive alcohol consumption and related harms in Australia has prompted {{calls for the}} introduction of tighter regulatory controls. From an evidence-based, research perspective, measures which increase alcohol prices and taxes, in particular, are considered most effective for reducing alcohol consumption and related harms. Accordingly, this report presents a review of <b>pricing</b> and <b>taxation</b> policy levers that have been considered and/or implemented nationally and internationally. These policies include: alcohol <b>taxation</b> and differential <b>price</b> by beverage; special/additional taxation on alcopops; minimum pricing; and bans on price discounts and promotions.

Two‐sided platform firms derive income from two customer {{groups that are}} connected through at least one positive network externality from one group to the other.

A second result of the paper is that it is inherently difficult to establish arm’s length prices in two‐sided markets. Finally, we find that differences in national tax rates may be welfare enhancing, despite the use of (abusive) transfer prices as a profit‐shifting device.

The city government initially tried to halt the development by the area but extending and raising property taxes, but it did not work.

Many of the buildings had French influence, which was popular at the time, which even included mansard roofs, {{despite the fact that it}} never snows here.
