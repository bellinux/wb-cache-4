Horne's MP, Tony Clarke, visited Horne in prison on 12 November to negotiate another meeting between Horne's supporters and the Home Office, which took place on 19 November 44 days into the strike.

25|$|In July 1953, Representative Leonor Sullivan {{introduced}} H.R. 6549, a bill {{authorizing the}} allocation {{of no more than}} $5million to build the arch. After much negotiation, both houses of Congress approved the bill in May 1954, and on May 18, 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the bill into law as Public Law 361. Congress could not afford to appropriate the funds in 1955, so association president William Crowdus resorted <b>to</b> <b>asking</b> the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations for $10million. The foundations denied the request because their function as private foundations did not include funding national memorials. In 1956, Congress appropriated $2.64million to be used to move the railroad tracks. The remainder of the authorized appropriation was requested via six congressional bills, introduced on July 1, 1958, that revised Public Law 361 to encompass the cost of the entire memorial, increasing federal funds by $12.25million. A month later the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of the Budget endorsed the bill, and both houses of Congress unanimously passed the bill. Eisenhower signed it into law on September 7. The NPS held off on appropriating the additional funds, as it planned to use the already-appropriated funds to initiate the railroad work.|$|E

500|$|With {{the series}} already lost, England made four changes to their team. John Dewes {{replaced}} Cyril Washbrook—who broke his thumb in {{a match for}} Lancashire against the Australians—at {{the top of the}} order. Dewes had gained attention after scoring 51 for Middlesex in the tour match against the Australians. In the three weeks between then and the Test, he had scored 105 and 89 against Lancashire and Sussex respectively. However, he had averaged less than 40 for the season and made three consecutive scores below 20 leading into the Tests. The journalist and former Australian Test cricketer Bill O'Reilly condemned the decision, claiming that aside from defending the ball, Dewes was too reliant on slogging towards the leg side with a horizontal bat. O'Reilly claimed Dewes was not ready for Test cricket and that asking him to face the rampant Australians could have psychologically scarred him. He said the selection [...] "was tantamount <b>to</b> <b>asking</b> a young first-year medical student to carry out an intricate operation with a butcher's knife." ...|$|E

[...] Trenchard judged that the chief threat to his service came from the new First Sea Lord, Admiral Beatty. [...] Looking to take the initiative, Trenchard arranged to see Beatty, meeting with him in early December. [...] Trenchard, arguing that the [...] "air is one and indivisible", put forward a case for an air force with its own strategic role which also controlled army and navy co-operation squadrons. [...] Beatty did not accept Trenchard's argument and Trenchard resorted <b>to</b> <b>asking</b> for a 12 months amnesty to put his plans into action. [...] The request appealed to Beatty's sense of fair play and he agreed to let Trenchard be until the end of 1920. Around this time Trenchard indicated to Beatty that control over some supporting elements of naval aviation (but not aircrew or aircraft) might be returned to the Admiralty. Trenchard also offered Beatty the option of locating the Air Ministry staff who worked in connection with naval aviation at the Admiralty. [...] Beatty declined the offer and later, when no transfer of any naval aviation assets occurred, came to the view that Trenchard had acted in bad faith.|$|E
