500|$|The company's online {{advertising}} program in Spain described the BK XXL line as being made [...] "with two enormous portions of flame-broiled meat <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> {{all the energy}} {{you need to take}} the world by storm." [...] This claim combined with the television advertising were the prime motivators behind the Spanish government's concerns with the XXL sandwich line. The government claimed that campaign violated an agreement with the government to comply with an initiative on curbing obesity by promoting such a large and unhealthy sandwich. In response to the government's claims, Burger King replied in a statement: [...] "In this campaign, we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years. Our philosophy can be summed up with the motto 'As you like it,' in which our customers' taste trumps all." [...] The company {{went on to say that}} it offers other healthier items such as salads and that customers are free to choose their own foods and modify them as they desire.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Disney {{began to}} {{negotiate}} with Joseph Kosinski to direct Tron: Legacy. Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are you interested? What would your take be? In a post-Matrix world, how do {{you go back to the}} world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and let me do a small test <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a hint for a couple minutes of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Thirty {{years after}} the scandal broke, Amanda Marcotte {{suggested}} in The Daily Beast that [...] "we owe a lot to Vanessa Williams for being a pioneer {{when it comes to}} showing the world how to recover when you’ve been unjustly shamed for being sexual. Williams could have slunk off into the shadows in shame, which no doubt many people at the time expected her to do. Williams picked herself up and kept fighting for a career as an entertainer, first by becoming a successful singer and then becoming a well-known comic actress ... Sleazy people tried to drag Vanessa Williams down with accusations of being sexual 30 years ago, but she moved on, showing she had nothing to be ashamed of." [...] In addition, Williams commented on her ability to persevere after these events in a 2015 interview with Entertainment Tonight by stating that [...] "you can't give up ... you always have to remember what you're made of and not let circumstances get in the way. They might delay your progress for the moment, but you always have to remember who you are, and <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> the eyes on the prize." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Rotten Tomatoes, {{a review}} {{aggregator}} that collects both contemporary and modern reviews, {{the film has}} an 82% approval rating based on 38 reviews; the average rating is 6.9/10. [...] The site's consensus reads: [...] "Brimming with energy and packed with humor, Big Trouble in Little China distills kung fu B-movies as affectionately as it subverts them." [...] Ron Base, in his review for the Toronto Star, praised Russell's performance. [...] "He does a great John Wayne imitation. But he's not just mimicking these heroes, he is using them to give his own character a broad, satiric edge." [...] Walter Goodman in The New York Times wrote, [...] "In kidding the flavorsome proceedings even as he gets the juice out of them, the director, John Carpenter, is conspicuously with it." [...] Writer Harlan Ellison, widely known in Hollywood for his brutally honest critiques, praised the film, writing that it had [...] "some of the funniest lines spoken by any actor this year to produce a cheerfully blathering live-action cartoon <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> release from the real pressures of your basically dreary lives." [...] In his review for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "Little China offers dollops of entertainment, {{but it is so}} stocked with canny references to other pictures that it suggests a master's thesis that moves." ...|$|E
