5|$|With Piper's departure, Paul McDermott, who {{performed}} {{at one of}} DAAS's regular clubs, was invited to join. He accepted, {{although he did not}} like their material, which he considered <b>too</b> <b>sweet.</b> Fidler says McDermott changed the group's dynamic; he wrote the majority of their songs and prompted a darker tone. After winning the Pick of the Fringe award at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival, the group relocated from Canberra to Melbourne, where they based themselves with a regular gig at the Prince Patrick Hotel in Collingwood, in an effort to save enough money to travel to the Edinburgh Fringe. Initially DAAS found that Melbourne audiences did not respond to their act and to provoke a reaction they became more aggressive, with McDermott and Ferguson adopting more abusive personas and often picking on Fidler's naturally happy but stupid character. They made their first overseas performance at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1987, to sold out crowds.|$|E
5|$|Regarding Hall's fate, the {{official}} investigation that followed ruled {{the cause of}} death was apoplexy (an early term for stroke). Some of Hall's symptoms— partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium— certainly fit that diagnosis. Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke. However, in 1968, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Because of the permafrost, Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life. Arsenic poisoning appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, stupor, and mania. Arsenic can have a sweet taste, and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted <b>too</b> <b>sweet,</b> and had burned his stomach. It also appears that at least three of the crew, Budington, Meyer, and Bessels, expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him. In his book The Arctic Grail, Pierre Berton suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in medical kits of the time. But it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, who was in nearly constant attendance of Hall. No charges were ever filed.|$|E
500|$|For the {{coronation}} {{of their parents}} in 1937, {{it was decided that}} Elizabeth and Margaret should be given small versions of crowns to wear at the ceremony. Ornate coronets of gold lined with crimson and edged with ermine were designed by Garrard & Co. and brought to the royal couple for inspection. However, the king and queen decided they were inappropriately elaborate and too heavy for the young princesses. Queen Mary suggested the coronets be silver-gilt in a medieval style with no decorations. George VI agreed, and the coronets were designed with Maltese crosses and fleurs-de-lis. After {{the coronation}}, Mary wrote: [...] "I sat between Maud and Lilibet (Elizabeth), and Margaret came next. They looked <b>too</b> <b>sweet</b> in their lace dresses and robes, especially when they put on their coronets". Both coronets are thought to be in the Queen's private collection.|$|E

500|$|When {{she first}} arrived in Genoa City, Angelina set her eyes on Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), whom she {{developed}} a huge crush on. Of her crazy crush, DeGarmo said: [...] "Ooh, she wants him bad! Angie has her eyes, her heart and her body set on landing Kevin — and it scares him to death." [...] She said that Kevin was <b>too</b> <b>sweet</b> and nervous, and is weakened to Angelina's preying on him. [...] "She loves seeing him squirm" [...] DeGarmo stated. Of working with Rikaart, she said: [...] "Greg and I can't stop laughing during our scenes together." [...] During an interview with MSN, she stated: [...] "I've had the great pleasure sharing the screen with Mr. Greg Rikaart. Angelina gets {{a little bit of}} a crush on Kevin, and she's not afraid not to show it. It's a blast, because she makes him incredibly nervous [...] The sparks that fly on screen are just hilarious. It's wonderful to be a part of." [...] Just before Kevin was set to marry his girlfriend Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson), Angelina persuaded him to help her escape town, as she was in danger. They returned home safe.|$|E
500|$|Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said [...] "Fifteen" [...] {{was one of}} Swift's best-written songs. James Reed of The Boston Globe {{believed}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] was one of Fearlesss {{most interesting}} songs and stated he could visualize the lyrics of the song scribbled in a diary that chronicled Swift's freshman year in high school. Sean Dooley of About.com named it the best track on Fearless and said it showcased Swift's growth as a songwriter. Josh Love of The Village Voice called the song a [...] "standout" [...] on the album and found it a refreshing contradiction to typical, idealistic country songs. Prior to its single release, Kate Kiefer of Paste magazine suggested for the song be released as a single from Fearless, adding that she loved it. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called the track a fantastically good song that broadened [...] "her potential market from teenage girls to anyone {{who used to be}} a teenage girl". Petridis continued, [...] "You applaud her skill, while feeling slightly unsettled by the thought of a teenager pontificating away like Yoda." [...] Aidan Vaziri of San Francisco Chronicle ranked it twelfth on his top 12 singles of 2009 list, commenting, [...] "Damn it if this song isn't <b>too</b> <b>sweet,</b> too vulnerable and just too real to ignore." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times gave a mixed assessment. He praised Mary Martin's performance, saying [...] "she {{still has}} the same common touch ... same sharp features, goodwill, and glowing {{personality}} that makes music sound intimate and familiar" [...] and stated that [...] "the best of the Sound of Music is Rodgers and Hammerstein in good form". However, he said, the libretto [...] "has the hackneyed look of the musical theatre replaced with Oklahoma! in 1943. It is disappointing to see the American musical stage succumbing to the clichés of operetta." [...] Walter Kerr's review in the New York Herald Tribune was unfavorable: [...] "Before The Sound of Music is halfway through its promising chores it becomes not only <b>too</b> <b>sweet</b> for words but almost <b>too</b> <b>sweet</b> for music", stating that the [...] "evening suffer(s) from little children".|$|E

[...] Aqua and Aria together have been praised for their joyful calm, vividly depicted futuristic world, moments of magic, and sense of whimsy. Amano's artwork is praised for her crisp lines and details, especially in the backgrounds and landscapes. Amano has also been criticized for confusingly giving every character a name that begins with A, for letting some slice-of-life stories [...] "drift too far out," [...] and for making Akari's character <b>too</b> <b>sweet</b> and effusive.|$|E
