5000|$|Like its near {{neighbours}} in Upper Nidderdale, {{the construction}} of Leighton reservoir (and Roundhill) necessitated the building of an industrial railway to bring in materials for construction. A [...] 6 mi railway was built from {{the north end of}} Masham railway station where a <b>transhipment</b> <b>yard</b> was located to transfer freight between the narrow and standard gauge lines. The line opened in 1905 and was closed by 1930.|$|E

Masham had a goods yard directly next to the station platforms, but was also provided with a <b>transhipment</b> goods <b>yard</b> north of the station and across the Masham to Melmerby road (now the A6108 road) for the narrow gauge railway supplying the reservoir building further west.|$|R
