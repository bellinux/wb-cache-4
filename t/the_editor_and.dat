5|$|Daniel Adamson, {{promoter}} of the Manchester Ship Canal, {{lived at the}} Towers (blue plaque – once the Shirley Institute) on Wilmslow Road from 1874 {{until his death in}} 1890.

5|$|In August 2012, Weird Tales became {{involved}} in a media altercation after the editor announced the magazine was going to publish an excerpt from Victoria Foyt's controversial novel Save the Pearls, which many critics accused of featuring racist stereotyping. The decision was made despite the protests of VanderMeer, and prompted her to end her association with the magazine. The publisher subsequently overruled <b>the</b> <b>editor,</b> <b>and</b> announced that Weird Tales no longer had plans to run the excerpt.|$|E
5|$|The Towers, {{now known}} as the Shirley Institute, was once the home of {{engineer}} Daniel Adamson – {{the driving force behind the}} Manchester Ship Canal project – and the venue where the decision to build the canal was taken. The house was designed by Salford architect Thomas Worthington, for <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> <b>and</b> proprietor of the Manchester Guardian, John Edward Taylor.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Adams Township High School, Verville took a {{correspondence}} course in electrical engineering. He moved to Detroit, Michigan {{at the age}} of twenty, and from 1910 to 1913 he worked in the electrical departments of the Detroit Edison Company, Ford Motor Company, and Hudson Motor Car Company. By 1913, Verville had made his mind up that he wanted to learn to fly. William Edmund Scripps, <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> <b>and</b> owner of The Detroit News, introduced Verville to Glenn Curtiss in July 1913. Curtiss encouraged Verville to apply for his Spring 1914 flight school. Instead, Verville went to Hammondsport, New York in February 1914, where Curtiss Aeroplane Company was located, and told Curtiss he wanted to work as an apprentice in his drafting and engineering shop. Curtiss agreed and this began Verville's aviation career.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, amateur historians {{first began}} writing {{accounts}} {{of the events of}} the Fishing Creek Confederacy. In January 1950, William M. Scnure mentioned the event {{at a meeting of the}} Northumberland County Historical Society, and the fort on North Mountain was said to exist in an article written by Myrtle Magargel in 1955. In 1958 the Fishing Creek Confederacy was mentioned in the History of Columbia County, Pennsylvania, which was intended to be used in schools in Columbia County. In the 1960s and 1970s local newspapers occasionally ran articles summarizing the Fishing Creek Confederacy. In 1998, the Bloomsburg Theater Ensemble compiled a book of Columbia County history based on letters to <b>the</b> <b>editor,</b> <b>and</b> several of these letters mentioned the Fishing Creek Confederacy. In 2012 Byron Heller wrote a piece of historical fiction called The Fishing Creek Confederacy, inspired by the events of the Fishing Creek Confederacy. The confederacy has been the subject of satirical works.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1857, FitzGerald {{resigned}} from Parliament {{on the advice}} of his doctors, and also decided not to seek re-election as provincial Superintendent. Robert Heaton Rhodes offered a requisition to Brittan to make himself available for the by-election that would result from FitzGerald's resignation from Parliament in the Lyttelton electorate, but Brittan replied that he could not absent himself from his private affairs as yet; Parliament at that time met in Auckland, and the 1858 session lasted from 10 April to 21 August, which required an absence from home for several months. Instead, Crosbie Ward, <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> <b>and</b> proprietor of the Lyttelton Times, was the only person nominated on 28 May 1858 and was thus declared elected.|$|E
5|$|Shankar, {{who also}} wrote the film's story and screenplay, was paid a then record salary of 30million (Indian rupees) for the project. A. R. Rahman, who was {{selected}} to compose the film's soundtrack and background score, was also paid 30million. Sujatha Rangarajan was assigned to write the dialogues for Sivaji. Tha. Prabhu Raja Cholan, who would later direct the film Karuppampatti (2013), worked as an assistant director in this film. Rajinikanth's daughter Soundarya worked as a graphics designer, creating the title for this film; she had earlier worked {{in the same position}} on two of her father's films– Baba (2002) and Chandramukhi (2005). K. V. Anand was hired as the cinematographer in August 2005. Manish Malhotra was responsible for designing the film's costumes, while Anthony and Thota Tharani were <b>the</b> <b>editor</b> <b>and</b> art director respectively. Additional make-up for Rajinikanth was done by make-up artist Banu.|$|E

5|$|The case {{established}} {{the doctrine of}} fair abridgement, which allowed that abridgements displaying {{a fair amount of}} labour on the part of <b>the</b> <b>editor,</b> <b>and</b> that differed from the original published work in a significant way, could not be copyright violations. This in effect raised the abridger to the level of an author. The decision did not define the exact parameters that would qualify a work as a valid abridgement. This distinction came with a later case involving an abridgement of Hawksworth's Voyages, in a decision written by Lord Chancellor Apsley. This concept of fair abridgement eventually evolved through common law, initiated from Gyles v Wilcox, into the current concept of fair use. Hardwicke's decision also added the exercise of personal judgement to the list of admissible defences against the charge of copyright infringement, adding to the growing case law establishing that British copyright would be based on labour and not on originality. The opinion advanced the position that copyright law should serve the public interest by promoting the creation of new educational and useful works, rather than focusing on publishing rights. The case {{played a significant role in}} the development of English copyright law. The United States federal courts have cited the case as recently as the 1980s.|$|E
