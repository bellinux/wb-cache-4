5|$|Neighbours {{executive}} producer Susan Bower said {{the creation of}} the character and his storyline was a result of requests from young viewers in the Neighbours website forums. Bower said that although the show had featured lesbian romances before, love scenes between men are still taboo in Australian dramas.

5|$|In Colonel Redl, Brandauer plays Alfred Redl, {{counter-intelligence}} {{chief of}} the Austro-Hungarian Empire who was blackmailed into espionage for the Russians {{in order to prevent}} the revelation of his homosexuality.

5|$|The breed {{remained}} relatively unknown {{outside of the}} borders until 1815 when Sir Walter Scott's novel Guy Mannering was published. Scott had spent time in the area whilst the Sheriff of Selkirkshire and had learned of the prowess {{of these types of}} specialist terriers for working both fox and otter. When he wrote Guy Mannering, he included a character by the name of Dandie Dinmont who owned a number of terriers named Pepper and Mustard after the colours of their coats. The Dinmont character was partly based on <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>life</b> farmer and terrier owner, James Davidson, who too used the generic terms of Pepper and Mustard for his dogs depending on their coats. Davidson's dogs came {{from a variety of sources}} including the dogs of the Allan, Anderson and Faas families. Davidson documented his breeding, and he has been accepted as the originator of the modern breed.|$|E
5|$|The film {{is based}} on <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>life</b> of Ron Woodroof, a patient of HIV and AIDS, who {{was the subject of}} a lengthy 1992 article in The Dallas Morning News written by {{journalist}} and author Bill Minutaglio. A month before Woodroof died in September 1992, screenwriter Craig Borten was told about the story by his friend, so he went and interviewed him to create the screenplay; Borten recorded many hours of interviews with Woodroof and had access to his personal journals. Borten wrote a script for what he believed would make a great movie and attempted to attract interest in making the film in mid 1996, with Dennis Hopper attached to direct. Columbia Pictures was set to buy the script but the film was unable to secure financial backing.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} Mario Vargas Llosa {{are viewed as}} both modernist and postmodernist novels. Though {{there is still much}} debate over the {{differences}} between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as The Green House and Conversation in the Cathedral, are clearly elements of the modern novel. Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude—another important defining aspect of modernist art. By contrast, his later novels such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, <b>The</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Life</b> of Alejandro Mayta, and The Storyteller (El hablador) appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing. These novels have a much lighter, farcical, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism. Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, The Green House and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution as well as the workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.|$|E

5|$|Now in a {{committed}} relationship, Rachel and Adam begin trying for a baby. The storyline was devised because Harries wanted Cold Feet to reflect relevant issues in contemporary society; {{in vitro fertilisation}} featured heavily in the news during 2000, and Harries felt that incorporating it into the series would help {{to raise awareness of}} it, as well as provide fodder for the characters' story arcs. Rachel's intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment incorporated aspects of <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>life</b> IVF treatment experienced by Harries and his wife Rebecca Frayn, and eminent fertility scientist Sammy Lee was consulted extensively throughout the development of the plot. After spending several thousand pounds on IVF treatment, Rachel's doctor informs her that she is infertile due to Asherman's syndrome, most likely caused by her abortion. Despite being unable to have children naturally, Rachel and Adam are determined to continue their relationship; Adam proposes to her and they are married in a civil ceremony in Series 3, Episode 8. In the same episode, she is reunited with her estranged parents, Brian and Mary (Paul Ridley and Sue Holderness). Before the episode, Rachel had not spoken to them for years; her father because of his bigotry and abuse of her mother, and her mother for staying with him. She refuses to allow Paul to give her away, and instead asks David to, despite learning that he has been having an extra-marital affair. At the reception, she inadvertently reveals to her parents that her sister, their other daughter Lucy, has come out as a lesbian.|$|E
