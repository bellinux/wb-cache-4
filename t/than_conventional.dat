5|$|Although by tradition, Hastert was {{the leader}} of the House Republicans, he adopted a much lower profile in the media <b>than</b> <b>conventional</b> wisdom would suggest for a Speaker. This led to accusations that he was only a figurehead for DeLay. In 2005, DeLay was indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges of campaign-finance violations. DeLay stepped down as {{majority}} leader and was replaced in that post by Roy Blunt; DeLay resigned from Congress the following year.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Abha {{teachers}} college in 1999, Wail al-Shehri {{took a job}} as an elementary school physical education teacher at the Khamis Mushait airbase. Five months into the job, Shehri took leave due to mental illness and depression. Rather <b>than</b> <b>conventional</b> therapy, Wail sought consultation with Muslim clerics, and hoped that a visit to Medina would help. His treatment involved verses from the Qur'an read to him by a sheikh. He traveled to Medina together with Waleed.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of hUC-MSCs {{treatment}} on immune function, tryptophan metabolic pathways and related gene expression of children with immune thrombocytopenia. Methods: A total of 58 cases of children with immune thrombocytopenia were enrolled for study and randomly divided into hUC-MSCs group and conventional group, hUC-MSCs group received glucocorticoid + gamma globulin + hUC-MSCs treatment and conventional group received glucocorticoid + gamma globulin treatment. Then platelet content, immune function, tryptophan metabolism as well as expression of T-bet and GATA- 3 of two groups were compared. Results: Platelet content of hUC-MSCs group was higher <b>than</b> that of <b>conventional</b> group; serum IFN-γ and IL- 2 contents of hUC-MSCs group were lower <b>than</b> those of <b>conventional</b> group, and serum IL- 4 and IL- 10 contents as well as peripheral blood Treg cell ratio was higher <b>than</b> those of <b>conventional</b> group; serum Trp concentration and Trp/Kyn ratio of hUC-MSCs group were lower <b>than</b> those of <b>conventional</b> group, Kyn concentration was higher <b>than</b> that of <b>conventional</b> group, IDO expression in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} was higher <b>than</b> that of <b>conventional</b> group, and TTS expression was lower <b>than</b> that of <b>conventional</b> group; mRNA content of T-bet in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of hUCMSCs group was lower <b>than</b> that of <b>conventional</b> group, and mRNA content of GATA- 3 was higher <b>than</b> that of <b>conventional</b> group. Conclusion: hUC-MSCs therapy can increase platelet content and regulate Th 1 /Th 2 balance and tryptophan metabolism; it’s an ideal method for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia...|$|R

5|$|Another {{factor in}} making the Zephyr lighter <b>than</b> <b>conventional</b> trains was that the {{individual}} carbodies in the train share their trucks with adjacent cars. In this design by Budd engineer Walter B. Dean, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of trucks (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only {{reduced the number of}} trucks under the train, but it also dispensed with the need for couplers between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean that train lengths could not be easily changed by switching out cars.|$|E
5|$|Every {{station is}} {{equipped}} with General Ticketing Machines (GTMs), a Passenger Service Centre and LED or plasma displays that show train service information and announcements. All stations are equipped with restrooms and payphones; some restrooms are located at street level. Some stations, especially the major ones, have additional amenities and services, such as retail shops and kiosks, supermarkets, convenience stores, automatic teller machines, and self-service automated kiosks {{for a variety of}} services. Heavy-duty escalators at stations carry passengers up or down at a rate of 0.75m/s, 50% faster <b>than</b> <b>conventional</b> escalators.|$|E
5|$|Higher-speed rail (HrSR), {{also known}} as {{high-performance}} rail, higher-performance rail, or almost-high-speed rail, is a jargon used to describe inter-city passenger rail services that have top speeds of more <b>than</b> <b>conventional</b> rail but are not high enough to be called high-speed rail services. The term is also used by planners to identify the incremental rail improvements to increase train speeds and reduce travel time as alternatives to larger efforts to create or expand the high-speed rail networks. Some countries use the term medium-speed rail, or semi-high speed rail instead.|$|E

5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{projectile}} potentially poses {{less risk}} of collateral damage <b>than</b> <b>conventional</b> pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, {{as well as}} risk of ricochet. The lightweight projectile also poses less risk of collateral damage {{in the event of}} a miss, because it loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m (437yd), whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m (875yd). This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7×28mm cartridge's intended applications, so the cartridge's limited energy at long range is not conversely considered to be disadvantageous.|$|E
5|$|The two {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} to UP in April 1939, and they completed test runs {{and participated in}} a variety of publicity events for the railroad, including the grand opening of the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal, the world premier of Cecil B. DeMille's film Union Pacific, and even an inspection by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While the locomotives displayed excellent acceleration and an ability to maintain schedules better <b>than</b> <b>conventional</b> steam locomotives, they also demonstrated serious reliability problems and relatively high maintenance costs; they never entered regular revenue service.|$|E
5|$|When the DDL {{project began}} in 1966, the ships' {{role was to}} support patrol boats during anti-infiltration {{operations}} and complement the Navy's existing destroyer force.

It was also hoped that a common DDL hull design {{could be used to}} produce variants optimised for different roles. The RAN and British Royal Navy (RN) held discussions in 1967 on jointly developing DDLs, but the RN withdrew from the project when the Australians insisted on arming the ships with United States-designed weapons.|$|E

5|$|A study {{conducted}} at the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) published in 2014 found that many car dealers are less than enthusiastic about plug-in vehicles. ITS conducted 43 interviews with six automakers and 20 new car dealers selling plug-in vehicles in California’s major metro markets. The study also analyzed national and state-level J.D. Power 2013 Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) study data on customer satisfaction with new car dealerships and Tesla retail stores. The researchers found that buyers of plug-in electric vehicles were significantly less satisfied and rated the dealer purchase experience much lower than buyers of non-premium conventional cars, while Tesla Motors earned industry-high scores. According to the findings, plug-in buyers expect more from dealers <b>than</b> <b>conventional</b> buyers, including product knowledge and support that extends beyond traditional offerings.|$|E

Since the SS190 projectile does not rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a hollow point, the cartridge (and 5.7×28mm weapons) is considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibits the use of expanding bullets in warfare.|$|E
5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives.

The player's objective {{is to put the}} ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further <b>than</b> <b>conventional</b> flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety of ingredients into the bowl, which changes for each level.
