Cork defeated Waterford in the 1961 Munster championship, and while wins over Clare and Cork saw Waterford into the 1962 final, Tipperary hammered Waterford by 20 points to secure a third successive Munster title.The 1963 League final against Tipperary - the ‘Home’ final as the winners were due to meet New York for the <b>title</b> <b>proper</b> - was much closer, with Waterford winning a thrilling match by 2-15 (21) to 4-7. There was to be no such free-scoring the 1963 Munster final though, reached after a six point in over Limerick in the semi-final., Waterford edging a tense affair by 0-11 to 0-8, a result that would be Tipperary’s only senior championship defeat between 1961 and 1965, effectively denying them a 'five-in-a-row'. In the All-Ireland final, Kilkenny were inspired by a 14-point haul from Eddie Keher to a 4-17 (29) to 6-8 (26) victory. There was some consolation for Waterford in the National Hurling League final ‘proper’, where after a scare in a drawn first game (3-6 to 3-6) Waterford won the replay against New York by 3-10 (19) to 1-10 (13).|$|E
