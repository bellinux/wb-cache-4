Since tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 4 (TIMP- 4), {{the activity of}} which is impaired in both pathological conditions, has several amino acid residues susceptible to peroxynitrite, we investigated {{its role as a}} potential target of peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite-induced nitration and oligomerization of TIMP- 4 attenuated its inhibitory activity against MMP- 2 activity and endothelial or <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> <b>invasiveness.</b> Moreover, cell treatment with peroxynitrite promoted the nitration of endogenous TIMP- 4.

40|$|Abstract Background The metastatic {{spread of}} solid tumors is {{directly}} or indirectly responsible for most cancer-related deaths. Tumor metastasis is very complex and this process requires a <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> to acquire enhanced motility, invasiveness and anoikis resistance to successfully establish a tumor at a distal site. Metastatic potential of <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> is directly correlated with the expression levels of several angiogenic cytokines. Copper is a mandatory cofactor for the function {{of many of these}} angiogenic mediators as well as other proteins that {{play an important role in}} <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> motility and <b>invasiveness.</b> We have previously shown that tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a potent chelator of copper and it mediates its anti-tumor effects by suppressing tumor angiogenesis. However, very little is known about the effect of TM on <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> function and <b>tumor</b> metastasis. In this study, we explored the mechanisms underlying TM-mediated inhibition of tumor metastasis. Results We used two in vivo models to examine the effects of TM on tumor metastasis. Animals treated with TM showed a significant decrease in lung metastasis in both in vivo models as compared to the control group. In addition, <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> from the lungs of TM treated animals developed significantly smaller colonies and these colonies had significantly fewer <b>tumor</b> <b>cells.</b> TM treatment significantly decreased <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> motility and <b>invasiveness</b> by inhibiting lysyl oxidase (LOX) activity, FAK activation and MMP 2 levels. Furthermore, TM treatment significantly enhanced <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> anoikis by activating p 38 MAPK cell death pathway and by downregulating XIAP survival protein expression. Conclusions Taken together, these results suggest that TM is a potent suppressor of head and neck tumor metastasis by modulating key regulators of <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> motility, <b>invasiveness</b> and anoikis resistance. </p...|$|R

40|$|Development of hypoxic regions is an {{indicator}} of poor prognosis in many tumors. Here, we demonstrate that HIF 1 alpha, the direct effector of hypoxia, partly through increases in SDF 1 alpha, induces recruitment of bone marrow-derived CD 45 + myeloid cells containing Tie 2 +, VEGFR 1 +, CD 11 b+, and F 4 / 80 + subpopulations, as well as endothelial and pericyte progenitor cells to promote neovascularization in glioblastoma. MMP- 9 activity of bone marrow-derived CD 45 + cells is essential and sufficient to initiate angiogenesis by increasing VEGF bioavailability. In the absence of HIF 1 alpha, SDF 1 alpha levels decrease, and fewer BM-derived cells are recruited to the tumors, decreasing MMP- 9 and mobilization of VEGF.

40|$|The {{multiple}} isoforms of the transmembrane glycoprotein CD 44 {{are produced}} by alternative RNA splicing. Expression of CD 44 isoforms containing variable 5 exon (v 5) correlates with enhanced malignancy and invasiveness of some tumors. Here we demonstrate that SRm 160, a splicing coactivator, regulates CD 44 alternative splicing in a Ras-dependent manner. Overexpression of SRm 160 stimulates inclusion of CD 44 v 5 when Ras is activated. Conversely, small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of SRm 160 significantly reduces v 5 inclusion. Immunoprecipitation shows association of SRm 160 with Sam 68, a protein that also stimulates v 5 inclusion in a Ras-dependent manner, suggesting that these two proteins interact to regulate CD 44 splicing. Importantly, siRNA-mediated depletion of CD 44 v 5 decreases tumor cell invasion.

40|$|In {{the tumor}} {{microenvironment}} hypoxia and nutrient deprived states can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. If ER stress is not relieved, the tumor cells may become apoptotic. Therefore, targeting ER homeostasis {{is a potential}} strategy for cancer treatment. Various chemotherapeutic agents including histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can induce ER stress to cause cell death in cancers. Some HDAC inhibitors can prevent HDAC from binding to the specificity protein 1 -binding site of the promoter of reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) and up-regulate RECK expression. Up-regulation of RECK expression by HDAC inhibitors has been observed in various cancer types. RECK is a tumor and metastasis suppressor gene and is critical for regulating <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> <b>invasiveness</b> and metastasis. RECK also modulates ER stress via binding to and sequestering glucose-regulated protein 78 protein, so that the transmembrane sensors, such as protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase are released to activate eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2 α phosphorylation and enhance ER stress.

HS, therefore, may {{also play a role}} in the malignant transformation of <b>cells,</b> <b>tumor</b> growth, <b>cell</b> <b>invasiveness</b> and the formation of tumor metastases. To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression of HS and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) in histological sections of human lung-cancer tissues and assayed for the presence of HSPGs in extracts of human lung-cancer cell lines, using a panel of native HS-, delta-HS- and HSPG (syndecan, glypican, CD 44 and perlecan) core protein-specific monoclonal antibodies. Compared to normal epithelia, non-small-cell lung carcinomas, particularly poorly differentiated tumors, often expressed reduced amounts of the major cell surface-associated HSPGs (most consistently of syndecan- 1). CD 44 or CD 44 -variant proteins, in contrast, were found on all <b>tumor</b> <b>cells,</b> irrespective of their differentiation. Perlecan, a matrix-associated HSPG found in the basement membrane of normal bronchial epithelium, was consistently undetectable in invasive bronchogenic carcinomas. Staining reactions for native HS were consistently reduced in squamous-cell lung carcinomas, in the cells in contact with the stroma and in the less differentiated areas of these tumors. Reactions for delta-HS, however, were not reduced, suggesting a structural change in the HS of these <b>tumor</b> <b>cells.</b> Poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, in contrast, yielded strong HS and delta-HS reactions. Marked differences in HSPG expression also were observed among various non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell lines.

We show here that FoxM 1 directly activates the transcription of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK 1) gene in U 2 OS osteosarcoma cells. Expression of JNK 1, which regulates the expression of genes important for the G 1 /S transition, rescues the G 1 /S but not the G 2 /M cell cycle block in FoxM 1 -deficient cells. Knockdown of either FoxM 1 or JNK 1 inhibits <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. However, expression of JNK 1 in FoxM 1 -depleted cells does not rescue these defects, indicating that JNK 1 is a necessary but insufficient downstream mediator of FoxM 1 in these processes. Consistent with this interpretation, FoxM 1 regulates the expression of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP- 2 and MMP- 9, which play a role in <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> invasion, through JNK 1 -independent and -dependent mechanisms in U 2 OS cells, respectively.

To identify biologically relevant genes with prognostic and therapeutic significance in PDAC, we first performed the microarray gene-expression profiling in 45 matching pairs of tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from resected PDAC cases. We identified 36 genes that were associated with patient outcome and also differentially expressed in tumors as compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues in microarray analysis. Further evaluation in an independent validation cohort (N =  27) confirmed that DPEP 1 (dipeptidase 1) expression was decreased (T: N ratio ∼ 0. 1, P< 0. 01) in tumors as compared with non-tumor tissues. DPEP 1 gene expression was negatively correlated with histological grade (Spearman correlation coefficient = − 0. 35, P =  0. 004). Lower expression of DPEP 1 in tumors was associated with poor survival (Kaplan Meier log rank) in both test cohort (P =  0. 035) and validation cohort (P =  0. 016). DPEP 1 expression was independently associated with cancer-specific mortality when adjusted for tumor stage and resection margin status in both univariate (hazard ratio =  0. 43, 95 %CI =  0. 24 – 0. 76, P =  0. 004) and multivariate analyses (hazard ratio =  0. 51, 95 %CI =  0. 27 – 0. 94, P =  0. 032). We further demonstrated that overexpression of DPEP 1 suppressed <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> <b>invasiveness</b> and increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agent Gemcitabine. Our data also showed that growth factor EGF treatment decreased DPEP 1 expression and MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor AZD 6244 increased DPEP 1 expression in vitro, indicating a potential mechanism for DPEP 1 gene regulation. Therefore, we provide evidence that DPEP 1 plays a role in pancreatic cancer aggressiveness and predicts outcome in patients with resected PDAC. In view of these findings, we propose that DPEP 1 may be a candidate target in PDAC for designing improved treatments...|$|R
40|$|The {{spread of}} tumor cells from primary sites often occurs as {{associated}} cell collectives. In {{this form of}} invasion, the contribution of cells leading the way may differ from those that follow. By implication, proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton, a major driver of cell motility, may have different roles depending on whether they are in leading or following cells. The LIM kinases 1 and 2 (LIMK) phosphorylate and inactivate the filamentous actin severing function of cofilin proteins. Using siRNA or pharmacological inhibitors, LIMK {{was found to be}} required in leading cells of collectively invading tumor cells, or in cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts, for effective extracellular matrix degradation that facilitates three-dimensional invasion. The decreased extracellular matrix degrading activities were associated with an inability to form the stable filamentous actin structures necessary to make matrix-degrading protrusive structures. However, LIMK was not required for cell motility or for path-following in associated collectives. These findings show that leading and following cells in collective invasion have different properties and indicate that targeting the activities in leading cells is sufficient to significantly inhibit <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> <b>invasiveness...</b>|$|E

To understand the dynamics of polyadenylation site usage, we performed transcriptome-wide mapping of both binding sites of 3 ′ end processing factors CPSF- 160, CPSF- 100, CPSF- 73, CPSF- 30, Fip 1, CstF- 64, CstF- 64 τ, CF Im 25, CF Im 59, and CF Im 68 and 3 ′ end processing sites in HEK 293 cells. We found that although binding sites of these factors generally cluster around the poly(A) sites most frequently used in cleavage, CstF- 64 /CstF- 64 τ and CFIm proteins have much higher positional specificity compared to CPSF components. Knockdown of CF Im 68 induced a systematic use of proximal polyadenylation sites, indicating that changes in relative abundance of a single 3 ′ end processing factor can modulate the length of 3 ′ untranslated regions across the transcriptome and suggesting a mechanism behind the previously observed increase in <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> <b>invasiveness</b> upon CF Im 68 knockdown...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ionizing {{radiation}} (IR) is {{a mainstay}} of cancer therapy, but irradiation can at times also lead to stress responses, which counteract IR-induced cytotoxicity. IR also triggers cellular secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor β and matrix metalloproteinases, among others, to promote tumor progression. Lysyl oxidase is known {{to play an important}} role in hypoxia-dependent cancer cell dissemination and metastasis. Here, we investigated the effects of IR on the expression and secretion of lysyl oxidase (LOX) from <b>tumor</b> <b>cells.</b> METHODS: LOX-secretion along with enzymatic activity was investigated in multiple <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> lines in response to irradiation. Transwell migration assays were performed to evaluate invasive capacity of naïve <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> in response to IR-induced LOX. In vivo studies for confirming IR-enhanced LOX were performed employing immunohistochemistry of tumor tissues and ex vivo analysis of murine blood serum derived from locally irradiated A 549 -derived tumor xenografts. RESULTS: LOX was secreted in a dose dependent way from several <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> lines in response to irradiation. IR did not increase LOX-transcription but induced LOX-secretion. LOX-secretion could not be prevented by the microtubule stabilizing agent patupilone. In contrast, hypoxia induced LOX-transcription, and interestingly, hypoxia-dependent LOX-secretion could be counteracted by patupilone. Conditioned media from irradiated <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> promoted <b>invasiveness</b> of naïve <b>tumor</b> <b>cells,</b> while conditioned media from irradiated, LOX- siRNA-silenced cells did not stimulate their invasive capacity. Locally applied irradiation to tumor xenografts also increased LOX-secretion in vivo and resulted in enhanced LOX-levels in the murine blood serum. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate a differential regulation of LOX-expression and secretion in response to IR and hypoxia, and suggest that LOX may contribute towards an IR-induced migratory phenotype in sublethally-irradiated <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> and <b>tumor</b> progression...|$|R

40|$|In {{patients}} with estrogen receptor (ER) -negative disease or ER+ hormone-resistant disease, the dominant influence on <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> growth is growth factors, e. g., {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF), heregulins, and insulin-like growth factors acting through specific receptor tyrosine kinases at the cell surface. This superfamily of ligand-activated growth factor receptors triggers cascades of biochemical signals that influence <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> motility, <b>invasiveness,</b> angiogenesis, and survival, as well as proliferation. In breast tumors, expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or erbB 2 is associated with poor prognosis; the therapeutic utility of blocking these receptors has been established using trastuzumab (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody that blocks erbB 2 signaling. An alternative therapeutic approach is offered by small molecule inhibitors of EGFR-TK, exemplified by ZD 1839 (Iressa), a potent and selective EGFR-TK inhibitor. Resistance to tamoxifen is associated with up-regulation of the EGFR-TK pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity is substantially increased in tamoxifen-resistant MCF- 7 cells. ZD 1839 treatment of tamoxifen-resistant MCF- 7 cells blocks mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Furthermore, treatment of wild-type MCF- 7 cells with tamoxifen and ZD 1839 prevents development of tamoxifen resistance. These data support the potential clinical utility of ZD 1839 in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer and suggest the possibility of preventing resistance by the early use of combination ZD 1839 with antiestrogenic agents such as tamoxifen or ICI 182, 780...|$|R
40|$|MT 1 -matrix {{metalloproteinase}} (MT 1 -MMP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} critical factors in the invasion machinery of tumor cells. Subcellular localization to invasive structures is key for MT 1 -MMP proinvasive activity. However, the mechanism driving this polarized distribution remains obscure. We now report that polarized exocytosis of MT 1 -MMP occurs during MDA-MB- 231 adenocarcinoma cell migration into collagen type I three-dimensional matrices. Polarized trafficking of MT 1 -MMP is triggered by β 1 integrin-mediated adhesion to collagen, and is required for protease localization at invasive structures. Localization of MT 1 -MMP within VSV-G/Rab 8 -positive vesicles, but not in Rab 11 /Tf/TfRc-positive compartment in invasive cells, suggests the involvement of the exocytic traffic pathway. Furthermore, constitutively active Rab 8 mutants induce MT 1 -MMP exocytic traffic, collagen degradation and invasion, whereas Rab 8 - but not Rab 11 -knockdown inhibited these processes. Altogether, these data reveal a novel pathway of MT 1 -MMP redistribution to invasive structures, exocytic vesicle trafficking, which is crucial for its role in <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> <b>invasiveness.</b> Mechanistically, MT 1 -MMP delivery to invasive structures, and therefore its proinvasive activity, is regulated by Rab 8 GTPase...|$|E

Commonly observed changes in glycan structures during malignancy encompass aberrant expression and glycosylation of mucins; abnormal branching of N-glycans; and increased presence of sialic acid on proteins and glycolipids. Accumulating evidence supports {{the notion that the}} presence of certain glycan structures correlates with cancer progression by affecting <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> <b>invasiveness,</b> ability to disseminate through the blood circulation and to metastasize in distant organs.

In this review we will discuss current concepts how tumor cell-derived glycans contribute to metastasis with the focus on three types of lectins: siglecs, galectins and selectins. Siglecs are present on virtually all hematopoietic cells and usually negatively regulate immune responses. Galectins are mostly expressed by tumor cells and support tumor cell survival. Selectins are vascular adhesion receptors that promote tumor cell dissemination. All lectins facilitate interactions within the tumor microenvironment and thereby promote cancer progression.

40|$|Rationale: Lung {{adenocarcinoma}} histology {{and clinical}} outcome are heterogeneous and associated with tumor invasiveness. Objectives: We hypothesized that invasiveness {{is associated with}} a distinct molecular signature and that genes differentially expressed in tumor or adjacent stroma will identify cell surface signal transduction and matrix remodeling pathways associated with the acquisition of invasiveness in lung adenocarcinoma. Main Results: Microarray analysis of microdissected noninvasive bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) and invasive adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma-mixed type with BAC features identified transcriptional profiles of lung adenocarcinoma invasiveness. Among the signature set that was lower in adenocarcinoma-mixed compared with BAC was the type II transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) receptor, suggesting downregulation of TGFβRII is an early event in lung adenocarcinoma metastasis. Immunostaining in independently acquired specimens demonstrated a correlation between TβRII expression and length of tumor invasion. Repression of TGFβRII in lung cancer cells increased <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> <b>invasiveness</b> and activated p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Microarray analysis of invasive cells identified potential downstream mediators of TGFβRII with differential expression in lung adenocarcinomas.

Secondary screening of these genes using custom microarray chips identified ASAP 1, a multi-domain adaptor protein with ADP-ribosylation factor-GAP activity, as being potentially involved in tumor progression. Here, we show that at least three different splice forms of ASAP 1 are upregulated in rodent tumor models in a manner that correlates with metastatic potential. In human cancers, we found that ASAP 1 expression is strongly upregulated in a variety of tumors in comparison with normal tissue and that this expression correlates with poor metastasis-free survival and prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Using loss and gain of function approaches, we were able to show that ASAP 1 promotes metastasis formation in vivo and stimulates <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> motility, <b>invasiveness,</b> and adhesiveness in vitro. Furthermore, we show that ASAP 1 interacts with the metastasis-promoting protein h-prune and stimulates its phosphodiesterase activity. In addition, ASAP 1 binds to the SH 3 domains of several proteins, including SLK with which it co-immunoprecipitates.

Although some TN breast cancers respond initially to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the majority of patients die within three years of treatment due to recurrent tumor growth. Developing ex vivo models for TN breast cancer recurrence and defining responsible molecules will be crucial to developing effective combination therapies for TN breast cancer patients. We have developed an in vitro model of TN breast cancer dormancy/recurrence. Short-term exposure of <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> to chemotherapy at clinically relevant doses enriches for a dormant <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> population. Several days after removing chemotherapy, dormant <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> regain proliferative ability and establish colonies, resembling <b>tumor</b> recurrence. <b>Tumor</b> <b>cells</b> from "recurrent" colonies exhibit increased chemotherapy resistance, resembling therapy resistance of recurrent tumors in patients. Furthermore, we identify a novel signaling axis [nuclear bFGF/DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) ] supported by chemotherapy-enriched dormant TN breast cancer cells. This signaling axis drives accelerated DNA repair in chemo-residual TN breast cancer cells. Targeting this axis with either with a bFGF shRNA or DNA-PK small molecule inhibitor blocks recurrent colony formation. Using the Oncomine gene expression database, we found that bFGF expression in tumor samples from TN breast cancer patients predicts five year tumor recurrence following neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Finally, we demonstrate that recurrent <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> exhibit increased <b>invasiveness,</b> reflecting the aggressive behavior of recurrent tumors in patients. Collectively, these studies identify a novel signaling axis in TN breast cancer that likely contributes to tumor recurrence and provide molecular targets for developing future therapeutics against TN breast cancer.

40|$|Metastatic disease {{accounts}} for more than 90 % of deaths from breast cancer. Yet the factors that trigger metastasis, often years after primary tumor removal, are not understood well. Recently the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin- (IL-) 17 family has been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. Here we review current literature on the pathogenic mechanisms driven by IL- 17 during breast cancer progression and connect these findings to metastasis. These include (1) direct effects of IL- 17 on <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> promoting <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> survival and <b>invasiveness,</b> (2) regulation of tumor angiogenesis, and (3) interaction with myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to inhibit antitumor immune response and collaborate at the distant metastatic site. Furthermore, IL- 17 might also be a culprit in bone destruction caused by late stage bone metastasis. Interestingly, in addition to these potential prometastasis functions, there is also evidence for an opposite, antitumor role of IL- 17 during cancer therapies. We hypothesize that these contradictory roles may be due to chronic, imbalanced versus acute transient nature of the immune reactions, as well as differences in the cells that interact with IL- 17 + cells under different circumstances...|$|R
40|$|Around a {{fifth of}} melanomas exhibit an {{activating}} mutation in the oncogene NRas that confers constitutive signaling to proliferation and promotes tumor initiation. NRas signals downstream of the major melanocyte tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit and activated NRas results in increased signaling via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) /MAPK/ERK kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways to enhance proliferation. The Ras oncogene also activates signaling via the related Rho GTPase Rac 1, which can mediate growth, survival, and motility signaling. We tested the effects of activated NRas(Q 61 K) on the proliferation, motility, and invasiveness of melanoblasts and melanocytes in the developing mouse and ex vivo explant culture {{as well as in}} a melanoma transplant model. We find an important role for Rac 1 downstream of NRas(Q 61 K) in mediating dermal melanocyte survival in vivo in mouse, but surprisingly NRas(Q 61 K) does not appear to affect melanoblast motility or proliferation during mouse embryogenesis. We also show that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of Rac 1 in NRas(Q 61 K) induced melanoma suppresses tumor growth, lymph node spread, and <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> <b>invasiveness,</b> suggesting a potential value for Rac 1 as a therapeutic target for activated NRas-driven tumor growth and invasiveness...|$|E
40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} often lethal when {{invasion}} and/or metastasis occur. Tumor progression to the metastatic phenotype is mainly dependent on <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> <b>invasiveness.</b> Secondary bile acids, particularly deoxycholic acid (DCA), are implicated in promoting colon cancer growth and progression. Whether DCA modulates β-catenin and promotes colon cancer cell growth and invasiveness remains unknown. Because β-catenin and its target genes urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and cyclin D 1 are overexpressed in colon cancers, and {{are linked to}} cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis, we investigated whether DCA activates β-catenin signaling and promotes colon cancer cell growth and invasiveness. Our results show that low concentrations of DCA (5 and 50 μM) significantly increase tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, induce urokinase-type plasminogen activator, uPAR, and cyclin D 1 expression and enhance colon cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. These events {{are associated with a}} substantial loss of E-cadherin binding to β-catenin. Inhibition of β-catenin with small interfering RNA significantly reduced DCA-induced uPAR and cyclin D 1 expression. Blocking uPAR with a neutralizing antibody significantly suppressed DCA-induced colon cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. These findings provide evidence for a novel mechanism underlying the oncogenic effects of secondary bile acids...|$|E
40|$|Using highly {{sensitive}} microarray-based procedures, we identified eight microRNAs (miRNAs) showing robust differential expression between 31 laser-capture-microdissected nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) and 10 normal healthy nasopharyngeal epithelial samples. In particular, miRNA mir- 29 c was expressed at one-fifth the levels in tumors as in normal epithelium. In NPC tumors, the lower mir- 29 c levels correlated {{with higher levels}} of multiple mRNAs whose 3 ′ UTRs can bind mir- 29 c at target sequences conserved across many vertebrates. In cultured cells, introduction of mir- 29 c down-regulated these genes at the level of mRNA and inhibited expression of luciferase encoded by vectors having the 3 ′ UTRs of these genes. Moreover, for each of several genes tested, mutating the mir- 29 c target sites in the 3 ′ UTR abrogated mir- 29 c-induced inhibition of luciferase expression. Most of the mir- 29 c-targeted genes identified encode extracellular matrix proteins, including multiple collagens and laminin γ 1, that are associated with <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> <b>invasiveness</b> and metastatic potential, prominent characteristics of NPC. Thus, we identify eight miRNAs differentially expressed in NPC and demonstrate the involvement of one in regulating genes involved in metastasis...|$|E
40|$|Crosstalk between <b>tumor</b> and stromal <b>cells</b> in the tumormicro-environment alter its {{properties}} {{in ways that}} facilitate the invasive behavior of <b>tumor</b> <b>cells.</b> Here, we demonstrate that cancer-asso-ciated fibroblasts (CAF) increase the stiffness of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and promote anisotropic fiber orientation, two mechanical signals generated through a Snail 1 /RhoA/aSMA– dependent mechanism that sustains oriented <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> migra-tion and <b>invasiveness.</b> Snail 1 -depleted CAF failed to acquire myofibroblastic traits in response to TGFb, including RhoA acti-vation, aSMA-positive stress fibers, increased fibronectin fibrillo-genesis, and production of a stiff ECMwith oriented fibers. Snail 1 expression in human tumor–derived CAF was associated with an ability to organize the ECM. In coculture, a relatively smaller number of Snail 1 -expressing CAF were capable of imposing an anisotropic ECM architecture, compared with nonactivated fibro-blasts. Pathologically, human breast cancers with Snail 1 þ CAF tended to exhibit desmoplastic areas with anisotropic fibers, lymph node involvement, and poorer outcomes. Snail 1 involve-ment in driving an ordered ECMwas further confirmed inwound-healing experiments inmice,with Snail 1 depletion preventing the anisotropic organization of granulation tissue and delaying wound healing. Overall, our results showed that inhibiting Snail 1 function in CAF could prevent tumor-driven ECM reorganization and cancer invasion. Cancer Res; 1 – 12. 2014 AACR...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{molecular}} targeted therapy in cancer {{may depend on}} the selection of appropriate tumor types whose survival depends on the drug target, so-called "oncogene addiction. " Preclinical approaches to defining drug-responsive subsets are needed if initial clinical trials are to be directed at the most susceptible patient population. Here, we show that gastric cancer cells with high-level stable chromosomal amplification of the growth factor receptor MET are extraordinarily susceptible to the selective inhibitor PHA- 665752. Although MET activation has primarily been linked with <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> migration and <b>invasiveness,</b> the amplified wild-type MET in these cells is constitutively activated, and its continued signaling is required for cell survival. Treatment with PHA- 665752 triggers massive apoptosis in 5 of 5 gastric cancer cell lines with MET amplification but in 0 of 12 without increased gene copy numbers (P = 0. 00016). MET amplification may thus identify a subset of epithelial cancers that are uniquely sensitive to disruption of this pathway and define a patient group that is appropriate for clinical trials of targeted therapy using MET inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has a dual and {{contradictory}} role in cancer. It is a tumor suppressor at {{early stages of}} tumor formation {{by virtue of its}} growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic functions. However, at later stages of <b>tumor</b> progression, <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> lose their sensitivity to be growth inhibited by this cytokine, and, then, TGF-β facilitates tumor invasion and metastasis by diverse mechanisms, including the induction of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, the suppression of the immune system and the stimulation of angiogenesis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have also been shown to play a pivotal function in <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> migration, invasion and angiogenesis. MMPs and TGF-β form an interplay loop that may attenuate or promote tumor progression. On one hand, latent TGF-β, an inactive TGF-β precursor that is sequestered by the extracellular matrix, is proteolytically activated by MMPs; the released active cytokine may, then, suppress or promote <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> growth and <b>invasiveness</b> depending on the tumor stage. On the other hand, TGF-β regulates the expression of MMPs and their tissue inhibitors TIMPs in both <b>tumor</b> and stromal <b>cells.</b> MMPs in the tumor microenvironment are involved in the control of <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> growth and survival by modulating the bioavailability of growth factors and chemokines, and they also influence inflammation and angiogenesis. Thus, by modulating the net balance of MMPs and TIMPs in both compartments: the tumor and stroma, TGF-β regulates malignant progression.
