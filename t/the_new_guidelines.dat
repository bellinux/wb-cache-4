PU is the third costly disorder with high mortality and morbidity. Thus reduction of PU incidence is very important and effective step for health systems.

This semi-experimental study was conducted on high-risk patients with a Norton scale score of 16, while they had daily care for PU prevention. Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups of intervention and control patients in each. The control group was assessed with routine care o PU prevention in the first three months of the study. Then the nurses were trained with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>guideline</b> and after that the data were collected again in the second three months period. The data were analyzed through the SPSS statistical software (version 13). results showed that <b>new</b> <b>guideline</b> training program was associated with decreased risk of PU.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Effective {{delivery}} of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and prompt defibrillation following sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is vital. Updated guidelines for adult basic life support (BLS) {{were published in}} 2010 by the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) {{in an effort to}} improve survival following SCA. There has been little assessment of the ability of rescuers to meet the standards outlined within these <b>new</b> <b>guidelines.</b> Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of the performance of first year healthcare students trained and assessed using either <b>the</b> <b>new</b> 2010 ERC <b>guidelines</b> or their 2005 predecessor, within the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom. All students were trained as lay rescuers during a standardised eight hour ERC-accredited adult BLS course. Results We analysed the examination records of 1091 students. Of these, 561 were trained and assessed using the old 2005 ERC guidelines and 530 using <b>the</b> <b>new</b> 2010 <b>guidelines.</b> A significantly greater proportion of candidates failed in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>guideline</b> group (16. 04 % vs. 11. 05 %; p[*] Conclusions <b>The</b> <b>new</b> ERC <b>guidelines</b> lead to a greater proportion of lay rescuers performing chest compressions at an erroneously fast rate and may therefore worsen BLS efficacy.
