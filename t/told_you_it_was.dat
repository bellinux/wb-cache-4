60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Gertrude, {{you have}} no right to use that word. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{question}} of rational compromise. It is no more than that.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Sure,' he answered--'just as I <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> Dave Duck, all right; {{most of us}} knew him. And now, you damned impostor, you'd better tell me who you are.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{noticed it}} myself. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{much the same}} shade as Miss Milliken's. It's rather {{fortunate}} that I happened {{to be here with}} you when he came." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, bother that thing!' she answered. 'I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{only one}} of his inventions, and I wish he would {{put it in his}} pocket.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that pleases me; I see you {{remember}} me." [...] He stepped {{to her and}} whispered: [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a Lucky Cat. Don't <b>be</b> troubled; <b>it</b> will provide." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He has <b>told</b> <b>you?</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> a wild purpose; but I {{doubt whether}} to dissuade him, except for your sake,' he added, {{with his first}} {{softening}} towards her, like balm to the sore spot in her heart.|$|R
6000|$|... [Holding up the Deed] Look! He's just gone! I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only {{necessary}} {{to use the}} threat. He caved in and signed this; we are sworn to say nothing. We've beaten him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{only the}} wind," [...] said Oliver Trembath, who {{had opened the}} shutter and gazed through the window for some time into the darkness, where, of course, he saw nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a buck, Macumazahn,' said Magepa. 'Still, if {{you smell}} danger, let us {{come away from}} the bush, though the orders are that no white man is to be touched as yet.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say {{nothing to}} your fellow sergeants of what I have <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> possible--although not probable--that my {{recommendation}} {{may not be}} acted upon and, at any rate, some months must elapse before an answer can be received." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, I {{do want to}} go, dreadfully," [...] said Bertha frankly. [...] "But as I've <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> impossible. But if I am disappointed, Aunt Meg musn't be. You must go, Grace, {{and that}} is all there is about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your papa, to be sure,' said Mistress Pauncefort, {{blushing}} {{up to her}} eyes, {{and looking}} very confused; 'that is to say, Miss Venetia, you are never {{to ask questions about}} such subjects. Have not I often <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not pretty?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so, señor. There was {{certainly}} a storm the day after it started, and, as I have <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> never heard of again. Had it been, a report of it would surely have come down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose the}} doctor <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> from my sister? She {{is coming to}} see me, and Miss Garth is coming to see me. They will {{thank you for all}} your {{goodness}} to me better than I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wish {{myself out}} of this!' breathed Havill to Dare, as he buttoned his coat over his white waistcoat. 'I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> true, but you wouldn't believe. I wouldn't she should catch me here {{eavesdropping}} for the world!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know <b>it</b> <b>is</b> so. He has <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not {{me that he}} loves; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you.</b> You are {{his chosen}} one. I am nothing to him,--nothing, nothing." [...] Then she flung herself down upon the bed which her own hands had {{prepared}} for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] he said, {{and pulled}} at his pipe. [...] "But you are wrong, Climene. I have practised no deception. If {{there are things}} about me that I have not <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that I did not account them of much importance. But I have never deceived you by pretending to be other than I am. I am neither more nor less than I have {{represented}} myself." ...|$|R
60|$|L. No; and therefore, as I <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not a {{characteristic}} specimen of a foliated crystallisation. The little triangles are portions of solid crystals, {{and so they}} are in this, which looks like a black mica; but <b>you</b> see <b>it</b> <b>is</b> made up of triangles like the gold, and stands, almost accurately, as an intermediate link, in crystals, between mica and gold. Yet this is the commonest, as gold the rarest, of metals.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, no," [...] {{replied the}} Duke; [...] "that is unlikely. They seldom carry these things about them, {{unless they were}} likely to be wanted; and, besides, her Majesty <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the King, not she, who was to grant it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> hopeless, Matt," [...] Scott {{said in a}} {{discouraged}} voice. [...] "I've {{thought about}} it off and on, while not wanting to think of it. But we've come to it now. It's {{the only thing to}} do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Didn’t I?” faltered Lola; “I thought I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a brown horse. It was {{certainly}} brown in both dreams. But I don’t {{see what the}} colour has {{got to do with}} it. Nursery Tea and Le Five O’Clock are both chestnuts.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will do. As I <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not {{strictly}} necessary {{that we should}} let it at all. We are not rich, but we have {{enough to go to}} Europe on. I have never been in Europe in my life, and never expected or wanted to go. But my niece there, Maria Spofford, has taken a fancy to go. Now, you know a young person like Maria can't go globetrotting alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, as to {{the matter}} on which we are here. Brenon <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{dangerous}} business for which you would be required?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, Mademoiselle," [...] he pursued, bending towards her. [...] "It {{is not for}} {{my health}} that I stay here, as I have <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> for the sight of you, {{for the sound of}} the music of that low voice. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> in the hope that you will be a little kinder, that you will {{understand}} me a little better. And to-day, when I learn that still another {{is on his way to}} see you, I could sit still no longer. I do not fear that Spence,--no. But this other--what is he like?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The verse before, you know, as I <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> part of {{an answer}} to such as lose their souls; {{so it is a}} vindication of the Scriptures of Moses and the prophets, 'They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> villafied and cockneyfied. There," [...] as {{the horses}} {{tried to stop}} at a lodge leading to a prettily built house, [...] "that's Timber End, the crack place here, where Bessie has always said it was her {{ambition}} to live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One other thing, sir," [...] I said hurriedly, for he {{was turning}} away, [...] "I {{hope that you will}} not be angry with your {{daughter}} for anything which I have <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> for my sake that she kept it all secret from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It must be {{important}} business which takes you East alone," [...] I said idly--to gain {{time in which}} to frame a more leading question; but the words had a somewhat startling effect. A trace of indignation or confusion became visible in the girl's face as she answered: [...] "I have already <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> business which cannot be neglected; and if you desire any further information I fear I cannot give <b>it</b> to <b>you.</b> Now, suppose we reverse the positions. What has made you so unusually inquisitive to-night, Mr. Ormesby?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "’Fair cop,’ ses Ginger, who {{was still}} rubbing his leg. ’I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be,</b> but there’s no need for Beauty to overdo it. He nearly ’ad a bit out o’ my leg.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Countess Radantz. If <b>you</b> remember, I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{her desire}} just now to remain incognito. I, however, {{unfortunately}} forgot this {{during the course}} of our conversation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] cried Jane, in triumph, [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{silly to}} send so far on so sudden an occasion; now, after all, {{what is to}} be done--it will be so awkward when Clara's friends call to see her--Oh! John, John, you are a Marplot." ...|$|E
6000|$|But he {{consented to}} raise his {{estimate}} to twenty; and a little after, the calculation coming out with a deficit, cut it down again to five pounds ten, with the remark, [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> nonsense. This sort of thing {{has to be done}} strictly, or where's the use?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{a foolish}} fancy, but {{you asked for}} it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and then I have {{imagined}} them {{the footsteps of the}} people who are to come into my life, and my father's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] replies the critic; [...] "I want {{no other}} light and shade. I have already <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> my {{business}} {{to see things}} just as they are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> false," [...] {{he replied}} furiously. [...] "I {{had nothing to}} do with your capture. I knew nothing of it till I saw you here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I beg {{you will}} not allude to that subject again. When I have {{distinctly}} <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> annoying--that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> painful to me, {{you should have a}} little more consideration." ...|$|R
