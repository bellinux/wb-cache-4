5|$|Around 1781, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> {{been the}} base for one of Manchester's eight fire engines.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> a {{significant}} choral history, with significant events often celebrated {{with a full}} choir, sometimes accompanied by an orchestra. In the late 19thcentury the St John's choir participated in regional choir festivals.|$|E
5|$|A holding company, {{known as}} the Ashland Junior College Corporation, formed {{by the board of}} {{education}} in 1937, purchased the First M.E. Church's vacated property on the corner of 15th Street and Central Avenue for $39,000 in downtown Ashland. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> bought the property for $163,000 in 1925, before the Great Depression of 1929.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> is of dressed {{magnesian}} limestone with a slate roof. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a cruciform layout with a crossing {{tower and}} broach spire. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a buttressed three-bay north nave with south aisles. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a gabled porch to its south side.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Church</b> {{is founded}} on 5 June 2005 Hyderabad by Dr. P. Satish Kumar with 25 people. Hundreds of people are added and in 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>has</b> 1,000.

5000|$|Although largely rebuilt in 1873 <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> some {{late medieval}} fabric. It is built of Sandstone ashlar with a slate roof. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a west tower built {{in three stages}} with {{diagonal}} buttresses, a clockface on its southside and belfty windows of two cusped lights. [...] <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a lychgate dating from 1889.|$|R
5|$|Before this <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> {{maintained}} {{a distance from}} the Armenian revolutionary groups as the latter saw the former as a conservative institution. It was Khrimian who welcomed revolutionary activism, especially by the Dashnaktsutyun, the most influential Armenian party. According to Panossian, Khrimian thus radicalised, to a certain degree, the Armenian Church and as such secularised in its vision of the Armenian nation.|$|E
5|$|By the 13th century, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> a stone-built nave and chancel; {{the latter}} survives {{in the present}} building, as does a 12th-century font which was {{probably}} taken from the building in place at that time. A chancel arch was inserted between the nave and chancel in about 1300. The dedication to Saint Margaret is later: it was first recorded in 1489.|$|E
5|$|In the 1989 form nominating {{it for the}} National Register of Historic Places, it {{was noted}} that <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> {{undergone}} only minor alterations, including an interior redecoration in 1964, the replacement of roof slates with asphalt shingles in 1977, and the addition of a concrete ramp for access by the handicapped in 1986.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Central Baptist <b>Church,</b> one of <b>the</b> oldest <b>churches</b> in Delhi, is a {{fine example}} of European {{architecture}} of that time. The southern side entrance of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a large deep colonnaded porch supported on thick heavy circular columns. Likewise the other two sides have double height verandahs with semi-circular arched openings. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> been well maintained with its original motifs and carvings. However, the roof of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> been re-laid with stones and iron beams. The walls of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>have</b> memorial tablets remembering the faithful who devoted their whole life in service of <b>the</b> <b>church.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a {{circular}} shape with large glass windows around the facade. The seating is in a semi-circular shape around <b>the</b> altar. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> been heritage-listed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> come a {{long way}} since its early days with several {{extensions}} and additions to its structure. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> now <b>has</b> three spacious wings, and a residence for the parish priest. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a single bell tower, which is rung to summon the people for prayer.|$|R
5|$|Maeser's primary {{responsibility}} was {{to head the}} Utah exhibit at the Mid-winter Fair in San Francisco in 1894, while he was serving as Superintendent of Church Schools. The exposition was patterned after Chicago World's Fair of 1893. At the Chicago exhibit, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> displayed minerals and produce from Utah. In the San Francisco exhibit, Maeser chose {{to focus more on}} beliefs of the church and educational accomplishments of students in the church school systems. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> an exhibit in the Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building, and Maeser gave a series of lectures to bring more publicity to the church school exhibit. Utah's participation in the exhibit attempted to gain favor for its becoming a state. He and his companions helped distribute information about the history of Utah. No one was baptized into the church while Maeser was president of the mission; however, he did help create friendlier public-relations between Utah and California.|$|E
5|$|The church, {{without an}} apse and a transept, {{maintained}} its original single-nave plan {{until at least}} 1627. In 1662 the naves had become three, separated by two rows of square brick pillars and surmounted by vaults. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> five altars in 1627, increasing to six in 1649. In 1726 the closing of its side gate along the Borgo Vecchio made room for another altar.|$|E
5|$|Within {{two years}} the Boston {{membership}} had exceeded the original church's capacity. By 1903 the block around <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> been purchased by Christian Scientists, and in 1906 the Mother Church Extension, accommodating 5,000 people, was completed {{at a cost of}} $2 million. This attracted the criticism that, whereas Christian Scientists spent money on a magnificent church, they maintained no hospitals, orphanages or missions in the slums.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> {{a central}} cupola that is {{surrounded}} by four smaller cupolas and a large bell-tower. During {{the last few years}} <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> been renovated and iconostasis re-installed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a two manual {{pipe organ}} {{on the left}} side of <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> <b>The</b> <b>church</b> also <b>has</b> two towers.|$|R
50|$|Internationally, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> {{partnered with}} Mission of Mercy in the {{sponsorship}} of several hundred children in Haiti. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> sponsored <b>the</b> digging of water wells in underdeveloped countries.|$|R
5|$|By some accounts, Smith {{had been}} {{teaching}} a polygamy doctrine {{as early as}} 1831, and there is unconfirmed evidence that Smith was a polygamist by 1835. Although <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> publicly repudiated polygamy, in 1837 there was a rift between Smith and Oliver Cowdery over the issue. Cowdery suspected Smith had engaged {{in a relationship with}} his serving girl, Fanny Alger. Smith never denied a relationship, but insisted it was not adulterous, presumably because he had taken Alger as a plural wife.|$|E
5|$|By {{the latter}} part of the 16th-century Reformation, <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>had</b> grown less {{tolerant}} of mystery plays. A performance in Chester in 1575 is the last recorded from the city until the 20th century, when the Chester cycle was revived under the supervision of Christopher Ede, as part of the city's Festival of Britain celebrations in June 1951. This production was received enthusiastically, and was repeated the following year; thereafter it became a regular feature and tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the twentieth century <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> little to show from its earlier history, or indeed of its former wealth, beyond the great size of the church. The church was {{relatively}} plainly decorated – see below – and had nothing by way of old fittings, plate or vestments. Amongst its liturgical plate were a chalice of 1788, an alms plate of 1839, a set of chalice, paten and flagon of 1841, and a silver mounted glass cruet of 1909.|$|E
50|$|St Mary's {{acoustics}} {{are fine}} and <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> {{been used as}} a concert venue, rehearsal space and recording space. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> frequently featured in the BBC soap opera Doctors.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> is of a gothic revival style, {{built of}} coursed stone with ashlar dressings. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a steeply pitched slate roof with gable ends. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a four-bay nave with {{octagonal}} piers. The reredos is made 1891 of Burmantofts faience and coloured tiles. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a terracotta memorial below west window which commemorates James Holroyd (1839-1890), {{the founder of}} the Burmantofts Faience Works, erected 'by his employees'.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{parts are}} of rubble stone. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> tall perpendicular windows {{with the exception}} of the chancel which has two Norman windows. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a Georgian oak pulpit. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a Norman doorway to its north although it's doubtful it is in its original position. Outside <b>the</b> <b>church</b> is a memorial in memory of the navvies who died building the nearby Bramhope Tunnel between 1845 and 1849.|$|R
5|$|During the regency, he and {{his mother}} {{abolished}} the Va'a Tai 'Aru, the law, enacted by his father, which had made crimes such as murder, treason and adultery punishable by death. Instead, criminals were exiled to small island of Îles Maria. Teuruarii and his mother also presided over the opening of the Protestant church of Moerai. The construction of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> been begun by his father and the work was completed by a foreign carpenter named Quittaine Chapman.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the fabric of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> also deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} serious remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|Educated in Tiflis and Rome, Agagianian first {{served as}} leader of the Armenian Catholic {{community}} of Tiflis before the Bolshevik takeover of the Caucasus in 1921. He then moved to Rome, where he first taught and then headed the Pontifical Armenian College until 1937 when he was elected to lead the Armenian Catholic Church, which he revitalized after major losses <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> experienced during the Armenian Genocide.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> 350 congregations and 500 ordained ministers. Member of World Evangelical Congregational Fellowship. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> two Seminaries {{called the}} Congregational Seminary in Rio de Janeiro and the Northeastern Congregational Seminary.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> is bounded {{on three}} sides by land owned by the National Trust: a farm, common meadow and dense woodland. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a vestry housing robes for choir and clergy. <b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> a {{maintained}} graveyard surrounding.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> {{a double}} nave and twin {{parallel}} roofs. The south nave {{may be the}} oldest part of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> and dates to the fifteenth century. The interior of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> original plaster-panelled roofs with moulded timber ribs throughout the building.|$|R
5|$|In 1827, {{the church}} erected a {{building}} dedicated as a Sunday school. This {{was also used}} as a day school from 1838. In 1906, around 250 children attended the Sunday school and <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> numerous affiliated groups, such as a Penny Bank and a Choral Society. The day school accommodation {{was at that time}} condemned by the Board of Education as unfit for purpose and it was operating under a stay issued by the board. In the same year, Hannah Mitchell, a suffragette, was arrested at the day school for protesting during an election campaign speech by Winston Churchill. The building was closed in 1908 and a new school building opened on Gartside Street in 1910 at a cost of £4000. This new facility was used only as Sunday school because, said the local clergy, the Board of Education put too many administrative obstacles and demands in their way, such as stipulating such a small attendance roll as to render any day school uneconomic and insisting on a dedicated playground despite there being a large open space next door that was traditionally used for that purpose. According to the foundation stone of the new school building, <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> operated the first Sunday school in Manchester, although Shaw attributes that distinction to a Mr Fildes, a Methodist whose establishment began operating from a Travis Street cellar in 1782. Shaw says that several other schools preceded that of St John's.|$|E
5|$|In April 1990, he {{arranged}} {{for several hundred}} Asháninka to make a five-day trek from the central highlands into the mountains of Peru at Tzibokiroato. During this time period, he was recalled by his religious superiors to Lima, where they questioned his arming the Asháninka, because of {{the view that the}} Catholic Church should not use violence. Gagnon responded that <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>had</b> resorted to the use of violence in the past, and should not be hypocritical.|$|E
5|$|In January 1939 John and Frances Baxter, {{a brother}} and sister who had befriended Jack and Helen Parsons, took Jack to the Church of Thelema in Winona Boulevard, Hollywood, where he {{witnessed}} the performance of The Gnostic Mass. Celebrants of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>had</b> included Hollywood actor John Carradine and gay rights activist Harry Hay. Parsons was intrigued, having already heard of Thelema's founder and Outer Head of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), Aleister Crowley, after reading a copy of Crowley's text Konx om Pax (1907).|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{facade of}} <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> been modified {{after a series}} of renovations. The original altar of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>has</b> been moved backward to allow a larger area for the faithful inside <b>the</b> <b>church</b> building. <b>The</b> original sacristy has been moved to the side.|$|R
2500|$|The {{teachings of}} <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>have</b> {{also been used}} to [...] "establish {{the status of women}} under the law". There has been some debate as to whether <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>has</b> {{improved}} <b>the</b> status of women or hindered their progress.|$|R
