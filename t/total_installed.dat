5|$|The {{wind power}} {{industry}} set new records in 2014 – more than 50 GW of new capacity was installed. Another record breaking year occurred in 2015, with 22% annual market growth {{resulting in the}} 60 GW mark being passed. In 2015, close to half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets in Europe and North America. This was largely from new construction in China and India. Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) figures show that 2015 recorded an increase of installed capacity of more than 63 GW, taking the <b>total</b> <b>installed</b> wind energy capacity to 432.9 GW, up from 74 GW in 2006.

5|$|Worldwide use {{of solar}} power and wind power {{continued}} to grow significantly in 2012. Solar electricity consumption increased by 58 percent, to 93 terawatt-hours (TWh). Use of wind power in 2012 increased by 18.1 percent, to 521.3 TWh. Global solar and wind energy installed capacities continued to expand even though new investments in these technologies declined during 2012. Worldwide investment in solar power in 2012 was $140.4billion, an 11 percent decline from 2011, and wind power investment was down 10.1 percent, to $80.3billion. But due to lower production costs for both technologies, <b>total</b> <b>installed</b> capacities grew sharply. This investment decline, but growth in installed capacity, may again occur in 2013. Analysts expect the market to triple by 2030. In 2015, investment in renewables exceeded fossils.|$|E
