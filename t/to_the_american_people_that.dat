George W.

[...] Debra L. Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, also condemned the decision, saying, “If employers can keep the discrimination hidden {{for a period of}} time, they can continue to discriminate without being held accountable.” On the other side, the majority's findings were applauded by the US Chamber of Commerce, that called it a [...] "fair decision" [...] that [...] "eliminates a potential wind-fall against employers by employees trying to dredge up stale pay claims." ...|$|E
