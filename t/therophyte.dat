50|$|The most {{important}} distinction is their growth pattern, lacking a lateral meristem (cambium) {{that allows for}} continual growth in diameter with height (secondary growth), and therefore this characteristic is a basic limitation in shoot construction. Although largely herbaceous, some arboraceous monocots reach great height, length and mass. The latter include agaves, palms, pandans, and bamboos. This creates challenges in water transport that monocots deal with in various ways. Some, such as species of Yucca, develop anomalous secondary growth, while palm trees utilise an anomalous primary growth form described as establishment growth (see Vascular system). The axis undergoes primary thickening, that progresses from internode to internode, resulting in a typical inverted conical shape of the basal primary axis (see Tillich, Figure 1). The limited conductivity also contributes to limited branching of the stems. Despite these limitations {{a wide variety of}} adaptive growth forms has resulted (Tillich, Figure 2) from epiphytic orchids (Asparagales) and bromeliads (Poales) to submarine Alismatales (including the reduced Lemnoideae) and mycotrophic Burmanniaceae (Dioscreales) and Triuridaceae (Pandanales). Other forms of adaptation include the climbing vines of Araceae (Alismatales) which use negative phototropism (skototropism) to locate host trees (i.e. the darkest area), while some palms such as Calamus manan (Arecales) produce the longest shoots in the plant kingdom, up to 185 m long. Other monocots, particularly Poales, have adopted a <b>therophyte</b> life form.|$|E
40|$|Drift {{and soil}} erosion, are now also {{promoted}} for their positive, ecological impact on floral diversity. We ask: i) {{whether there are}} traits or combinations of traits that allow weed species to persist in sown grass strips; and, ii) how does duration of sown grass strips affect weed community composition? We hypothesized that <b>therophyte</b> annual and small weed species will dominate the community in newly sown grass strips (5 years old). Floral surveys were performed in 75 sown grass-margin strips in France and each strip was surveyed twice. Weed species were summarized with trait databases into functional groups using Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Hierarchical Ascendant Classification. Functional group trajectories were investigated in sown grass-margin strips that differed in age using a space-for-time substitution. We found that geophyte, competitor and monocotyledon species were more frequent and abundant than <b>therophyte,</b> ruderal and dicotyledon species. Trait combinations found in most functional groups appeared to be tolerant of strip management; however, one functional group consisting of <b>therophyte,</b> ruderals with a continuous reproduction period declined in importance with age of sown grass-margin strips. Our findings have implications for non-crop vegetation management for optimizing diversity and ecosystem services in land enrolled in conservation programs. Specifically, we propose that management should change towards regimes with mowing {{later in the season}} and soil scarification by tine harrows if floral diversity is a goal...|$|E

The floristic and vegetation biological spectra of four study sites (Jaisalmer, Ajmer, Sariska and Mt. Abu) were compared. Analysis of life form spectra revealed the most striking feature of higher differentiation in proportions of <b>therophytes</b> along climatic gradient using vegetation spectrum. The proportion of <b>therophytes</b> and phanerophytes are highly variable across the sites indicate influence of climate. Biological spectrum of the four study sites has been compared with Raunkiaer’s normal spectrum to know the phytoclimate of that region. Jaisalmer, Ajmer and Sariska represents tropical arid climate, while Mt. Abu of tropical moist climate. The present study recommended to use vegetation biological spectrum because of proper representation of life forms of a given area.

40|$|AbstractThe Hantam-Tanqua-Roggeveld subregion is {{situated}} {{in an area where}} the Fynbos, Succulent Karoo and Nama Karoo biomes meet. Life form spectra were compiled at a species richness and vegetation cover level {{in order to determine the}} affinities of the vegetation of the subregion with respect to its Succulent Karoo, Fynbos and Nama Karoo Biome status. A percentage succulence was also calculated for both species richness and cover. Comparisons of life form spectra and succulence were made across the eight vegetation associations found in the area and across three broad vegetation groups, i. e., Mountain Renosterveld, Winter Rainfall Karoo and Tanqua Karoo. Mountain Renosterveld vegetation was characterised by high chamaephyte, cryptophyte and <b>therophyte</b> species contributions. Compared to the other broad vegetation groups, the Mountain Renosterveld group showed phanerophyte contributions at the vegetation cover level to be highest, but the degree of succulence was low. Winter Rainfall Karoo vegetation was co-dominated by high levels of chamaephyte, cryptophyte and <b>therophyte</b> species with chamaephytes dominating the vegetation cover. Succulent contributions to species richness and cover values were higher than for Mountain Renosterveld vegetation. Tanqua Karoo vegetation was dominated by chamaephyte species or co-dominated by chamaephyte and cryptophyte species with <b>therophyte</b> species contributions lowest of all vegetation groups. Contributions by succulent species to richness and vegetation cover were high in the Tanqua Karoo. Life form spectra of the Mountain Renosterveld associations compared poorly to other sites in the Fynbos Biome. However, the low level of succulence in the Mountain Renosterveld associations also precludes its inclusion into the Succulent Karoo Biome. The large contribution of succulent species at a species and vegetation cover level in Winter Rainfall Karoo and Tanqua Karoo associations confirms that these two groups belong to the Succulent Karoo Biome. Affinities to the Nama Karoo Biome were indicated by the low level of succulence at a vegetation cover level in one of the Winter Rainfall Karoo associations (Roggeveld Karoo) ...|$|E

Species composition and numbers of individuals in the <b>therophytes</b> and geophytes offering flowers varied greatly according to the pattern and amount of seasonal precipitation. Despite these variations a consistent flowering sequence between the years was observed. Possible relations between the flowering phenology and the climatic variables are discussed in detail. The present data suggest that the onset of flowering is determined indirectly by the first drop in temperature in autumn, indicating the beginning of the rainy season and presumably the start of the growing period, and/or by the increase of temperatures in the beginning of spring. The pattern and amount of rainfall within a given season mainly influenced the duration of anthesis and the number of flowers produced. </p...|$|R
40|$|Six inselbergs of Benin {{have been}} studied in four localities. This study {{presents}} the results of 123 phytosociological "relevés". A total number of 285 plant species have been gathered belonging to 77 families, of which Poaceae (34 species) and Fabaceae (32 species) are the most representative. The 285 plant species identified have been classified in seven groups according to the vegetation types. The analysis of life-form spectra has revealed the abundance of <b>therophytes</b> (38. 2 % and 36. 5 %) and phanerophytes (39. 7 % and 37. 2 %). The grasslands are dominated by annual species. The number of <b>therophytes</b> increases from south to north; this could be due to decrease of average annual precipitation. The phytogeographical spectrum of species have revealed the abundance of sudano-zambezian elements (21. 4 % and 23. 9 %) and African pluriregional elements (21. 4 % and 21. 6 %). No endemic species have been noted among the 285 species. The two phanerophytes most frequently encountered and restricted to the inselbergs are Hymenodictyon floribundum and Ficus abutilifolia. The most characteristical species of dry grasslands is Afrotrilepis pilosa. Inselberg vegetation is characterized by its homogeneousness due to harsh environmental conditions.
