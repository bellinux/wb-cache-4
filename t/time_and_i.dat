5|$|I {{spend my}} time out in the open, on the shingle beach {{when the weather is}} bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the {{countryside}} which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work all the <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> believe that this year I am going to do some serious things.|$|E
25|$|We {{leave in}} 10 days for Brick House, Noroton, Connecticut right on Long Island Sound where the yacht will be within hailing {{distance}} all the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> expect {{we shall be}} on the water as much as on land this summer.|$|E
25|$|I had to gain {{them some}} <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{could think of}} nothing other than to attack. I had to stop them somehow. I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't going to make it back.|$|E
60|$|Such a sight as {{this have}} I seen many a hundred <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{hope to see}} it again before I die.|$|R

25|$|The fairest {{solution}} would be to replay the game {{but it is not}} in my control...Naturally I feel embarrassed at the way that we won and feel extremely sorry for the Irish who definitely deserve to be in South Africa...I have said at the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will say again that 'yes' I handled the ball. I am not a cheat and never have been. It was an instinctive reaction to a ball that was coming extremely fast in a crowded penalty area....As a footballer you do not have the luxury of the television to slow the pace of the ball down 100 times {{to be able to make}} a conscious decision...People are viewing a slow motion version of what happened and not what I or any other footballer faces in the game. If people look at it in full speed you will see that it was an instinctive reaction.|$|E
500|$|Some {{items on}} the {{original}} BDI {{had more than one}} statement marked with the same score. For instance, there are two responses under the Mood heading that score a 2: (2a) [...] "I am blue or sad all the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't snap out of it" [...] and (2b) [...] "I am so sad or unhappy that it is very painful".|$|E
500|$|Three {{members of}} the cast {{had never been in}} a film before: Ed Sanders was cast as Toby, Jayne Wisener as Johanna, and Jamie Campbell Bower, who auditioned, and after four days got the part of Anthony said [...] "I think I weed myself. I was out {{shopping}} at the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> got this call on my mobile. I was just like, 'OH MY GOD!' Honestly, I was like a little girl running around this shop like oh-my-god-oh-my-god-oh-my-god." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1973, Cashman and West {{produced}} Croce's Life <b>and</b> <b>Times</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> Got A Name albums. They received five gold {{records for}} their work on Jim Croce’s hits - #1 singles [...] "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown" [...] and [...] "Time in a Bottle," [...] and three albums (You Don’t Mess Around With Jim, Life <b>and</b> <b>Times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> Got A Name), all three now which have reached platinum status. Croce and Muehleisen perished in a small plane crash in Natchitoches, Louisiana on September 20, 1973.|$|R

500|$|The {{former vice}} {{president}} opens the film by greeting an audience with his well-known line about his campaign in 2000: [...] "I am Al Gore; I {{used to be the}} next President of the United States." [...] He is shown using his laptop to edit his presentation, and pondering the difficulty he has had in awakening public concern: [...] "I've been trying to tell this story for a long <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feel as if I've failed to get the message across." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite its poor {{performance}} at the American box office, Labyrinth was a success on home video and later on DVD. David Bowie told an interviewer in 1992, [...] "every Christmas a new flock of children comes {{up to me and}} says, 'Oh! you're the one who's in Labyrinth!" [...] In 1997, Jennifer Connelly said [...] "I still get recognized for Labyrinth by little girls in the weirdest places. I can't believe they still recognize me from that movie. It's on TV all the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> guess I pretty much look the same." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{fulfilled}} {{his creative}} ambition with Instant Vintage, he sought a looser direction for a follow-up studio album. He {{said of the}} direction for Ray Ray in an interview for Rolling Stone, [...] "You only get to make a first statement one <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had definite ideas of how I wanted it to sound. Ray Ray represents a more fun side of what I do. I {{wanted to have a}} good time with it." [...] In an interview for The Baltimore Sun, Saadiq discussed the inspiration behind the album's blaxploitation concept: ...|$|E
5000|$|... … even long {{normal tissues}} {{differed}} markedly among themselves in NMR relaxation <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wondered whether {{there might be}} some way to noninvasively map out such quantities within the body.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} it will put you out, Isobel; {{but they have}} been here {{for the last two years}} at the race <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> did not like not asking them again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} {{ask myself}} whether she has repented. I made her swear that she'd never give me up. She might have broken her word {{a score of}} <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wish she had." ...|$|R
500|$|Turner {{himself had}} this to say of the album, fully {{cognizant}} that it would be the band's last: [...] "I don't know if looking back many years from now if Wavering Radiant will be my favorite Isis record or not, but I certainly feel like it's the best record we were capable of making at the <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> also feel like we didn't compromise in any really significant way the spirit or ideology behind the band in making it. And sonically speaking, I think it sounds really good, so that makes me happy, too." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story for}} Halo 2 {{grew out of}} all the {{elements}} that were not seen in Halo: Combat Evolved. Jason Jones organized his core ideas for the sequel's story and approached Staten for input. According to Staten, among the elements that did not make it to the finished game was a [...] "horrible scene of betrayal" [...] where Miranda Keyes straps a bomb to the Master Chief's back and throws him into a hole; [...] "Jason was going through a rather difficult breakup at the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think that {{had something to do with}} it," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Jimmy Duncan, who was {{coaching}} New Zealand {{after retiring}} as a player, {{said before the}} historic match: [...] "I have given them directions. It's man for man all the <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have bet Gallaher a new hat that he can't catch [...] Bush. Bush has never been collared in Australia but he'll get it today." [...] The match was tied 3–3 at half-time, but New Zealand were the stronger side {{in the second half}} and eventually won 9–3. Gallaher was praised by press for his all-round display at wing-forward, but in particular for his successful harassment of the British Isles' half-back Tommy Vile.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} wiser {{if you were}} to, I think. You have played the part of mentor to me many <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't see why you should fear to do it now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you be so}} {{sure about}} that!" [...] cried a third. [...] "I've seen Jack Harrison fight five <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never yet saw him have the worse of it. He's a slaughterer, <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> tell you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Ladies <b>and</b> gentlemen - <b>I</b> {{fear that}} what I {{am going to}} say will spoil your appetites; {{but the truth is}} {{beautiful}} at all <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have to state that Mrs. Lovett's pies are made of human flesh!" ...|$|R
500|$|... "We were noodling {{around and}} 'Crazy for You' was {{something}} that Jon was singing over that section of the song. It was really descriptive of {{the scene in the}} film. [...] After that, I was out on vacation out in the desert and [...] called and said Phil Ramone was in love with the song and wanted to cut it on Madonna. [...] 'Borderline' was out at that <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said, 'Excuse me? This is for Madonna? Really? Can she sing a song like this?' Jon and I were surprised at the choice of artist at the time, {{if you want to know}} the truth." ...|$|E
500|$|Desi Arnaz, Jr. voiced {{his support}} of the film, stating {{that he and his}} sister Lucie Arnaz, [...] "loved the story being told in this movie." [...] Arnaz, Jr. said, [...] "It is an amazing saga of people in search of the American dream. It is my father`s story. It is the story of many people who came to this country with hopes and dreams." [...] Tito Puente praised the film prior to its {{theatrical}} release, stating, [...] "I've seen the movie twice, and I loved it the second time. The first time I couldn't get into it. I was watching for too many details, I guess. But now I've seen it a second <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think it's great." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1996, Madonna {{travelled}} to Buenos Aires {{to research}} Eva's life, {{and met with}} several people who had known her before her death. During filming, she fell sick many times due to the intense emotional effort required, and midway through production, she discovered she was pregnant. Her daughter Lourdes was born on October 14, 1996. Madonna published a diary of the film shoot in Vanity Fair. She said of the experience, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same <b>time...</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} did--not once, {{but half}} a dozen <b>times.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> gave him all the money I could scrape up. In fact, I even borrowed some money from Halliday {{and a couple of}} the other fellows." ...|$|R
3000|$|Interviewee 6 : “Ah, if I read a book, I have to {{read the}} same page two or three <b>times.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> cannot stand sitting like this. It’s getting {{difficult}} to stay here, like this, listening...” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and we can}} try {{our hands}} at some cookies," [...] added Fred. [...] "I've watched our cook make them quite a few <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think I could make some myself if I tried real hard." ...|$|R
500|$|Kistiakowsky was {{initially}} reluctant to come, [...] "partly because", he later explained, [...] "I didn't think the bomb {{would be ready}} in <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was interested in helping to win the war". At Los Alamos, he began reorganizing the implosion effort. He introduced techniques such as photography and X-Rays to study the behavior of shaped charges. The former had been extensively employed by the ERL, while the latter had been described in papers by Tuck, who also suggested using three-dimensional explosive lenses. As with {{other aspects of the}} Manhattan Project, research into explosive lenses followed multiple lines of inquiry simultaneously because, as Kistiakowsky noted, it was [...] "impossible to predict which of these basic techniques will be the more successful." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1930 Richardson, {{with some}} misgivings, {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} join The Old Vic company. The theatre, in an unfashionable location south of the Thames, had offered inexpensive tickets for opera and drama under its proprietor Lilian Baylis since 1912. Its profile had been raised considerably by Baylis's producer, Harcourt Williams, who in 1929 persuaded the young West End star John Gielgud to lead the drama company. For the following season Williams wanted Richardson to join, {{with a view to}} succeeding Gielgud from 1931 to 1932. Richardson agreed, though he was not sure of his own suitability for a mainly Shakespearean repertoire, and was not enthusiastic about working with Gielgud: [...] "I found his clothes extravagant, I found his conversation flippant. He was the New Young Man of his <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't like him." ...|$|E
500|$|By autumn 1974, Drake's weekly {{retainer}} from Island had ceased, and {{his illness}} meant {{he remained in}} contact {{with only a few}} close friends. He had tried {{to stay in touch with}} Sophia Ryde, whom he had first met in London in 1968. Ryde has been described by Drake's biographers as [...] "the nearest thing" [...] to a girlfriend in his life, but she now prefers the description [...] "best (girl) friend". In a 2005 interview, Ryde revealed that a week before he died, she had sought to end the relationship: [...] "I couldn't cope with it. I asked him for some <b>time.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> never saw him again." [...] As with the relationship he had earlier shared with fellow folk musician Linda Thompson, Drake's relationship with Ryde was never consummated.|$|E
50|$|This song {{became a}} staple in Supertramp concerts after its release. The song's length is {{extended}} live often reaching over seven minutes. It appears on Paris, Live '88, It Was the Best of <b>Times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Is</b> Everybody Listening?.|$|R
