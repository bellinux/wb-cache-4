Spills may be cleaned by sprinkling cat litter, sand or other absorbent material directly on <b>the</b> <b>spill.</b> Once fully absorbed, while wearing protective gloves, the material may be scooped {{into a plastic}} bag, sealed and disposed. <b>The</b> <b>spill</b> area may be scrubbed with a stiff brush and warm, soapy water. The soapy water is not recommended to be drained in a storm drain.|$|E
5|$|Scientists from {{multiple}} disciplines at the University of California, Santa Barbara and elsewhere began collaborating immediately after <b>the</b> <b>spill.</b> Based on {{lessons learned from}} studies of earlier spills, and using refined computer models, they predicted <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> spread and dispersion, including impacts on Los Angeles area beaches. They used his information to provide guidance to cleanup agencies and to monitor the effects on the ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|The Exxon Valdez {{oil spill}} {{adversely}} affected killer whales in Prince William Sound and Alaska's Kenai Fjords region. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod {{disappeared in the}} following year. <b>The</b> <b>spill</b> damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local killer whales. By 2009, scientists estimated the AT1 transient population (considered {{part of a larger}} population of 346 transients), numbered only seven individuals and had not reproduced since <b>the</b> <b>spill.</b> This population is expected to die out.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} to all, <b>the</b> <b>spilling</b> of {{pipeline}} may cause serious problems, especially when the pipe conveying petroleum, natural gas or other toxic substance. There are countless accidents during past century. Once <b>the</b> <b>spilling</b> occurs, <b>the</b> vibration of the pipe would aggravate spill situation and even result in crack of the pipe. The consequence will be more severe when the fluid inside is compressible. To prevent the detriment of <b>the</b> <b>spilling</b> model is developed by assuming the leakages as orifices or nozzles and a 2 -D vertical simply supported pipe is selected to analyze the phenomena of the oscillation. Combining these two models, the oscillation model for the pipe with leakage is set up and <b>the</b> <b>spilling</b> effect is analyzed by numerical method. The amplitude of the pipe oscillation and the normal stress enlarge as the internal velocity increased, while the shear stress changes very little...|$|R

5|$|The {{pipeline}} has {{at times}} been damaged due to sabotage, human error, maintenance failures, and natural disasters. By law, Alyeska {{is required to}} report significant oil spills to regulatory authorities. The Exxon Valdez oil spill is the best-known accident involving Alaska oil, {{but it did not}} involve the pipeline itself. Following <b>the</b> <b>spill,</b> Alyeska created a rapid response force that is paid for by the oil companies, including ExxonMobil, which was found liable for <b>the</b> <b>spill.</b>|$|E

5|$|Almost a {{year after}} <b>the</b> <b>spill,</b> the Santa Barbara County Grand Jury handing down 46 {{criminal}} indictments against Plains. The Santa Barbara County District Attorney also announced a misdemeanor count {{against one of the}} company’s employees. California state Attorney General Kamala Harris, who had also opened a criminal investigation right after spill, said this prosecution will send a message to Plains and to {{the oil and gas industry}} in California.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3, it was {{indicated}} {{that under the}} combined influence of water flow and wind field, {{it was difficult for}} <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil to form a relatively high jet-flow in a vertical direction. <b>The</b> <b>spilled</b> oil mostly gathered along the direction of the river-bottom water flow, and the frontier oil droplets dispersed very quickly in the water.|$|R
40|$|Many {{optimizing}} compilers perform global register allocation using a Chaitin-style graph coloring algorithm. Live ranges that {{cannot be}} allocated to registers are <b>spilled</b> to memory. <b>The</b> amount of code required to <b>spill</b> <b>the</b> live range depends on <b>the</b> <b>spilling</b> heuristic used. Chaitin's spilling heuristic offers some guidance in reducing <b>the</b> amount of <b>spill</b> code produced. However, this heuristic {{does not allow}} <b>the</b> partial <b>spilling</b> of live ranges and <b>the</b> reduction in <b>spill</b> code {{is limited to a}} local level. In this paper, we present a global technique called interference region <b>spilling</b> that improves <b>the</b> <b>spilling</b> granularity of any local spilling heuristic. Our technique works above <b>the</b> local <b>spilling</b> heuristic, limiting <b>the</b> normal insertion of spill code to a portion of each spilled live range. By partially spilling live ranges, we can achieve large reductions in dynamically executed spill code; up to 75 % in some cases and an average of 33. 6 % across the benchmarks tested. 1 Introduction Gl [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Mercury {{and most}} of its {{compounds}} are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs), specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain <b>the</b> <b>spill.</b> Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an eyedropper, or for gently pushing <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine sulfur, zinc, or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill.|$|E
5|$|Three {{bills were}} {{signed into law}} in {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>spill.</b> Under a new law, the California Fire Marshall {{will be required to}} review the oil pipelines conditions every year while federal regulations only mandate a review every five years. Another new law provides for making oil spill response times faster and more effective. Finally, a new law will force intrastate pipelines to use the best-known technology such as automatic shut-off valves.|$|E
5|$|Anger at Turnbull's {{response}} to the 23 November 2009 meeting triggered a spill motion against his leadership three days later. The motion was moved by Kevin Andrews, a former Minister in the Howard government, but was defeated {{by a vote of}} 48 to 35. Andrews was not seen as a genuine prospect for the leadership, so the close vote on <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> motion was considered a blow to Turnbull. While Abbott supported Turnbull at the time of Andrews' spill, he subsequently resigned from the frontbench. Several others joined Abbott in resigning, including Nick Minchin, Eric Abetz, Sophie Mirabella and Tony Smith.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} the images above, <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil mostly {{diffused}} along the river-bottom water flow direction in a horizontal manner under the combined action of wind and water, and the frontier oil droplets were dispersed quickly by the water flow. The smaller the wind speed, the smaller the horizontal displacement of <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil. In <b>the</b> vertical direction, oil columns formed around the leakage hole under the action of buoyancy.|$|R

5|$|As waterbirds {{that feed}} on fish, {{pelicans}} are highly susceptible to oil spills, both directly by being oiled {{and by the}} impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that, during the previous 20 years, some 500–1000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil spills in California. A 2011 report by the Center for Biological Diversity, {{a year after the}} April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed as a result of <b>the</b> <b>spill.</b>|$|E
5|$|Days after <b>the</b> <b>spill,</b> tar balls began washing ashore on beaches {{down the}} coast in nearby Summerland and then farther {{down the coast}} in Ventura county. Although the source of these tar balls could not be {{immediately}} confirmed, the pipeline company sent workers to clean them up. Crews cleaned up coin-sized clumps of oil along the Rincon shoreline such as Faria, the beaches in the City of Ventura including San Buenaventura State Beach, and the extensive oceanfront of the Oxnard Plain.|$|E

There was speculation that Turnbull would challenge Nelson for the leadership in late 2008; however, Nelson caught Turnbull by surprise by calling a snap spill of the party's leadership positions while Turnbull was returning from an overseas holiday. <b>The</b> <b>spill</b> was moved on 16 September 2008. Turnbull defeated Nelson by four votes, becoming {{the leader of the}} Liberal Party and of the Opposition Coalition between the Liberals and the National Party.

5|$|Plains All American Pipeline {{estimated}} that the cleanup had cost $96 million during a joint oversight hearing of the State Assembly Natural Resources Committee and Senate Select Committee on June 26, 2015. Overall expenses related to <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> were estimated to be $257 million in an earnings report for Plains All American Pipeline issued around the same time. This included the emergency response and cleanup efforts along with the expected legal claims and potential settlements. The CEO stated in the report that all but $65 million would be covered by insurance and that the figure did not include lost revenue from the pipelines that have been shutdown.|$|E
5|$|The Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) is {{responsible}} for developing and enforcing regulations for pipeline operation transportation having been created in 2004 within the United States Department of Transportation. In the months following <b>the</b> <b>spill,</b> {{they found that the}} in-line inspection tool used by Plains in Line 901 and Line 903 had miscalculated the degree of corrosion. The company also withheld in-line inspection data so “it could enhance its interpretation of the data,” according to a corrective order issued by PHMSA. In October, PHMSA proposed new rules to assist in preventing such inspection discrepancies.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spill</b> cleanup {{occurred}} during the nesting season for snowy plovers so special precautions were necessary while cleaning up tar balls. The birds are often found on the beaches {{along the coast of}} the Oxnard plain. Their nests are hard to see in the open sand and the birds are easily frightened away by human activity leaving the eggs to fast-moving predators such as sea gulls. Least terns were another endangered species of bird that was a concern during the cleanup efforts.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm was}} {{expected}} to impact operations regarding the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, with both containment and cleanup operations being affected by repercussions from the storm (such as wave action and wind direction). Although Alex stayed relatively away from the site, the storm caused BP to delay plans to increase oil capture from the leak by a week. Tarballs from <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> as large as apples washed onshore around Grand Isle, {{as well as other}} parts of Louisiana, Alabama and Florida, from high storm tides created by the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>spill</b> was the {{culmination}} of a dispute within the Liberal Party over its response to the Rudd Government's proposed emissions trading scheme (ETS). Turnbull supported the introduction of an ETS and sought to negotiate amendments to government's proposed legislation. Abbott came to represent many Liberal members of Parliament who were climate change sceptics or otherwise opposed the ETS. After Turnbull survived a spill motion (a motion to declare the leadership vacant) against his leadership in late November 2009, Abbott declared his candidacy and a subsequent spill was moved on 1 December. Hockeya moderate who had been a supporter of Turnbull's position on the ETSalso stood. While Hockey had been expected to win, he was knocked out {{in the first round of}} voting. Abbott subsequently defeated Turnbull in the second round, 4241.|$|E
30|$|As {{displayed}} in the above images, the faster the water flow, the more difficult {{the formation of a}} continuous jet-flow, the lower the oil column, and the greater the horizontal displacement of <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil.
