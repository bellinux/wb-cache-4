40|$|A {{review is}} {{presented}} {{of the advantages}} and {{problems associated with the}} use of in vitro assays of cellular clonogenic capacity when used to analyse <b>responses</b> of <b>tumours</b> treated in vivo, either with radiation or chemotherapeutic agents. Three questions are considered: (1) Does the cell suspension obtained by the dispersion technique from various types of solid tumours provide an adequately random sample of the cells initially present in the tumour? (2) Are the properties of cells in suspensions obtained from solid tumours assayed in optimal conditions in vitro? (3) Are the properties expressed and analysed by in vitro techniques equivalent to the properties that the same cells would have expressed if they had been left in vivo, either in untreated or in treated tumours? It is concluded that the in vitro assay provides a valuable tool to analyse <b>tumour</b> <b>responses</b> but that the data obtained must be complemented by information on cell kinetics and other factors to obtain a complete description of <b>tumour</b> <b>responses</b> and to correlate them with tumour curability and growth delay...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of mitotane in providing objective <b>tumour</b> <b>responses</b> {{in patients with}} adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), has been recently questioned. Experience with non specific chemotherapy is limited. <b>Tumour</b> <b>responses</b> have been reported with cisplatin administered as a single agent or in combination. Other reports however failed to show benefit from cytotoxic chemotherapy. The very low number of patients included in each study, mostly of them previously treated with mitotane, may account for these controversial results. The finding that multidrug resistance mediated by MDR- 1 /P-glycoprotein can be reverted by mitotane provides a rational basis for exploring the use of mitotane in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. In a multicenter cooperative (SWOG) phase II study, a combination of mitotane+cisplatin appeared active in advanced ACC, with 30 % response rate in 37 eligible patients. These results prompted us to evaluate the activity of a combination chemotherapy of Eto-poside, Adriamycin and Cisplatin (EAP) in association with mitotane (4 g daily per os). Up to now we treated 6 patients, obtaining 3 partial responses. Recently, new drugs as suramin and gossypol have been show to have some activity in patients with surgically unresectable ACC, suggesting {{the need for further}} investigation. In conclusion, cytotoxic drugs+mitotane and new adrenocorticolytic/cytotoxic agents, should be explored as first line treatments in patients with advanced ACC. However, due to the extreme rarity of the disease, coordinated multicenter investigations should be highly encouraged...|$|R

50|$|Part of {{the process}} of {{determining}} the effectiveness of anti-cancer agents in clinical trials involves measuring the amount of tumor shrinkage such agents can generate. The WHO Criteria, developed in the 1970s by the International Union Against Cancer and the World Health Organization, represented the first generally agreed specific criteria for the codification of tumor response evaluation. These criteria were first published in 1981. The RECIST Criteria, first published in 2000, revised the WHO Criteria primarily to clarify differences that remained between research groups. Under RECIST tumour size was measured unidimensionally rather than bidimensionally, fewer lesions were measured, and the definition of 'progression' was changed so that it was no longer based on the isolated increase of a single lesion. RECIST also adopted a different shrinkage threshold for definitions of <b>tumour</b> <b>response</b> and progression. For the WHO Criteria it had been >50% tumour shrinkage for a Partial Response and >25% tumour increase for Progressive Disease. For RECIST it was >30% shrinkage for a Partial Response and >20% increase for Progressive Disease. One outcome of all these revisions was that more patients who would have been considered 'progressors' under the old criteria became 'responders' or 'stable' under the new criteria. RECIST and its successor, RECIST 1.1 from 2009, is now the standard measurement protocol for measuring response in cancer trials.|$|E

40|$|Background Tailoring neoadjuvant {{chemotherapy}} (NAC) during {{breast cancer}} treatment is performed to improve overall <b>tumour</b> <b>response,</b> with increasing {{evidence to support}} its role. This study evaluates our breast unit's experience in MRI assessment of <b>tumour</b> <b>response</b> as an aid in tailoring NAC. Materials and methods This is a retrospective study of patients treated with NAC for breast cancer between 2005 and 2009 who underwent MRI to assess <b>tumour</b> <b>response.</b> Response to NAC was monitored before NAC and after 2 and/or 4 cycles of anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy. Taxane was substituted for AC if MRI response was deemed inadequate. <b>Tumour</b> <b>response</b> on last MRI was correlated with final pathology against different tumour subtypes and in inflammatory tumours. Strength of agreement was measured using Kappa analysis. Potential predictive factors for MRI response were assessed for significance. Results 166 tumours were assessed with serial MRI scans. MRI showed high sensitivity rate (93. 1 %) in predicting response to NAC particularly for tumours showing partial (PR) or complete (CR) response on pathology (p <  0. 001) with fair agreement on Kappa analysis (K =  0. 31). MRI seems more accurate in triple negative, HR+/HER 2 + and high-grade tumours. Early identification of non-responders on MRI resulted in early tailoring of NAC, with improved rates of <b>tumour</b> <b>response</b> seen in 74. 2 % following switching NAC. Logistic regression showed that PR or CR observed on MRI after 2 NAC cycles significantly predicted pCR (p <  0. 001). Conclusion Serial MRI {{can be used to}} assess patterns of <b>tumour</b> <b>response</b> to NAC. This study shows that tailoring NAC according to pattern of response can improve overall <b>tumour</b> <b>response</b> rates...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -The {{effect has}} been studied of adding either {{misonidazole}} (MISO) or metronidazole (METRO) to cytotoxic drug treatment of C 3 H mice bearing the RIF- 1 sarcoma. The nitroimidazoles were injected 30 min before the cytotoxic drugs at a dose of 2 ' 5 mmol/kg. Both clonogenic-cell survival and growth delay were measured as indicators of <b>tumour</b> <b>response</b> and depression in WBC count and acute lethality were used to indicate normal-tissue response. For melphalan, neither pretreatment agent produced any change in <b>tumour</b> <b>response.</b> For cyclophosphamide, no change was produced by METRO but a minimal increase in <b>tumour</b> <b>response</b> occurred with MISO. An enhancement of cell killing by CCNU was seen with MISO pretreatment, {{but there was no}} increase in tumour growth delay. METRO, however, did not enhance <b>tumour</b> <b>response</b> by either endpoint. WBC depression by CCNU was not enhanced by MISO pretreatment, and there was no significant reduction in the acute LD 50. This indicates a therapeutic advantage from the addition of MISO to CCNU in this model system. For chlorambucil, considerable enhancement of <b>tumour</b> <b>response</b> followed either MISO or METRO pretreatment (dose-modifying factors of 2. 0 and 1 * 4 respectively). However, the modification by MISO of normaltissue response to chlorambucil was also enhanced by about a factor of 2, with no therapeutic gain. SEVERAL RECENT STUDIES have demonstrated that <b>tumour</b> <b>response</b> to cytotoxic drugs in mice can be enhanced by the 2 -nitroimidazole misonidazole (MISO), a radiosensitizer of hypoxic cells (Rose et al. ...|$|E
30|$|As it was {{underlined}} {{in other}} papers [7, 24, 25], the Ki index, even {{highly correlated with}} the SUV values, gives additional information.

The variation in Ki,max is statistically higher than the variation in SUVmax values. Considering the EORTC or PERCIST criteria, the <b>tumour</b> <b>response</b> could be modified considering the Δ Ki,max instead of the ΔSUVmax value. For clinical trials, this could imply that use of SUV for assessment of radio-chemotherapy may under- or overestimate treatment efficiency compared with parametric analysis.|$|E

Emerging experimental data highlights the immuno-modulatory roles of diverse cell populations in GVHD, including regulatory T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, NK T cells, γδ T cells, and antigen presenting cells (APC). Knowledge of the pathophysiology of GVHD has driven the investigation of new rational strategies to both prevent severe GVHD and treat steroid-refractory GVHD. Novel cytokine inhibitors, immune-suppressant agents known to preserve or even promote regulatory T-cell function and the depletion of specific alloreactive T-cell sub-populations all promise significant advances in the near future.

40|$|The {{response}} of 6 human colorectal tumour xenografts to 7 cytotoxic agents have been established. <b>Tumour</b> <b>responses</b> have been quantified by growth inhibition, {{and the time}} taken for 3 H-thymidine fractional incorporation (TFI) to recover to the control value after treatment. The chemosensitivity of each tumour line to a spectrum of agents was individual, and no pattern of response which would allow prediction of individual agent efficacy was apparent. Cyclophosphamide, methyl-CCNU and 5 -fluorouracil produced marked growth inhibition in individual tumour lines, whereas actinomycin-D, cis-dichlorodiammine platinum, doxorubicin and pentamethylmelamine showed little activity.

30|$|The radiobiological {{molecular}} {{mechanisms of}} radiation-induced morbidities in normal {{tissues and organs}} are very complex and vary between different {{signs and symptoms of}} morbidity in the same organ and between different organs. Also the <b>tumour</b> <b>responses</b> to therapeutic exposure to ionising radiation, including radiotherapy using hadrons, are currently largely unknown. The radiobiological molecular mechanisms are even more complex for combined radiotherapy and chemo- or biologically targeted treatment strategies. These mechanisms need to be clarified for specific clinical morbidity endpoints in order to develop specific strategies for protection, mitigation or management of the clinical consequences of exposure. They are even more important for medical radiation procedures in paediatric patients given the evidence showing that the complexity and severity of morbidities and developmental injury and the risks of therapy-induced malignant diseases are particularly high after radiotherapy (in almost all instances in combination with chemotherapy).|$|R
30|$|Some {{physicians}} prefer NAC {{instead of}} the adjuvant chemotherapy because {{of the ability to}} assess <b>tumour</b> <b>response</b> in vivo. In this situation, reliable assessment of pathological <b>tumour</b> <b>response</b> to NAC is vital in order to select the most appropriate surgical plan. An imaging modality that could assess <b>tumour</b> <b>response</b> to NAC would be beneficial, providing it could detect any residual disease present. This could result in a surgical treatment plan more tailored to the individual patient. In addition, pathological complete response (pCR, i.e. the absence of any residual invasive tumour cells) on NAC has shown to be a prognostic factor for overall better survival, disease-free survival and recurrence-free survival [2].
