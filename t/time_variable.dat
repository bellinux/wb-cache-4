5|$|Because of this {{experiment}} Hendrik Lorentz {{proposed that the}} motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to contract along its length in the direction of motion, and he further assumed, that the <b>time</b> <b>variable</b> for moving systems must also be changed accordingly ("local time"), which led to the formulation of the Lorentz transformation. Based on Lorentz's aether theory, Henri Poincaré (1900) showed that this local time (to first order in v/c) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz's theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincaré brought Lorentz's aether theory into full observational agreement with the principle of relativity.|$|E
25|$|The main {{benefits}} of the a posteriori methods are as follows. In this case, the collision detection algorithm need {{not be aware of}} the myriad of physical variables; a simple list of physical bodies is fed to the algorithm, and the program returns a list of intersecting bodies. The collision detection algorithm doesn't need to understand friction, elastic collisions, or worse, nonelastic collisions and deformable bodies. In addition, the a posteriori algorithms are in effect one dimension simpler than the a priori algorithms. Indeed, an a priori algorithm must deal with the <b>time</b> <b>variable,</b> which is absent from the a posteriori problem.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS The {{prevalence}} of female {{stress urinary incontinence}} is high, and young adults are also affected, including athletes, especially those involved in "high-impact" sports. To date there have been almost no studies testing pelvic floor muscle (PFM) activity during dynamic functional whole body movements. The {{aim of this study}} was the description and reliability test of PFM activity and <b>time</b> <b>variables</b> during running. METHODS A prospective cross-sectional study including ten healthy female subjects was designed with the focus on the intra-session test-retest reliability of PFM activity and <b>time</b> <b>variables</b> during running derived from electromyography (EMG) and accelerometry. RESULTS Thirteen variables were identified based on ten steps of each subject: Six EMG variables showed good reliability (ICC 0. 906 - 0. 942) and seven <b>time</b> <b>variables</b> did not show good reliability (ICC 0. 113 - 0. 731). <b>Time</b> <b>variables</b> (e. g. <b>time</b> difference between heel strike and maximal acceleration of vaginal accelerator) showed low reliability. However, relevant PFM EMG variables during running (e. g., pre-activation, minimal and maximal activity) could be identified and showed good reliability. CONCLUSION Further adaptations regarding measurement methods should be tested to gain better control of the kinetics and kinematics of the EMG probe and accelerometers. To our knowledge this is the first study to test the reliability of PFM activity and <b>time</b> <b>variables</b> during dynamic functional whole body movements. More knowledge of PFM activity and <b>time</b> <b>variables</b> may help to provide a deeper insight into physical strain with high force impacts and important functional reflexive contraction patterns of PFM to maintain or to restore continence...|$|R

2500|$|In 1892 and 1895, Lorentz {{worked on}} {{describing}} electromagnetic phenomena (the propagation of light) in reference frames that move {{relative to the}} postulated luminiferous aether.

Although Lorentz did not give a detailed interpretation of the physical significance of local time, with it, he could explain the aberration of light and the result of the Fizeau experiment. In 1900 and 1904, Henri Poincaré called local time Lorentz's [...] "most ingenious idea" [...] and illustrated it by showing that clocks in moving frames are synchronized by exchanging light signals that are assumed to travel at the same speed against and with the motion of the frame (see Einstein synchronisation and Relativity of simultaneity). In 1892, with the attempt to explain the Michelson-Morley experiment, Lorentz also proposed that moving bodies contract in the direction of motion (see length contraction; George FitzGerald had already arrived at this conclusion in 1889).|$|E
