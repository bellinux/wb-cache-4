A {{system of}} {{reactions}} with some irreversible reactions {{is a limit}} of systems with detailed balance when some constants <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> {{if and only if}} (i) the reversible part of this system satisfies the principle of detailed balance and (ii) the convex hull of the stoichiometric vectors of the irreversible reactions has empty intersection with the linear span of the stoichiometric vectors of the reversible reactions.

25|$|Acoustic phonons are {{coherent}} {{movements of}} atoms of the lattice {{out of their}} equilibrium positions. If the displacement is {{in the direction of}} propagation, then in some areas the atoms will be closer, in others farther apart, as in a sound wave in air (hence the name acoustic). Displacement perpendicular to the propagation direction is comparable to waves in water. If the wavelength of acoustic phonons goes to infinity, this corresponds to a simple displacement of the whole crystal, and this costs zero energy. Acoustic phonons exhibit a linear relationship between frequency and phonon wavevector for long wavelengths. The frequencies of acoustic phonons <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> with longer wavelength. Longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonons are often abbreviated as LA and TA phonons, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{essence of}} {{asymptotic}} safety is {{the observation that}} nontrivial renormalization group fixed points {{can be used to}} generalize the procedure of perturbative renormalization. In an asymptotically safe theory the couplings {{do not need to be}} small or <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> in the high energy limit but rather tend to finite values: they approach a nontrivial UV fixed point. The running of the coupling constants, i.e. their scale dependence described by the renormalization group (RG), is thus special in its UV limit in the sense that all their dimensionless combinations remain finite. This suffices to avoid unphysical divergences, e.g. in scattering amplitudes. The requirement of a UV fixed point restricts the form of the bare action and the values of the bare coupling constants, which become predictions of the asymptotic safety program rather than inputs.|$|E
25|$|For {{experimental}} physics, hotness means that, {{when comparing}} any two given bodies {{in their respective}} separate thermodynamic equilibria, any two suitably given empirical thermometers with numerical scale readings will agree as to which is the hotter of the two given bodies, or {{that they have the}} same temperature. This does not require the two thermometers to have a linear relation between their numerical scale readings, but it does require that the relation between their numerical readings shall be strictly monotonic. A definite sense of greater hotness can be had, independently of calorimetry, of thermodynamics, and of properties of particular materials, from Wien's displacement law of thermal radiation: the temperature of a bath of thermal radiation is proportional, by a universal constant, to the frequency of the maximum of its frequency spectrum; this frequency is always positive, but can have values that <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero.</b> Thermal radiation is initially defined for a cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium. These physical facts justify a mathematical statement that hotness exists on an ordered one-dimensional manifold. This is a fundamental character of temperature and thermometers for bodies in their own thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
500|$|This {{suggests}} that [...] is a linear transformation from the vector space Rn to the vector space Rm. In fact, {{it is possible}} to make this a precise derivation by measuring the error in the approximations. [...] Assume that the error in these linear approximation formula is bounded by a constant times ||v||, where the constant is independent of v but depends continuously on a. Then, after adding an appropriate error term, all of the above approximate equalities can be rephrased as inequalities. [...] In particular, [...] is a linear transformation up to a small error term. [...] In the limit as v and w <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero,</b> it must therefore be a linear transformation. Since we define the total derivative by taking a limit as v goes to zero, [...] must be a linear transformation.|$|E

40|$|We show {{by example}} that {{empirical}} likelihood and other commonly used tests for moment restrictions {{are unable to}} control the (exponential) {{rate at which the}} probability of a Type I error <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> unless the possible distributions for the observed data are restricted appropriately. From this, it follows that for the optimality claim for empirical likelihood in Kitamura (2001) to hold, additional assumptions and qualifications are required. Under stronger assumptions than those in Kitamura (2001), we establish the following optimality result: (i) empirical likelihood controls {{the rate at which the}} probability of a Type I error <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> and (ii) among all procedures for which the probability of a Type I error <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> at least as fast, empirical likelihood maximizes the rate at which the probability of a Type II error <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> for most alternatives. This result further implies that empirical likelihood maximizes the rate at which the probability of a Type II error <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>zero</b> for all alternatives among a class of tests that satisfy a weaker criterion for their Type I error probabilities...|$|R

This channel has a nonnegative input (representing the transmitted optical intensity), which is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise.

2500|$|Partly {{following}} a heuristic {{method of calculation}} pioneered by Boltzmann for gas molecules, Planck considered the possible ways of distributing electromagnetic energy over the different modes of his hypothetical charged material oscillators.
