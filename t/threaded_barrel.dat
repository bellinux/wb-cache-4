5|$|Some {{minor changes}} in the gun {{construction}} were introduced during production. The carriage received a modified shoulder guard and traverse controls (carriage M4A1, standardized on 29 January 1942). Although ordnance requested an upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, this process was not completed. Another change was a <b>threaded</b> <b>barrel</b> end to accept a big five-port muzzle brake (gun M3A1, adopted on 5 March 1942). According to some sources, the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust {{in front of the}} gun, which hindered aiming; however, the brake {{turned out to be a}} safety problem when firing canister ammunition and consequently the M3A1 went into combat without the muzzle brake. Other sources mention the muzzle brake was intended to soften a recoil and they say that it was dropped simply because additional recoil control measures were not really needed.|$|E

50|$|Many {{upgrades}} {{are available}} for the Bushmaster series markers including valves, boards, frames, triggers, feednecks, bolts, ASAs and regulators. The stock barrel can also be replaced with an aftermarket barrel. The 2003 and earlier models use ICD <b>threaded</b> <b>barrels</b> while 2004 and some 2003 models use Autococker <b>barrel</b> <b>threads.</b> Other than <b>barrels,</b> the only other compatibility difference between different models {{is that of the}} wiring harness or board. Some models use 22-pin wiring (such as the old LCD boards) while the 12-pin is more common. A 22 pin board can be plugged into a 12 pin harness and will work correctly except for the paintball detection system.|$|R

The stock breech is threaded to accept Autococker <b>threaded</b> <b>barrels</b> and has a pair of rubber ball detents. The detents can easily be removed and cleaned or replaced using an o-ring pick to remove them and a hex key to push them back in. The completely removable breech leaves ways for aftermarket manufactures to develop new and improved breeches.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{products}} of the Ultra Light Engineering from Tom Kaye was the aluminum vertical feed bodies. These ULE vertical bodies gave players a tighter profile when playing paintball. These bodies use Autococker <b>threaded</b> <b>barrels</b> and Angel <b>threaded</b> feednecks and ball-detents. This made the powerfeed tube design obsolete since chopping was no longer a problem {{with the help of the}} level ten bolt and agitated/force feed loaders. The use of aluminum instead of stainless steel dropped the weight of the automag significantly, allowing players a tighter as well as lighter marker setup.|$|R
