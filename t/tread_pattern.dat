50|$|The small {{footprint}} {{of the bar}} grip tread makes them perform poorly on sand. Even in the 1930s, 'balloon' tyres with wider <b>treads,</b> smaller <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> and lower pressures, were available for desert use.|$|R
2500|$|The {{other major}} factor {{controlling}} the cornering {{speed of the}} cars is {{the design of the}} tyres. From [...] to , the tyres in Formula One were not [...] "slicks" [...] (tyres with no <b>tread</b> <b>pattern)</b> as in most other circuit racing series. Instead, each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars. Slick tyres returned to Formula One in the [...] season. Suspension is double wishbone or multilink front and rear, with pushrod operated springs and dampers on the chassis – one exception being that of the 2009 specification Red Bull Racing car (RB5) which used pullrod suspension at the rear, the first car to do so since the Minardi PS01 in 2001. Ferrari used a pullrod suspension at both the front and rear in their [...] car. Both Ferrari (F138) and McLaren (MP4-28) of the 2013 season used a pullrod suspension at both the front and the rear.|$|E

50|$|Bar grip tyres, or 'NDT' (Non-Directional Tire) in US {{military}} parlance, are {{an early}} tyre <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> developed for off-road use.|$|E
50|$|Treads fall {{somewhere along}} the {{spectrum}} from smooth or slick to knobby. Smooth treads are intended for on-road use, where a <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> offers no improvement in traction. However, many otherwise slick tires have a light <b>tread</b> <b>pattern,</b> due to the common belief that a slick tire will be slippery in wet conditions. Knobby treads are intended for off-road use, where the tread texture can help improve traction on soft surfaces. Many treads are omnidirectional—the tire can be installed in either orientation—but some are unidirectional and designed to be oriented a certain way. Some tires, especially for mountain bikes, have a tread which is intended either for the front wheel or the rear wheel. A special <b>tread</b> <b>pattern,</b> with small dimples, has been developed to reduce air drag.|$|E
50|$|The rain groove is {{a design}} {{element of the}} <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> {{specifically}} arranged to channel water away from the footprint. Rain grooves are circumferential in most truck tires. Many high-performance passenger tires feature rain grooves that are angled from the center toward {{the sides of the}} tire. Some tire manufacturers claim that their <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> is designed to actively pump water out from under the tire by the action of the tread flexing. This results in a smoother ride in different types of weather.|$|E

Nokian Tyres designed the first winter tyres in 1934 and has more winter tyre patents than any other manufacturer. Nokian Tyres {{is known for its}} winter tyres, {{not to be confused with}} all-season tyres. Nokian winter tyres have been described as a favourite of critics and have been well received in winter test results by several publications. Nokian also has designed some winter tyre models with low rolling resistance, offering lower fuel consumption. Nokian was the first company to produce a tyre that allowed for year-round use by having different <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> on the lateral and medial aspect of the <b>tread.</b> One <b>pattern</b> is optimised for winter and another pattern is designed as an all-season pattern.|$|R

This study basically assessed <b>tread</b> wear <b>pattern</b> of tyres in passenger cars used on Nigeria roads. The result obtained showed that 75. 4 % of the assessed tyres showed uneven wear pattern resulting from incorrect tyre-road contact effects. This observed high proportion of uneven tyre <b>tread</b> wear <b>pattern</b> implies high rate of inconsequential regard for tyre safety...|$|R
50|$|Various tyres {{have been}} made {{available}} by different mountainboard manufacturers, giving riders a choice of tire specifications. For example, {{the thickness of the}} tyre is variable between tyres, usually either 2 or 4 ply. 2 ply tyres are lighter, but more susceptible to punctures than 4 ply tyres. There is a variety of <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> available, ranging from street slicks to deep tread designed for maximum grip with split center beads to channel water away. Width and diameter is also variable.|$|R
50|$|Dunlop {{exported}} {{on average}} over 120,000 pairs of KT26 shoes to Papua New Guinea per year. Dunlop KT26s have become ubiquitous fashion items within rugged countries {{where they are}} prized for their low cost, wide fit, sturdy construction and superior <b>tread</b> <b>pattern.</b> The shoe's <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> is particularly useful in muddy conditions, which has helped it to become the footwear of choice for competitors in the Kokoda Challenge, a race over {{the length of the}} Kokoda Track. It is reported that there are over 23 counterfeit versions of KT26 on sale in Papua New Guinea.|$|E
50|$|Tires {{may also}} be directional, where the <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> favors {{operation}} in one direction. This usually {{takes the form of}} v-shaped grooves that help to disperse water from the center {{to the edge of the}} tread. Symmetric directional tires can be used on both sides, but once mounted on a rim cannot be moved to the other side, since the <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> will be in the wrong direction. This restricts tire rotation. Some directional tires are also asymmetric, in which case there will be specific left and right-handed versions.|$|E
50|$|An {{asymmetric}} tire may {{refer to}} a tire whose <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> does not form in line symmetry or point symmetry vis-à-vis its central line, thus having a distinct inside and outside edge. They may be mounted {{on either side of}} the vehicle. Since the <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> of many ordinary tires do not form symmetry in relation to design or pattern noise, the method of mounting tires is specially prescribed. This type of tires is used in many cases to promote tire performance, braking performance, and turning performance, since tread contact changes according to the change in alignment during travel.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on the design, an {{off-road}} tire may {{be designated}} [...] "all terrain", meaning {{it is intended}} for use both on- and off-road. Such tires attempt to compromise between grip on loose terrain and safety or comfort on paved roads. Some tires, such as the bar grip used on United States military vehicles in World War II, accomplish this by separating the tire into distinct on-road and off-road tread zones. Modern all-terrain tires typically employ hybrid <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> and tougher compound to increase the wear life under mixed-surface conditions.|$|R
40|$|Most {{traditional}} tyre models {{concern the}} low and middle frequency ranges. For improved accuracy in tyre/road interaction models {{it is necessary}} to include higher frequencies. Often only the radial direction is included, although the tangential direction may be important, especially studying stick slip motion in the contact between tyre and road surface. Designing accurate and efifcient models requires insight into the behaviour of the tyre structure at higher frequencies to make the models as complete as necessary without creating tools that are computationally too costly. To add insight to this area, experimental studies were done on four different tyres with the same internal design but with different <b>tread</b> <b>patterns.</b> Point mobilities were measured and compared with two different tyre models, a two-layer plate model based on the elastic field equations and an orthotropic plate model. The results of this study underline the importance of the local deformation when there are forces that act with small excitation areas on the tread. Adequate consideration of the tread properties in the tyre/road interaction models is thus of extreme importance to obtain the correct local contact force distribution. This is most important for the tangential driving point mobility. <b>Tread</b> <b>patterns</b> are shown mainly to modify the flexural stiffness in comparison to smooth tyres, while block resonances are not expected to be located in the frequency range in which tyre/road noise is important...|$|R
50|$|WTB {{filled the}} parts chasm that {{the rapidly growing}} sport had left by the wayside. Purpose-built parts, made {{specifically}} for mountain biking, were designed and abusively tested on the very fire roads that the sport had just emerged from. WTB’s experience with modified parts led to its design of the first mountain bike tires and rims. WTB designed quickly. WTB Toe Flips {{led the way to}} WTB Speedmaster brakes, then Type II fork crowns, WTB Modified Shifters and WTB Drop Bars. Starting in 1985, WTB designed 25 <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> for Specialized and created geometry for the 1987 Trek 8000 mountain bike frame.|$|R
50|$|GRI also {{produces}} tires required for agricultural purposes {{which are used}} in farming vehicles especially those in tractors and harvesters. Agricultural tires are unique in aspects of <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> & high-load carrying capacity.|$|E
50|$|Performance-oriented tires have a <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> {{and rubber}} {{compounds}} designed to grip the road surface, and so {{usually have a}} slightly shorter stopping distance. However, specific braking tests are necessary for data beyond generalizations.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the dimple <b>tread</b> <b>pattern</b> mentioned above, at least one tire has an extra [...] "wing" [...] to cover {{the gap between the}} tire sidewall and the wheel rim and reduce drag.|$|E
5000|$|Booker {{began working}} with rubber tires in the early 1990s and {{presently}} continues to work in this medium. The various <b>tread</b> <b>patterns,</b> colors, and widths which the tires possess create a palette for Booker similar to the palette of painter. Booker's utiliztation of tires {{was considered to be}} an [...] "aesthetic response to the urban landscape of Northern New Jersey." [...] The rubber and tires were transformed into fluid materials giving them a new life and energy. The tires represented metaphors which satisfied aesthetic, political, and economic concerns. Lucinda Masson notes that Booker's use of recycled tires can remind us of how modes of transportation have changed since the industrial age.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Modeling tire-snow {{interaction}} {{is important in}} designing effective snow tires, which directly affects road safety during wintry weather. Unfortunately, tires have complex tread designs and the physical properties of snow have not been characterized. We employ the Material Point Method (MPM) for simulating a material that mimics the fracturing and plasticity of snow using established physical models. This realistic simulation allows us to assess the interactions between a breakable material like snow and a continuum structure like rubber tires, and {{determine the effect of}} <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> on tire traction. We also design a novel snow rendering technique for particle simulation using a combination of surface reconstruction, surface instanced geometry and sub-surface scattering...|$|R
40|$|A {{new device}} was {{developed}} for tire tread block slip friction tests. Then the friction characteristics were investigated under different loads and contact roads. Based on this, a friction model for contact between tire tread block and different road surfaces was developed. A finite element slip friction model of rubber block {{was developed for}} studying the tread contact stress, stiffness under different pattern slope angles, and ditch radius. Results indicate that friction coefficient between tread and ice road increases when the temperature decreases; different <b>tread</b> <b>patterns</b> have a certain influence on the friction coefficient; its average difference was less than 10 %. Different roads impact the coefficient of friction more significantly; the greater the pattern slope, the greater the radial stiffness...|$|R
