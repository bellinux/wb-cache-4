Rural districts were grouped into four stratifications {{on the basis}} of enrollment size; I) less than one section per grade, 2) one section per grade, 3) two sections per grade and 4) three sections per grade. To permit additional comparisons, all other districts were placed in four geographic/enrollment stratifications; I) large towns, 2) non-metropolitan cities, 3) suburbs and 4) urban. The comparative district stratification/trend analysis model was a useful applied research method. Rural school districts with fewer than three sections per grade experienced greater adverse effectsas the result of community demographic and economic change. Generalizing from anecdotal data becomes an issue in identifying problems unique to rural schools and in formulating appropriate policy responses.

Many of the issues raised in this report have persisted for years. IRS believes that the solution to many of these issues may lie in systems modernization. IRS plans to implement a new financial system that includes a cost accounting module as well as integrated administrative and custodial general ledgers that are supported by subsidiary ledgers containing the transactional details for key accounts, such as <b>taxes</b> <b>receivable</b> and property and equipment.

40|$|A new, “supercharged” form of IPO has slowly {{developed}} over the last twenty years. This new form of IPO takes advantage of several seemingly unrelated provisions {{of the tax code}} to multiply pre-IPO owners’ proceeds from a public offering without reducing the amount public investors {{are willing to pay for}} the stock. Supercharged IPOs use a <b>tax</b> <b>receivable</b> agreement to transfer tax assets created by the IPO back to the pre-IPO ownership, “monetizing” the tax assets.

40|$|The law of reflux is {{explained}} using {{an example of}} backed money. In the example, government-issued money is backed by the government’s assets (mainly <b>taxes</b> <b>receivable)</b> while bank-issued money is backed by the bank’s assets. The value of both kinds of money {{is determined by the}} amount of backing held per unit of money issued. The example shows that reflux maintains money’s value, not by assuring that excessive issues of money reflux to their issuers, but by providing people with access to the assets backing their money. Conventional metallic convertibility is only one channel of many through which money can reflux to its issuer. The suspension of metallic convertibility still leaves many other open channels of reflux, but can create the illusion that money is unbacked fiat money that was somehow forced into circulation. Backed money will hold its value as long as its issuer remains solvent. One way for an issuer to stay solvent is to issue money in exchange for short-term real bills of adequate value, but as long as the bills are of adequate value, it is largely unnecessary for the bills to be real or short-term. ...|$|E

The first, enterprises created, established the outreach impact of financial intervention on enterprise development. The other three (employment, taxes and shareholders wealth), corroborated enterprise creation, established deepening effect, and demonstrated the intervention’s capacity to sustain these enterprises and add economic value to stakeholders. Multiple coefficient of determination (R 2) and F-test were the principal inferential analyses conducted. The ordinary least square method was employed with an assumption that over the fifteen years period (1999 - 2013) the data were stationary.

40|$|The {{application}} of accrual accounting principles {{is a challenge}} for public sectors internationally and increases the level of transparency and accountability of management. Taxation authorities are governed by legislation {{and have to be}} supported by a sound legislative framework to enable effective administration of taxes and the proper {{application of}} the accrual accounting principles. The recent issuing of the accounting standard for taxes and developments relating to the subsequent measurement of <b>tax</b> <b>receivables</b> highlights the ineffectiveness of current administrative tax legislation relating to penalties and interest which does not allow SARS to effectively apply accrual accounting principles. The receipt of taxpayer returns and payments as required by legislation are critical in order to allow the recording of taxes owed in the financial records of SARS. These taxpayer actions can only be effectively influenced by an effective penalty regime. Similarly, the current interest regimes on <b>tax</b> <b>receivables</b> and payables need to be adjusted in order to allow efficiencies and be comparative to market rates and calculation methods. International comparisons of penalty and interest regimes did not indicate a specific standard regime that should be applied, but the United Kingdom identified sound design principles for penalty and interest regimes. A simple standardised penalty and interest regime for all taxes administered by SARS is recommended which meets the identified design principles and supports the accrual accounting principles. The move to accrual accounting is an additional driver for administrative legislative reform which supports the effective management of taxation authorities.

Deferred taxes will reverse {{themselves}} in the long run and in total will zero out, unless there is something like a change in tax rates in the intervening period. A deferred tax payable results from a tax break in the early years and will reverse itself in later years; a deferred <b>tax</b> <b>receivable</b> results from more taxes being paid in early years than the tax expense reported to shareholders and will again reverse itself in later years. The deferred tax amount is computed by estimating the amount and the timing of the reversal and multiplying that by the appropriate tax rates.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the U.K. and elsewhere, {{companies}} {{are permitted to}} report one pre-tax income number (also called income before tax, profit before tax or earnings before income tax) to shareholders, and another, called taxable income, to the tax authorities. Differences between taxable income and the pre-tax income or profit number reported for financial statements are either temporary or permanent in nature. Permanent differences result when deductibility rules differ in perpetuity between accounting and tax law. Temporary differences result when the recognition of deductions for tax and accounting standards differ in their timing. The result is a gap between tax expense computed using income before tax and current tax payable computed using taxable income. This gap is known as deferred tax.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, a revolutionary new tax structure, known as the Up-C, has become {{increasingly}} popular, particularly in instances where an LLC is being taken public. In such an Up-C IPO, a newly formed C corporation is placed {{on top of the}} existing LLC, which continues to operate the business. Shares of the C corporation are sold to new investors, and the proceeds are used by the C corporation to buy an interest in the LLC. Meanwhile, the legacy owners of the LLC (typically, founders and private investment funds) retain their interests in the LLC, while receiving exchange rights that allow them to swap their LLC interests for equivalent-value shares of the C corporation. In addition, the legacy owners often receive the benefit of <b>tax</b> <b>receivables</b> agreements (TRAs), which provide that the owners will receive a specified percentage (usually 85 percent) of the tax benefits to the C corporation resulting from future exchanges. In combination, these features seem to provide a near-nirvana of tax efficiency. It is therefore unsurprising that the popularity of Up-Cs is growing at an exponential rate. Nevertheless, the Up-C has received very little attention in the academic literature. This paper endeavors to fill this void. It describes the complicated Up-C IPO structure (and its frequent complement, TRAs) in detail and discusses their many attractive tax features. While Up-Cs and TRAs have faced skepticism from some quarters, the paper explains that there appears to be nothing particularly nefarious about the use of Up-Cs or TRAs per se, at least from a tax policy perspective. In addition, the paper discusses some of the significant implications of the Up-C revolution, including choice-of-entity and international tax implications. We believe that ultimately the Up-C revolution will finally fulfill predictions that the advent of the LLC would fundamentally alter the landscape of business taxation in the United States, not by replacing corporations with LLCs but instead by combining the best features of both entities into a single dominant structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{fundamental}} premise for {{the regular}} performance of economic policy, fulfilment of the revenues of the state budget and thus creating optimal conditions for efficient fiscal policy realization, is to minimize state receivables after maturity, as the theoretical planning of the revenue side of the state budget is irrelevant considering that tax payers and other entities fail to fulfil their liabilities towards the state, more precisely state budget, and conversely the state {{is not able to}} provide the approved income in the state budget. The objective of this paper is to: analyse the development of state receivables in years 2001 - 2014; identify the causes of the state receivables origin; test econometrically the dependence of formation of the state receivables after maturity on the economic cycle, the tax rate change and entry of the Czech Republic to the European Union; evaluate the results of the long-term research of implementation of an experimental model, during which the possibility of reaching incomparably higher efficiency was verified and proven in the management process of state receivables recovery; highlight this important negative determinant of the state fiscal policy. With regard to aforesaid, this text is structured in the following way. First, the author took into consideration the theories which are connected with surveyed matters, following by the characteristic and causes of state receivables development for the period of 1991 to 2014.

40|$|The {{theme of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis {{is the final}} accounts according to the International Financial Reporting Standarts, especially, the first transformation of the final accounts from the czech accounting legislation to the IFRS. In the first part I present the theoretical basis which is necessary to know for a realization of reporting according to the IFRS and I mention to whom is it related to. In a practical part I realized the first transformation of the financial statements to the IFRS to 31. 12. 2007 in one middle-sized czech company which is focused on goods traffic and repair business. Considering {{the size of my}} work I chose the most important items and account cases which we can find in most of the companies and which solve the IFRS differently. Especially, it refers to the investment property, non-current assets held for sale, evaluation of assets, provisions, financial leasing, deferred <b>tax</b> and long-term <b>receivables.</b> I was interested how difficult such transformation is and to how big differences in the reported items can it lead. It is evident from the tranformation that the differences in the reporting between Czech accounting legislation and the IFRS are considerable. That is why I was interested in which principles both of the methods differ and which of them correspond more to the principle of a true and full display. In this confrontation the IFRS is winning which try to display the whole property from which the account unit has an economical profit and display his real value as well. On the other hand, the IFRS are far liberal, they often provide a choice of several different possibilities for reporting of some items what obstructs the principle of a comparability of the particular companies. One of the disadvantages of the IFRS is its demandingness, it requires better cooperation between the accountants, management and experts. The Standarts are not written in a comprehensible way, they are too large and there is a shoortage of a practical book and a software for the realization of a transformation in the market. Especially, for the small and middle-sized companies the transformation is a big burden and it leads to a generation of some special standart for them today...|$|R
