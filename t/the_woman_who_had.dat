5|$|On May 10, 1999, Debra won the Women's Championship from Sable in an Evening Gown match. Usually, in an Evening Gown match, {{the woman}} who {{forcibly}} removes her opponent's dress wins. Because Sable removed Debra's dress, she therefore {{should have been the}} winner. Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, ruled that he considered <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> lost her dress the winner, crowning Debra the new Women's Champion. Debra lost the Women's Title to Ivory on June 14, due to interference from Nicole Bass.|$|E

40|$|Background: Millions of {{patients}} are prescribed drugs for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) {{in developing countries}} each year, yet the treatment effect of these prescriptions is largely unknown. Objectives: To determine if the prescribing of erythromycin and ceftriaxone to pregnant women with STI symptoms leads {{to a reduction in}} the prevalence among these women of chlamydia and gonorrhoea, respectively. Methods: We compared the prevalence of chlamydia among 116 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been prescribed erythromycin for a history of STI symptoms in their current pregnancy with the prevalence in a control group of 557 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed this drug. Similarly we compared the prevalence of gonorrhoea among 110 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> and 561 <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed ceftriaxone. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the prevalence of chlamydia among <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> and <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed erythromycin four times daily for 10 days (7 % v 8 %). Contrarily, none of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been prescribed a single dose of ceftriaxone had gonorrhoea, whereas 4 % of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not had this drug prescribed did have gonorrhoea.

5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners found that both the head and shoulders of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. <b>The</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E

Another participant, Daniel Pope, managed to track Russian down to an address in Richmond upon Thames and convinced him {{to be interviewed by}} Christmas TV and apologise on camera.

5|$|Following Christiane's funeral, Dr. Génessier and his {{assistant}} Louise, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> disposed of the dead body earlier, return home where the real Christiane is hidden (it is explained that Louise is deathlessly loyal to Génessier because he repaired her own badly damaged face, leaving only a barely noticeable scar she covers with a pearl choker). The body belonged to {{a young woman who}} died following Dr. Génessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's. Dr. Génessier promises to restore Christiane's face and insists that she wear a mask to cover her disfigurement. After her father leaves the room, Christiane calls her fiancé Jacques Vernon, who works with Dr. Génessier at his clinic, but hangs up without saying a word.|$|E

5|$|Carlo Maggi, a Catholic {{acquaintance}} of Momolo's {{who was also}} a retired judge, sent a report of Lepori's refutation to Scazzocchio, who asked Antonelli to pass it on to the Pope. A cover letter attached to Maggi's statement described it as proof that Morisi's story was false. Scazzocchio also forwarded an affidavit from the Mortara family doctor, Pasquale Saragoni, who acknowledged that Edgardo had fallen sick when he was about a year old, but stated that he had never been in danger of dying, and that in any case Morisi had been herself bedridden at the time she was supposed to have baptised the boy. A further report sent from Bologna in October 1858, comprising the statements of eight women and one man, all Catholics, corroborated the doctor's claims about the sicknesses of Edgardo and Morisi respectively, and alleged that the former maid was given to theft and sexual impropriety. Four women, including the servant Anna Facchini and <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras, Elena Pignatti, claimed that Morisi had regularly flirted with Austrian officers and invited them into her employers' homes for sex.|$|E
5|$|While William Dyer {{appeared}} in the Boston records on several occasions, Mary Dyer had not {{caught the attention of}} the Massachusetts authorities until March 1638 as the Antinomian Controversy came to an end. Following Hutchinson's civil trial, she was kept as a prisoner in the home of a brother of one of the colony's ministers. Though she had been banished from the colony, this did not mean she was removed {{as a member of the}} Boston church. In March 1638 she was forced to face a church trial to get at the root of her heresies, and determine if her relationship with the Puritan church would continue. While William Dyer was likely with other men finding a new home away from Massachusetts, Mary Dyer was still in Boston and in attendance at this church trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Hutchinson was excommunicated, and as she was leaving the Boston Church, Mary stood and walked hand in hand with her out of the building. As the two women were leaving the church, a member of the congregation asked another person about the identity of the woman leaving the church with Hutchinson. A reply was made that it was <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had the monstrous birth. Governor Winthrop soon became aware of this verbal exchange and began conducting an investigation.|$|E

25|$|In December 2001, {{allegations}} were raised that, {{during his time}} as Archbishop of Brisbane, Hollingworth had failed to deal appropriately with sex abuse allegations made against a church teacher at Toowoomba Preparatory School. That month, the Brisbane Anglican diocese was ordered to pay $834,800 damages to <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{been found to have}} been sexually abused. Hetty Johnston, an advocate for child sex abuse victims, instigated a campaign calling for Hollingworth to resign. Hollingworth told the Australian media that, as a newly appointed archbishop at the time, he lacked the experience to handle the matter. He also said he had not believed that the case involved sexual abuse, but conceded he had not done enough to stop abuses occurring. Hollingworth subsequently apologised to the Toowoomba victim and released a formal statement condemning child sexual abuse but by February 2002, the Labor Opposition was calling for Hollingworth to be dismissed. Hollingworth stepped down from his positions as the Brisbane Lions' No 1 ticket holder, patron of Barnardos, Kids First Foundation and the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} Tristan film is 2006's Tristan & Isolde, {{produced}} by Tony Scott and Ridley Scott, written by Dean Georgaris, directed by Kevin Reynolds, and starring James Franco and Sophia Myles. In this version, Tristan is a Cornish warrior {{who was raised}} by Lord Marke after his parents were killed at a young age. In a fight with the Irish, Tristan defeats Morholt, the Irish King's second, but is poisoned in the process. The poison dulls all his senses and his companions believe him dead. He is sent off in a boat meant to cremate a dead body. Isolde, dismayed over her unwilling betrothal to Morholt, leaves her home and finds Tristan on the Irish coast. She tells Tristan that she is called Bragnae, which {{is the name of}} her maidservant. Isolde takes care of him and hides him from her father. They spend long days together and come to care for each other. Eventually they confess their feelings for one another and consummate their love. Tristan's boat is discovered and Isolde's father begins a search for a Cornish warrior in Ireland. Isolde helps Tristan escape but cannot leave with him. Tristan returns to England and learns of a tournament between the Cornish tribes for the hand of the Irish princess named Isolde. He agrees to participate to win the princess as Marke's wife. After winning the tournament and discovering that the princess is <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> rescued him, Tristan is devastated but decides to bury his feelings, because her marriage to Marke would end decades of bloodshed. Eventually Tristan cannot stand to be apart from Isolde any longer and they start their adulterous relationship. Later, they are found out but Marke frees them after hearing their story. Tristan, however, returns to defend Marke against a rebellion. He dies a hero, with Isolde at his side.|$|E

500|$|By 1820 Pickersgill {{had become}} {{sufficiently}} successful in her business {{to purchase the}} house she had been renting, and lived there {{for the remainder of}} her life. [...] Her business success allowed her to become active in addressing social issues such as housing, job placement, and financial aid for disadvantaged women, decades before these issues became prominent concerns in society. The Impartial Female Humane Society had been established to help needy Baltimore families with educating their children, and to help destitute women find employment. Pickersgill served as the president of this society from 1828 to 1851, and under her presidency a home for aged women was finally opened in West Baltimore in 1851 after a long planning and construction process. [...] Following her tenure as president, a home for aged men was then established adjacent to the women's home in 1869. [...] In 1959 the two homes were combined and moved from west Baltimore to Towson, Maryland, and in 1962 the new facility was named the [...] "Pickersgill Retirement Community" [...] in honor of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been instrumental in its creation.|$|E
