'It is a King cobra, and you have not killed it' replied Eha. The snake was put in a crate and sent to the BNHS with the note 'It may not survive the journey.

25|$|In January 1917, Germany resumed {{unrestricted}} submarine warfare, {{realizing it}} would mean American entry. The German Foreign Minister, in the Zimmermann Telegram, invited Mexico to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States. In return, the Germans would finance Mexico's war and help it recover the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The United Kingdom intercepted the message and presented it to the U.S. embassy in the U.K. From there it {{made its way to}} President Wilson who released the Zimmermann note to the public, and Americans saw it as casus belli. Wilson called on antiwar elements to end all wars, by winning <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> eliminating militarism from the globe. He argued that the war was so important that the U.S. had to have a voice in the peace conference. After the sinking of seven U.S. merchant ships by submarines and the publication of the Zimmermann telegram, Wilson called for war on Germany, which the U.S. Congress declared on 6 April 1917.|$|E

In 1947, Boyd discovered a fragment of an earlier draft in Jefferson's handwriting. Jefferson and Adams sent copies of the rough draft to friends, with slight variations.|$|E
500|$|The Charity Shield was {{presented}} to Bruce by former Arsenal manager Billy Wright. Wright died barely a year later, aged 70. Graham assumed both clubs would share the trophy, so {{when it came to}} a penalty shoot-out he entrusted his players to decide their order. He described Wright's goal as [...] "brilliant" [...] and felt it was [...] "unfortunate" [...] that Seaman missed: [...] "For a goalkeeper, he normally takes great penalties. He normally hits them hard but he decided to try and place <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> it didn't work." [...] Wright was unashamed of his penalty miss, [...] "…just as long as I don't do it when it is important".|$|E
500|$|There is {{much debate}} among historians and archaeologists {{concerning}} {{the dates of}} occupation of the Webster County village. Four Kitkehahki village sites on the Republican are known, two of them quite large: <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> <b>and</b> the Pawnee Indian Village Site near Republic, Kansas, [...] downstream. The band inhabited the Republican valley intermittently from the 1770s to the 1820s. Unfortunately, there is little information on which villages were occupied at what times, {{although there is a}} strong consensus that this village is the one visited by Pike in 1806. The following account, therefore, can only describe what is known about Kitkehahki occupation and abandonment of the Republican valley, and not the history of this particular village.|$|E

500|$|... "A Town Called Mercy" [...] and the {{previous}} episode, [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship", were the first episodes to be produced for the seventh series, and both were directed by Saul Metzstein. The two episodes are Metzstein's first Doctor Who credits. Much of the episode was filmed around the desert area of Almería, Spain, where studios have built Wild West-style streets {{that have been used}} in the making of over 100 Western-set films, such as A Fistful of Dollars. Filming the episode in Spain was cheaper than constructing a set in the UK. Moffat stated, [...] "We knew from the start we need some serious location shooting for <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> <b>and</b> given the most iconic American setting imaginable, there was only one place to go– Spain." [...] They reportedly filmed there from 8 March to 17 March 2012. Filming took place at Oasys/Mini Hollywood, and Fort Bravo/Texas Hollywood. While Smith was allowed to try riding the horse, most of the action shown in the episode was done by his stuntman. Composer Murray Gold mimicked Western-style scores when creating the music for the episode.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive reviews. [...] Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times, who reviewed B'Day negatively, {{wrote that}} [...] "Suga Mama" [...] was the [...] "best moment" [...] on the album, {{and that it}} [...] "owes much of its charm to lifts from Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers". Likewise, Bernard Zuel The Sydney Morning Herald cited [...] "Suga Mama" [...] {{as one of the}} [...] "good moments" [...] on B'Day, writing: [...] "... followed by a dud ... the slinky funk of 'Suga Mama' is trodden on by the mechanical 'Upgrade U' and then trampled by the posturing and eventually annoying 'Ring the Alarm'". Chris Richards of The Washington Post commented that Rich Harrison [...] "delivers again with 'Suga Mama', twisting a vintage Soul Searchers sample into a gritty, loping groove. Beyonce sounds right at home on <b>this</b> <b>one</b> ... <b>And</b> while it doesn't quite eclipse 'Crazy in Love', it's still B'Days finest moment." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic described [...] "Suga Mama" [...] as a [...] "spectacularly layered" [...] track.|$|E
500|$|To {{prevent a}} {{recurrence}} of disasters like <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926, the Florida State Legislature created the Okeechobee Flood Control District, which was authorized {{to cooperate with the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in flood control undertakings. After a personal inspection of the area by President Herbert Hoover, the Corps drafted a new plan which provided for the construction of floodway channels, control gates, and major levees along Lake Okeechobee's shores. A long term system was designed for the purpose of flood control, water conservation, prevention of saltwater intrusion, and preservation of fish and wildlife populations. One of the solutions was the construction of the Herbert Hoover Dike. Today, concerns related to the dike's stability have grown in response to studies indicating long term problems with [...] "piping" [...] and erosion. Leaks have been reported after several heavy rain events. Proposed solutions to the dike's problems have included the construction of a seepage berm on the landward side of the dike, with the first stage costing approximately $67million (US$).|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} {{a message of}} female strength, the song lyrics were described as [...] "goofy" [...] and [...] "fun" [...] by Larry Katz from the Boston Herald. Reading [...] "Just like the Calgon commercial / I really gotta get up out of here", Carey tells her lover that she is leaving him, making a [...] "clever" [...] reference to a commercial. In regards to the latter lyrics, Lawrence Farber from the Windy City Times wrote [...] "they are a playful approach to bitterness—and, more specifically, a cheatin' bad apple." [...] She then sings [...] "By {{the time you get}} this message / It's gonna be too late / So don't bother paging me / 'Cause I'll be on my way," [...] establishing that the relationship is over, and that he shouldn't even try to mend the situation.

500|$|Cornwallis {{departed}} Velhout, near Madras, on 5 February, reaching Vellore on 11 February. [...] After {{several days}} of rest, the army set out with the apparent intention of crossing the Eastern Ghats directly west of Vellore. [...] However, this was a feint, and Cornwallis turned the army north and instead crossed the mountains at Muglee. Tipu, who had taken steps to defend the more southerly passes, had not defended <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> <b>and</b> the army met no resistance. [...] In fact, it met no significant resistance until it neared Bangalore, {{one of the strongest}} fortresses in eastern Mysore. On 5 March, Colonel John Floyd, leader of the British cavalry, was lured into a trap set by Tipu that cost the army 70 men and 250 valuable horses. Cornwallis brushed off the loss and proceeded to besiege Bangalore. [...] On 7 March the city's walls were breached, and the city was stormed through the opening, sending its defenders scurrying. [...] Cornwallis gained control of the whole city except its fortress, which was stormed on the night of 21 March after its walls were breached. Tipu, from his camps outside the city, offered only weak resistance, ineffectually attempting to impede the siegeworks and assist the besieged fortress during the final assault.|$|E
500|$|The portion from Boulevard to {{near the}} Imperial County line was {{included}} in the California Highway Commission budget for 1965–1966. A [...] extension from Mountain Springs west to what was then known as Road J-35 was given $3.3million (about $ in [...] dollars) in funding by the Highway Commission in May 1965. The [...] section in between <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>and</b> the Mountain Springs pass section was in planning by that September, and was scheduled to begin the building phase shortly thereafter, with the section extending west of Boulevard to follow. That section, from Crestwood to Boulevard, was to begin construction soon after the $3million (about $ in [...] dollars) contract was given out in January 1966. The coming of the freeway from both west and east of Jacumba was projected to be a significant event {{in the history of the}} town. Cafes and gas stations went out of business once the freeway bypassed the town; however, many retirees relocated into the town since the high traffic levels were gone. The labeling of the town Boulevard as Manzanita on I-8 signs raised controversy and forced the Division of Highways to obscure the name on the signs until the issue was resolved.|$|E
