5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{came under}} navy control, {{and the first}} maintenance rules were laid down. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> to be lit and extinguished in strict accordance to sunrise and sunset. In cloudy weather lighthouse keepers were to consult a calendar for the necessary data. At that time, <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> kept burning nightly from 1 July to 1 May– 10 months of the year.|$|E
5|$|During {{the height}} of the typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam, a {{gasoline}} tank caught fire, believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne and spreading the fire to other nearby tanks. The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire. While <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> burning, transportation of gasoline from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public.|$|E
5|$|Early in his reign, Constantinople {{suffered}} a massive fire, which destroyed houses, churches, and completely incinerated the huge library built by Emperor Julian. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> {{seen as a}} bad omen {{for the rule of}} Basiliscus.|$|E
50|$|While {{the causes}} of <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> undetermined, it was {{believed}} {{to be the result of}} faulty electrical wiring. <b>The</b> <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> partly responsible for the formation of Boomer Lake and OSU’s fire training program.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> under {{investigation}} {{and is the}} subject of a Public Inquiry.

5|$|After {{four minutes}} of deliberation, the jury's foreman {{announced}} a guilty verdict and {{a sentence of}} death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were pushed aside by a surge of spectators, who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed {{around his neck and}} he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack of fingers. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching, including Washington's bones and links of the chain. One attendee kept part of Washington's genitalia; a group of children snapped the teeth out of Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time that <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> {{attacked}} from <b>the</b> {{upwind side}} by lightly swatting out the flames or glows with the thick flap. When the flapper {{hits the ground}} , the oxygen supply to <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> stopped and <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> will <b>be</b> extinguished. Where ground cover is short, the flapper can <b>be</b> dragged along <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> edge to smother <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> If used too hard it can add more oxygen to <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> It <b>is</b> often recommended to either hose water on the area or keep it under observation, as {{there will always be}} a risk of it flaring up later.|$|R
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> {{going into}} its sixth hour it had spread {{up to the}} 26th floor. With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters stretched hoses up the building's stairwells to help fight the fire. While hoses were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved the hose streams, but the fire had engulfed several floors {{and could not be}} contained with just hoses. By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able to get control of the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E
5|$|At about 8:30am {{the wooden}} {{construction}} of {{the main part of}} the building also burned through and collapsed. Despite the fact that there were still people in the building and more people were lying around the building severely injured, the fire fighters decided to withdraw. The fire department proceeded to extinguish the smoking debris, and at 9:30am <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> declared under control. The building's collapse left a gaping hole; of the hotel, the furniture store and the book store, almost nothing remained.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters {{were able}} to save over 100 {{people out of the}} 180 {{families}} inhabiting the high-rise apartment building. According to Al Jazeera, the fire began at the scaffolding that surrounded the building, but spread to the complex's main building of around 500 apartments. Xinhua News Agency said <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> contained at about 6:30pm local time (10:30 UTC), more than four hours after it began.|$|E

5|$|On 23 November 1984, during {{renovation}} works, {{the station}} suffered a severe fire which burned out the northbound Victoria line platform. It {{is believed that}} <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> caused by smoking materials being pushed through a ventilation grille into a storeroom where they set several materials on fire. This caused the Victoria line between Warren Street and Victoria to be suspended until 18 December the same year. This incident also led to a smoking ban being introduced on trains in July 1984.|$|E
5|$|Sir Oliver Popplewell {{published}} his {{inquiry into the}} fire in 1986, which introduced new safety legislation for sports grounds across the country. Forensic scientist David Woolley believed the cause of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> from a discarded cigarette or match, which had dropped through gaps between the seating to a void below the stand where rubbish had built up. A number of police officers and 22spectators were later awarded bravery awards for their deeds on the day.|$|E

5|$|The {{buildings}} are considered fireproof by the New York City Fire Department because partitions between individual units {{are designed to}} stop the spread of flames, also known as compartmentalization. This is evidenced by a 2004 fire caused by a cigarette, where no one was seriously injured because <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> self-contained.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty. One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, {{and the opening of}} the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory that <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, {{there was no evidence of}} a burglary.|$|E
