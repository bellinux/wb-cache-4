5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of <b>the</b> <b>linen</b> industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources {{and partly because of}} the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E
5|$|Brownlow and {{his family}} were {{released}} by the forces of Lord Conway, and as the rebellion ended they returned to their estate in Lurgan. William Brownlow died in 1660, but the family went on to {{contribute to the development of}} <b>the</b> <b>linen</b> industry which peaked in the town in the late 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Canvaswork {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>linen</b> ground was covered entirely by tent, gobelin, or cross {{stitches}} in wool or silk thread was {{often used for}} cushion covers and small bags. Notable examples like the Bradford carpet, a pictorial table cover, were likely the work of professionals in the Broderers' Company.|$|E
50|$|The word {{translated}} as seeth/saw {{is closer to}} examine, implying that Peter is paying detailed attention to <b>the</b> strips of <b>linen.</b> This contrasts with the previous verse, where the Greek implies the Beloved Disciple gave a much shorter glance to <b>the</b> <b>linens.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cleaning {{household}} linens is done {{as appropriate}} {{to the type of}} cloth. Household linens are most likely to have stains from organic sources such as food, blood, and soil. If <b>the</b> <b>linens</b> are made of natural fibres such as <b>linen</b> or cotton, <b>the</b> cloth will need to be rinsed as soon as possible in cold water to prevent the stain from becoming permanent. Stains from red wine, or red or purple berries and fruit are an exception and must be washed in boiling water, yet despite this, these stains may be impossible to remove. Otherwise, regular washing of household linens should be done in hot water for hygienic reasons, to destroy bacteria left on <b>the</b> <b>linens</b> from frequent use. Linen and cotton that are white may also become yellow over time, but this is eliminated by bleaching, either with liquid bleach, or by the traditional method of hanging <b>the</b> <b>linens</b> in <b>the</b> sun to let the sunlight bleach out the discoloration.|$|R

5|$|Glue binder {{was often}} used as an {{inexpensive}} alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of <b>the</b> <b>linen</b> cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived. Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c.1415–25) and Bouts' Entombment (c.1440–55). The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the glaze.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood. Blood was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its shroud or coffin and its left eye was often open. It would be clad in <b>the</b> <b>linen</b> shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature. Although vampires were generally described as undead, some folktales spoke of them as living beings.|$|E
5|$|Lurgan has {{historically}} been an industrial town in which <b>the</b> <b>linen</b> industry predominated {{as a source of}} employment during the Industrial Revolution, and is said to have employed as many as 18,000 handloom weavers {{at the end of the}} 19th century, a figure significantly higher than the town's resident population at the time. That particular branch of the textile industry declined as consumer tastes changed, but other textiles continued to be produced in the town providing a major source of employment until the 1990s and 2000s when the textile industry across the UK suffered a major decline as a result of outsourcing to low wage countries.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{long history}} of <b>the</b> {{production}} of <b>linen</b> in Ireland. <b>The</b> Living <b>Linen</b> Project was set up in 1995 as an oral archive of the knowledge of <b>the</b> Irish <b>linen</b> industry, which was at that time still available within a nucleus of people who formerly worked in the industry in Ulster.|$|R
25|$|During the 18th century, <b>the</b> {{trade in}} <b>linen</b> overtook that in wool, peaking at over 12 million yards {{produced}} in 1775. Production remained in cottage industry units but the trading conditions were locked {{into the modern}} economy and gave rise to institutions such as <b>the</b> British <b>Linen</b> Bank. By 1770, Glasgow was <b>the</b> largest <b>linen</b> manufacturer in Britain.|$|R

5|$|The cloth {{support is}} visible {{in areas where the}} paint was thinly applied. Rusty nail holes {{can be seen in the}} lower border and across the top of the picture in an area of sky that was {{initially}} covered by frame. They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional joiners who worked independently of the painter. The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first laid down. The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails; the nails would have been used to attach <b>the</b> <b>linen</b> to the underlying wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>linen</b> {{industry}} was {{widespread in the}} Fylde during the 18thcentury and Poulton's importation of flax was essential. There were large warehouses at Skippool and Wardleys, owned by linen merchants from Kirkham. By the 19thcentury, craftsmen in Poulton were {{an important part of}} the industry. In the early part of the 19thcentury, there was a significant decline in the craft industries because of increased mechanisation, as well as increased demand for labour. In contrast to neighbouring Kirkham, Poulton appeared to suffer from a lack of enthusiasm for new industrial techniques and opportunities among its industry leaders.|$|E
5|$|Þorgerðr and Irpa {{are again}} {{mentioned}} together in chapter 88 of Njáls saga, {{set in the}} 10th and 11th centuries. Here, Hrapp breaks into the temple owned by Haakon and Gudbrand while Haakon is at a feast at Gudbrand's home. Hrapp plunders a seated depiction of Þorgerðr; he takes a large gold ring from her plus <b>the</b> <b>linen</b> hood she is wearing. Next, Hrapp spots a depiction of Thor and Thor's wain. He takes a gold ring from the depiction of Thor too, and, thirdly, he takes a ring from a depiction of Irpa there. Hrapp takes all of the images from the temple, strips them of their items, and then burns the temple until leaving at dawn.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Edinburgh-based British <b>Linen</b> was [...] "the only British bank to {{be formed}} {{on the basis}} of an {{industrial}} charter" [...] and, as the name suggests, its roots lay in <b>the</b> Scottish <b>linen</b> industry. <b>The</b> original driving force behind the formation of <b>the</b> British <b>Linen</b> Company (as it was first named) was Andrew Fletcher, Lord Milton. He was a lawyer landowner, had been active in the promotion of The Royal Bank of Scotland and, according to Checkland, [...] "from 1735 to 1766 he was the most important man in the politics of Scotland." [...] He had helped establish the Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland and was the chairman of <b>the</b> board's <b>Linen</b> Committee.

25|$|In December 2011 {{scientists}} at Italy's National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Development ENEA deduced from the STURP results that {{the color of}} the Shroud image is the result of an accelerated aging process of <b>the</b> <b>linen,</b> similar to the yellowing of the paper of ancient books. They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to ultraviolet light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means. When subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like <b>the</b> <b>linen</b> of the Shroud. They also determined that UV radiation changes the crystalline structure of cellulose in a similar manner as aging and long-duration background radiation.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1620s, styles were relaxing. Ruffs were {{discarded}} {{in favor}} of wired collars which were called rebatos in continental Europe and, later, wide, flat collars. By the 1630s and 1640s, collars were accompanied by kerchiefs similar to <b>the</b> <b>linen</b> kerchiefs worn by middle-class women in the previous century; often the collar and kerchief were trimmed with matching lace.|$|E
25|$|In a {{characteristic}} style of 1625–1650, hair was worn in loose waves to the shoulders on the sides, {{with the rest}} of the hair gathered or braided into a high bun at the back of the head. A short fringe or bangs might be worn with this style. Very fashionable married women abandoned <b>the</b> <b>linen</b> cap and wore their hair uncovered or with a hat.|$|E
25|$|William Warren Barbour, {{the third}} of four brothers, was born in 1888 to Colonel William Barbour and his wife, Julia Adelaide Sprague, in Monmouth Beach, Monmouth County, New Jersey.

50|$|The topmost cloth was <b>the</b> fair <b>linen,</b> a {{long white}} linen cloth laid over <b>the</b> two <b>linen</b> cloths. It had the same depth as the mensa of the altar, but was longer, {{generally}} hanging over the edges to within {{a few inches of}} the floor or, according to some authorities, it should hang 18 inches over the ends of the mensa. On an altar without antependium and consisting of the mensa resting on columns or made after the fashion of a tomb <b>the</b> topmost <b>linen</b> did not have to overhang the edges at the sides. It could be trimmed with lace on the ends and could be ornamented with figures of chalices, hosts and the like. Five small crosses might be embroidered on <b>the</b> fair <b>linen</b> - one to fall at each corner of the mensa, and one {{in the middle of the}} front edge. These symbolised the five wounds of Jesus. <b>The</b> fair <b>linen</b> should be left on the altar at all times. When removed for replacement, it should be rolled, not folded. It symbolized the shroud in which Jesus was wrapped for burial.|$|R
