25|$|The {{completion}} in 1856 of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad provided {{the impetus for}} the establishment of the iron and steel industry in Newburgh by linking the mills to sources for raw materials, opening up regional markets for iron and steel, and for allowing Cleveland to serve as a <b>transshipment</b> <b>center</b> for iron ore to inland areas. That same year, the Grasselli Chemical Company opened on the Cuyahoga River (near the modern intersection of Broadway Avenue and E. 30th Street) to supply chemicals to the iron industry. Although Grasselli Chemicals was located outside the Union-Miles Park neighborhood, Czech and Polish immigrants, seeking work in the plant, began settling along Broadway Avenue nearby.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} two decades of Spanish rule, the {{settlement}} of the Bolivian highlands — now known as Upper (Alto) Peru or Charcas — was delayed by a civil war between the forces of Pizarro and those of Almagro.

Fighting broke out in 1537 when Almagro seized Cuzco after suppressing the Manco Inca rebellion. Pizarro defeated and executed Almagro in 1538, following the Battle of Las Salinas, but was himself assassinated three years later by former supporters of Almagro. Pizarro's brother Gonzalo assumed control of Upper Peru but soon became embroiled in a rebellion against the Spanish crown.

25|$|The first {{iron foundry}} {{in the greater}} Cleveland area was founded in 1834. By 1837, there were four foundries, and by 1846 there were six. All of these were small and {{produced}} inferior-quality products, as they relied on the poor-quality iron ore found in Ohio. The metals industry in Cleveland in 1860 consisted of just three shops, which manufactured iron bar and plate. The completion in 1856 of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad through the city provided {{the impetus for the}} establishment of the iron and steel industry in Cleveland by linking the mills to sources for raw materials, opening up regional markets for iron and steel, and for allowing Cleveland to serve as a <b>transshipment</b> <b>center</b> for high-quality hematite ore from the Marquette Iron Range to inland areas. The establishment of what would become the Cleveland Rolling Mill in 1856 proved to be the starting point of the emergence of a vast steel industry in Cleveland.

40|$|In recent years, {{traditional}} urban distribution {{systems have}} undergone major structural changes {{as a result}} of the increasing power of customers demanding greater variety of quality products at a low cost. This has increased the competition between businesses and at the same time more complicated and longer supply chains have emerged {{as a result of}} the globalization of many businesses in their search for low cost production locations and access to new skills. In response hub-and-spoke systems are increasingly used to deal with product flows from numerous origins and to many destinations. As a result, a growing number of studies examine the establishment of various forms of inter-modal <b>transshipment</b> <b>centers</b> to minimize the road use in city centers and support the frequent and rapid replenishment of goods at retail and catering outlets. To this end, this paper examines the establishment of a consolidation center servicing nearly 100 businesses that operate in an urban shopping mall in Southampton U. K. Through the review of numerous existing U. K. and international consolidation schemes and the examination of their operational characteristics, this paper aims to identify potential strengths, weaknesses and risks that would impact its operation. Various operational scenarios considering different business take-up combinations, vehicle delivery mixes, fill rates and back-load practices are examined to elucidate the potential transport and environmental effects of the consolidation scheme. To accurately quantify and verify these effects, a multi-stage analysis framework is developed including data collection, map routing, emissions assessment and scenarios building activities. <br/...|$|R
