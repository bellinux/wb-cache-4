A remarkable feature of <b>the</b> weak <b>in-plane</b> anisotropy is <b>the</b> abrupt change of its sign at the spin-flop point. This anisotropy switching disappears at the tilting of magnetic field to the easy axis by the angle of 10 ^∘ within the plane. The nature of the abrupt anisotropy reversal remains unclear.
