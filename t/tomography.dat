5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} usually {{diagnosed}} {{based on the}} person's medical history, history from relatives, and behavioural observations. The presence of characteristic neurological and neuropsychological features {{and the absence of}} alternative conditions is supportive. Advanced medical imaging with computed <b>tomography</b> (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and with single-photon emission computed <b>tomography</b> (SPECT) or positron emission <b>tomography</b> (PET) can be used to help exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia. Moreover, it may predict conversion from prodromal stages (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine-18 {{is often}} found in {{radioactive}} tracers for positron emission <b>tomography,</b> as its half-life of almost two hours is long enough to allow for its transport from production facilities to imaging centers.

40|$|We compute <b>tomographies</b> of 2 D fast-ion {{velocity}} distribution functions from synthetic collective Thomson scattering (CTS) and fast-ion D-alpha (FIDA) 1 D measurements {{using a new}} reconstruction prescription. Contradicting {{conventional wisdom}} we demonstrate that one single 1 D CTS or FIDA view suffices to compute accurate <b>tomographies</b> of arbitrary 2 D functions under idealized conditions. Under simulated experimental conditions, single-view <b>tomographies</b> do not resemble the original fast-ion velocity distribution functions but nevertheless show their coarsest features. For CTS or FIDA systems with many simultaneous views on the same measurement volume, the resemblance improves {{with the number of}} available views, even if the resolution in each view is varied inversely proportional to the number of views, so that the total number of measurements in all views is the same. With a realistic four-view system, <b>tomographies</b> of a beam ion velocity distribution function at ASDEX Upgrade reproduce the general shape of the function and the location of the maxima at full and half injection energy of the beam ions. By applying our method to real many-view CTS or FIDA measurements, one could determine <b>tomographies</b> of 2 D fast-ion velocity distribution functions experimentally...|$|R

Compared to simulated CT projection data, real measurements allowed less improvements in image quality. Neither could metal artifacts be eliminated completely, nor was there a significant gain regarding the presentation of anatomical structures in the immediate neighbourhood of metal objects. Reduction of global image noise, however, was clearly recognizable. For further processing of the <b>tomographies</b> including several applications {{in the field of}} radiation therapy, this promises improved accuracy and numerical stability. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this work, signal {{processing}} techniques are combined with non-destructive evaluation (NDE) {{to evaluate the}} capability for detecting defects in historic walls. To join this aim, ashlar masonry walls of 3 x 2 x 0. 2 m have been made at laboratory facilities with controlled and localized defects. These scale walls have been inspected by means ultrasound and ground penetrating radar (GPR) with loads of different weights (0 Tn, 10 Tn, 50 Tn and 80 Tn). The ultrasonic and GPR signals provided <b>tomographies</b> that have been improved by means processing techniques. Re-lated to ultrasonic <b>tomographies,</b> kriging algo-rithm have been implemented for visualization improvement. By the other hand, novelty dif-ferential <b>tomographies</b> have demonstrated their sensibility to defects. Related to GPR, different algorithms {{have been developed to}} improve the tomographies: elimination of the background noise, depth resolution enhancing and automat-ic detection and correction of hyperbolas due to radiation pattern of the antenna. Finally, it is concluded the added value of {{signal processing}} applied to NDE for the detection of defects in historic walls.

40|$|A {{geophysical}} study {{by means of}} electrical resistivity and induced polarization <b>tomographies</b> {{was carried out in}} the landfill site of Bellolampo (Palermo, Italy) to check the integrity of the landfill liner and to detect possible leachate plumes. Preliminarily, synthetic tests were performed, simulating acquisition data along profiles placed above resistivity distribution, suitable to represent landfills protected with an high-density polyethylene (HDPE) liner at the bottom or with possible leachate plumes. Optimized array data sets for parallel measurements have been tested in order to assess the resolution and the effectiveness of tomographic images, comparing inversions with and without the constraint of the HDPE liner position. Based on the obtained results, three electrical <b>tomographies</b> have been planned and carried out directly over the landfill and nearby. The results provided useful information for identifying the electrical properties of the rock, waste, and leachate; for identifying snags and disruption of the tank bottom liner; and for pointing out possible polluting leachate nearby and below the landfill...|$|R

5|$|Until the 1950s, the {{diagnosis}} of pituitary disease remained based on clinical features and visual field examination, sometimes aided by pneumoencephalography and X-ray <b>tomography.</b> Nevertheless, the field of pituitary surgery developed during this time. The major breakthrough in diagnosis came {{with the discovery of}} radioimmunoassay by Rosalyn Yalow and Solomon Berson in the late 1950s. This allowed the direct measurement of the hormones of the pituitary, which {{as a result of their}} low concentrations in blood had previously been hard to measure. Stimulation tests were developed in the 1960s, and in 1973 the triple bolus test was introduced, a test that combined stimulation testing with insulin, GnRH and TRH. Imaging of the pituitary, and therefore identification of tumors and other structural causes, improved radically with the introduction of computed <b>tomography</b> in the late 1970s and magnetic resonance imaging in the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|Geophysical {{surveys are}} {{carried out in the}} coastal area of Petrosino (south-western Sicily) to study the time {{evolution}} of seawater contamination of the coastal aquifer, probably increased due to human impact. The overexploitation of the aquifer, due to an intensive agricultural use has affected significantly the natural hydro-geochemical state of the basin. The study is based on a processing and integrated analysis of hydrogeological, geochemical and geophysical data. In particular {{in the last two years}} seasonal time-lapse electrical resistivity <b>tomographies</b> (ERT), new TDEM soundings and Multi-Analysis Surface Wave soundings (MASW) have been carried out. The interpretation of the total set of previously existing and new geophysical data made it possible to reconstruct a three-dimensional model of the electrical resistivity of the aquifer, aimed at defining the extent and geometry of the seawater intrusion. Furthermore, the execution of a series of high-resolution time-lapse electrical <b>tomographies</b> and a correlation analysis between geophysical measures and geo-chemical, geological and hydrogeological data allowed to discriminate the effects of the salt con-centration in the groundwater and the porosity and saturation degree of the rock on the time varia-tions of the measured electrical resistivity. Finally, the average porosity of the rocks forming th...|$|R
