In the total dataset and frozen mashed potatoes, frozen/thawed mashed potatoes, and MPA subgroups, component 1 was a contrast between mechanical and surface textural attributes, whereas in MPB samples component 1 was determined by geometrical attributes.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} {{to evaluate the use}} of High Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography (HPSEC) of polar compounds of refined, mild deodorized, <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oils as well as of their blends, in attempting to reveal significant differences in the amounts of the substance classes constituting polar compounds among these oils. Two sets of blends were prepared by mixing an <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil with both refined and mild deodorized olive oils in increasing amounts. The obtained data highlighted that the triacylglycerol oligopolymers were absent or present in traces in the <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil, while their mean amount was equal to 0. 04 g/ 100 g and 0. 72 g/ 100 g in mild deodorized and refined olive oils, respectively. Oxidized triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols were more abundant in mild deodorized oil and refined oil than in <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil. The Factorial Discriminant Analysis of the data showed that the HPSEC analysis could reveal the presence of refined/mild deodorized oils in <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oils. In particular, the classification functions obtained allowed designation of mixtures containing at least 30 g/ 100 g of mild deodorized oil and all those containing refined olive oil as deodorized oil, therefore as oils subjected to at least a mild refining treatment...|$|R

The basic quality tests considered in the formula are Rancimat® or induction time (IND); 1, 2 -diacylglycerols (DAGs); pyropheophytin a (PPP); and free fatty acids (FFA).

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out to evaluate the quality of taralli {{as a function of}} the type of oil used in their dough formulation. To this end, 4 types of oil (<b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil, olive oil, olive-pomace oil, and refined palm oil) were utilized to prepare taralli to investigate on the lipid fraction degradation and evaluate the taralli acceptability by consumers. The data obtained pointed out that taralli manufactured with <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil were significantly more appreciated than those made with refined oils due to their visual appearance and odor. Moreover, with respect to the other kinds of oil, the use of <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil led to significantly lower values (P < 0. 05) of specific absorption at 232 and 270 nm (K(232) and K(270), respectively) and of triacylglycerol oligopolymers. It also proved to present a much lower content in oxidized triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols than olive-pomace oil and refined palm oil, respectively. Furthermore, trans fatty acid isomers were absent in taralli made with <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil but were constantly present in those produced with refined oils...|$|R

40|$|The main {{conclusions}} of the FLAIR project can be summarized as follows: 1. The sensory wheel {{set up by the}} FLAIR team is proposed as a European standard to evaluate the sensory profile of <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil. 2. Preference studies demonstrate that the sensory profile of <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil should be optimized as a function of consumer expectations. Once a sensory profile has been selected, it must be used as a reference for product standardization. 3. Sensory analysis cannot be used as a legal tool for evaluating the quality or the origin of <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oils. It is suggested that a sensory test can only be used as a legal tool if it is applied to assess the absence of defects. This implies a modification of the COI test. 4. The Good Manufacturing Practices set up by the Flair team are proposed as a European standard for process control and quality system certification. 5. Nutritional studies demonstrate that <b>extra</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> oil has a noticeable in vivo antioxidant activity.
