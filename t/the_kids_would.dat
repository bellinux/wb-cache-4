25|$|During the 1950s, the U.S. {{automakers}} were commissioning {{models of}} their cars from suppliers that included AMT and Jo-Han. Automobile sales people realized that, as one slogan of the time put it, “the little ones sell the big ones”. The promise of a free toy car for <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> entice families into showrooms to view the latest car designs and take them for test drives.|$|E
25|$|Far from {{endangering}} kids, teen dances keep kids safe. If {{the young}} people hadn't been at a crowded public dance overseen by extensive security (19 guards were at CHAC on Saturday night) where no one got hurt, <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> likely have been out at unchaperoned and completely unregulated house parties—not after the dance, but all night. And, without a fat calendar of all-ages events, that's {{where they would be}} every weekend. Because without organized all-ages dances and live-music events, house parties and parking lots are all kids have.|$|E
25|$|The pilot {{aired on}} June 11, 1987, but NBC {{had decided not}} to pick up the series even before it was shown. Tartikoff didn't want to give up on the show, though, and made a deal with the Disney Channel to air {{thirteen}} episodes of the series in prime time. If the initial order did well, Disney was prepared to order an additional seven-seven. The show was completely retooled, with Mills the sole remaining cast member from the pilot. Miss Bliss's class was changed from the sixth grade to the eight grade, and <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> be more central to the story.|$|E
50|$|Teams played individually. <b>The</b> <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> have 3 {{attempts}} {{to try and}} knock a soccer ball into a goal using a remote controlled car. At the same time, the adult will defend the goal with a RC car. Each successful goal is worth 10 points for a maximum of 30 points.|$|R

5000|$|The Regulators {{would go}} through three {{different}} leaders, all but one being killed. Although Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>would</b> achieve fame {{as a member of}} the Regulators, he never led them. Their first leader was Richard [...] "Dick" [...] Brewer, killed later by Buckshot Roberts and replaced by Frank McNab, who was killed by members of the Seven Rivers Warriors. McNab was replaced by the Regulators final leader, Doc Scurlock.|$|R
500|$|When a boy asked Timberlake for his {{autograph}} at the Giants' rookie camp in 1965, Timberlake {{signed his}} name but also wrote citations to two Bible verses: [...] and 1 Peter 1:5–9. [...] The boy asked, [...] "What's that?" [...] Timberlake explained they were Bible verses, {{and he told}} reporters he started doing it about six months earlier, hoping <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> look up the verses. [...] In 1965, such public religious expressions were not common among athletes, and columnists made note {{of the fact that}} Timberlake [...] "packs a Bible in his suitcase and keeps one in his locker." ...|$|E
500|$|The Seventh Victim did not {{fare well}} with audiences. A cinema {{proprietor}} in South Carolina reported that theatergoers were disappointed: [...] "We {{must have been}} the eighth victim; patrons walked out. Business poor. Some of <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> not sit through it." [...] A.C. Edwards, a theater employee in Scotia, California, said it was [...] "without doubt the most unsatisfactory picture we have any recollection of." [...] The failure to generate considerable income at the box office (on top of the financial failure of Lewton and Robson's follow-up picture, The Ghost Ship) would result in Lewton scrapping two planned projects, The Screaming Skull and The Amorous Ghost.|$|E
500|$|Guest {{stars in}} the episode include Tim Robbins as Jim Hope, Gary Coleman as himself, Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony, and Clarence Clemons as a narrator. Scully thought Robbins [...] "did a great job" [...] because the Simpsons staff wanted the {{character}} of Jim Hope to be [...] "fun and upbeat and somebody <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> love." [...] Clemons narrates a few scenes {{at the end of}} the episode, telling the viewers how the story ends. When Coleman agrees to spend Christmas with the Simpsons, Clemons says, for example: [...] "And Gary Coleman was as good as his word, and as for old Mr. Burns, he was visited by three ghosts during the night and agreed to fund the school with some money he found in his tuxedo pants." [...] Shortly after Coleman's death in 2010, an article appeared in the newspaper El Comercio that noted that [...] "the nod to the harsh reality of Gary Coleman in [...] is given: in real life a few years ago Gary had to make a living as a shop security guard." ...|$|E
5000|$|In late 1877 {{the gang}} {{was hired by}} the [...] "Murphy-Dolan faction" [...] prior to and {{eventually}} during the Lincoln County War, to face off against Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> and his faction. Despite the fame that Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>would</b> eventually receive due to the war, by many accounts Evans was the most feared of the two factions. Evans and members of his gang harassed rancher John Tunstall, and on February 18, 1878, Evans, Frank Baker, William Morton, and Tom Hill murdered Tunstall, which ignited the Lincoln County War.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Caballero's Way", {{in which}} Porter's most famous character, <b>the</b> Cisco <b>Kid,</b> is introduced. It was first {{published}} in 1907 in the July issue of Everybody's Magazine and collected in the book Heart of the West that same year. In later film and TV depictions, <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>would</b> be portrayed as a dashing adventurer, perhaps skirting the edges of the law, but primarily {{on the side of the}} angels. In the original short story, the only story by Porter to feature <b>the</b> character, <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> is a murderous, ruthless border desperado, whose trail is dogged by a heroic Texas Ranger. The twist ending is, unusually for Porter, tragic.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; but I {{could have}} done some work these last three years and made it not matter whether it failed or not. You can't comfort me out of that knowledge. I knew all along that I was being a waster and a loafer, but I was so happy that I didn't mind. I was so {{interested}} in seeing what you and <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> do next that I didn't seem {{to have time to}} work. And the result is that I've gone right back.|$|R
500|$|In {{his review}} of [...] "The Food Wife", HitFix's Alan Sepinwall commended it for [...] "stay true to the characters. Of course <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> {{consider}} Homer to be the fun dad on those occasions when he's actually making an effort, and of course Marge would feel jealous of this. And if she goes too far in trying to keep this as her special thing, she also recognizes it immediately, feels guilty throughout the meal and then heads off to save the day, complete with a great homage to the climax of Ratatouille." [...] Sepinwall also praised the episode for being [...] "packed with great jokes", such as Heidecker and Wareheim's hip hop song and the scenes at the video game convention where the screen turns into a first-person shooter game. Similarly, Haydens Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "funny and well-observed", giving it a B+ grade, and cited the hip hop song as {{the highlight of the}} episode. He also praised Bourdain, Batali, and Ramsay, and stated that he wished Bourdain would have gotten a bigger part in the episode. Childs further wrote that [...] "The best thing about this episode is that it doesn’t try to stuff any outlandish plot mechanics or out-of-character character moments down the viewers’ throats. It sticks to the basics: the family dynamic combined with gentle mocking of a still-current fad. I say 'still-current' because although it is probably true that food blogging is a bit past its expiration date in some cities, I don’t think that it has been overdone everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Stamp {{designed}} {{the cover of}} the UK version of Are You Experienced, which featured a picture of Hendrix, Mitchell, and Redding by Bruce Fleming. The image shows Hendrix wearing a long dark cape while standing over Mitchell and Redding, striking what Egan described as a [...] "Dracula-esque pose". Chandler contacted Fleming based on the photographer's previous work with the Hollies, the Dave Clark Five, and the Animals. The photo shoot took place in February after Fleming had attended several recording sessions and Experience gigs. Chandler made a point of requesting that the band member's faces be clearly visible in the photograph; Fleming explained: [...] " [...] got much more esoteric as time went on, but to establish the artist we had to get their faces across so <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> recognize them." [...] He took monochrome and color shots of the band; Track selected an image from the latter group. Fleming had indicated which picture he preferred they use, marking the shot with a cross, but after the album's release he realized that they had selected another, less desirable image. According to Fleming, the shot that he chose was [...] "more sinister; more interesting". Stamp hired graphic artist Alan Aldridge to design the sleeve's psychedelic lettering. Track inexplicably put only the album's title on the cover, omitting the band's name; Polydor issued the release throughout Europe with Hendrix's name printed at the top in matching font. The cover art's combination of dull green and brown tones, juxtaposed with the jocular nature of the subject's pose, created a weak overall visual impression; Stamp commented: [...] "It's not a great cover at all. Hopefully, we made up for that in all the other covers." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} Thelma, on {{the other}} hand, was first written as a character who [...] "had kids and stuff like that, but I realized that she couldn’t have kids. The idea that Darryl wanted her to wait, because <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> be a sacrifice for him financially, fit perfectly. And, of course, she’s really a child herself. I had {{to set it up}} that way. I love to laugh, and I wanted this to be a movie you were enjoying and having a good time with because you were watching these women get their lives. Even though they would lose them, they were becoming more and more themselves. It was a beautiful experience, a liberating experience to watch that." ...|$|E
50|$|It was {{announced}} that <b>The</b> Thin <b>Kids</b> <b>would</b> tour with British top 10 artist Kate Nash. In early 2012 the band released a double a side vinyl with Kate Nash for record store day in the UK, then again in 2013 <b>The</b> Thin <b>Kids</b> released another double A-side with Kate Nash.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> two <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> then play [...] "Wheels Of Fire". Similar to the Hamster Wheel on Double Dare, each <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> {{get inside}} a large wheel and run inside it {{to move it}} across a track. Again, the first to knock over a pole {{at the finish line}} won two Contraptiles, while the runner up won one.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{once wrote}} of Froug, [...] "I know an old writer. His name is William Froug, {{he lives in}} Florida {{and if you look}} him up on Amazon, you will see he is still writing {{brilliant}} and useful books about screenwriting and teleplays. He is not merely as sharp as a tack, he is the standard by which they sharpen tacks. If he had been advising <b>the</b> <b>kid,</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> have made a better movie, and if he had been advising the director of 'The Man in the Chair,' we would have been spared the current experience. Just because you're old doesn't mean {{you have to be a}} decrepit caricature. One thing that keeps Froug young is that, unlike Flash Madden, he almost certainly does not sit on an expressway overpass guzzling Jack Daniels from a pint bottle." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Simpsons later {{have dinner}} at Luigi's Restaurant, where Homer remains miserable. Luigi Risotto {{introduces}} {{him to his}} saucier, who he claims can tell what someone's life could have been like by stirring tomato sauce in a certain way. By using his magical tomato sauce, he helps Homer see what his {{life would have been}} like if he had won the election: Homer would have been rich, he would have had a better position at the nuclear plant, would have lived in a mansion on the site where the Flanders now live, been closer to Abe that he would live in the house the Simpsons currently live, and would not be bald. <b>The</b> <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> not have been born because Homer would have remembered to use protection before sex (apparently, Marge is confused by this).|$|E
2500|$|Hepburn toured Central America in February 1989, and {{met with}} leaders in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In April, she visited Sudan with Wolders {{as part of a}} mission called [...] "Operation Lifeline". Because of civil war, food from aid {{agencies}} had been cut off. The mission was to ferry food to southern Sudan. Hepburn said, [...] "I saw but one glaring truth: These are not natural disasters but man-made tragedies for which there is only one man-made solution – peace." [...] In October 1989, Hepburn and Wolders went to Bangladesh. John Isaac, a UN photographer, said, [...] "Often <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> have flies all over them, but she would just go hug them. I had never seen that. Other people had a certain amount of hesitation, but she would just grab them. Children would just come up to hold her hand, touch her – she was like the Pied Piper." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gingrich {{has said}} that {{children}} {{should be able to}} work at an earlier age. He said: [...] "You say to somebody, you shouldn't go to work before you're what, 14, 16 years of age, fine," [...] Mr. Gingrich said. [...] "You're totally poor. You're in a school that is failing with a teacher that is failing. I've tried for years to have a very simple model. Most of these schools ought {{to get rid of the}} unionized janitors, have one master janitor and pay local students to take care of the school. <b>The</b> <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> actually do work, they would have cash, they would have pride in the schools, they'd begin the process of rising." [...] He later clarified his position, saying he was not proposing major changes in the law or encouraging children to seek jobs instead of attending school, but rather was [...] "talking about working 20 hours a week and being empowered to succeed".|$|E
5000|$|Dig 'em was {{replaced}} by an animal more associated with honey, Wally the Bear, in 1986 (1984 in France). These ads would feature Wally (not {{to be confused with}} the Wally Bear from Wally Bear and the NO! Gang) pestering a kid eating a bowl of Honey Smacks and doing anything to get some, and <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> always refuse or just ignore Wally completely. These commercials didn't do too well since they seemed too much like the Trix commercials, plus Wally was not a very attractive character, and Dig'em Frog was brought back the following year by popular demand.|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{his status}} as a jobber, Horowitz would {{occasionally}} wrestle in matches of greater prominence. He was instrumental in starting the feud between reigning tag team champions, The Quebecers, and <b>the</b> “1-2-3” <b>Kid.</b> <b>The</b> Quebecers were set to defend their titles against Horowitz and Reno Riggins but Horowitz brought in <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> as a last-minute replacement partner. Though the Quebecers prevailed in <b>the</b> match, <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>would</b> continue to challenge for the tag team titles, albeit with changing partners and without Horowitz. Barry would return to teaming with Reno Riggins during 1994, facing The Smoking Gunns and Men on a Mission on multiple occasions. Despite numerous defeats, Horowitz did gain two victories in 1994 by defeating Ben Jordan and Mark Thomas. He also faced Thurman [...] "Sparky" [...] Plugg in the latter's first WWF match.|$|R
50|$|The {{cast and}} <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> then say their goodbyes and <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>would</b> {{walk off the}} set as the closing credits ran.

5000|$|At {{the end of}} each show, one of {{the adult}} Runaround losers and their <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> be called {{to the center of the}} stage. There, Phil and <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> do gross things to them, such as pouring slime on them, asking them {{questions}} with a messy penalty for a wrong answer delivered by <b>the</b> <b>kid,</b> or getting them to stomp on large purple balloons to make [...] "grape juice". The messy things Phil would do to the adults were based on at least one of the tasks from earlier in the show, usually tasks that were not completed. On the final episode, the tables were turned on Phil. Before Phil could call anyone to the center of the stage, Vivianne & Travis suddenly walked in from backstage. They, along with Phil's own son David, proceeded to slime him with a variety of substances. On another episode, Phil called all three adults center stage and had them bob for apples in a bowl of jello and whipped cream, blindfolded, with <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> giving them directions.|$|R

500|$|The series {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of gunge based games too, the first being <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> Gets It which would involve a celebrity speaking on a subject for 60 seconds without saying a trigger word. If they did, <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>would</b> be gunged. In January 2001, the premise evolved into a courtroom setting with a trivial argument between friends trying to be settled. The person the jury found guilty would subsequently be gunged. In March 2001, the game took on the premise of The Leakiest Sink', a parody of The Weakest Link which involved three contestants vying to meet a celebrity. After three rounds of questions which would eliminate one contestant, the remaining two would go onto the final round where the celebrity would pick plugs out of a sink whilst the contestants switched for each one pulled.
