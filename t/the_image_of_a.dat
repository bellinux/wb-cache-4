5|$|In September 2001, Studio Ghibli {{announced}} {{the production of}} two films. The first would become The Cat Returns and the second was an adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones' novel, Howl's Moving Castle. A rumor persists that Miyazaki had an idea to do Howl's Moving Castle {{during a visit to}} Strasbourg Christmas market. Toshio Suzuki, who produced Howl's Moving Castle, stated that Miyazaki was inspired to make the film when he read Jones' novel, and was struck by <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> castle moving around the countryside. The novel does not explain how the castle moved, and Miyazaki was interested in figuring out how the castle might move, which led to <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> castle on chicken legs. The complex moving castle changes and rearranges itself several times throughout the movie in response to Howl's eccentricity and the various situations. The basic structure of the castle consists of more than 80 elements including turrets, a wagging tongue, cogwheels and chicken legs, that were rendered as digital objects.|$|E

If the quotient space X/G is <b>the</b> continuous <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordered compactum, {{under what conditions}} is X also <b>the</b> continuous <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordered compactum? Examples around the (non-metric) Hahn–Mazurkiewicz Theorem show that one must place severe conditions on G if one wishes to obtain positive results. We prove that the compactum X is <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordered compactum when each g∈G has 0 -dimensional boundary. We also consider the case when G has only countably many non-degenerate elements. These results extend earlier work of the first named author in <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> ways...|$|R

5|$|Burial 67 {{was found}} in a cist under the second of five stucco floor levels in Northeast Plaza Structure 2. The {{skeleton}} was lying on its back with the head towards the north. The remains were poorly preserved but belonged to an adult. Of the skull only some dental remains were found. A ceramic plate had been placed under the head of the deceased and another plate was placed upon the knees. The plate was painted with four seated anthropomorphic figures with inclined head and wearing leather gloves with jaguar claws. The facial features of the figures are unusual. The bottom of the plate bears <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dancer. The ceramics date the burial to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Vaballathus, Zenobia had other children; <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child named Hairan (II) appears on a seal impression {{with that of}} his brother Vaballathus; no name of a mother was engraved and the seal is undated. Odaenathus' son Herodianus is identified by Udo Hartmann with Hairan I, a son of Odaenahtus who appears in Palmyrene inscriptions as early as 251. David S. Potter, on the other hand, suggested that Hairan II {{is the son of}} Zenobia and that he is Herodianus instead of Hairan I.|$|E

5|$|The current archaeological {{situation}} allows {{no closer}} evaluation of Khaba's reign.

The inscriptions reveal that the seals and their belonging vessels originated from Thinis and that they were registered by the governor of Elephantine. Other seals show the depiction of the goddess Bastet. The Hierakonpolis seal was found in early dynastic ruins of a local Horus temple.

5|$|The {{opposition}} to the ritual is not explicit in the oldest Upanishads. On occasions, the Upanishads extend {{the task of the}} Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical and giving it a philosophical meaning. For example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ashvamedha allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse. It then {{goes on to say that}} spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which is conceived in <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> horse.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene of}} Kane {{inspecting}} the egg {{was shot in}} post-production. A fiberglass egg was used so that actor John Hurt could shine his light on it and see movement inside, which was provided by Ridley Scott fluttering his hands inside the egg while wearing rubber gloves. The top of the egg was hydraulic, and the innards were a cow's stomach and tripe. Test shots of the eggs were filmed using hen's eggs, and this footage was used in early teaser trailers.
