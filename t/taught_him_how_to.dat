5|$|Dickinson played pubs with Shots on {{a regular}} basis to small audiences. One {{particular}} night, Dickinson suddenly stopped {{in the middle of a}} song and started interviewing a man in the audience, heckling for not paying enough attention. He got such a good response he started doing it every night until it became a regular routine used to catch the audience's attention. Dickinson states that this experience <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> be a frontman.|$|E

However, all his grandfather had <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> was <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do it, not when. As Sayama doesn't know when the abilities he carries are truly necessary, he has grown to never be really serious about anything, at least until he finds about what happened sixty years ago and meets Shinjou, the one who will be his counterbalance.|$|R

His mother died when he was seven years old. He attended a Dutch school but had no interest in academic studies. His involvement with music started when he was introduced to the Solfa music system by a teacher.

5|$|Harland Sanders {{was born}} in 1890 and raised on a farm outside Henryville, Indiana. His father died in 1895, and {{to make ends meet}} his mother took work at a canning plant. As the eldest child at the age of five, Sanders was left to care for his two siblings. When he turned seven his mother <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> cook. After leaving the family home at age 13, Sanders pursued several professions {{including}} railroad worker and insurance salesman, with mixed success. In 1930, he took over a Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin, a small city {{on the edge of the}} Appalachian Mountains. By June, he had converted a storeroom into a small eating area using his own dining table, serving meals such as steaks and country ham to travelers.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{played a}} mouth organ during a bus journey {{to visit his}} cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a {{harmonica}} he could have if he came to Edinburgh the following day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, {{and it became a}} signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.|$|E
5|$|Harland Sanders {{was born}} in 1890 and raised on a farm outside Henryville, Indiana (near Louisville, Kentucky). When Sanders was five years old, his father died, forcing his mother {{to work at a}} canning plant. This left Sanders, as the eldest son, to care for his two younger siblings. After he reached seven years of age, his mother <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> cook. After leaving the family home at the age of 13, Sanders passed through several professions, with mixed success. In 1930, he took over a Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin, Kentucky, a small town {{on the edge of the}} Appalachian Mountains. It was here that he first served to {{travelers}} the recipes that he had learned as a child: fried chicken and other dishes such as steaks and country ham. After four years of serving from his own dining room table, Sanders purchased the larger filling station on the other side of the road and expanded to six tables. By 1936, this had proven successful enough for Sanders to be given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon. In 1937 he expanded his restaurant to 142 seats, and added a motel he purchased across the street, naming it Sanders Court & Café.|$|E
50|$|His mother, a {{classical}} pianist, <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> piano and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> read {{music at the}} age of four.

50|$|Born on January 18, 1823, in Jackson County, Mississippi, to Isham Copeland and Rebecca Wells, James Copeland began {{school at}} {{approximately}} age ten or eleven. Although {{his father was}} willing to put him through school {{for as long as}} James desired, he began associating with people who <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> fraud and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> cheat and steal. It was reported that he would often trick his schoolmates out of their money and pocket knives.|$|R
50|$|Santos {{was born}} in Brotas de Macaúbas, Bahia, Brazil on May 3, 1926. Santos' parents were {{elementary}} school teachers and <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> at home <b>how</b> <b>to</b> read and write. By {{the time he was}} eight, he had already completed the equivalent of an elementary school education. Milton's father was a descendant from slaves, which gave Santos motivation to study. From 1934 to 1936, he lived in Alcobaça, learning French and good manners.|$|R
5|$|Plante {{was born}} on a farm near Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel, in Mauricie, Quebec, the first of 11 {{children}} born to Palma and Xavier Plante. The family moved to Shawinigan Falls, where his father worked {{in one of the}} local factories. In 1932, Plante began to play hockey, skateless and with a tennis ball, using a goaltender's hockey stick his father had carved from a tree root. When he was five years old, Plante fell off a ladder and broke his hand. The fracture failed to heal properly and affected his playing style during his early hockey career; he underwent successful corrective surgery as an adult. Plante suffered from asthma starting in early childhood. This prevented him from skating for extended periods so he gravitated to playing goaltender. As his playing progressed, Jacques received his first regulation goaltender's stick for Christmas of 1936. His father made Plante's first pads by stuffing potato sacks and reinforcing them with wooden panels. As a child, Plante played hockey outdoors in the bitterly cold Quebec winters. His mother <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> knit his own tuques to protect him from the cold. Plante continued knitting and embroidering throughout his life and wore his hand-knitted tuques while playing and practicing until entering the National Hockey League (NHL).|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} Edmonds High School, Anderson briefly studied with Alaskan scenic painter Eustace Ziegler, who {{encouraged}} Anderson's career-long preference for oil paints, and <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> draw nude figures, which would become important features of his work.|$|E
25|$|His first {{teacher was}} his father Mario Morricone, who <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> read music and also to play several instruments.

60|$|Up to this period, {{none of the}} English generals {{had shown}} any {{military}} talent. Shirley, the Earl of Loudon, and General Abercrombie had each held the chief command at different times; but {{not one of them}} had won a single important triumph for the British arms. This ill success was not owing to the want of means: for, in 1758, General Abercrombie had fifty thousand soldiers under his command. But the French general, the famous Marquis de Montcalm, possessed a great genius for war, and had something within <b>him</b> that <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> battles were <b>to</b> be won.|$|R
50|$|In {{his early}} career, his work {{leaned toward the}} fantastic, with an erotic feel, {{featuring}} humans transforming into something else such as birds. Elements of abstractionism also appeared early. He is quoted at that time as considering himself self-taught as school <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> nothing about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> express himself {{and that he did}} not like labels on his work.(alirico) In the late 1970s, he work took a darker turn, describing himself as “filled with rage and sadness”, creating art to fight against “dehumanization and to express ideas such as oppression and loneliness.|$|R

He worked at the doctor's clinic as a right-hand man and was responsible for ordering materials and medical supplies. He also served as an interpreter between the doctor and the hospital. Over the years, he learned to administer injections and assist in treating patients. The doctor, who had brought photography and darkroom equipment with <b>him,</b> <b>taught</b> Haybi <b>how</b> <b>to</b> take photographs and develop them {{at a time when}} photography was illegal in Yemen.|$|R

5000|$|Salley {{was drafted}} by the Detroit Pistons {{in the first round}} of the 1986 NBA draft out of Georgia Tech. After joining the Pistons, he became close friends with Adrian Dantley, who <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> proper nutrition, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> exercise, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> conduct himself off the court. Salley, for his part, called Dantley [...] "The Teacher". Salley would become good friends with comedian Eddie Murphy and made several {{appearances}} at comedy clubs in the off-season. In 1989 and 1990, he played on two Pistons NBA championship teams. He is among the Pistons' all-time leaders in blocked shots.|$|R
6000|$|The said [...] "hog-yoke," [...] an Eldridge chart, {{the farming}} almanac, Blunt's [...] "Coast Pilot," [...] and Bowditch's [...] "Navigator" [...] {{were all the}} weapons Disko needed to guide him, except the deep-sea lead that was his spare eye. Harvey nearly slew Penn with it when Tom Platt <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> first <b>how</b> <b>to</b> [...] "fly the blue pigeon"; and, though his {{strength}} was not equal to continuous sounding in any sort of a sea, for calm weather with a seven-pound lead on shoal water Disko used him freely. As Dan said: [...] "'Tain't soundin's dad wants. It's samples. Grease her up good, Harve." [...] Harvey would tallow the cup at the end, and carefully bring the sand, shell, sludge, or whatever it might be, to Disko, who fingered and smelt it and gave judgment. As has been said, when Disko thought of cod he thought as a cod; and by some long-tested mixture of instinct and experience, moved the [...] "We're Here" [...] from berth to berth, always with the fish, as a blindfolded chess-player moves on the unseen board.|$|R
5000|$|Edward {{was born}} on September 2, 1918 (according to the date in the family crypt). Edward and his wife Lila are {{considered}} to be two of the wealthiest individuals in the fictional town of Port Charles, New York. Edward is the Founder & Chairman, former CEO, and principal shareholder of E.L.Q. Industries. Many of his storylines involve health concerns, such as multiple heart attacks, a bout of amnesia in 1989, a stroke and faked coma, and a time in 2004 when his daughter Tracy had him committed to the Shadybrook Sanitarium, though he later escaped with the assistance of Luke Spencer. Portrayer John Ingle describes, [...] "Edward likes to think that he's <b>taught</b> everyone around <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> be ruthless." ...|$|R
25|$|Yuzo Koshiro {{was born}} in Tokyo on December 12, 1967. His mother, Tomo Koshiro, was a pianist. She <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> play the piano {{at the age of}} three, and by the age of five, he had a strong command of it. In 1975, he began taking music lessons from the {{acclaimed}} film composer Joe Hisaishi (later known for his soundtracks to Hayao Miyazaki films), and studied with him for three years. Everything Koshiro has learned after that has since been self-taught.|$|E
25|$|Schwarz's father <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> compute square roots {{when he was}} 4 years old. His {{interest}} in mathematics led to a strong {{interest in}} baseball, and he served as the statistician for the baseball team at Scarsdale High School. At the University of Pennsylvania, where he majored in mathematics, Schwarz began covering sports for the student newspaper, The Daily Pennsylvanian. After graduating in 1990, Schwarz decided to attempt a career in journalism rather than follow his original plan of becoming a high school math teacher.|$|E
25|$|It {{is evident}} {{how much he}} learned from Arcangelo Corelli about writing for instruments, and from Alessandro Scarlatti about writing for the solo voice; {{but there is no}} single {{composer}} who <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> write for chorus. Handel tended more and more to replace Italian soloists by English ones. The most significant reason for this change was the dwindling financial returns from his operas. Thus a tradition was created for oratorios which was to govern their future performance. The performances were given without costumes and action; the singers appeared in their own clothes.|$|E
60|$|It {{was well}} for the poor missionary, at that moment, that he had learned the art of boxing when a boy! The {{knowledge}} so acquired had never induced him to engage in dishonourable and vulgar strife; but it had <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> and where <b>to</b> deliver a straightforward blow with effect; and he now struck out with tremendous energy, knocking down an adversary at every blow,--for the thought of Alice lent additional strength to his powerful arm. Success in such warfare, however, {{was not to be}} expected. Still, Mr Mason's activity and vigour averted his own destruction for a few minutes; and these minutes were precious, for they afforded time for Captain Montague and his officers to cut their way to the spot where he fought, just as a murderous club was about to descend on his head from behind. Montague's sword unstrung the arm that upheld it, and the next instant the pastor was surrounded by friends.|$|R
500|$|Hemingway {{learned from}} Ezra Pound <b>how</b> <b>to</b> achieve a stripped-down style and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{incorporate}} {{the concepts of}} imagism in his prose. He said Pound [...] "had <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> more 'about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> write and <b>how</b> not <b>to</b> write' than any {{son of a bitch}} alive"; and his friend James Joyce told him [...] "to pare down his work to the essentials". The prose is spare and lacks a clear symbolism. Instead of more conventional literary allusions, Hemingway relied on repetitive metaphors or metonymy to build images. The caesarian is repeatedly associated with words such as [...] "the blanket" [...] and [...] "the bunk" [...] in a series of objective correlatives, a technique Hemingway learned from T.S. Eliot. Tetlow believes in this early story Hemingway ignored character development; he simply places a character in a setting, and adds descriptive detail such as a screaming woman, men smoking tobacco, and an infected wound, which give a sense of truth.|$|R
5000|$|The backing vocal {{sessions}} were problematic, as Bruce Johnston recalled, [...] "We re-recorded our vocals so many times, but the rhythm was never right. We would slave at Western {{for a few}} days, singing this thing, and would say, 'No, it's not right, it's not right.' One time, he had a 4-track Scully recorder sent to his home, but that didn't really work out." [...] During sessions, Brian taught brother Dennis Wilson a recording technique involving cupping {{his hands over his}} mouth, elaborating: [...] "Well, {{he had a lot of}} trouble singing on mike. He just didn't really know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> stay on mike. He was a very nervous boy. Very nervous person. So I <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> a trick, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> record and he said, 'Hey Brian. That works great. Thank you!' And I said, 'It's okay, Dennis: He was really happy. I showed him—not <b>how</b> <b>to</b> sing, but I showed him a way to get the best out of himself—just 'cup' singing." ...|$|R
