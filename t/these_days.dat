5|$|Apart from <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> {{the flag}} is flown at {{election}} polling sites. The national government, under Article 4, Section 7 {{of the flag}} law, is given the authority to call for the display of the national flag and to determine special conditions, such as marking for mourning.|$|E
5|$|Following federal decree on 22 March 2005, {{the flag}} must be flown from public {{buildings}} on the following dates. Not all of <b>these</b> <b>days</b> are public holidays.|$|E
5|$|Each of the 19 {{months is}} given a name which is an {{attribute}} of God; some examples include Bahá’ (Splendour), ‘Ilm (Knowledge), and Jamál (Beauty). The Bahá'í week is familiar in that it consists of seven days, with {{each day of the}} week also named after an attribute of God. Bahá'ís observe 11 Holy Days throughout the year, with work suspended on 9 of these. <b>These</b> <b>days</b> commemorate important anniversaries {{in the history of the}} religion.|$|E

50|$|This Phelsuma {{species can}} be quite shy in captivity. <b>These</b> <b>day</b> geckos are also {{surprisingly}} speedy.|$|R
5|$|Men {{spent their}} free time doing crafts such as woodworking, rugmaking, {{leatherwork}} and photography. Outdoor activities included hiking and swimming. Men formed choirs and music ensembles, performing in neighboring towns when relations were good. The men earned two days of furlough for each month of service. <b>These</b> <b>days</b> could be saved to allow enough time to travel several hundred miles home {{or in some cases}} traded to other men in exchange for cash.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Iskandar held annual {{open house}} events either at Istana Bukit Serene, his {{official}} residence, or at Istana Besar. On <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> the Sultan and his eldest son, the Tunku Mahkota, held special sessions whereby Johoreans {{came up to}} pay their respects to him. The Sultan also bestowed honorary awards on distinguished Malaysians from his annual birthday honours list on his birthdays. As a matter of convention, the state government gazetted 8 April as a state public holiday to mark his birthday.|$|E
5|$|We {{were trying}} to avoid that whole game of who gets in first with the reviews. <b>These</b> <b>days</b> there's so much paper to fill, or digital paper to fill, that whoever writes the first few things gets cut and pasted. Whoever gets their opinion in first has all that power. Especially for a band like ours, it's totally {{the luck of the}} draw whether that person is into us or not. It just seems wildly unfair, I think.|$|E

5|$|With Misery we had {{the luxury}} of doing a two-day shoot, which is totally luxurious <b>these</b> <b>days.</b> And we got to do what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not having any rules. It was very much on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in there. We were there for two days and it was like an art project.|$|E
5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E
5|$|At Wonsan 11 July– 12 July, New Jersey fired one of {{the most}} {{concentrated}} bombardments of her Korean duty. For nine hours the first day, and for seven the second, her guns opened fire on gun positions and bunkers on Hodo Pando and the mainland with telling effect. At least ten enemy guns were destroyed, many damaged, and a number of caves and tunnels sealed. New Jersey smashed radar control positions and bridges at Kojo 13 July, and was once more on the east coast bombline 22 July– 24 July to support South Korean troops near Kosong. <b>These</b> <b>days</b> found her gunners at their most accurate: A large cave, housing an important enemy observation post was closed, the end of a month-long United Nations effort, and a great many bunkers, artillery areas, observation posts, trenches, tanks and other weapons were destroyed.|$|E
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>day</b> geckos feed {{on various}} insects and other invertebrates. Like {{many members of}} the genus Phelsuma, this species might also feed on pollen and nectar.|$|R
50|$|P. dubia {{can easily}} adapt to {{different}} biotopes. <b>These</b> <b>day</b> geckos are often found on different trees and other lowland vegetation. They also inhabit buildings {{as a human}} commensal.|$|R
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>day</b> geckos feed on many {{arthropods}} (insects and arachnids) {{as well as}} some fruit matter(mashed). They {{also like}} to lick hard, tart fruit, pollen and nectar found on Coonatorious Palm trees.|$|R
5|$|Between 1577 and 1583, various colonial {{writers have}} {{reported}} in their chronicles {{the use of}} tunjos for offering pieces. The descriptions from the early colonial period of the New Kingdom of Granada have been collected first by Vicenta Cortés Alonso in 1958 and later by Ulises Rojas in 1965. The reports of the late 16th century show that the religious practices of the Muisca were still alive, despite the intensive catholic conversion policies. Caciques of Tuta, Toca, Duitama, Iguaque, Ramiriquí, Chitagoto, Onzaga, Tunja and Cucunubá participated in these rituals. The religious leader of Sogamoso was still the most important in <b>these</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eichmann {{was taken}} to one of several Mossad safe houses {{that had been set}} up by the team. He was held there for nine days, during which time his {{identity}} was double-checked and confirmed. During <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> Harel tried to locate Josef Mengele, the notorious Nazi doctor from Auschwitz, as the Mossad had information that he was also living in Buenos Aires. He was hoping to bring Mengele back to Israel on the same flight. However, Mengele had already left his last known residence in the city, and Harel was unable to get any leads on where he had gone, so the plans for his capture had to be abandoned. Eitan told Haaretz in 2008 that they intentionally made the decision not to pursue Mengele, reasoning that to do so might jeopardize the Eichmann operation.|$|E
5|$|In 1855/56, Guise Brittan had Englefield Lodge {{built on}} land {{alongside}} the Avon River {{just outside the}} initial town area (<b>these</b> <b>days</b> the area {{to the east of}} Fitzgerald Avenue). Joseph Brittan chose land a short distance downstream along the Avon River and had his homestead, Linwood House, built in 1857. Fooks was the architect for Linwood House, and, based on an assessment by art historian Dr Ian Lochhead, it is likely that he also designed Englefield Lodge. Joseph Brittan called his property and farm Linwood after his home in Linwood, Hampshire.|$|E
30|$|Characteristics of the {{services}} are also limited in Akiotacho. There is only one Day Care Center where holiday services are provided. Three Day Care Centers provide the extended hour services (more than 11 hours services a day). 2 / 3 of <b>these</b> <b>Day</b> Care Centers’ Voronoi areas are wider than 100 km 2 and Voronoi population of <b>these</b> <b>Day</b> Care Centers are more than 100 0 – 5 year-old children. All of the 6 Day Care Centers provide the temporary services (for children who {{are not allowed to}} attend Day Care Center) and the integrated early childhood special education services.|$|R
25|$|There are {{a handful}} of private day care {{facilities}} for elderly, but it is limited to the capital city. <b>These</b> <b>day</b> care services are very expensive and out of reach for the general public.|$|R
50|$|Amongst <b>these,</b> <b>Day's</b> YouTube channel also {{contains}} travel vlogs, music videos and satirical rants. In June 2014, {{he had reached}} over a million subscribers and his videos had been watched over 100 million times.|$|R
5|$|Public {{holidays}} in Rhodesia, {{a historical}} region in southern Africa equivalent to today's Zimbabwe and Zambia—formerly Southern and Northern Rhodesia, respectively—were largely based around milestones in the region's short history. Annual holidays marked {{various aspects of}} the arrival of white people during the 1880s and 1890s, as well as the respective unilateral declarations of independence (1965) and of republican government (1970). On <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> most businesses and non-essential services closed. A number of Christian holidays were also observed according to custom, in the traditional British manner, and referred to in official documents by name—Christmas Day, for example, or Easter Monday.|$|E
5|$|The University of Chicago's 1960–61 Group Theory Year brought {{together}} group theorists such as Daniel Gorenstein, John G. Thompson and Walter Feit, laying {{the foundation of}} a collaboration that, with input from numerous other mathematicians, led to the classification of finite simple groups, with the final step taken by Aschbacher and Smith in 2004. This project exceeded previous mathematical endeavours by its sheer size, in both length of proof and number of researchers. Research is ongoing to simplify the proof of this classification. <b>These</b> <b>days,</b> group theory is still a highly active mathematical branch, impacting many other fields.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} it is a seaside city has shaped Póvoa de Varzim's economy: the fishing {{industry}}, from the fishing vessels that put in each day to the canning industry and to the city's fish market, beach agriculture, and seaweed-gathering for fertilizing fields are the result of its geography. Tourism and the related industries are more relevant in Póvoa's economy <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> as fisheries have lost importance. Nevertheless, the mean value of fish landed in 2004, in its seaport, was almost three times that of Matosinhos seaport and significantly higher in the average vessels' capacity. Its fishing productivity is also comparatively higher than the national average. A Poveira is a traditional Povoan canning factory and most of its production, 80 to 85%, is exported and deals with high-end brands in canned fish, for MDC markets. Export market brands include: Poveira, D'Henry IV, Ala-Arriba, Minerva, and Alva.|$|E

50|$|Community {{health care}} centers (Centros de Salud), or day hospitals, are found inside {{metropolitan}} areas of cities and in rural areas. <b>These</b> <b>day</b> hospitals give care to patients whose hospitalization is less than 24 hours.|$|R
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>day</b> geckos fed {{on various}} insects and other invertebrates. As {{observed}} in {{other species of}} day geckos, {{it was assumed that}} P. gigas also liked to lick at soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of calendars between {{the start of}} the Reformation and the 20th century were quite minimal in their commemorations. Most included events such as the Annunciation or persons such as Saint Paul, <b>these</b> <b>days</b> often went unobserved despite scrupulous attention to the temporal cycle. Even further, the commemoration of some biblical persons of note (including the Virgin Mary) were often omitted entirely. During the 20th century, especially at the instigation of the liturgical movement, familiar saints began make a reemergence onto the calendar, along with newer names and events.|$|E
5|$|The {{visit was}} largely {{ceremonial}} and mainly focused on mutual praise rather than specific policy planning and negotiations. Diệm {{stayed in the}} capital for four days, meeting with Eisenhower and high-ranking members of the State Department on the last of <b>these</b> <b>days.</b> However, the meeting with Dulles turned into a farce after the Secretary of State and his subordinates decided to visit Diệm at Blair House. Diệm, notorious for monologues that often lasted {{for up to six}} hours, talked endlessly and as a result the American diplomats were unable to raise whatever issues they had wanted to discuss.|$|E
5|$|This species {{grows in}} at least 2 {{distinct}} sub-populations, {{both of which are}} well protected by Sabah National Parks Authority. One of the populations grows in an area public access to which is strictly prohibited without permit. However, there has been a decline in population of mature individuals in the better known and less patrolled site. This is largely due to damage to habitat and plants by careless visitors rather than organised collection of plants. Nepenthes rajah has become common in cultivation in recent years {{as a result of the}} availability of inexpensive clones from tissue culture. I believe that <b>these</b> <b>days</b> commercial collection of this species from the wild is negligible.|$|E

50|$|<b>These</b> <b>day</b> geckos feed {{on various}} insects and other invertebrates, {{and are also}} capable of eating other smaller lizards. They also eat soft, sweet fruit and pollen and nectar from flowers, often congregating in groups of many {{individuals}} to feed off of one plant.|$|R
