5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs. This may include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), amphetamines, pethidine (meperidine), <b>tramadol,</b> dextromethorphan, buspirone, L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, St. John's wort, triptans, ecstasy (MDMA), metoclopramide, ondansetron, or cocaine. It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the central nervous system (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra serotonin.|$|E
5|$|Some authors {{challenge}} {{the validity of}} the second step (mild opioids) and, pointing to their higher toxicity and low efficacy, argue that mild opioids could be replaced by small doses of strong opioids (with the possible exception of <b>tramadol</b> due to its demonstrated efficacy in cancer pain, its specificity for neuropathic pain, and its low sedative properties and reduced potential for respiratory depression in comparison to conventional opioids).|$|E
5|$|The WHO {{guidelines}} recommend prompt {{oral administration}} of drugs when pain occurs, starting, {{if the person}} is not in severe pain, with non-opioid drugs such as paracetamol, dipyrone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors. Then, if complete pain relief is not achieved or disease progression necessitates more aggressive treatment, mild opioids such as codeine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine or <b>tramadol</b> are added to the existing non-opioid regime. If this is or becomes insufficient, mild opioids are replaced by stronger opioids such as morphine, while continuing the non-opioid therapy, escalating opioid dose until the person is painless or the maximum possible relief without intolerable side effects has been achieved. If the initial presentation is severe cancer pain, this stepping process should be skipped and a strong opioid should be started immediately in combination with a non-opioid analgesic.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} risk {{and severity of}} serotonergic side effects and serotonin toxicity, with individual drugs and combinations, is complex. Serotonin syndrome {{has been reported in}} patients of all ages, including the elderly, children, and even newborn infants due to in utero exposure. The serotonergic toxicity of SSRIs increases with dose, but even in over-dose it is insufficient to cause fatalities from serotonin syndrome in healthy adults. Elevations of central nervous system serotonin will typically only reach potentially fatal levels when drugs with different mechanisms of action are mixed together. Various drugs, other than SSRIs, also have clinically significant potency as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, (e.g. <b>tramadol,</b> amphetamine, and MDMA) and are associated with severe cases of the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tramadol</b> acts on the opioid receptors {{through its}} major active {{metabolite}} desmetramadol, which {{has as much}} as 700-fold higher affinity for the MOR relative to <b>tramadol.</b> Moreover, <b>tramadol</b> itself {{has been found to}} possess no efficacy in activating the MOR in functional activity assays, whereas desmetramadol activates the receptor with high intrinsic activity (Emax equal to that of morphine). As such, desmetramadol is exclusively responsible for the opioid effects of <b>tramadol.</b> Both <b>tramadol</b> and desmetramadol have pronounced selectivity for the MOR over the DOR and KOR in terms of binding affinity.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{researchers}} reported that <b>tramadol</b> {{was found in}} relatively high concentrations (1%+) in {{the roots of the}} African pin cushion tree (Nauclea latifolia). In 2014, however, it was reported that the presence of <b>tramadol</b> in the tree roots was the result of <b>tramadol</b> having been administered to cattle by farmers in the region: <b>tramadol</b> and its metabolites were present in the animals' excreta, which contaminated the soil around the trees. Therefore, <b>tramadol</b> and its mammalian metabolites were found in tree roots in the far north of Cameroon, but not in the south where it is not administered to farm animals.|$|E
25|$|Fatalities with <b>tramadol</b> {{overdose}} {{have been}} reported and are increasing in frequency in Northern Ireland; {{the majority of these}} overdoses involve other drugs including alcohol. Recognised risk factors for <b>tramadol</b> overdose include depression, addiction and seizures. Naloxone only partially reverses the toxic effects of <b>tramadol</b> overdose and may increase the risk of seizures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tramadol</b> is {{well-established}} as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. In addition, a {{few studies}} have found that it also acts as a serotonin releasing agent (1–10μM), similar in effect to fenfluramine. The serotonin releasing effects of <b>tramadol</b> could be blocked by sufficiently high concentrations of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor 6-nitroquipazine, which is in accordance with other serotonin releasing agents like fenfluramine and MDMA. However, two more recent studies failed to find a releasing effect of <b>tramadol</b> at respective concentrations up to 10 and 30μM. In addition to serotonergic activity, <b>tramadol</b> is also a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It is not a norepinephrine releasing agent. <b>Tramadol</b> does not inhibit the reuptake or induce the release of dopamine.|$|E
25|$|Use of <b>tramadol</b> is not advised {{for people}} {{deficient}} in CYP2D6 enzymes. The enzymes {{are crucial to}} the therapeutic effects of <b>tramadol,</b> by means of enabling tramadol's metabolism to desmetramadol.|$|E
25|$|As of 2015 <b>tramadol</b> was not {{approved}} in the United States for fibromyalgia. Based on three small trials with weak study design, there is fair evidence for <b>tramadol</b> {{as a second}} line treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{adverse effects of}} <b>tramadol</b> include nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, indigestion, {{abdominal}} pain, vertigo, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness and headache. Compared to other opioids, respiratory depression and constipation are considered {{less of a problem}} with <b>tramadol.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, {{according}} to a 2014 report by the World Health Organizations Expert Committee on Drug Dependence '"....in many cases of <b>tramadol</b> dependence, a history of substance abuse is present....but....the evidence for physical dependence was considered minimal. Consequently, <b>Tramadol</b> is generally considered as a drug with low potential for dependence. In a recent German study (including a literature study, an analysis of two drug safety databases, and questionnaires analyses), the low abuse and low dependence potential of <b>Tramadol</b> were re-confirmed. The German expert group found a low prevalence of abuse or dependence in clinical practice in Germany, and concluded that <b>Tramadol</b> has a low potential for misuse, abuse, and dependence in Germany”.|$|E
25|$|The European League Against Rheumatism in 2008 {{recommends}} <b>tramadol</b> {{and other}} weak opioids {{may be used}} for pain but not strong opioids. A 2015 review found fair evidence to support <b>tramadol</b> use if other medications do not work. Goldenberg et al suggest that <b>tramadol</b> works via its serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, rather than via its action as a weak opioid receptor agonist. The combination of <b>tramadol</b> and paracetemol has demonstrated efficacy, safety and tolerability (for up to two years in the management of other pain conditions) without the development of tolerance. It is as effective as a combination of codeine (another mild opioid) and paracetamol but produces less sleepiness and constipation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tramadol</b> and desmetramadol may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma or serum to monitor for abuse, confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a sudden death. Most commercial opiate immunoassay screening tests do not cross-react significantly with <b>tramadol</b> or its major metabolites, so chromatographic techniques must be used to detect and quantitate these substances. The concentration of desmetramadol in the blood or plasma {{of a person who}} has taken <b>tramadol</b> is generally 10–20% those of the parent drug.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of convulsions at high doses for some users, recreational use can be very dangerous. <b>Tramadol</b> can cause a higher incidence of nausea, dizziness, loss of appetite compared with opioids, which could deter recreational use. Compared to hydrocodone, fewer persons choose to use <b>tramadol</b> recreationally.|$|E
25|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} caused by <b>tramadol</b> {{is thought to}} be due to activation of the 5-HT3 receptor via increased serotonin levels. In accordance, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist metoclopramide can be used to treat tramadol-associated nausea {{and vomiting}}. <b>Tramadol</b> and desmetramadol themselves do not bind to the 5-HT3 receptor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tramadol</b> is used {{primarily}} to treat mild–severe pain, both acute and chronic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tramadol,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Ultram among others, is an opioid pain {{medication}} used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. When taken by mouth in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually occurs within an hour. It is often combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as this is known to improve the efficacy of <b>tramadol</b> in relieving pain.|$|E
25|$|The drug <b>tramadol</b> is a {{racemate}} of the hydrochlorides of the (1R,2R)-(+)- and the (1S,2S)-(−)-enantiomers.|$|E
25|$|Effective August 18, 2014, <b>tramadol</b> {{has been}} placed into Schedule IV of the federal Controlled Substances Act in the United States. In addition, many states, {{including}} Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Illinois, Mississippi, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, Wyoming and the U.S. military have already classified <b>tramadol</b> as a Schedule IV controlled substance under state law.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tramadol</b> {{has been}} found to lower the seizure {{threshold}} and should be avoided during benzodiazepine withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine may {{decrease}} {{the effects of}} CYP2D6 substrates that are prodrugs, such as codeine, <b>tramadol,</b> and tamoxifen.|$|E
25|$|Several {{synthetic}} opioids function additionally as NMDAR-antagonists, such as pethidine, levorphanol, methadone, dextropropoxyphene, <b>tramadol</b> and ketobemidone.|$|E
25|$|Analgesics, such as <b>tramadol</b> and {{pethidine}} due to {{the potential}} {{for an increase in}} seizure risk and serotonin syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} <b>tramadol</b> in March 1995 and an extended-release (ER) formulation in September 2005. <b>Tramadol</b> {{is protected}} by US patents nos. 6,254,887 and 7,074,430. The FDA listed the patents' expiration as 10 May 2014. However, in August 2009, US District Court for the District of Delaware ruled the patents invalid, which, if it survives appeal, would permit manufacture and distribution of generic equivalents of Ultram ER in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, {{radiocarbon}} analysis {{confirmed that}} the <b>tramadol</b> found in N.latifolia roots could not be plant-derived and was of synthetic origin.|$|E
25|$|The UK {{classified}} <b>tramadol</b> as a Schedule 3 {{controlled drug}} (CD) on 10 June 2014, but exempted {{it from the}} safe custody requirement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tramadol</b> is {{classified}} in Schedule 4 (prescription only) in Australia, {{rather than as}} a Schedule 8 Controlled Drug (Possession without authority illegal) like most other opioids.|$|E
25|$|Effective May 2008, Sweden {{classified}} <b>tramadol</b> as {{a controlled}} substance {{in the same}} category as codeine and dextropropoxyphene, but allows a normal prescription be used currently.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tramadol</b> {{may be used}} {{to treat}} post-operative, injury-related, and chronic (e.g., cancer-related) pain in dogs and cats as well as rabbits, coatis, many small mammals {{including}} rats and flying squirrels, guinea pigs, ferrets, and raccoons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tramadol</b> {{undergoes}} hepatic metabolism via the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2B6, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, being O- and N-demethylated to {{five different}} metabolites. Of these, desmetramadol (O-desmethyltramadol) {{is the most}} significant since it has 200 times the μ-affinity of (+)-tramadol, and furthermore has an elimination half-life of nine hours, compared with six hours for <b>tramadol</b> itself. As with codeine, in the 6% of the population that have reduced CYP2D6 activity (hence reducing metabolism), there is therefore a reduced analgesic effect. Those with decreased CYP2D6 activity require a dose increase of 30% in order to achieve the same degree of pain relief as those with a normal level of CYP2D6 activity.|$|E
25|$|Venlafaxine {{should be}} taken with caution when using St John's wort. Venlafaxine may lower the seizure {{threshold}}, and coadministration with other drugs that lower the seizure threshold such as bupropion and <b>tramadol</b> {{should be done with}} caution and at low doses.|$|E
25|$|Escitalopram, {{similarly}} to other SSRIs (with {{the exception of}} fluvoxamine), inhibits CYP2D6 and hence may increase plasma levels {{of a number of}} CYP2D6 substrates such as aripiprazole, risperidone, <b>tramadol,</b> codeine, etc. As much of the effect of codeine is attributable to its conversion (10%) to morphine its effectiveness will be reduced by this inhibition, not enhanced. As escitalopram is only a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6, analgesia from <b>tramadol</b> may not be affected. Escitalopram can also prolong the QT interval and hence it is not recommended in patients that are concurrently on other medications that have the ability to prolong the QT interval. Being a SSRI, escitalopram should not be given concurrently with MAOIs or other serotonergic medications.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{cause of}} death was a drug overdose; an autopsy found a lethal mixture of cocaine and the prescription drug <b>tramadol.</b> The overdose was ruled accidental and witnesses say Ol' Dirty Bastard complained of chest pain on the day he died.|$|E
25|$|According to {{subsequent}} {{news reports}} the toxicology tests also showed levels of painkillers hydrocodone, oxycodone, and <b>tramadol,</b> {{as well as}} anti-anxiety drugs alprazolam and diazepam. Mays had suffered from hip problems and was scheduled for hip replacement surgery {{the day after he}} was found dead.|$|E
25|$|Its {{analgesic}} effects {{take about}} one hour {{to come into}} effect and 2h to 4h to peak after oral administration with an immediate-release formulation. On a dose-by-dose basis <b>tramadol</b> has about one tenth the potency of morphine and is approximately equally potent when compared with pethidine and codeine.|$|E
