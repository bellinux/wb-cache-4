5|$|Ruffin's and Leval's {{divisions}} fled {{towards the}} Laguna del Puerco, where Victor succeeded in halting their disorganised rout. The Marshal deployed {{two or three}} relatively unscathed battalions to cover the reorganisation of his forces and secure their retreat, but Graham had also managed to call his exhausted men to order and he brought them, with Duncan's artillery, against Victor's new position. Morale in the re-formed French ranks was fragile; when a squadron of KGL hussars rounded the Cerro and drove a squadron of French dragoons onto their infantry, the shock was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> for the demoralised soldiers, who retreated in a sudden rush.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a winning}} record, {{injuries}} hobbled {{the team for}} the 2009–2010 season. Reserves Batum and Fernández started the season on the inactive list and forward Travis Outlaw soon followed after a serious foot injury early in the season. Most notably, centers Oden and Joel Przybilla suffered season-ending knee injuries, while Roy and Aldridge played through shoulder, hamstring, ankle and knee injuries. Head Coach Nate McMillan was likewise not spared, suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon during practice and was in a walking boot. Because of the void at the center position, Blazers general manager Kevin Pritchard worked out a deal to acquire Marcus Camby from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Steve Blake and Outlaw. Although wins did not come as easily as the season before, the Blazers rallied to finish at 50–32, and finished 6th in the West. Roy underwent surgery after suffering a torn meniscus in his right knee, but returned for Game 4 {{of the first round}} series against the Phoenix Suns. However, the accumulation of injuries was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear,</b> and the short-handed Trail Blazers lost the series 4–2 to the Suns.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{high-profile}} baby rapes appeared since 2001 (including {{the fact that}} they required extensive reconstructive surgery to rebuild urinary, genital, abdominal, or tracheal systems). In 2001, a 9-month-old was raped and likely lost consciousness as the pain was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> In February 2002, an 8-month-old infant was reportedly gang raped by four men. One has been charged. The infant has required extensive reconstructive surgery. The 8-month-old infant's injuries were so extensive, increased attention on prosecution has occurred.|$|E
60|$|This was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be <b>borne,</b> and Frank rode up {{red with}} passion; {{and a lot}} of others, {{including}} the whipper, soon followed.|$|R

50|$|Inumaru's grumpy mother. She always nags and is {{the first}} to object to believing that Mariko is from the future. She {{eventually}} decides to leave the household, as the news is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for her <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b>|$|R
500|$|Britain {{had very}} limited {{resources}} {{at the end}} of the war, but the British Zone was the most populated, most industrialised, and most devastated by Allied bombing, and therefore the most expensive for the occupier. The British government decided to reduce the cost by sharing the burden with the United States. Rainbow returned to London to work on this project, and was then sent to Washington, D.C., as part of the British negotiating team. She sailed on the , arriving in New York in November 1946. The Americans agreed to merge the U.S. and British zones into Bizonia, with the two nations sharing the costs equally. To deal with issues arising from the agreement, a small staff remained in Washington, and Rainbow was selected to be part of it. After spending Christmas in London, she flew to New York in January 1947. During her time in Washington, she had a desk at the Pentagon, and lived in a house on P Street which she shared with two other women from the British Embassy. She attempted to get the best possible deal for Britain; whenever possible, purchases were made in sterling, and shipping was with the Cunard Line. Eventually, the British government found even [...] half the cost of Bizonia <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear,</b> resulting in further negotiations. In 1949, she returned to England on the [...]|$|E
2500|$|Life for America's {{first black}} police {{officers}} was not easy. For Raiford, {{the tension and}} humiliation became <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> After a five-year tour of duty, Raiford traded his badge for a rundown schoolhouse for black children located in a remote area of Guilford County called Goodwill. A defunct book titled [...] "Hiawatha, the Warrior," [...] was compulsory reading {{for all of the}} first through twelfth graders he taught.|$|E
2500|$|The attacks hurt Stanton, and he {{considered}} resigning, but {{he remained in}} his position, at Lincoln's request. As defeats piled up, Lincoln sought to give some order to the disparate divisions of Union forces in Virginia. He decided to consolidate the commands of [...] Maj. Gens. McDowell, John C. Frémont, and Nathaniel P. Banks into the Army of Virginia, {{which was to be}} commanded by Maj. Gen. John Pope. Lincoln was also convinced that the North's army needed reform at the highest ranks; he and Stanton being the de facto commanders of Union forces had proved <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear,</b> so Lincoln would need a skilled commander. He chose Gen. Henry W. Halleck. Halleck arrived in Washington on July 22, and was confirmed as the general-in-chief of Union forces the following day.|$|E
50|$|Payah makes a {{surprising}} discovery, and {{takes on a}} responsibility that becomes almost <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for her <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> She befriends a run-away and keeps him hidden. She also learns the reason behind her great aunt’s constant bad temper.|$|R
50|$|The guilt becomes <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for Adenike <b>to</b> <b>bear,</b> and {{she finally}} tells her husband the truth.

60|$|They {{thought as}} little of Miss Pecksniff, while they greedily perused this letter, {{as if she}} were the very last person on earth whom it concerned. But Miss Pecksniff really had fainted away. The {{bitterness}} of her mortification; the bitterness of having summoned witnesses, and such witnesses, to behold it; the bitterness of knowing that the strong-minded women and the red-nosed daughters towered triumphant in this hour of their anticipated overthrow; was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be <b>borne.</b> Miss Pecksniff had fainted away in earnest.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm not,' she protested. 'I'm {{not afraid}} of other things. But black-beetles--ugh!' she shuddered convulsively, as if the very thought were <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you break}} off," [...] she asked then, with her former air of {{being afraid of}} me, [...] "because you hate me <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> to speak to me?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{only wanted}} {{to be left alone}} now. He had his own trouble, which was almost <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> Clara only tormented him and made him tired. He was not sorry when he left her.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "When I Think About Cheatin'," [...] {{the female}} narrator states that she resists {{the temptation of}} {{infidelity}} because the possibility of losing her current relationship would be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for her <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> The song is performed {{in the style of}} the Nashville sound.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} {{the night was}} hideous with noises; musket shots, the sharp cracks of revolvers, shouts, cries, and at times the long shrill screams of women. It was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be <b>borne,</b> and feeling that for the present Saba's act had saved them, the boys, laying down their weapons, pressed their hands to their ears {{to keep out the}} din. There they sat for half an hour, stunned by the awful calamity, too horror-stricken at what had passed, and at the probable fate of their father, to find relief in tears.|$|R
60|$|It {{was almost}} <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{happiness}} <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> Oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; {{he could not}} weep, or speak, or rest. He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of tears came to his relief, {{and he seemed to}} awaken, all at once, to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope the}} net won't break," [...] he replied. [...] "If it does we shall lose them all, and the {{disappointment}} to the Indians might be almost <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> See, they prepare for action!" ...|$|E
60|$|The way he sank on {{the table}} in exhaustion, {{drinking}} his milk, his will, nevertheless, so perfect and unblemished, triumphant, though his body was broken and in anguish, was almost <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> My heart was wrung for my countryman, wrung till it bled.|$|E
60|$|This was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> meekly. The boiling {{blood in}} the youth's heart boiled over into his face. He leaped forward, seized the donkey's rein with one hand, caught the man's left leg with the other, and hurled the rider {{backward}} to the ground.|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, the Nazi {{tactics of}} {{repression}} were <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for Zoellner <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> and he resigned on 12 February 1937, after the Gestapo had denied him {{the right to}} visit some imprisoned pastors. The Minister of Church Affairs spoke to the churchmen {{the next day in}} a shocking presentation that clearly disclosed the regime's hostility to the church: ...|$|R
6000|$|Pen {{looked at}} his early acquaintance,--who had been plucked, who had been rusticated, who had only, after {{repeated}} failures, learned {{to read and write}} correctly, and who, in spite of all these drawbacks, had attained the honour of a degree.

60|$|Leo stood nearest to her, and {{the sight}} of this royal woman in her misery proved <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for him <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> Stepping <b>to</b> her side he stooped and lifted her to her feet, muttering some kind words. For a moment she rested on his arm, then shook herself free of him and took the proffered hand of her old uncle Simbri.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him silently, still with the blank despair on her face; but then the tears began to fill her blue eyes, and her lip trembled. The strong man had had <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> that day. He let his head fall beside hers and sobbed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know. And I'm {{glad for}} that. But I'm {{hungry for a}} violin all the time. And I only come here when the hunger gets <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> I feel as if I oughtn't to come even then--I'm always saying I won't do it again, because I know {{grandfather}} wouldn't like it, if he knew." ...|$|E
60|$|She had morphia every night, and {{her heart}} got fitful. Annie slept beside her. Paul would go in in the early morning, when his sister got up. His mother was wasted and almost ashen {{in the morning with}} the morphia. Darker and darker grew her eyes, all pupil, with the torture. In the mornings the weariness and ache were <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> Yet she could not--would not--weep, or even {{complain}} much.|$|E
5000|$|To some extent, Thompson {{seems to}} have {{confirmed}} {{a number of the}} commonly held suspicions about himself and Bessie. Although generally a discreet man who kept his personal business to himself, {{the truth of the matter}} may have been <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for him <b>to</b> <b>bear,</b> and he confessed his feelings for Bessie in a letter to his then-wife Patience O'Hara. Patience describes the letter thus: ...|$|R
60|$|Chebron was silent. His whole affection {{had been}} given to his father, for his mother he had {{comparatively}} little. As a child he had seldom been allowed to come into the room where she was. She declared that his noise was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for her, that his talk made her head ache, and that his fidgeting about was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be <b>borne.</b> Nor since that time had he been much more with her. It was his father who had seen to his welfare and that of Mysa, who would put aside his grave studies to walk and talk with them, who was always indulgent, always anxious to give them pleasure. He therefore thoroughly entered into Mysa's feelings, but saw no possible alternative for her.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the laying of the cornerstone, a rector had yet to be named. The vestry {{selected}} the Rev. Edmund Neville of Taunton, Massachusetts. Humbled by the call, Rev. Neville declined the offer because he felt organizing and growing a new congregation was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for him <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> The vestry then selected the Rev. William W. Spear, rector of St. Michael’s Church, Charleston, South Carolina. He accepted the call on July 15, 1840.|$|R
60|$|The bounder {{had once}} more resumed his theme of l'Inghilterra, l'Italia, la Germania. He swanked England {{as hard as}} he could. Of course England was the top dog, and if he could speak some English, if he were talking to English people, and if, as he said, he was going to England in April, why he was so much the more top-doggy than his companions, who could not rise to all these heights. At the same time, my nerves had <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b>|$|E
60|$|But with Bowser it {{was very}} different. Poor Bowser didn't know where he was. It would have been bad enough under any {{circumstances}} to have been lost, but to be lost {{and at the same}} time tired almost to death, bruised and lame, wet and chilled through, was almost <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> He hadn't the least idea which way to turn. He couldn't climb up the bank to find his own trail and follow it back home if he wanted to. You see, that bank was very steep for some distance in each direction, and so it was impossible for Bowser to climb it.|$|E
60|$|What {{will not}} women do on such devoted occasions? weary {{as she was}} she {{went all the way}} down the {{rambling}} staircases to the ground-floor, then to search for a lantern, which she lighted and hid under her cloak; then for a wet sponge, and next went forth into the night. The white railing stared out in the darkness at her approach, and a ray from the enshrouded lantern fell upon the blood--just where he had told her it would be found. She shuddered. It was almost <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> in one day--but with a shaking hand she sponged the rail clean, and returned to the house.|$|E

Despite {{all the hard}} works of his husband, Waldo, their family is never able to make both ends meet, so she is bitter even if she's {{actually}} a loving person. The miserable life in Barrio Tapas is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for her <b>to</b> <b>bear,</b> so when she meets Lemuel Verder and promised her a better life in Manila, she jumps at the chance. A decision that will make her life a nightmare.|$|R
50|$|In {{the same}} year, Feng Heng was {{pregnant}} with Huang Rong. When she learnt that the copy she wrote had been stolen, she attempted to write another from memory for her husband. However, the stress was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for her <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> so she died shortly after giving birth to Huang Rong. Huang Yaoshi was deeply tramautised {{by the loss of}} his wife and driven to near-insanity. He vented his anger on his other four apprentices (Qu Lingfeng, Lu Chengfeng, Wu Mianfeng and Feng Mofeng) by crippling them and banishing them from his island.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Brother's Keeper", the Haitian gives Peter {{the address}} of a storage facility, advising him to go there alone because the truth could be <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for him <b>to</b> <b>bear.</b> Despite this, Peter goes there with [...] "Nathan", and they find Nathan's corpse. To find the truth, they visit the {{comatose}} Matt Parkman. Peter heals him {{so they can get}} some answers, but this revives Sylar, who jumps from Matt's consciousness into his own body. However, [...] "Nathan" [...] is still in control, and flies away with Peter to avoid the police.|$|R
