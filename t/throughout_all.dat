5|$|Historically, {{hunting and}} habitat loss have {{severely}} impacted American alligator populations throughout their range, {{and whether the}} species would survive was in doubt.

Cheeseman had been educated in Germany, knew the language and felt able to recognise a German accent; he noticed that Lody's American accent slipped from time to time, presumably due to stress, and became convinced that the man was German.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} issues confronting the delegates was that of slavery. Slavery was widespread in the states {{at the time of}} the Convention. At least a third of the Convention's 55 delegates owned slaves, including all of the delegates from Virginia and South Carolina. Slaves comprised approximately one-fifth of the population of the states; and apart from northernmost New England, where slavery had largely been eliminated, slaves lived <b>throughout</b> <b>all</b> regions of the country. The majority of the slaves (more than 90%), however, lived in the South, where approximately 1 in 3 families owned slaves (in the largest and wealthiest state, Virginia, that figure was nearly 1 in 2 families). The entire agrarian economy of the South was based on slave labor, and the Southern delegates to the Convention were unwilling to accept any proposals that they believed would threaten the institution.|$|E

5|$|As early Homo sapiens {{began to}} diversify the {{ecological}} zones that they inhabited during the MSA, {{the archaeological record}} associated with these zones begins to show evidence for regional continuities. These continuities are significant {{for a number of}} reasons. The expansion of Homo sapiens into various ecological zones demonstrates an ability to adapt to a variety of environmental contexts including marine environments, savanna grasslands, relatively arid deserts, and forests. This adaptability is reflected in MSA artifacts found in these zones. These artifacts display stylistic variability depending on zone. During the Acheulian, which spanned from 1.5 million years ago to 300 thousand years ago, lithic technology displayed incredible homogeneity <b>throughout</b> <b>all</b> ecological niches. MSA technologies, with their evidence for regional variability and continuity, represent a remarkable advance. These data have been used to support theories of social and stylistic development throughout the MSA.|$|E
5|$|Bowman Creek's main stem is {{designated}} as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and the watersheds of {{all but two of}} its tributaries have the same designation. The watersheds of the remaining two tributaries, Sorber Run and Cider Run, are {{designated as}} Exceptional Value waters, with standards even higher than those of High-Quality Coldwater Fisheries. Additionally, these two tributaries are the only Wilderness Trout Streams in Wyoming County. Wild trout naturally reproduce <b>throughout</b> <b>all</b> of the creek's tributaries. A total of ten named streams in the watershed of Bowman Creek are classified by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as Class A Wild Trout Waters. Most hold this designation for brook trout only, but Sugar Hollow Creek and a section of Roaring Run hold the designation for rainbow trout, either instead of or in addition to brook trout.|$|E
5|$|Common herbs such as sage, mustard, {{and parsley}} were grown {{and used in}} cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill and fennel. Many of these plants grew <b>throughout</b> <b>all</b> of Europe or were {{cultivated}} in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.|$|E
