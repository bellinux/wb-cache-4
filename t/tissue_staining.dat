50|$|In 1870, German {{physicians}} Eduard Hitzig and Gustav Fritsch published {{their findings}} about {{the behavior of}} animals. Hitzig and Fritsch ran an electric current through the cerebral cortex of a dog, causing different muscles to contract depending on which {{areas of the brain}} were electrically stimulated. This led to the proposition that individual functions are localized to specific areas of the brain rather than the cerebrum as a whole, as the aggregate field view suggests. Brodmann was also an important figure in brain mapping; his experiments based on Franz Nissl’s <b>tissue</b> <b>staining</b> techniques divided the brain into fifty-two areas.|$|E
50|$|In 1956, {{biologists}} from Lund University in Sweden {{announced that}} humans have exactly 46 chromosomes. Turpin had many years earlier proposed {{the idea of}} culturing cells to {{count the number of}} chromosomes in trisomy. Gautier had recently joined the pediatrics group he headed at the Armand-Trousseau Hospital, and she offered to attempt this, since she had been trained in both cell culture and <b>tissue</b> <b>staining</b> techniques in the United States. Turpin agreed to provide her with tissue samples from patients with Down syndrome. With very limited resources Gautier set up the first in vitro cell culture laboratory in France.|$|E

This compound inhibits glycolysis, and can mimic some of the physiological effects of CR, in particular increased insulin sensitivity, reduced glucose levels, reduced body temperature, and other biochemical changes. It was reported to extend the lives of C. elegans worms; however, studies in different strains of rats found that 2DG did not extend lifespan at several tested doses, and exhibited toxic effects [...] "Histopathological analysis of the hearts revealed increasing vacuolarization of cardiac myocytes with dose, and <b>tissue</b> <b>staining</b> revealed the vacuoles were free of both glycogen and lipid." ...|$|E

Normal vaginal <b>tissue</b> <b>stains</b> brown due to its high {{glycogen}} content, while tissue suspicious for cancer does not stain, and thus appears pale compared to the surrounding tissue.

5000|$|Camillo Golgi {{was born}} in July 1843 {{in the village of}} Corteno, in the {{province}} of Brescia (Lombardy), Italy. The village is now named Corteno Golgi in his honour. His father was a physician and district medical officer. Golgi studied at the University of Pavia, where he worked in the experimental pathology laboratory under Giulio Bizzozero, who elucidated the properties of bone marrow. He graduated in 1865. He spent much of his career studying the central nervous system. <b>Tissue</b> <b>staining</b> techniques in the later half of the 19th century were inadequate for studying nervous tissue. While working as chief medical officer in a psychiatric hospital, he experimented with metal impregnation of nervous tissue, using mainly silver (silver staining). He discovered a method of staining nervous tissue that would stain a limited number of cells at random in their entirety. This enabled him to view the paths of nerve cells in the brain for the first time. He called his discovery the [...] "black reaction" [...] (in Italian, reazione nera), but today it is called Golgi's method or the Golgi stain. The reason for the random staining is still not understood.|$|E
5000|$|Krebs {{was born}} in Hildesheim, Germany, to Georg Krebs, an ear, nose, and throat surgeon, and Alma Krebs (née Davidson). He {{was the middle of}} three children, older sister Elisabeth and younger brother Wolfgang. He {{attended}} the famous old Gymnasium Andreanum in his home town. Before completing his secondary school education (by six months) he was conscripted into the Imperial German Army in September 1918, during World War I. He was allowed to appear in an emergency examination for the higher school leaving certificate, which he passed in such a good grade that he suspected the examiners of being [...] "unduly lenient and sympathetic". The war ended after two months and his conscription ended. He decided to follow his father's profession and entered the University of Göttingen in December 1918 to study medicine. In 1919 he transferred to the University of Freiburg. In 1923 he published his first technical paper on <b>tissue</b> <b>staining</b> technique, the study which he started under the guidance of his teacher Wilhelm von Mollendorf in 1920. He completed his medical course in December 1923. To obtain a medical licence he spent one year at the Third Medical Clinic in the University of Berlin. By then he turned his ambition from becoming a practising physician to medical researcher, particularly towards chemistry. In 1924 he studied at the Department of Chemistry at the Pathological Institute of the Charité Hospital, Berlin, for informal training in chemistry and biochemistry. He finally earned his MD. degree in 1925 from the University of Hamburg.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tissue</b> <b>staining,</b> or chomoscopy, {{is used as}} an {{adjunctive}} technique during gastrointestinal endoscopy. Chemical {{agents are}} applied to the gastrointestinal mucosal surface to identify specific epithelia or to enhance the mucosal surface characteristics of the gastrointestinal epithelium. This aids in the recognition of subtle lesions (ie, polyps) or allows directed targeting of biopsies (ie, sprue or Barrett’s esophagus) to increase the yield of endoscopic diagnostic accuracy. The four endoscopic tissue-staining techniques in use are vital staining, contrast staining (chromoscopy), reactive staining and tattooing. Some of the agents used for endoscopic <b>tissue</b> <b>staining</b> and the uses of chromoscopy in identifying pathology of the esophagus, stomach, small bowel and colon during endoscopy are discussed...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY-An {{electron}} microscopic {{study was}} made of a benign con-nective tissue tumor, elastoFibroma, characterized in light microscopy by "Fibers, globes, and irregular masses " which take the elastic <b>tissue</b> <b>stains.</b> These masses were found by electron microscopy to consist of degenerating Fibrils, often surrounding an elastic fiber core which was removed by elastase digestion. A matrix material surrounding the degenerating Fibrils was also removed by elastasedigestion.

50|$|Gitter {{cells are}} the {{eventual}} result of microglial cell's phagocytosis of infectious material or cellular debris. Eventually, after engulfing {{a certain amount}} of material, the phagocytic microglia becomes unable to phagocytose any further materials. The resulting cellular mass is known as a granular corpuscle, named for its ‘grainy' appearance. By looking at <b>tissues</b> <b>stained</b> to reveal gitter cells, pathologists can see post-infection areas that have healed.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To compare tissue {{immunohistochemical}} {{expression of}} CA 125 with its {{level in the}} serum of corresponding uterine serous carcinoma (USC) patients. Materials and Methods: Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of consecutive USC uterine specimens of 25 patients with known serum CA 125 levels prior to treatment were examined. The clinicopathological records of these patients were retrospectively abstracted. Immunohistochemistry was performed in each case on deparaffinized 4 and # 956; sections of paraffin-embedded tissue blocks for detection of CA 125. Staining of more than 10 % of cells was considered positive. A scoring index was calculated by multiplying the intensity grade by the percentage of stained cells and considered low when it was equal to 1 or less and high when {{it was more than}} 1. Results: Positive immunohistochemical staining and a high staining score were found in 72. 0 % and 61. 1 % of the patients respectively elevated serum CA 125 levels prior to treatment were observed in 36. 0 % of the patients. The difference between the percentage of USC patients with positive CA 125 <b>tissue</b> <b>staining</b> and the percentage of those with elevated CA 125 serum levels were significant. Elevated serum levels correlated significantly with advanced stage disease. No correlation was found between positive immunohistochemical <b>tissue</b> <b>staining</b> parameters and stage of the disease. Conclusion: The higher proportion of USC patients with positive CA 125 immunohistochemical <b>tissue</b> <b>staining</b> than with elevated serum CA 125 levels indicates the presence of some mechanism that prevents the access of CA 125 into the circulation.
