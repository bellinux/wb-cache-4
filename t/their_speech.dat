5|$|Although {{individuals}} with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and <b>their</b> <b>speech</b> typically lacks significant abnormalities, language acquisition and use is often atypical. Abnormalities include verbosity, abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful {{only to the}} speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, intonation, prosody, and rhythm. Echolalia has also been observed in {{individuals with}} AS.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{members of}} Georgia Tech's college Republican club sued Georgia Tech, {{aided by the}} Alliance Defense Fund, in a case known as Sklar v. Clough that lasted until April 2008.

Clough stepped down after almost fourteen years as President on July 1, 2008, which he previously announced in an email to students and staff on March 15, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Language {{assessment}} {{will allow}} the recognition of medical conditions presenting with aphonia or dysarthria, neurological conditions such as stroke or dementia presenting with aphasia, and specific language disorders such as stuttering, cluttering or mutism. People with autism or Asperger syndrome may have abnormalities in paralinguistic and pragmatic aspects of <b>their</b> <b>speech.</b> Echolalia (repetition of another person's words) and palilalia (repetition of the subject's own words) can be heard with patients with autism, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. A person with schizophrenia might use neologisms, which are made-up words which have a specific meaning to the person using them.|$|E

5|$|People who stutter include British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, orator Demosthenes, King George VI, actor James Earl Jones, {{and country}} singer Mel Tillis. Churchill, whose stutter was {{particularly}} apparent to 1920s writers, {{was one of}} the 30% of stutterers who have an associated speech disorder—a lisp in his case—yet led his nation through World War II. Demosthenes stammered and was inarticulate as a youth, yet, through dedicated practice, using methods such as placing pebbles in his mouth, became a great orator of Ancient Greece. King George VI hired speech therapist Lionel Logue to enable him to speak to his Empire, and Logue effectively helped him accomplish this goal. This training and its results are the focus of the 2010 film The King's Speech. James Earl Jones has stated he was mute for many years of his youth yet he became an actor noted for the power of his voice. Mel Tillis stutters when talking but not when singing. Many people had <b>their</b> <b>speech</b> impediment only as a child and have overcome their condition.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which the player takes control of a silent protagonist that can be named and whose personality is determined by dialogue choices made in the game. Navigation is split into two types: standard navigation through the game's three-dimensional (3D) dungeons in a first-person view, and navigation around the protagonist's home of Hirasaki City using a 3D overworld map. During dungeon navigation, the player's route is automatically mapped, and the map can be viewed in the menu screen. Non-playable characters (NPCs) are represented in first-person navigation with 2D sprites, and <b>their</b> <b>speech</b> is represented with head-and-shoulder portraits above dialogue boxes. Quests are available at a location called the House of Divination, which the player can choose to accept in exchange for rewards. Various stores are scattered throughout Hirasaki City for buying items, weapons and armor, and healing the player's party and reserves. A key currency in the game is Magnetite, which is used for summoning demons and as currency {{in some of the}} stores.|$|E
5|$|The dialect of the {{district}} of Palakkad in Kerala has {{a large number of}} Malayalam loanwords, has been influenced by Malayalam's syntax and also has a distinctive Malayalam accent. Similarly, Tamil spoken in Kanyakumari District has more unique words and phonetic style than Tamil spoken at other parts of Tamil Nadu. The words and phonetics are so different that a person from Kanyakumari district is easily identifiable by their spoken Tamil. Hebbar and Mandyam dialects, spoken by groups of Tamil Vaishnavites who migrated to Karnataka in the 11th century, retain many features of the Vaishnava paribasai, a special form of Tamil developed in the 9th and 10th centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values. Several castes have their own sociolects which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of where they come from. It is often possible to identify a person's caste by <b>their</b> <b>speech.</b> Tamil in Sri Lanka incorporates loan words from Portuguese, Dutch, and English.|$|E

5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that <b>their</b> <b>speech</b> seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E
5|$|Upsher and Doff: Upsher and Doff are {{a tabloid}} {{journalist}} and photographer, respectively, {{from the planet}} Jetsam, who work for a tabloid called The Hebdomadal, and who are also lovers.

Jetsam is a partially underwater society, as its natives possess an amphibious physiology, and are capable of surviving in and out of water. Upsher and Doff experience more than one confrontation with Freelancers hired {{to put an end to}} their investigation. The Brand poisons them with embargon, a substance that will kill them if they report their findings about the family to anyone else, though they attempt to find a way around this in order to continue their investigation. After they learn The Brand is dead, they attempt to resume their investigation, but are confronted by The Will, who drafts them into his service.|$|E
