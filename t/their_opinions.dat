5|$|Frederick's childrenWilhelm in particularheld various {{political}} positions and greatly influenced Europe.

Wilhelm grew up full of disdain for <b>their</b> <b>opinions</b> on government, and shortly after his father's death, proclaimed that he would follow the path of his grandfather, William I. He made no reference to Frederick III. William II abandoned all of his father's policies and ideas, and eventually led Germany into World War I.|$|E

Critics were also mixed in <b>their</b> <b>opinions</b> of the arranged album, feeling that several of the pieces were simply inferior versions of the original tracks. Both of the albums and the single sold well enough to place on the Japanese Oricon charts, with the original soundtrack album reaching a peak of #13 and remaining on the charts for eight weeks.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} had promulgated the Powers of Nomad Shiekhs Ordinance in 1922, and had recognized and reinforced the judicial powers of over 300 tribal leaders by 1923.

The principle of indirect rule had also given the Sayyids, including Abd al-Rahman, more power to prevent changes demanded by the secular opposition. In a shift of policy, the Graduates' General Congress was launched in 1938 as a forum for the intelligentsia of Sudan to express <b>their</b> <b>opinions</b> and as an alternative voice to that of the tribal leaders, who had become discredited.|$|E
