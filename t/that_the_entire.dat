5|$|Astronomers {{originally}} supposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> trans-Neptunian {{population would}} show a similar red surface colour, {{as they were}} thought to have originated in the same region and subjected to the same physical processes. Specifically, SDOs were expected to have large amounts of surface methane, chemically altered into complex organic molecules by energy from the Sun. This would absorb blue light, creating a reddish hue. Most classical objects display this colour, but scattered objects do not; instead, they present a white or greyish appearance.|$|E

5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1917, the {{unrestricted}} submarine warfare campaign—which Germany had launched {{at the beginning of}} February—had so succeeded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Allied war effort was endangered.

In response to a request from the Royal Navy for the service of American antisubmarine warfare ships in European waters, the United States Navy began sending destroyers eastward across the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, {{the last}} {{king of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs.

None of his guests through the 1880s could do much for Muir's cause, except for Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine. Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty congressional lobbyist.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{fears of}} a Japanese {{counter-attack}} grew and they requested reinforcements from General Douglas MacArthur. The request was denied as his intelligence staff believed that there were only 350 Japanese in the vicinity. Actually, there were already 5,000 Japanese around Sattelberg and Finschhafen. The Australians received some reinforcements {{in the shape of}} the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion. The arrival of this unit meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> 20th Infantry Brigade could concentrate on Finschhafen. The Japanese naval troops which were holding Finschhafen began to withdraw and Finschhafen fell to the Australians on 2 October. The 20th Infantry Brigade then linked up with the 22nd Infantry Battalion, a Militia infantry battalion that had cleared the coastal area in the south of the Huon Peninsula, advancing from Lae over the mountains. The Japanese withdrew into the mountains around Sattelberg.|$|E

Australias design was altered during construction to incorporate improvements in technology, including the newly developed nickel-steel armour plate. While it was intended <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> ship be fitted with the new armour, manufacturing problems meant that older armour had {{to be used in}} some sections: the delay in sourcing the older armour plates set construction back half a year.
