5|$|Music {{journalist}} Peter Doggett notes <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> {{the surf}} music reference. In 1970, business manager Michael Jeffery committed Hendrix to {{contributing to the}} soundtrack for Rainbow Bridge; his music is heard during surfing scenes with David Nuuhiwa and others. Pioneer surf guitarist Dick Dale, {{who claimed to have}} met Hendrix in Los Angeles in 1964, believed the mention was Hendrix's way of encouraging his recuperation when Dale was seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> Seinfeld's stance {{was noted}} {{by at least}} one publication, as Seinfeld had itself {{weathered}} a rocky beginning thanks to the patience of NBC executive Rick Ludwin, the benefit of a strong lead-in (Cheers), and years to develop its audience as opposed to O'Brien's six months.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> Royce's film {{career is}} that he ended up portraying the very people he had fled from in Germany and Austria. In the 1990s, a play about Royce's life was written by Felix Mitterer, titled In der Löwengrube (English: In the Lion's Den). It premiered at the Volkstheater in Vienna on January 24, 1998.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> the {{situation}} was that the primary reason {{this section of the}} creek was in so natural a state was that it had been protected from other development through the land having been reserved for the section of the proposed F35 Scoresby Freeway (Renamed Eastlink) to join the end of the Eastern Freeway under the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan.|$|E

A further distinction is made between <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> policy and <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> <b>of</b> practice, <b>the</b> latter characterized by the strategies used by headteachers and teachers as they adapt policy to practice and as they represent these adaptations as fulfilling accountability requirements.

25|$|Harold Holt is {{most famously}} commemorated by the Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre in the Melbourne suburb of Glen Iris.

25|$|Panufnik {{continued}} {{to find it}} frustratingly difficult to get permission {{to travel to the}} States. In the wake of McCarthyism, the staff at the American Embassy in London were unhelpful, and treated him with suspicion: Panufnik was surprised to have to supply fingerprints, and he was pointedly asked more than once whether he had ever {{been a member of the}} Polish United Workers' Party. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> this difficulty, after his recent public defection to the west, was not lost on Panufnik.|$|E
25|$|The name Blue River {{began to}} be applied in the 18th century, {{apparently}} owing to a former name of the Dam Chu or Min and to analogy with the Yellow River, but it was frequently explained in early English references as a 'translation' of Jiang, Jiangkou, or Yangzijiang. Very common in 18th- and 19th-century sources, the name fell out of favor due to growing awareness of its lack of any connection to the river's Chinese names and to <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> its application to such a muddy waterway.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{majority}} of Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur {{is closer to the}} style of Gawain and French versions of the legend, the second part of Malory's work, King Arthur's war against the Romans, is primarily a translation of the earlier alliterative work, although Malory alters the Alliterative Morte Arthure's tragic ending into a triumphant ending. Malory's contextualization of this tale early in his collection of Arthurian tales seems to indicate Arthur's heroic potential which will deepen <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> his eventual fall through his own pride, and the wrath and lust that are allowed to run rampant in his court.|$|E
25|$|Paley was {{a notorious}} ladies man his entire life. Indeed, his first {{marriage}} to Dorothy ended when a newspaper published a suicide note written to Paley by a former girlfriend. As a result of another relationship, he provided a stipend to a former lover, actress Louise Brooks, {{for the rest of}} her life. In his later years, he enjoyed keeping company with several women. Paley was included in a list of the ten most eligible bachelors compiled by Cosmopolitan magazine in 1985; <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> the octogenarian Paley being on the list was an inspiration for Late Night with David Letterman's nightly Top Ten lists.|$|E
25|$|In {{his recent}} book 'Back to the Mark' the fast bowler had written 'I try to hit a batsman in the rib-cage when I bowl a {{purposeful}} bouncer and I want it to hurt {{so much that the}} batsman doesn't want to face me any more'. How well he had succeeded in Edrich's case! <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> his pyrrhic victory was that Edrich had not been felled by a bouncer...The English press greeted the incident with headlines such as: 'Licence to Kill!', 'Lillee should be banned' – '007, James Bond cricket'. The atmosphere {{on and off the field}} was emotionally electric. Bodyline was freely discussed. In the background the crowd, lusting for more blood and guts, stirred the embers of controversy chanting for 'Lillee, Lillee'.|$|E

25|$|Adrien has co-written {{two plays}} with Jean-Louis Bauer.

25|$|From 1905 until 1989 {{there were}} two top {{divisions}} in Cornwall; Cornwall Senior League 1 East and Cornwall Senior League 1 West. The teams finishing in first place played for the Western Morning News Cup with the winner declared champions of Cornwall. The last winners of the Western Morning Cup was St Gluvias who beat St Austell by 22 runs. In 1990 the top six clubs {{in the east and}} west leagues formed County League One with St Just winning the league despite only finishing 6th in the western league the previous season. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> St Just winning the first title was they were initially against an all Cornwall league because of the increased expenditure of travel for teams in the far west.|$|E
25|$|Inheritance was by descent, {{but could}} be further {{restricted}} by entailment, which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only. In {{the case of the}} Bennet family, Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet's death and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her future security. Nevertheless, she refuses his offer. Inheritance laws benefited males because most women did not have independent legal rights until {{the second half of the}} 19th century. As a consequence, women's financial security at that time depended on men. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and her future children. <b>The</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> the novel's opening line, therefore, is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be looking for a wealthy husband in order to have prosperous life.|$|E
25|$|The oral {{tradition}} {{of that time}} depicted <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> the rivalries and adversities attracted to the Ado Township and the Ewi when describing her quest for expansion in Ekiti as popularly recounted thus: ‘Ogun yeye, b’Ewi ja, Ajase I loo Ewi’ Meaning ‘Many are the adversity of the King of Ado-Ekiti (Ewi), but the power of triumph lies in his hands.’ The continuous opposition to Ewi’s paramountcy by {{a large number of}} Ekiti royalties across the country is a pointer to the fear inherent in Ewi’s notable imperial ambitions from 17th to 19th century, which became threats on the status and economy of other notable towns, who were also aiming at prominence and equality within the regional power sharing structure of Ekiti country. No doubt, the characteristics of town formation in Ado-Ekiti area distinguish the mother town (the metropolis) where the most important chiefs reside from the subordinate towns where other rulers existed.|$|E
