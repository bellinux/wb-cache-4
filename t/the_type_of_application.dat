25|$|Windows HotStart (formerly Windows Direct {{and also}} known as Direct Media Mode) enables a user to {{immediately}} launch an application after startup or resume by the press of a button or by wireless receiver events; {{it is designed to}} provide the instant on feature availability that is traditionally associated with mobile devices such as cell phones and portable media players. HotStart enables what Microsoft has referred to as appliance-like availability, allowing a PC to take on a number of roles based on <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> launched—a PC that boots into a multimedia application, for example, can essentially function as a dedicated media device. Original equipment manufacturers can customize HotStart hardware implementation and functionality. Users may also customize application launch functionality through the Windows Registry; instead of launching a multimedia application, a user can, for example, configure a HotStart button or other form of input to instantly launch an e-mail application.|$|E

The tuning constants are shown below as [...] "K" [...] and must be derived for each control application, as they depend on the response characteristics of the complete loop external to the controller. These are dependent on the behaviour of the measuring sensor, the final control element (such as a control valve), any control signal delays and the process itself.

40|$|Abstract—In {{an effort}} to {{ultimately}} develop a network-based mobile device resource monitor, we demonstrate the feasibility <b>of</b> remotely detecting <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> (i. e., CPU intensive, I/O intensive or non-CPU intensive) actively executing on a mobile device. The distinguishing characteristic of this method is its uncanny ability to remotely infer <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> executing on a mobile device {{when there is no}} native network traffic being generated from it. To do this, we inconspicuously solicit network traffic from the mobile device by pinging it. Then we capture the timestamps of the ICMP replies, calculate the average inter-packet spacing, and finally use a Neural-Fuzzy Classifier (NFC) that has been previously trained on CPU intensive, I/O intensive, and non-CPU intensive correlated network traffic to discern between <b>the</b> three application <b>types.</b> <b>The</b> NFC acts as a dynamic threshold by grouping the training patterns into clusters and uses these clusters to create membership functions to separate future patterns <b>of</b> each <b>type.</b> We evaluate several Android and Apple devices, and we show that our approach is feasible for Android mobile devices. The key to this method is CPU throttling (when the on-demand governor is used), which scales the CPU performance according {{to the needs of the}} presently executing applications in {{an effort to}} save power. We exploit CPU throttling to extract embedded delays from solicited ICMP network traffic. Our results show that our method is at least 95 % effective in remotely detecting <b>the</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> executing on Android mobile device.

A computer can follow a rote sequence of steps more quickly than a person, and it can run the tests overnight to present the results in the morning. However, the labor that is saved in actual testing must be spent instead authoring the test program. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> to be tested, and the automation tools that are chosen, this may require more labor than a manual approach. In addition, some testing tools present a very large amount of data, potentially creating a time consuming task of interpreting the results.|$|E

Since features are used as the starting point and main primitives for subsequent algorithms, the overall algorithm will often only be as good as its feature detector. Consequently, the desirable property for a feature detector is repeatability: whether or not the same feature will be detected in two or more different images of the same scene.|$|E

50|$|There is no {{engineering}} {{limit to}} the size of jetboats, though the validity of their use depends a lot on <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>application.</b> Classic prop-drives are generally more efficient and economical at low speeds, up to about 20 kn, but as boat speed increases beyond this, the extra hull resistance generated by struts, rudders, shafts (etc.) means waterjets are more efficient in the 20-50 knot range (up to 50 kn). Also, in situations with very large propellers turning at slow speeds (such as tug boats), the equivalent size waterjet would be too big to be practical. For these reasons, the vast majority of waterjet units are installed in high-speed vessels and in particular situations where shallow draught, maneuverability, and load flexibility are main concerns.|$|E
