40|$|This project {{identifies}} {{and critically}} explores {{the significance of}} allusions to author James Joyce found across {{a wide range of}} cultural products, from Jacques Derrida's published philosophical works to popular culture artefacts such as Hollywood films and late twentieth-century literature. Allusive depth is multiplied as allusions to Joyce's work connect to the multiple allusions already at work within his own text; this connectivity functionally reverses the referential chain and carries it outside of <b>the</b> <b>text</b> to innumerable other alluded to texts. This project will elaborate on how alluding to Joyce opens up a multilayered intertextual dialogue that has the potential to enrich and complicate <b>the</b> alluding <b>text,</b> as well as all of <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> <b>that</b> <b>get</b> pulled into such intertextual dialogues. This process of recognition and reintegration generates a dialogue between <b>texts,</b> as <b>the</b> alluding <b>text</b> opens up an allusive space that encourages further signification, culminating in an interpretive interplay...|$|R
