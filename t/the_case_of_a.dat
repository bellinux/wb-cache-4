5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix {{of positive and negative}} in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> global alignment, but must be both positive and negative, in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local alignment.|$|E
5|$|A graph {{is formed}} by a {{collection}} of vertices and edges, where the vertices are structureless objects that are connected in pairs by edges. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> directed graph, each edge has an orientation, from one vertex to another vertex.|$|E

5|$|Front flat tire. Braking a {{wheel with}} a flat tire can cause the tire {{to come off the}} rim which greatly reduces {{friction}} and, in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> front wheel, result in a loss of balance.|$|E
5|$|Government {{meetings}} are generally {{conducted on the}} second and fourth Mondays of the month. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tie, the mayor has the casting vote. Mayors of Lincolnshire can veto propositions set forth {{by the board of}} trustees, although this move may be overridden by a two-thirds opposition vote from the board.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> driven wheel, a torque must {{be applied}} to {{generate}} the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, {{of which there are}} many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bicycle.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.|$|E

50|$|Debtors {{may also}} be forced into {{bankruptcy}} by creditors in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> involuntary bankruptcy, but only under Chapters 7 or 11. However, in most instances the debtor may choose under which chapter to file. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> involuntary bankruptcy, <b>the</b> debtor may also choose to convert from the forced chapter 7 or 11 proceeding into a proceeding under another chapter.|$|R
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, {{the increase}} in downward force on the front wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. This is known as brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the downward force on the front wheel is known as trail braking.|$|E

The offices of Lord High Steward and Lord High Constable {{have not been}} regularly filled since the 15th and 16th centuries respectively; they are, however, revived for coronation ceremonies.

5|$|The {{ignition}} system {{consisted of two}} rear-mounted, crankshaft-driven magnetos, each supplying one {{of a pair of}} spark plugs fitted to each cylinder. This is common practise for aero engines, as it ensures continued operation in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single magneto failure, and has the advantage of more efficient combustion over a single spark plug application.|$|E

5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a {{pull on the}} attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope was attached to ballast, {{so that it would}} also be activated automatically in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> catastrophic loss of ballast. Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the Patrie.|$|E
5|$|After {{the power}} outage was over, Hydro-Québec made {{numerous}} upgrades to its system {{in order to}} improve the power grid. Examples include the strengthening of electrical pylons and power poles, and increasing the power supply. This was done to enable the utility to restore power more rapidly in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> massive ice striking Quebec again. Hydro-Québec has stated that it is better-prepared to handle an ice storm with the same magnitude as the one of 1998.|$|E

5|$|Darlington {{considers}} the topology of coupled tuned circuits to involve a separate approximation technique to the insertion-loss method, but also producing nominally flat passbands and high attenuation stopbands. The most common topology for these is shunt anti-resonators coupled by series capacitors, less commonly, by inductors, or in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> two-section filter, by mutual inductance. These are most useful where the design requirement {{is not too}} stringent, that is, moderate bandwidth, roll-off and passband ripple.|$|E

In April 1913 he drew the attention of the Postmaster-General to <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> post office sorting-clerk who was having difficulties claiming his pension. On 10 August 1916, after a fatal raid by a Zeppelin in the early of the previous morning, against which the city had been able to muster only a single searchlight and one gun, he asked that adequate defences be provided and brought to action where necessary.|$|E
5|$|Her Story is an {{interactive}} movie video game {{written and directed}} by Sam Barlow. It was released on 24 June 2015 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and iOS, and the following year for Android. In the game, players search and sort through a database of video clips from fictional police interviews, and use the clips to solve <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> missing man. The police interviews focus on the man's wife, Hannah Smith, portrayed by British musician Viva Seifert.|$|E
