50|$|In {{his time}} Stuart-Glennie was seen, by Bernard Shaw, as a {{successor}} to Henry <b>Buckle,</b> <b>with</b> a theory of religious origins going back some eight thousand years, and based on racial foundations. Lewis Mumford in a 1956 work credited him with anticipating the Axial Age concept. As a disciple of <b>Buckle,</b> <b>with</b> whom he travelled, Stuart-Glennie was heavily criticised by John Mackinnon Robertson in Buckle and His Critics; Robertson took up challenges to his account of Buckle in Pilgrim Travels, made in the biography by Alfred Huth, was dismissive as callow of the theories about the era of 600 BC, and discounted John Fiske as a supporter of Stuart-Glennie.|$|R

Methods: Three eyes were treated in three patients, healthy boys aged 7  years, 12  years, and 11  years, with RRD, macular involvement, and small retinal holes, of which two were preoperatively undetectable. Conventional scleral <b>buckling</b> <b>with</b> cryoretinopexy was performed under the contact lens for vitreous surgery or noncontact wide-angle viewing system using 27 -gauge twin chandelier illumination. Results: The only known predisposing factor for retinal detachment was myopia stronger than 3  D with lattice retinal degeneration {{in two of the}} three patients. Retinal reattachment was achieved in all cases without intra- or postoperative complications. However, visual recovery was limited in one of the three patients. Conclusion: Scleral <b>buckling</b> <b>with</b> chandelier illumination is effective for pediatric RRD, especially if the retinal hole is difficult to detect preoperatively. However, visual recovery was sometimes limited because of macular involvement due to late diagnosis, {{which is one of the}} characteristic features of pediatric RRD.

Methods. 48 patients who underwent scleral <b>buckling</b> <b>with</b> encircling band surgery for unilateral rhegmatogenous retinal detachment were included in the retrospective observational study. Themean time from scleral buckling surgery to the final EDI-OCT examination was 22 ± 6. 7 months. We compare choroidal thickness between operated and fellow eyes. Results. In all patients, the macula was detached before the surgery. The subfoveal choroidal thickness in 48 treated eyes was 260. 9 ± 45. ...|$|R

40|$|Ziegler {{pioneered the}} study of thick-plate <b>buckling</b> <b>with</b> {{allowance}} for the effect of prebuckling in-plane deformation and concluded that this effect is of the same order of magnitude as that due to shear deformation. This research work further explores this important effect on the elastic buckling loads of rectangular plates with various boundary conditions, thicknesses, aspect ratios, and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratios. In contrast to Ziegler 2 ̆ 7 s static-kinematic approach, the incremental total potential energy approach is adopted. Based on the derived energy functional, the recent pb- 2 Rayleigh-Ritz method is applied for solution. The present energy approach is more convenient for handling plates with any combination of support conditions, as compared to Ziegler 2 ̆ 7 s approach of having to solve a somewhat difficult boundary-value problem. The salient aspects of plate <b>buckling</b> <b>with</b> prebuckling deformation effect are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts. The first part {{consists}} of an introduction to theory and design aspects regarding the subject of thermal <b>buckling</b> <b>with</b> main focus on buried pipelines. The second part introduces the reader to the experiments performed in this thesis, including the analytical tests performed in ANSYS followed by a presentation of the derived results. Analysis of the results, conclusions and recommendations for further work is presented in the final chapter. A lifting experiment was performed to detect and analyze the resistance provided by different soils. Upheaval buckling experiments were performed to detect a general behavior of a pipe in different upheaval buckling scenarios. Several scenarios regarding upheaval buckling were tested including; - Upheaval buckling over an imperfection with gravel, sand and clay as cover respectively - Upheaval <b>buckling</b> <b>with</b> a trenched pipe without cover in granular soils - Creep scenario simulating a pipeline {{going in and out of}} service while buried in clay - Upheaval <b>buckling</b> <b>with</b> various imperfection heights while buried in clay Most of the experiments provided interesting results, and some unforeseen happenings with the experiments in clay led to tough challenges. This also made some of the intended objectives for the thesis hard to fulfill. All performed experiments are presented graphically in the appendix.
