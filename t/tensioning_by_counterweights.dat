2500|$|Hells Gate Airtram {{starts at}} {{the parking lot of}} the Trans-Canada Highway and descends to its lower {{terminal}} on the opposite side of Fraser River next to the pedestrian suspension bridge, where there is an observation deck, a restaurant, a gift shop and other tourist attractions. It was built in 1970 by the Swiss manufacturer Habegger Engineering Works and opened on 21 July 1971. Its two cabins can carry 25 people each, plus the cabin attendant. Each cabin travels up and down along its own track rope at a maximum speed of 5m/s (18km/h, 984ft/min) over an inclined length of 341m (1118ft). The horizontal distance between the terminals is 303m (994ft) and their difference in altitude is 157m (515ft). The mean inclination between the terminals is 51%. The track ropes have a diameter of 40mm, the haul rope connecting the two cabins via the drive bull wheel in the [...] upper terminal has a diameter of 19mm and its counter rope 15mm. The track ropes are anchored in the upper terminal and are <b>tensioned</b> <b>by</b> two concrete blocks of 42 tons each suspended inside the lower terminal where the blocks have a leeway of 7.9m to move up and down. The haul rope and its counter rope are <b>tensioned</b> <b>by</b> a <b>counterweight</b> of 3.5 tons, also in the lower terminal. The max output of the motor is 140 HP (104kW). The total carrying capacity of the aerial tramway is 530 passengers per hour (one way).|$|R

50|$|The system {{consists}} of three types of stations: Power Stations with 135 hp (101 kW) electric motors, powering one or both connecting sections. Terminal stations in Forsby and Köping where the limestone was loaded/unloaded also functioned as power stations. Angle stations lack motors and only change {{the angle of the}} cable track by splicing together two sections powered from their respective other sides. Station buildings have an iron frame, wooden walls and roof constructed from asbestos cement. The pulling cables go in endless loops between stations, and kept taut <b>by</b> <b>counterweights</b> in towers in the power stations. The heavier carrying cable is divided into four runs along each section, connected <b>by</b> <b>tension</b> stations. These stations are comparatively small, simple structures regulating cable tension along the way.|$|R

50|$|Some {{designers}} have reverted to a 60° angle between cylinder banks, which produces a more compact engine, but have used three-throw crankshafts with flying arms between the crankpins of each throw to achieve even 120° angles between firing intervals. This has the additional advantage that the flying arms can be weighted for balancing purposes. This still leaves an unbalanced primary couple, which is offset <b>by</b> <b>counterweights</b> on the crankshaft and flywheel {{to leave a}} small secondary couple, which can be absorbed by carefully designed engine mounts.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the advancements {{of the application}} of thermal tensioning techniques to different weld geometries in order to eliminate buckling distortion. The main goal of this work is to better understand these techniques through experimental and numerical investigation and increase their technological maturity to aid industrial implementation. The thermal tensioning techniques investigated in this work are Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling and Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Heating. The investigation for both techniques encompasses thermal source characterisation, application to different weld geometries and residual stress measurements and analysis of both butt and fillet welded samples. A detailed technology transfer study of Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling {{was carried out in}} which different aspects of the application of TTC to arc welding (Gas Metal Arc Welding and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding) was examined. This study focused on the influence of both the liquid CO 2 delivery system installation and welding tooling and jigging on the effectiveness of Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling in reducing buckling distortion. Experimental and numerical cooling source characterisation was also carried out in the Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling work to investigate the characteristics of the cooling source under different cooling conditions. The Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling work was then concluded with welding trials and residual stress measurement and analysis. The results of the Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling study show that the installation of the liquid CO 2 delivery system as well as the welding tooling and jigging has a major influence on the effectiveness of Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling in reducing buckling distortion. The cooling source characterisation work reveals that the most important parameter of the cryogenic nozzle delivery system used in this work is the Air Entrainment Gap. A description of a control system of Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Cooling is suggested based on controlling the Air Entrainment Gap. The residual stress analysis shows a reduction in the Applied Weld Load and minor changes in the tensile peak of the residual stress distribution of both butt and fillet welded panels. The Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Heating investigation includes heat source characterisation, application of Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Heating on butt and fillet welds, utilisation of alternative heat sources and residual stress analysis. The results of these investigation show that Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Heating is also highly effective in eliminating buckling distortion in butt, fillet and overlapped panels. The applied heating temperature in this work is typically in the range of 160 - 250 °C but not greater than 330 °C. The residual stress measurements reveal that the additional heating of Thermal <b>Tensioning</b> <b>by</b> Heating generates a positive stress gradient at the location of heating...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A falling soccer goalpost is {{associated}} with the potential risk of serious injury that can sometimes even be fatal. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyse the extent of the problem in Denmark and focus on the mechanism of injury and prevention. METHODS: Data were analysed for the period 1989 - 1997 from the European Home and Leisure Accident Surveillance System, which is an electronic register of the injuries seen in the casualty departments of the hospitals of five selected cities in Denmark representing 14 % of the Danish population; in addition, fatal accidents in the whole of Denmark since 1981 were examined. Forty two injured persons were interviewed about the circumstances of the accident. Attempts were made to estimate the proportion of goalposts secured <b>by</b> <b>counterweight</b> in the five different regions, compared with the proportion secured with ground stakes and those that were unsecured, by analysing data from the largest producers of goalposts in Denmark. RESULTS: In the period 1981 - 1988, two fatal accidents were recorded. In the period 1989 - 1997, 117 people were injured by a falling goalpost; six of the injuries required hospitalisation. Some 88 % of the injured were under the age of 15. In a telephone interview with 42 of the injured, 50 % stated that the goalpost fell because someone was hanging on the crossbar. Comparing the five different regions with respect to the proportion of goalposts secured <b>by</b> <b>counterweight</b> and the number of accidents, the following relation was found. Areas in which a high percentage of the goalposts were secured <b>by</b> a <b>counterweight</b> correlated inversely with a high number of accidents (r = - 0. 9; p = 0. 04). CONCLUSION: Soccer is a widely played sport and it is important to be aware that accidents caused by falling goalposts can occur and that they presumably can be prevented by proper use of goalposts, by using secure goalposts, and by securing old goalposts with a counterweight. ...|$|R

50|$|Rail linkspans are {{generally}} supported at their outer end <b>by</b> <b>counterweights.</b> This {{means that when}} the linkspan is lowered onto the ship’s ledge only {{a small proportion of}} its weight rests there. However half of the weight of the train on the linkspan is transferred to the ledge. When it becomes necessary to make longer linkspans to accommodate a greater tide range the train loads become proportionately higher until a critical reaction is reached. Before this point is reached, it is usual to create a second span with this inner span being adjusted at its outer end, where it is hinged to the outer span. Rail ferries must not only have the correct rail alignment, but their stern configuration and beam must be an exact fit for the berth it is to use.|$|R
