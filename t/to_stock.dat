40|$|I {{show that}} {{ambiguity}} (Knightian uncertainty) {{and learning about}} the equity premium can explain the fraction of financial wealth allocated <b>to</b> <b>stocks</b> over the life cycle {{and the stock market}} participation puzzle. I assume that individuals are ambiguous about the equity premium and are averse with respect to this ambiguity, which results in a lower optimal allocation <b>to</b> <b>stocks</b> over the life cycle. As agents get older, they learn about the equity premium and increase their allocation <b>to</b> <b>stocks.</b> Cohort effects can be identified via learning, since each cohort has different stock market experiences and thus differ in their beliefs. Time effects are identified via decreasing fees over time. Two ways to include ambiguity aversion in the model are examined: recursive smooth preferences and maximin utility preferences. I find that if agents have maximin preferences, the empirically observed allocation <b>to</b> <b>stocks</b> can be matched. However, the stylized facts cannot be replicated when agents have smooth recursive preferences with only moderate risk aversion.

5|$|During the 1880s, Moore {{began work}} {{on a series of}} novels in a realist style. His first novel, A Modern Lover (1883) was a three-volume work, as {{preferred}} by the circulating libraries, and deals with the art scene of the 1870s and 1880s in which many characters are identifiably real. The circulating libraries in England banned the book because of its explicit portrayal of the amorous pursuits of its hero. At this time the British circulating libraries, such as Mudie's Select Library, controlled the market for fiction and the public, who paid fees to borrow their books, expected them to guarantee the morality of the novels available. His next book, a novel in the realist style, A Mummers Wife (1885) was also regarded as unsuitable by Mudie's and W H Smith refused <b>to</b> <b>stock</b> it on their news-stalls. Despite this, during its first year of publication the book was in its fourteenth edition mainly due to the publicity stirred up by its opponents. The French newspaper Le Voltaire published it in serial form as La Femme du cabotin in July–October 1886. His next novel A Drama in Muslin was banned by Mudie's and Smith's. In response Moore declared war on the circulating libraries by publishing two provocative pamphlets; Literature at Nurse and Circulating Morals. In these, he complained that the libraries profit from salacious popular fiction while refusing <b>to</b> <b>stock</b> serious literary fiction.|$|E

40|$|In the Chinook Fishery Regulation Assessment Model (FRAM), {{the number}} of {{encounters}} with fish below the size limit in a fishery (sublegals) is calculated as {{the number of}} encounters with fish at or above the size limit in a fishery (legals) times an average sublegals/legals ratio from that fishery. Because coded wire tags (CWTs) are not recovered from non-landed encounters, such as those with sublegals, methods are needed <b>to</b> infer <b>stock</b> and age composition of sublegal encounters in a fishery. Sublegal encounters are assigned only <b>to</b> <b>stocks</b> caught in the fishery (or a surrogate fishery) and may include sublegals from ages present in the legal catch as well as younger ages with few or no legals. In previous calibrations, total sublegal encounters in a fishery and time step were assigned <b>to</b> <b>stocks</b> and ages in two steps. First, total sublegal encounters were apportioned <b>to</b> <b>stocks</b> based on the stock composition of the landed catch in that fishery and time step (Unidentified Author, 2012).

5|$|Native Silver perch and {{introduced}} brown trout were released in 1981–83 and 1987–89 respectively, {{but have not}} been stocked since. Silver perch stockings resulted in almost no captures. Introduced rainbow trout have been released sporadically, approximately once a decade, but have not been released since 2002–04, due to unacceptably low survival rates. According to a government report, {{the reason for the}} low survival rate is unknown, but the dominance of carp in the competition for food is one suggested theory. However, the eutrophic nature and high water temperatures of the lake in summer are more probable reasons.
