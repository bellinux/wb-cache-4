In the Early Medieval period, when ships were important means of transportation, Charlemagne decided to link both catchments by {{the construction of}} a canal connecting the Schwabian Rezat and the Altmühl rivers. The artificial waterway would provide a continuous inland navigation route from the North Sea to the Black Sea. The shortcut is known as Fossa Carolina and represents {{one of the most important}} Early Medieval engineering achievements in Europe. Despite the important geostrategic relevance of the construction it is not clarified whether the canal was actually used as a navigation waterway. We present new geophysical data and in situ findings from the <b>trench</b> <b>fills</b> that prove for the first time a total length of the constructed Carolingian canal of at least 2300 metres. We have evidence for a conceptual width of the artificial water course between 5 and 6 metres and a water depth of at least 60 to 80 cm. This allows a crossing way passage of Carolingian cargo scows with a payload of several tons. There is strong evidence for clayey to silty layers in the <b>trench</b> <b>fills</b> which reveal suspension load limited stillwater deposition and, therefore, the evidence of former Carolingian and post-Carolingian ponds.

RF-GD-OES (radio frequency glow discharge optical emission spectrometry) was used for detection of C and H as indicators for incorporated hydrocarbon molecules. The presented results indicate a fragmentation of incorporated hydrocarbons and their constrict segregation near the Cu surface. The bilateral relationship between incorporated organic impurities and intrinsic stress behavior {{is associated with the}} Gorky effect. Key words: Electrochemical deposition; copper; impurities; segregation; GD-OES. The electrochemical deposition of Cu is widely applied for manufacturing of conducting lines and vias of semiconductor devices. This technique is very cost-effective by offering a high deposition rate, low temperature processing, system simplicity, and good process controllability. Particularly, Cu electroplating is favored for damascene process, which requires a good <b>trench</b> <b>filling</b> with high aspect ratio [1, 2].

Samples of raw and pasteurised milk from different sampling sites along the line were collected. After incubation at 7 °C until the total aerobic plate count reached 106 to 107 cfu/ml, {{or the number of}} GPS exceeded 104 cfu/ml isolates were picked randomly and identified. All GNP present in the raw milk were properly killed during pasteurisation. A recontamination by GNP was observed in 40 % of the consumer packages. This recontamination was focused to the filling procedure, and Pseudomonas was the dominating GNP in all packages. Environmental samples, as water from different water sources in the dairy plant, air collected by a RCS-sampler on water-agar strips, and empty, formed and sealed packages taken from the <b>filling</b> <b>machines,</b> were inoculated with sterile milk. GNP isolates were randomly picked and identified after incubation at 7 °C. Samples of water and air collected in the immediate surroundings of the <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> contained large numbers of GNP causing growth in refrigerated milk. GNP isolates from the milk samples and from the environmental samples were genomically typed by the PCR-based method Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The RAPD-typing showed that there are many different RAPD-types involved in the recontamination of pasteurised milk. Several of the milk contaminating RAPD-types were found in condensed water on the filling nozzles, in waste-water {{at the bottom of the}} <b>filling</b> <b>machine,</b> and in air surrounding the <b>filling</b> <b>machine.</b> Some contaminating RAPD-types were present inside the <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> over long periods, especially at the bottom of the <b>filling</b> <b>machine.</b> The effect on post-pasteurisation contamination by reducing the usage of water around the <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> was studied.
