5|$|From {{the first}} article, {{cataloguing}} {{the rights of}} man, Mason derived the following articles, which make clear that <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> is to secure and protect those rights, and if it fails to do so, the {{people have a right}} to amend or abolish it. Property could not be taken for public use without the owner's consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives. If accused, a person had the right to a speedy and local trial, based on an accusation made known to him, with the right to call for evidence and witnesses in his favor.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{has been}} {{described}} as conservative and libertarian. According to University of Georgia political scientist Keith Poole, Paul had the most conservative voting record of any member of Congress from 1937 to 2002, and is the most conservative of the candidates that had sought the 2012 Republican nomination for president, on a scale primarily measuring positions on <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in managing the economy– not positions on social issues or foreign policy matters. Other analyses, in which key votes on domestic social issues and foreign policy factor more heavily, have judged Paul much more moderate. The National Journal, for instance, rated Paul only the 145th most conservative member of the House of Representatives (out of 435) based on votes cast in 2010.|$|E

25|$|In turn, <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in the {{national}} economy had become associated with the assumption {{by the state of}} the responsibility for assuring its citizens of a degree of economic well-being. The system of economic protection for at-risk citizens sometimes called the welfare state grew out of the Great Depression, which created a popular demand for governmental intervention in the economy, and out of the theoretical contributions of the Keynesian school of economics, which asserted the need for governmental intervention to counter market imperfections.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, the Republic of China (ROC) government, {{retreated to}} Taiwan {{after losing the}} Chinese Civil War, carried out land reform {{policies}} such as the 375 Rent Reduction. In the 1960s, the agrarian economy was replaced with light industry as small and medium enterprises started to form. From 1966 to 1980, Taiwan's economy was gradually stabilized as the Ten Major Construction Projects laid a foundation in further economic developments. After the 1980s, <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in the economy gradually lessened as many government-owned corporations were privatized.|$|E
50|$|Changes {{occurred}} {{from the}} 1970s to the 1980s.

Partisan composition of state governments is the most significant factor, with states led primarily by Democrats tending to expand Medicaid and states led primarily by Republicans tending to reject expansion. Other important factors include the generosity of the Medicaid program in a given state prior to 2010, spending on elections by health care providers, and the attitudes people in a given state tend to have about <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> and the perceived beneficiaries of expansion.|$|E
25|$|Because the Roman Catholic Church {{had played}} such an {{important}} role in the Reconquista (Christian reconquest) of the Iberian peninsula from the Moors, the Church in essence became another arm of the Spanish government. The Spanish Crown granted it a large role in the administration of the state, and this practice became even more pronounced in the New World, where prelates often assumed <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> officials. In addition to the Church's explicit political role, the Catholic faith became a central part of Spanish identity after the conquest of last Muslim kingdom in the peninsula, the Emirate of Granada, and the expulsion of all Jews who did not convert to Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{constant}} security threats, Israel—a majorly Jewish state—has thrived economically. Throughout the 1980s and the 1990s {{there were numerous}} liberalization measures: in monetary policy, in domestic capital markets, and in various instruments of governmental interference in economic activity. <b>The</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in the economy was considerably decreased. On the other hand, some governmental economic functions were increased: a national health insurance system was introduced, though private health providers continued to provide health services within the national system. Social welfare payments, such as unemployment benefits, child allowances, old age pensions and minimum income support, were expanded continuously, until they formed a major budgetary expenditure. These transfer payments compensated, to a large extent, for the continuous growth of income inequality, which had moved Israel from among the developed countries with the least income inequality to those with the most.|$|E

25|$|The 1930s {{also saw}} a change in <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> Until then, the state acted {{primarily}} {{in response to the}} demands of the export sector. During the first half of the decade, it was forced to interfere swiftly in an attempt to control the external crisis and to avoid the collapse of the coffee economy; government leaders hoped that the crisis would pass soon and that another export boom would occur. However, with the magnitude and duration of the crisis it became clear that Brazil could no longer rely solely on exports of primary goods and that it was necessary to promote economic diversification. During the Estado Novo, the government made initial attempts at economic planning, and in the late 1930s began to establish the first large government enterprise, an integrated steel mill, Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional.|$|E

[...] Similarly, the Cato Institute's David Boaz includes passages from the Daodejing in his 1997 book The Libertarian Reader.

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> also grew {{during the}} early 20th century. [...] In the rural areas, most people {{obtained}} food and manufactured goods from neighbors and other people they knew personally. [...] As industry and commerce grew, goods such as food, materials, and medicines were no longer made by neighbors, but by large companies. [...] In response, citizens called on their government for consumer protection, inspection of goods, and regulation of public utilities. [...] The growth of the automobile spurred calls to develop roads and to enforce traffic laws. [...] The state officially started its trunk highway system in 1920, {{with the passage of}} the Babcock Amendment that established 70 Constitutional Routes around the state. New regulation was necessary for banking and insurance. The safety of industrial workers and miners became an increasing concern, and brought about the workers' compensation system. [...] Since government was getting more complex, citizens demanded more of a role in their government, and became more politically active.|$|E
500|$|During the Song dynasty, {{there was}} also a notable {{increase}} in commercial contacts with global markets. Merchants engaged in overseas trade through investments in trading vessels and trade which reached ports as far away as East Africa. This period also witnessed the development of the world's first banknote, or printed paper money (see Jiaozi, Huizi), which circulated on a massive scale. Combined with a unified tax system and efficient trade routes by road and canal, this meant the development of a truly nationwide market. Regional specialization promoted economic efficiency and increased productivity. Although much of the central government's treasury went to the military, taxes imposed on the rising commercial base refilled the coffers and further encouraged the monetary economy. [...] Reformers and conservatives debated <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in the economy. The emperor and his government still took responsibility for the economy, but generally made fewer claims than in earlier dynasties. The government did, however, continue to enforce monopolies on certain manufactured items and market goods to boost revenues and secure resources that were vital to the empire's security, such as tea, salt, and chemical components for gunpowder.|$|E

[...] It sold over 400,000 copies in the first eighteen years {{and more than half}} a million since 1962. It has been translated into eighteen languages. [...] Friedman talks about the need to move to a classically liberal society, that free markets would help nations and individuals in the long-run and fix the efficiency problems currently faced by the United States and other major countries of the 1950s and 1960s. He goes through the chapters specifying a specific issue in each respective chapter from <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> and money supply to social welfare programs to a special chapter on occupational licensure. Friedman concludes Capitalism and Freedom with his [...] "classical liberal" [...] stance, that government should stay out of matters that do not need and should only involve itself when absolutely necessary for the survival of its people and the country. He recounts how the best of a country's abilities come from its free markets while its failures come from government intervention.|$|E

500|$|In France, satirical {{magazine}} Charlie Hebdo {{was taken}} to court for publishing the cartoons; it was acquitted of charges that it incited hatred. [...] In Canada a human rights commission investigated The Western Standard, a magazine which published the cartoons, but found insufficient grounds to proceed with a human rights tribunal (which does not imply criminal charges, but is a quasi-judicial, mandatory process) against the publication. These government investigations of journalists catalysed debate about <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in censoring or prosecuting expressions they deemed potentially hateful. Critics said the cartoon controversy {{was a sign that}} attempts at judicial codification of such concepts as respect, tolerance and offence have backfired on the West. Michael Neumann wrote, [...] "Western piety has left the West without a leg to stand on in this dispute. It is no good trumpeting rights of free expression, because these rights are now supposed to have nebulous but severe limitations." [...] Tim Cavanaugh wrote that the incident revealed the danger of hate speech laws, writing, [...] "The issue will almost certainly lead to a revisiting of the lamentable laws against 'hate speech' in Europe, and with any luck to a debate on whether these laws are more likely to destroy public harmony than encourage it." ...|$|E
500|$|When President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva {{took office}} in January 2003, he chose Gil as Brazil's new Minister of Culture, only the second black person {{to serve in the}} country's cabinet. The {{appointment}} was controversial among political and artistic figures and the Brazilian press; a remark Gil made about difficulties with his salary received particular criticism. Gil is not a member of Lula's Workers' Party and did not participate in creating its cultural program. Shortly after becoming Minister, Gil began a partnership between Brazil and Creative Commons. As Minister, he has sponsored a program called Culture Points, which gives grants to provide music technology and education to people living in poor areas of the country's cities. Gil has since asserted that [...] "You've now got young people who are becoming designers, who are making it into media and being used more and more by television and samba schools and revitalizing degraded neighborhoods. It's a different vision of <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> a new role." [...] Gil has also expressed interest in a program that will establish an Internet repository of freely downloadable Brazilian music. Since Gil's appointment, the department's expenditures have increased by over 50percent. In November 2007 Gil announced his intention to resign from his post due to a vocal cord polyp. Lula rejected Gil's first two attempts to resign, but accepted another request in July 2008. Lula said on this occasion that Gil was [...] "going back to being a great artist, going back to giving priority to what is most important" [...] to him.|$|E
500|$|Ron {{particularly}} despises {{talking to}} members of the public, which is why he deliberately designed his office to be uninviting to visitors, in part by mounting a double-barreled, sawed-off shotgun on a swivel atop his desk aimed at the guest chair, so it will be pointed at anyone who wants to speak to him, a claymore mine (front-pointed toward enemy), and a Czech hedgehog. Despite his lack of interest in the job, Ron occasionally demonstrates he is a good manager who recognizes the abilities of his co-workers. He claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him, and that his best friend was a co-worker he knew for three years without ever learning his name. However, Ron cares more about his colleagues than he lets on and often helps them in spite of himself. Despite sharing a nearly opposite view on <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> Ron gets along well with Knope, and the two share a strong mutual respect. Although Leslie had considered a job offer in the neighboring town of Eagleton, she stays based on advice from Ron that, no matter how many job offers she gets, Pawnee will always be her hometown. Ron also developed a grudging, avuncular affection for April's husband, Andy Dwyer, and decided to give him the [...] "Ron Swanson Scholarship" [...] ($940) so Andy can attend one college course: Women's Studies, after Andy and April couldn't afford to pay it. In the voiceover while Ron drops Andy off for his first day of class, he recalls his own first day of college when his father dropped him off at the steel mill. His father thought he shouldn't bother with college, but Ron hitched a ride to the school and went anyway.|$|E
