50|$|There is a Wolseley brand two-stand {{portable}} shearing {{plant in}} the collection of the National Museum of Australia in Canberra. Manufactured in Birmingham, England, around 1930, the shearing plant is powered by a 32-volt, three horse-power single-cylinder petrol engine, mounted on a wooden <b>trolley</b> <b>base</b> with four cast iron wheels. The plant incorporated a revolutionary mechanised shearing handpiece, one of which is also in the museum's collection. The engine is painted green and inscribed with the brand name Wolseley, and has a metal manufacturer's plate which reads: Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company Ltd Birmingham England. The plant, weighing 550 kg, was used on a sheep property named 'Emoh Ruo' in the Rockley-Black Springs area of New South Wales. It was used by Roy and George Keogh between 1948 and 1976.|$|E

40|$|A robotic {{manipulator}} {{has been}} mounted to an electric wheelchair to assist people with disabilities. Particular emphasis {{has been given}} to the constraints and requirements for wheelchair mounting. Background Many different approaches to assistive robotics have been both suggested and implemented. Whilst in some situations (for example a vocational setting) a fixed site workstation is suitable [1], in other cases (for example someone living independently in their own home) a mobile device [2] is more appropriate. An earlier project at our Institute implemented a low cost mobile robot by mounting a manipulator on a simple non-powered <b>trolley</b> <b>base,</b> which could be moved around the home by a carer. In order to extend the flexibility of this system, the same manipulator is now mounted onto an electric wheelchair as described in the current paper. development. In the case of the wheelchair-mounted robot project we have been in contact with about 30 volunteers, covering 5 disability groups. Of these a smaller number of local volunteers have been involved in more detailed discussions. We have also tried to involve disabled volunteer’s carers wherever possible, because they too are users of the device. In order to gauge volunteers ' reactions to a device before investing time and expense in producing a working prototype it is often valuable to build a model or full scale non-working mock up. In the case of this project, this was a valuable way of gaining an insight into how users might react to having a large robotic device mounted to their wheelchair. A fully working prototype is necessary to evaluate the functionality of a device. However, the prototype is not an end in itself but is only the first stage in making finished devices available to those who need them...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{approach}} to design of the equalization procedure of bearing loads on running wheels of a load trolley. Methodological ambiguity in the trolley design issue resulting in complication of the designing process was identified. There was formed and solved the task concerning compensation of variation {{in the position of}} the common resultant of forces acting on the trolley from the point characterizing optimal load distribution between the wheels. This distribution was achieved by introducing a conventional mass and using appropriate dependencies and imposed limitations. Different options for arrangement of actual masses which form the conventional mass under the multi-purpose metal construction scheme were considered. An example on how to address the presented issue for the overhead crane load trolley was considered. The paper presents the findings of usefulness of various schemes of mass arrangement depending on a design situation. The need to apply the hinged frame method for determining bearing loads on the running wheels of the <b>trolley</b> <b>based</b> on the multi-purpose layout drawing was identified. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — RFID (radiofrequency identification) {{technology}} offers {{the ability to}} provide many new services and conveniences in the retail environment. An innovative product with societal acceptance {{is the one that}} aids the comfort, convenience and efficiency in everyday life. Purchasing and shopping at big malls is becoming daily activity in various cities. We can see big rush at these malls on holidays and weekends. People purchase different items and put them in trolley. After completion of purchases, one needs to go to billing counter for payments. At billing counter the cashier prepare the bill using bar code reader which is very time consuming process and results in long queue at billing counter. In this paper, we discuss a product “Developing a Multitasking Shopping <b>Trolley</b> <b>Based</b> On RFID Technology ” being developed to assist a person in everyday shopping in terms of reduced time spent while purchasing. The main objective of proposed system is to provide a technology oriented, low-cost, easily scalable, and rugged system for assisting shopping in person. The developed system consists of 3 key components/modules (a) Server Communication component (SCC) (b) User Interface and display component (UIDC), and (c) Automatic billing component (ABC). SCC establishes and maintains the connection of the shopping cart with the main server. UIDC provides the user interface and ABC handles the billing in association with the SCC. These 3 modules are integrated into an embedded system and are tested to satisfy the functionality. Smart shopping carts with electronic displays, in communication with a computer system, can display an overall description with cost details associated with a Shopping list Databases. Smart cart, also equipped with RFID tags, can also verify the Purchase of the items as they are placed in the cart and, if desired, communicate with a billing system to automatically bill the shopper for the purchases...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 74 - 49). This research aims {{to evaluate}} the relationship between weekday light rail ridership and station access features present within one half-mile of each station. All 53 stations associated with the San Diego Trolley network were examined. Ninety independent variables were collected spanning the following categories: transit level of service, densities and socio-economic status, land use, mobility factors, and personal safety. Station-level ridership data (i. e. boarding and alighting counts) served as the dependent variable. A Pearson's r correlation test was run to determine which independent variables exhibited at least a low to moderate association with <b>trolley</b> ridership. <b>Based</b> on these results two multivariate regression models were created to estimate ridership. Model 1 includes all stations that {{are a part of}} the San Diego Trolley network. Model 2 excludes the San Ysidro Transit Center located adjacent to the United States-Mexico Border as ridership is heavily influenced by patrons originating from Mexico while the station's buffer only accounts for land area on the domestic side. Although not all hypothesized relationships were validated, both models displayed positive relationships between ridership and variables from each category. Recommendations for further study include a more robust collection of transit service level variables and parking data. A supplemental measure of ridership known as stop usage is also introduced. This measure calculates a percentage of use from the total vehicle load to express how each station is being utilized in comparison to others along the same light rail route. The measure is then compared to trends in connecting ridership and select demographic data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: [...] Microcontroller based design, has {{acquired}} {{the status of}} most happening field in electronics. This is highly specialized field that has the power of integrating thousands of transistors on single silicon chip. Nowadays, in mall for purchasing variety of items it requires trolley. Every time customer has to pull the trolley from rack to rack for collecting items {{and at the same}} time customer has to do calculation of those items and need to compare it with his budget in pocket. After this procedure, customer has to wait in queue for billing. So, to avoid headache like pulling trolley, waiting in billing queue, thinking about budget, We are introducing new concept that is “SMART TROLLEY IN MEGA MALL”. In modern era, for automation of mall we are developing a microcontroller <b>based</b> <b>TROLLEY</b> which is totally automatic. It follows the customer while purchasing items and it maintains safe distance between customer and itself. Only customer has to hold the barcode side of the product wrapper in front of barcode scanner. Then corresponding data regarding product will be displayed on display. By using this trolley, customer can buy large number of product in very less time with less effort. At the billing counter, computer can be easily interfaced for verification and bill print out...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- While {{purchasing}} {{in super}} market we can gather items we want, {{put it in}} the container and at the time of billing only we come to know about the total cost. Also we need to stand in a queue for billing those items. To overcome this here we can design a RFID <b>Based</b> <b>Trolley</b> to make the purchase more easily and comfortable. An RFID Reader with electronics hardware system in fitted with the trolley to make the purchase comfortable. All the items are fitted with an RFID card whose price is fixed into the card. When an item is shown in front of the reader (fitted in the trolley) the amount for the item is added to the purchase bill and is shown on the LCD Display. It also has the provision for removing the items from the trolley where the cost is removed from the total cost. We can set a limit value for the purchase amount in the microcontroller, once the items are added the cost is added up and if it crosses certain limit it gives an alarm signal to indicate that. Along with this a search mode is also provided to the customer. By selecting search mode, customer can easily find out a product that the customer wants to search in the super market. MCU send data through RF module to the receiver side in the search mode if the particular product is selected using key pad. Send data is corresponds to product details that the customer wants to search in the super market. On receiver side, LED indication for corresponding data/product received will switch ON. Audio indication is also provided by MCU. 2. 4 GHz open band wireless transceiver modules are used on receiver and transmitter which have range of 30 m...|$|R
