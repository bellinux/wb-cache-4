5|$|Shiva {{decides to}} travel to Panchavati under the {{guidance}} of Kali, who is the Naga queen and knows the path through the Dandak Forest to the Naga capital. While traveling they are attacked from the river side by a cache of ships containing <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction known as Daivi Astra that was once forbidden by Lord Rudra, the legendary supreme ruler of India. After fleeing from the attack and safely reaching Panchavati, Shiva and Sati suspect Daksha to be behind this. Kali takes Shiva to a nearby school in the capital, where she believes that the greatest secret of the Nagas lies. There in a classroom, Shiva finds Brahaspati, perfectly alive and teaching a class.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{original}} Mass Effect, where weapons overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods, <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mass</b> Effect 2 have a finite magazine {{and must be}} reloaded after {{a certain number of}} shots. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a damage-absorbing shield. When the shield is fully depleted, further damage reduces the hit points of a secondary health meter. Both the shield bar and health meter automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. The player can revive fallen squad members {{with the use of the}} Unity power. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.|$|E

25|$|Kelly's career {{specialisation}} led to {{confusion about}} his actual job {{as he was}} frequently seconded to other departments. His job description included liaising with the media, and he regularly acted as a confidential source, although he rarely went on the record or appeared on-camera. In 2002, {{he was working for}} the Defence Intelligence Staff {{at the time of the}} compilation of a dossier by the Joint Intelligence Committee on <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction possessed by Iraq. The government had commissioned the dossier as an element of the preparation for what later became the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of Operation Opera— in which an Israeli Air Force strike took place to destroy the Iraqi nuclear {{programme}} in 1981— suspicion grew in Pakistan that the Indian Air Force had similar plans for Pakistan. In a private meeting with General Anwar Shamim, then-Chief of Air Staff, Zia had notified General Shamim that the Indian Air Force had plans to infiltrate Pakistan's nuclear energy project, citing solid evidence. Shamim felt that the Air Force was unable to divert such attacks, therefore, he advised Zia to use diplomacy through Munir Ahmad Khan to divert the attacks. At Vienna, Munir Ahmad Khan met with Indian physicist Raja Ramanna and notified him that such an attack would provoke a nuclear war between the two countries. In the meantime, Shamim decided to start the programme to acquire the F-16 Falcons and A-5 Fanton jets for the Pakistan Air Force. Shamim launched Operation Sentinel- a counter operation that thwarted the Israeli Air Force attempt to sabotage Pakistan's nuclear energy project— forced Indian Premier Indira Gandhi to held talks with Pakistan on nuclear issues and directed a high delegation to Pakistan where both countries pledged not to assist or attack each other's facilities. In 1985, following the induction of the F-16 Falcons and A-5 Fantons, Shamim commissioned the Air Force Strategic Command to protect and battle <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction.|$|E

2500|$|In San Francisco, California protests {{occurred}} {{throughout the}} day and {{in different parts of}} the city with up to 150 people arrested for misdemeanors such as trespassing, resisting arrest and blocking an intersection. Part of the success of the group coordinating named Direct Action was due to utilizing smart mob technologies including text messaging, Google Maps, live video-feeds and internet radio updates. In contrast to the first-day protests in 2003 when the city was effectively shut down in many ways, the protests were focussed on specific targets and conveying messages – [...] "there's little point in barricading the Bay Bridge in a city where most people are against the war anyway." [...] In the morning, a group of 500 worked their way through the morning commute effectively tying-up traffic for hours as the police had to block, move and re-block streets and busses for the procession. The Federal Reserve Bank and Chevron Corporation were also targeted with actions and saw arrests. Starting around noon and lasting for several hours the most [...] "dramatic" [...] protests were a die-in – again blocking the main traffic artery, Market Street – directly in front of California Senator Dianne Feinstein's office. Feinstein supported the Iraq war resolution and subsequent supplemental appropriations bills although she has stated she was deceived by the Bush administration about <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction. As police arrested dozens of protesters more would take their place. In the evening 7000 marched and rallied in front of San Francisco City Hall hearing speeches including Assemblywoman Carole Migden. Although mostly peaceful some police were pelted with glass Christmas ornaments filled with paint.|$|E

[...] Timberlake released a statement saying [...] "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation.

[...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women.
