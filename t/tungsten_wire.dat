50|$|Several {{different}} emitter configurations {{have been}} used for FD emitters, such as single tips, sharp blades and thin wires. Single metal tips can be made from etching wires either by periodically dipping them into molten salts or by electrolysis in aqueous solutions. Compared to other emitter types, the single tips have the advantage that they can reach the highest field strengths. In addition, well-defined geometric shape of a single tip allows accurate calculation of the potential distribution in the space between the tip and the counter electrode. For blades used as emitters, their ruggedness under the high electric field is one of their advantages. Different thin wires were also used as emitters, such as platinum <b>wires</b> and <b>tungsten</b> <b>wires.</b> Platinum wires are fragile, and <b>tungsten</b> <b>wires</b> are much more stable than platinum wires.

30|$|For the {{fabrication}} {{of a single}} nanoribbon detector, Er-CdS NRs were dispersed into dehydrated ethyl acetate by ultrasonic processes. Subsequently, the suspension solution was dropped on a p-type Si substrate with a SiO 2 (500  nm) layer on top, and then a desired NR density was obtained on this substrate. After drying the wafer and locating the position of Er-CdS NRs, patterned Ti (20  nm) and Au (100  nm) electrodes were successively deposited on the two ends of the nanoribbons in high vacuum by e-beam evaporation {{with the assistance of}} a mesh-grid mask composed of <b>tungsten</b> <b>wires</b> (10  μm in diameter).

40|$|<b>Tungsten</b> <b>wires</b> are {{commonly}} used in the lighting industry as filaments for lamps. During the drawing process, the inhomogeneous deformation imparted by the drawing die causes tensile residual stresses at the wire surface in circumferential direction.

This work proposes two methods for reducing the residual stresses during wire drawing, namely applying an advanced die geometry and performing an inexpensive post-drawing treatment based on targeted bending operations. These two methods are analyzed with finite element simulations using material parameters obtained by mechanical tests on <b>tungsten</b> <b>wires</b> at different temperatures as input data.

50|$|In the HT {{activation}} mode, a 10 µm <b>tungsten</b> <b>wire</b> {{is activated}} outside the mass spectrometer {{in a vacuum}} cell containing benzonitrile at a pressure of about 10−1 Pa. The <b>tungsten</b> <b>wire</b> serving as the field anode is then heated up to about 1500 K with direct current at a potential of about 10 kV {{with respect to a}} cathode. Carbon microneedles can be produced within 8-12 h. HR activation method is to reverse the polarity of the emitter and the counter electrode, which emits a strong electron current. The strong electron current results in the heating of the growing carbon needles and therefore the high rates of the needle growth. In the HR activation mode, needles of other metals (iron, nickel or cobalt) and of alloys can also be generated. Instead of carbon microneedles, metallic dendrites (mainly of nickel or cobalt) can be produced on thin wires through electrochemical desorption process. This method is even faster than HR method.|$|E
