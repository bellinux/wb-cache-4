2500|$|On May 3–4, 2006, {{a series}} of demonstrations protested the forcible removal of {{irregular}} flower vendors from a lot in Texcoco {{for the construction of}} a Walmart branch. The protests turned violent when state police and the Federal Preventive Police bussed in some 5,000 agents to San Salvador Atenco and the surrounding communities. A local organization called the People's Front in Defense of the Land (FPDT), which adheres to the Sixth Declaration, called in support from other regional and national adherent organizations. [...] "Delegate Zero" [...] and his [...] "Other Campaign" [...] were at the time in nearby Mexico City, having just organized May Day events there, and quickly arrived at the scene. The following days were marked by violence, with some 216 arrests, over 30 rape and sexual abuse accusations against the police, five deportations, and one casualty, a 14-year-old boy named Javier Cortes shot by a policeman. A 20-year-old UNAM economics student, Alexis Benhumea, died on the morning of June 7, 2006, after being in a coma caused by a blow to the head from a <b>tear-gas</b> <b>grenade</b> launched by police. Most of the resistance organizing was done by the EZLN and Sixth Declaration adherents, and Delegate Zero stated that the [...] "Other Campaign" [...] tour would be temporarily halted until all prisoners were released.|$|E
50|$|Elena Nikolova Yoncheva (Елена Николова Йончева) (born on 27 May 1964) is a Bulgarian {{freelance}} journalist and former Bulgarian National Television correspondent, who has reported from many conflict areas. Yoncheva has authored more than 25 TV documentaries on these conflicts, and while reporting from Iraq in 2003, {{she had a}} narrow escape from tragedy being rescued from armed civilians by an Iraqi official. In June 2013, she was injured by a <b>tear-gas</b> <b>grenade</b> while reporting from Istanbul, Turkey.|$|E
50|$|On 11 April 1960 {{nearly a}} month after the demonstrations against the rigged {{elections}} on 15 March, the body of a high school boy with a police <b>tear-gas</b> <b>grenade</b> lodged into his skull was pulled out of a river in Masan. Already antagonized by the election and how the government had handled the protests thus far, the people of Masan exploded in fury. On 18 April, several student leaders at the Korea University in Seoul mobilized a demonstration and led 3,000 students in a march to the National Assembly building. The protesters demanded a new, fair election. They didn't get a response however and the next day, 19 April, approximately 50,000 students forced their way past the police and met in front of the principal government buildings in the centre of Seoul. They had come from thirty different colleges and high schools, and represented almost all the major universities in Seoul.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} grenades {{were extremely}} brutal. Even {{the smoke and}} <b>tear-gas</b> <b>grenades</b> had deliberate side-effects that would maim enemy personnel exposed to them. (Listed in alphabetical order).|$|R
5000|$|Soldiers {{sometimes}} used non-lethal smoke and <b>tear-gas</b> <b>grenades</b> to warn superiors {{that they were}} in danger of being fragged if they did not change their behavior. A few instances occurred—and many more were rumored—in which enlisted men collected [...] "bounties" [...] on particular officers or non-commissioned officers to reward soldiers for fragging them.|$|R
2500|$|In May 1986 {{clashes between}} anti-nuclear protesters and West German police became common. More than 400 {{people were injured}} in mid-May {{at the site of}} a nuclear-waste {{reprocessing}} plant being built near Wackersdorf. Police [...] "used water cannons and dropped <b>tear-gas</b> <b>grenades</b> from helicopters to subdue protesters armed with slingshots, crowbars and Molotov cocktails".|$|R
50|$|On April 11, Kim Ju-yul's {{body was}} found in the harbor at Masan by a fisherman. Kim had been a student at Masan Commercial High School who had {{disappeared}} during the Masan rioting of March 15. Authorities announced that an autopsy confirmed that the cause of his death was drowning, but many rejected this explanation. Some protesters forced their way into the hospital. They found that Kim's skull had been split by a 20 centimeter-long <b>tear-gas</b> <b>grenade</b> which had penetrated from Kim's eyes {{to the back of his}} head, which indicated that the police had shot the tear gas to an angle less than 45 degrees, which could be fatal if shot directly at a person's face. Rhee’s regime tried to censor news of this incident, however the story was reported by the Korean press along with a picture of Kim when his body was first found, and delivered to the world through AP. This incident shocked the nation and became the basis of a national movement against electoral corruption on April 19. Masan erupted into three days of spontaneous mass protests which led to further violent clashes.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, {{a colonel}} of the Ivory Coast armed forces, Nguessan Yao, {{was arrested in}} New York in a year-long U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement {{operation}} charged with procuring and illegal export of weapons and munitions: 4,000 9 mm handguns, 200,000 rounds of ammunition, and 50,000 <b>tear-gas</b> <b>grenades,</b> in violation of a UN embargo. Several other Ivory Coast officers were released based on their diplomatic passports. His accomplice, Michael Barry Shor, an international trader, was located in Virginia.|$|R
50|$|On 20 April 2007, Maguire {{participated in}} a protest against the {{construction}} of Israel's separation barrier outside the Palestinian village of Bil'in. The protest was held in a no-access military zone. Israeli forces used <b>tear-gas</b> <b>grenades</b> and rubber-coated bullets {{in an effort to}} disperse the protesters, while the protesters hurled rocks at the Israeli troops, injuring two Border Guard policemen. One rubber bullet hit Maguire in the leg, whereupon she was transferred to an Israeli hospital for treatment. She was also reported to have inhaled large quantities of tear gas.|$|R
5000|$|Afterward, the Lumbee {{celebrated by}} {{holding up the}} {{abandoned}} KKK banner; Charlie Warriax and World War II veteran Simeon Oxendine were shown wrapped in it in Life magazine photos. Oxendine, Neill Lowery and Sanford Locklear were acknowledged by the Lumbee as leaders of the attack, which they called [...] "the Klas." [...] Many local, state and national newspapers covered the event and captured photos of Lumbee burning the regalia and dancing around an open fire. A posse of Robeson County deputies led by the sheriff arrived on the scene, dispersing the Lumbee with <b>tear-gas</b> <b>grenades</b> and terminating the celebration.|$|R
25|$|For {{a moment}} {{it looked as if}} the police would manage to push home their attack, but some of the squatters were armed with <b>tear-gas</b> <b>grenades</b> and threw three of them into the shop. The police were {{carrying}} gas masks but it was impossible to don them without breaking their shield wall and thus exposing themselves to the incoming stones. The police attack broke. Fifteen officers were injured, and another 20-30 had to be taken to hospital to have their eyes flushed because of the tear gas. After this, the police gave up trying to storm the barricades. The order was given that nobody was to try to enter the area. The police now focused on keeping the squatters inside the barricaded area. The police commanders feared that the squatters would try to expand the barricades to cut several main roads around the house.|$|R
25|$|During the shootout, police {{continued}} to fire dozens of <b>tear-gas</b> <b>grenades</b> into the home, trying {{to flush out}} the SLA members. About two hours into the shootout, the house caught fire, probably due to an exploding tear gas canister. As the house began to burn, two women left {{from the rear of}} the house and one came out the front (she had come in drunk the previous night, passed out, and woken up in the middle of the siege); all were taken into custody, but were found not to be SLA members. Automatic weapons fire continued from the house. At this point, Nancy Ling Perry and Camilla Hall came out of the house. Investigators working for their parents would claim that they walked out intending to surrender and that they were unarmed but police later stated that Hall was shot in the head by police as she aimed a weapon towards them while Perry was providing covering fire. After Hall's body fell to the ground, it was pulled back inside the burning house by Angela Atwood. Perry followed Hall out of the house, firing a pistol at officers as she emerged, and was shot twice in the back. Her body remained outside the house.|$|R
50|$|The presidential {{elections}} {{that should have}} been organized in 2005 were postponed until November 2010. The preliminary results announced by the Electoral Commission showed a loss for Gbagbo in favour of his rival, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara. The ruling FPI contested the results before the Constitutional Council, charging massive fraud in the northern departments controlled by the rebels of the Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire (FNCI). These charges were contradicted by international observers. The report of the results led to severe tension and violent incidents. The Constitutional Council, which consists of Gbagbo supporters, declared the results of seven northern departments unlawful and that Gbagbo had won the elections with 51% of the vote (instead of Ouattara winning with 54%, as reported by the Electoral Commission). After the inauguration of Gbagbo, Ouattara, recognized as the winner by most countries and the United Nations, organized an alternative inauguration. These events raised fears of a resurgence of the civil war; thousands of refugees have fled the country.48 The African Union sent Thabo Mbeki, former President of South Africa, to mediate the conflict. The United Nations Security Council adopted a common resolution recognising Alassane Ouattara as winner of the elections, based on the position of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). ECOWAS suspended Ivory Coast from all its decision-making bodies49 while the African Union also suspended the country's membership.50In 2010, a Colonel of the Ivory Coast armed forces, Nguessan Yao was arrested in New York in a year-long U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation charging for procuring and illegal export weapons and munitions of 4,000 9-mm handguns, 200,000 rounds of ammunition and 50,000 <b>tear-gas</b> <b>grenades,</b> in violation of UN embargo.

50|$|Special blank {{cartridges}} {{are also}} used when the explosive power of a cartridge is needed, but a projectile is not. Blank cartridges were commonly used for launching <b>tear-gas</b> or rifle <b>grenades,</b> though some types of grenades are capable of trapping the bullet of a live round. Larger blanks {{are also used}} for line launching guns, such as the line launching kit for the Mossberg 500 shotgun.Blank rimfire cartridges, commonly called power loads, are also used in some nail guns (powder-actuated tools), where the power is tapped to force a heavy piston into the nail, with enough force to bury its full length in steel or concrete.|$|R
2500|$|The AC-556 is a selective-fire {{version of}} the Mini-14 marketed for {{military}} and law enforcement use. The AC-556GF is fully automatic. The design incorporates a selector on the right/rear of the receiver to select either semi-automatic, 3-round burst, or full-automatic fire modes; the manual safety {{at the front of}} the trigger guard operates the same as a standard Mini-14. The front sight is winged and incorporates a bayonet lug. The [...] or [...] barrel incorporates a flash suppressor, which can be used to launch approved <b>tear-gas</b> and smoke <b>grenades.</b> A folding stock was used on the AC-556F and AC-556K. The rifle came equipped with 20-round magazines and a 30-round version was available for a time. The AC-556 was dropped from production in 1999 and Ruger stopped offering service for the rifle in 2009.|$|R
