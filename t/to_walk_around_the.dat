The video begins by showing Wade sitting alone on a bed, with {{pictures}} of him and his girlfriend on the wall. He proceeds <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> house, while various things in the room he's in begin to explode around him, such as the bed and pictures in the bedroom, and various food and drink items in the kitchen. Near the end things begin going in reverse, and everything that had exploded is put back together. The video ends with Wade sitting back on the bed with his girlfriend now lying next to him.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the short}} line to Chesham {{generally}} {{had a good}} safety record, despite its sharp curves and relatively steep gradient, it suffered two significant accidents in this period. On 19August 1909 the Aclass engine hauling the 7.53am train from Chesham broke an axle and derailed outside Chesham. There were no injuries but the track was blocked; a passenger service was maintained by operating shuttle services from {{each end of the}} branch to the crash site, where passengers were obliged <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> derailed engine to change trains. On 6November 1909 a backdraught from a locomotive firebox enveloped Robert Prior, the train's driver, in flames. (The type of locomotive is not recorded, but it is likely to have been a Metropolitan Railway D Class, which are known to have had a problem with backdraughts.) The locomotive's fireman managed to drive the train to Chesham, where Prior died from his injuries two days later. An inquest found that Prior had failed to turn on the blower, and a verdict of accidental death was recorded.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln Castle {{is a major}} castle {{constructed}} in Lincoln, England, during the late 11th century by William the Conqueror {{on the site of}} a pre-existing Roman fortress. The castle is unusual in that it has two mottes. It is only one of two such castles in the country, the other being at Lewes in Sussex. Lincoln Castle remained in use as a prison and law court into modern times, {{and is one of the}} better preserved castles in England; the Crown Courts continue to this day. It is open to the public as a museum. Lincoln Castle remains one of the most impressive Norman castles in the United Kingdom.

5|$|Structurally, the late-18th century Bastille was not greatly {{changed from}} its 14th-century predecessor. The eight stone towers had {{gradually}} acquired individual names: {{running from the}} north-east side of the external gate, these were La Chapelle, Trésor, Comté, Bazinière, Bertaudière, Liberté, Puits and Coin. La Chapelle contained the Bastille's chapel, decorated with a painting of Saint Peter in chains. Trésor took {{its name from the}} reign of Henry IV, when it had contained the royal treasury. The origins of the name of Comté tower are unclear; one theory is that the name refers to the County of Paris. Bazinière was named after Bertrand de La Bazinière, a royal treasurer who was imprisoned there in 1663. Bertaudière was named after a medieval mason who died building the structure in the 14th century. Liberté tower took its name either from a protest in 1380, when Parisians shouted the phrase outside the castle, or because it was used to house prisoners who had more freedom <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> castle than the typical prisoner. Puits tower contained the castle well, while Coin formed the corner of the Rue Saint-Antoine.|$|E

On Day 61, the housemates were given a walking task. Each housemate was given a pedometer and was asked <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> house for two hours.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of this exercise {{because it is}} such a common and necessary command for a dog. Generally the handler will order the dog to sit and stay and then the judge will order the handler {{to walk away from the}} dog. Depending on the level of the competition the judge will order the handler to: walk around the ring, walk to the other side of the ring and wait for an order to return, or walk out of sight of the dog and wait for an order to return. In the later two cases the length of time before the judge orders the handler to return, and the time the dog must remain sitting, increases depending on the class the team is competing in. This exercise can also be performed in a group where as many as 10 dogs may perform the exercise simultaneously. In any case should a dog break the sit by lying down or getting up <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> team will usually fail the exercise and receive a non qualifying score for the class.|$|E

In addition to the completeness and level of the injury, age and concurrent health problems affect the extent to which a person with SCI will be able to live independently and to walk.
