5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ravens</b> {{first met}} the New England Patriots in 1996, but the rivalry truly started in 2007 when <b>the</b> <b>Ravens</b> {{suffered}} a bitter 27–24 {{loss in the}} Patriots' quest for perfection. The rivalry began to escalate in 2009 when <b>the</b> <b>Ravens</b> lost to the Patriots 27–21 {{in a game that}} involved a confrontation between Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs. Both players would go on to take verbal shots at each other through the media after the game. <b>The</b> <b>Ravens</b> defeated the Patriots in the 2009 AFC Wild Card playoff game, 33–14.

50|$|Bill Reid {{created the}} {{sculpture}} of <b>The</b> <b>Raven</b> and <b>The</b> First Men depicting {{a scene from}} a Haida myth that unifies <b>the</b> <b>Raven</b> as both <b>the</b> trickster and the creator. According to this myth, <b>the</b> <b>raven</b> who was both bored and well fed, found and freed some creatures trapped in a clam. These scared and timid beings were the first men of the world, and they were coaxed out of the clam shell by <b>the</b> <b>raven.</b> Soon <b>the</b> <b>raven</b> was bored with these creatures and planned to return them to their shell. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>raven</b> decided {{to search for the}} female counterparts of these male beings. <b>The</b> <b>raven</b> found some female humans trapped in a chiton, freed them, and was entertained as the two sexes met and began to interact. <b>The</b> <b>raven,</b> always known as a trickster, was responsible for the pairing of humans and felt very protective of them. With <b>the</b> <b>Raven</b> perceived as <b>the</b> creator, many Haida myths and legends often suggest <b>the</b> <b>raven</b> as a provider to mankind.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Raven</b> {{came to a}} world {{covered in}} darkness, {{where men and women}} lived in an area of dark and cold. <b>The</b> <b>Raven</b> felt bad for the people living in the dark and {{resolved}} to search for <b>the</b> light. <b>The</b> <b>Raven</b> flew across mountains, rivers, and valleys until finally, he saw light. He had arrived at the house of the Sky Chief, which was shining brilliantly in <b>the</b> horizon. <b>The</b> <b>Raven</b> snuck into <b>the</b> house of the Sky Chief by turning into a pine-needle and fell into the water of the Sky Chief's beautiful daughter. The daughter drank the water and unknowingly swallowed <b>the</b> <b>Raven.</b> Time passed and she soon gave birth to a child, that bore a striking resemblance to <b>the</b> <b>Raven.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Raven</b> used his child disguise to locate and secure the Sun, stealing it from the Sky Chief and returning to the land of darkness. <b>The</b> <b>Raven</b> threw <b>the</b> Sun into the sky, where it stayed filling the area a bright light. People feed <b>the</b> <b>Raven</b> today as a way to say thanks for bringing light to them.|$|R

5|$|Though the Giants {{kept the}} game {{close in the}} first half, and went into halftime down 10–0, <b>the</b> <b>Ravens</b> {{dominated}} the second half. Their defense (led by game MVP Ray Lewis) frustrated Kerry Collins all game long, resulting in Collins turning {{in one of the}} worst playoff performances in Super Bowl history. Collins completed 15 of 39 passes for 112yards and 4 interceptions. <b>The</b> <b>Ravens</b> won the game 34–7 {{in one of the most}} lopsided Super Bowls ever. The lone Giants score came on a Ron Dixon kickoff return for a touchdown. On the very next kickoff, <b>the</b> <b>Ravens</b> countered as Jermaine Lewis also returned a kickoff for a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|Against the Baltimore Ravens in week twelve, the Bears wore their 1940s {{alternate}} uniforms. The Bears last played <b>the</b> <b>Ravens</b> in 2009, {{which ended}} with a Baltimore 31–7 victory. With Jay Cutler still out, Josh McCown continued to play as quarterback for the Bears, who had the eighth-best passing offense in the league with 261.7 yards per game, which competed against the Ravens' 18th-ranked pass defense. On the ground, <b>the</b> <b>Ravens</b> had the tenth-best rushing D with 102.6 rushing yards allowed per game, but offensively, had the 30th-ranked rushing offense, averaging just 73.1 yards per game, going against Chicago's defense which allowed 129.4 rushing yards per game. Against Joe Flacco, the Bears {{had the opportunity to}} force turnovers, as Flacco had thrown eleven interceptions in the previous nine games. For the Bears on offense, a liability was to protect McCown from Terrell Suggs and Elvis Dumervil, who combined for 17 of 32 sacks by <b>the</b> <b>Ravens.</b> Two parties had the majority favoring the Bears for the game: 10 of 13 ESPN analysts predicted a Bears victory, with Ron Jaworski, Seth Wickersham and Cris Carter being the only three to predict a win for Baltimore. CBS Sports analysts predicted <b>the</b> <b>Ravens</b> would win in a 5–4 vote.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams were}} held {{scoreless}} before a record crowd at M Bank Stadium until a Baltimore field goal gave <b>the</b> <b>Ravens</b> a 3–0 lead at 12:34 {{of the second}} quarter. Pittsburgh tied the game on a Jeff Reed field goal; Matt Stover converted a second time to give <b>the</b> <b>Ravens</b> a three-point lead at halftime. Stover kicked his third field goal {{of the game in}} the third quarter, extending their lead to six points. In the final quarter, Reed kicked his second field goal of the game to put the Steelers within three points. On the Steelers final drive of the game, the offense drove 92yards over 2:53, with Ben Roethlisberger completing a touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes with 50seconds remaining. <b>The</b> <b>Ravens</b> embarked on one more drive, but the Steelers second interception of the game prevented them from scoring. With the victory the Steelers won their second consecutive AFC North title and clinched a first round bye and became the first AFC franchise to amass 550wins.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ravens</b> {{opened the}} game with Ray Rice gaining a 47-yard run, his longest of the year {{up to that point}} (his {{previous}} highest in 2013 was 14 yards), which led to Rice's 1-yard run with 9:58 in the first. <b>The</b> <b>Ravens</b> added to the score with Justin Tucker's 52-yarder, bringing the score to 10–0. With 4:51 left in the first quarter, the game was suspended due to inclement weather, which included a tornado watch, which was eventually elevated to a tornado warning. Fans were ordered to evacuate the stands and enter the covered concourses, while the teams returned to the locker rooms. The evacuation marked the first time Soldier Field had an evacuation since the stadium's opening in 1921. The game resumed play at 3:25p.m. ET, after a 1-hour, 53 minute-delay. In the second quarter, Robbie Gould kicked a 20-yard field goal, and eventually, rookie defensive end David Bass escaped a chop block by Rice and intercepted Flacco, scoring on a 24-yard return and tying the game. <b>The</b> <b>Ravens</b> eventually scored on Torrey Smith's five yard touchdown catch, and after Flacco had a pass intercepted by Jon Bostic, Gould ended the half kicking a 46-yarder. After a scoreless third period, Matt Forté caught a 14-yard pass from McCown and scored with 10:33 in the fourth, the Bears finally taking the lead 20–17. Now behind by three, <b>the</b> <b>Ravens</b> engineered an 82-yard drive to Chicago's 2-yard line, but Rice failed to score twice, and a botched snap from Gino Gradkowski slowed down <b>the</b> <b>Ravens,</b> and Flacco's pass towards Smith was overthrown. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Ravens</b> resorted to a 21-yard field goal with three seconds in regulation to force overtime. In overtime, Flacco's pass for Tandon Doss fell incomplete, and <b>the</b> <b>Ravens</b> punted to the Bears. McCown then completed a 43-yard pass to Martellus Bennett, and Gould kicked the game-winning 38-yard field goal with 8:41 remaining to win the game 23–20, which lasted five hours, 16 minutes.|$|E
