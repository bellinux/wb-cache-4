5|$|The South Tower has one freight {{and three}} {{passenger}} elevators. <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> are the second fastest {{in the city}} of San Francisco, second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> of the South Tower can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. The bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.|$|E
5|$|The {{control system}} was revised and trim tabs were fitted to <b>the</b> <b>elevators.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{check-in}} {{a dedicated}} bellhop staff will retrieve a customer's luggage from their prior hotel, airport, etc. {{so that the}} customer is not left waiting for luggage arrival. A complimentary Japanese tea service greets each guest upon check-in, featuring green tea and special rice crackers. As a security feature, <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> must be operated from the outside with a room key. There are no buttons inside <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> themselves. Other services include 24-hour in-room dining {{and access to the}} spa. WiFi access and shoeshine services are available for an additional charge.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} {{an elevator}} evacuation model for ultra-tall building which is implemented by AnyLogic package. Pedestrian movement and <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> running can be well combined into <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> evacuation model. Theoretical analysis is conducted {{to explore the}} influencing factors of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> evacuation and how <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> evacuation time is determined by these influencing factors, including the number of occupants evacuating by one <b>elevator,</b> <b>the</b> height of refuge floor, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> speed and acceleration speed, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> capacity and elevator door width etc. Simulation experiments are conducted to analyze <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> evacuation time of ultra-tall building. By theoretical and simulation analysis and <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> evacuation time 说 can be expressed as functions with several variables...|$|R
50|$|Beavis and Butt-Head {{go inside}} in an {{elevator}} at a hotel. When <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> breaks, they get stuck with a woman inside. After a lady climbs out of <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> they {{must find a way}} how to escape. After they fight in <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> they saved themselves and made <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> work again. When another lady comes in, the boys end up getting stuck in <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> again with her.|$|R
50|$|Suddenly {{and without}} warning, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> finally breaks free of its cables and hurtles {{to the ground}} floor. There is darkness, {{followed}} by the flickering of lights as <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> doors open. Stuart is {{lying on his back}} as Michael and Melanie step over him and exit <b>the</b> <b>elevator.</b> Matthew and Glen leave <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> holding hands.|$|R
5|$|During the {{designated}} moving-in/moving-out periods {{at the beginning}} and end of semesters, <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> in all three Towers can access the basement garage, allowing students and visitors the ability to travel freely between Towers.|$|E
5|$|The A320 {{airframe}} includes {{composite materials}} and aluminium alloys to save weight {{and reduce the}} total number of parts to decrease the maintenance costs. Its tail assembly is made almost entirely of such composites by CASA, who also builds <b>the</b> <b>elevators,</b> main landing gear doors, and rear fuselage parts.|$|E
5|$|Several of the Comet's {{avionics}} {{systems were}} new to civil aviation. One such feature was irreversible powered flight controls, which increased the pilot's ease {{of control and}} the safety of the aircraft by preventing aerodynamic forces from changing the directed positions and placement of the aircraft's control surfaces. Additionally, a large number of the control surfaces, such as <b>the</b> <b>elevators,</b> were equipped with a complex gearing system as a safeguard against accidentally over-stressing the surfaces or airframe at higher speed ranges.|$|E
50|$|Phase one mode is {{activated}} by a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building. Once an alarm has been activated, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> will automatically go into phase one. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> will wait {{an amount of}} time, then proceed to go into nudging mode to tell everyone <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> is leaving <b>the</b> floor. Once <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> has left <b>the</b> floor, depending on where the alarm was set off, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> {{will go to the}} fire-recall floor. However, if the alarm was activated on the fire-recall floor, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> will have an alternate floor to recall to. When <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> is recalled, it proceeds to the recall floor and stops with its doors open. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> will no longer respond to calls or move in any direction. Located on the fire-recall floor is a fire-service key switch. The fire-service key switch has the ability to turn fire service off, turn fire service on or to bypass fire service. The only way to return <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the alarms have reset.|$|R
5000|$|The {{floors are}} tiled with black & white colour and easily washable. These tiles are called {{cemented}} tiles, purposely made of by adding different colours in the cement. The usage of teak wood is found {{everywhere in the}} building, even <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> is also wooden. While using <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> one can see each floor as <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> features an open-cage design. There is only one railing back of <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> which is uncovered and mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> is visible.|$|R
25|$|As {{the ride}} begins, {{the lights of}} <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> turn off as Hightower's voice {{explains}} the significance of <b>the</b> idol. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> is pulled backwards, away from <b>the</b> still-visible service <b>elevator</b> doors as <b>the</b> walls of the basement disappear and turn into a star field. The glowing green eyes of the idol appear in the darkness as <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> enters <b>the</b> drop shaft. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> begins its ascent, stopping at the first scene.|$|R
5|$|Sound Transit {{awarded the}} {{construction}} contract for Mount Baker {{station and the}} Beacon Hill Tunnel to Japanese general contractors Obayashi Corporation in June 2004 for $280 million, the costliest component of the Central Link project. Construction began in September 2005 with the permanent closure of Stevens Street and utility relocation to clear the station site. By the following April, Obayashi completed erection of columns {{that would be used}} to support the elevated guideway and station. Mount Baker station was declared substantially complete in June 2009, excluding work on <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> and escalators.|$|E
5|$|The ellipse {{also served}} as the design basis for the Spitfire's fin and {{tailplane}} assembly, once again exploiting the shape's favourable aerodynamic characteristics. Both <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> and rudder were shaped so that their centre of mass was shifted forward, thus reducing control-surface flutter. The longer noses and greater propeller-wash resulting from larger engines in later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical and, later, horizontal tail surfaces {{to compensate for the}} altered aerodynamics, culminating in those of the Mk 22/24 series which were 25% larger in area than those of the Mk I.|$|E
5|$|They {{were also}} able to {{determine}} all of the flight control surfaces, including <b>the</b> <b>elevators,</b> ailerons and rudder, were functioning properly {{at the point of}} the crash, and there were no faults in the flight control system. The flaps were extended to between 15° and 20°, the standard setting for take-off. The propeller blades of No. 4 engine on the far right side of the aircraftwere reversedminus 8°, while the blades of Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines were at 34° positive pitch (also standard for take-off).|$|E
5000|$|In a {{building}} in Amsterdam, an elevator inexplicably begins to function alone. After a lightning storm causes a power failure and traps four people in <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> will not open after even after a subsequent power restore and the passengers almost suffocate. Soon, subsequent malfunctions prove fatal as an elderly blind man falls to his death when <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> doors open to an empty shaft, the building night watchman is decapitated by <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> doors, and a janitor is snared in the shaft in which his body drops through <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> ceiling hatch.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSpread of fire {{smoke in}} <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft of a {{high-rise}} building {{is influenced by}} many driving facts. We simulate smoke spreading in <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft, stair room, and pre-chamber with and without different supplied pressurized air. The simulation shows that smoke moves very fast in <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft. When a 12 floor high-rise building is in fire, smoke can fill up <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft in less than 1. 5 min after a fire started, temperature in <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft can be higher than 187 °C in 5 min, and the concentration of CO can also reach a high level. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft has a very low visibility in less than about 100 s...|$|R

5|$|Two hotels, The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and the Oberoi Trident, {{were among}} the four {{locations}} targeted. Six explosions were reported at the Taj hotel – one in the lobby, two in <b>the</b> <b>elevators,</b> three in the restaurant – and one at the Oberoi Trident. At the Taj, firefighters rescued 200 hostages from windows using ladders during the first night.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the MTA {{listed the}} 179th Street station among the 69 most {{deteriorated}} {{stations in the}} subway system. Later in the 1980s, the station was renovated and modernized; {{as part of the}} renovation, the IND-style purple tile band was removed from the station walls, and a design with intertwining blue and orange stripes was added. During a further upgrade that occurred by about 2000, elevators were installed in the station to make it ADA-accessible. <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> were opened around 2005. Starting in August 2007, the MTA began installing decorative ventilation grates along Hillside Avenue above the station, and sealing other grates, both in order to combat flooding. At the time, the Hillside Avenue subway was considered the most flood-prone area in the subway system.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the natural light from the atrium and skylights, the building is further illuminated inside by lightboxes and screens {{that are part of}} the artwork. Other interior details include steel mesh, a central courtyard, panels of stainless steel, pillars with burnished steel, and excerpts from the United States Constitution on the wall. Also, the areas leading into <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> have clear panels in the floor, and the main staircase is also constructed partly of transparent materials, with the steps made of gray slate. The exterior ribbons of stainless steel also extend into the lobby of the building.|$|E

50|$|If nothing were done, {{essentially}} all satellites with perigees {{below the}} top of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> would eventually collide with <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> cable. Twice per day, each orbital plane intersects <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> as <b>the</b> rotation of the Earth swings the cable around the equator. Usually the satellite and the cable will not line up. However, except for synchronized orbits, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> and satellite will eventually occupy the same {{place at the same}} time, almost certainly leading to structural failure of <b>the</b> space <b>elevator</b> and destruction of the satellite.|$|R
50|$|Incorrect locknuts {{had been}} {{installed}} in <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> operating system. These spun {{off during the}} flight, leaving <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> uncontrollable.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} {{was owned by}} the PNB and later its parent company CoreStates until it was sold to the JPMorgan Strategic Property Fund in 1996 for almost US$28.5 million. In 1998 the building's second-largest tenant, law firm Drinker Biddle & Reath, left for One Logan Square. The resulting vacancy prompted the owners to renovate the building, renamed One South Broad, {{at a cost of}} US$10 million. Renovations included modernizing <b>the</b> <b>elevators,</b> security and safety systems and converting the lower floors to retail and restaurant space. The renovations took eighteen months and One South Broad was officially rededicated on May 3, 2000.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{inclined}} elevators {{was intended}} to provide wheelchair-bound patrons with a shorter, easier path to the train platform {{as well as to}} reduce tunneling costs. The two elevators were manufactured by Maspero Elevatori, in Appiano Gentile, Italy, using a controller made on Long Island, speed governors made in Ohio, and buttons and other parts in Queens. The software for the elevator was written in the United States. Maspero Elevatori assembled <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> in Italy, and they failed an operational test there, prior to being shipped to the United States. The MTA said the manufacturer chose to use American subcontractors in place of local Italian suppliers after reading the specifications the transit agency submitted. The MTA worked with the manufacturer to try to resolve the problems caused by a very high level of customization.|$|E
5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw {{machines}} for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of these experiments {{was to determine}} how the air forces on the whole empennage are affected by varying the size of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> without changing <b>the</b> size of the whole empennage. The secondary objective was {{to determine how the}} magnitude of the air forces acting on <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> (or <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> moments) are affected by varying the angle of attack of the whole empennage, or of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> alone...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the initial}} investigation, police had noted {{undisturbed}} human excrement in <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft, which Conley {{said he had}} left there before the murder. Use of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> on <b>the</b> Monday after the murder crushed the excrement, which Slaton concluded was an indication that <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> {{could not have been}} used as described by Conley, casting doubt on his testimony. During the commutation hearing, Slaton asked Dorsey to address this issue. Dorsey said that <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> did not always {{go all the way to}} the bottom and could be stopped anywhere. Frank's attorney rebutted this by quoting Conley, who said that <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> stops when it hits the bottom. Slaton interviewed others and conducted his own tests on his visit to the factory, concluding that every time <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> made <b>the</b> trip to the basement it touched the bottom. Slaton said, [...] "If <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> was not used by Conley and Frank in taking the body to the basement, then the explanation of Conley cannot be accepted." ...|$|R
5|$|Major Kean {{returned}} to {{the ground floor of}} the Chancery and ordered his men to withdraw into a large semicircle at the main entrance to the Chancery. Most of the Marines were inside the Chancery when the crowds outside the Embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed and bolted the Chancery door, <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> were locked by Seabees on the sixth floor and the Marines withdrew up the stairwells locking grill gates behind them. On the ground floor a water tanker was driven through the Chancery door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward the rooftop. The Marines on the rooftop had sealed the doors and were using Mace to discourage the crowd from trying to break through. Sporadic gunfire from around the Embassy passed over the rooftop.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the line}} was {{extended}} to 225th Street on January 14, 1907, the 221st Street platforms were dismantled and moved to 230th Street for a new temporary terminus. Service was extended to the temporary terminus at 230th Street on January 27, 1907. An extension of Contract 1 north to 242nd Street at Van Cortlandt Park was approved in 1906 and opened on August 1, 1908. (The original plan had been to turn east on 230th Street to just west of Bailey Avenue, at the New York Central Railroad's Kings Bridge station.) When {{the line was}} extended to 242nd Street, the temporary platforms at 230th Street were dismantled, and were rumored {{to be brought to}} 242 Street to serve as the station's side platforms. The 191st Street did not open until January 14, 1911 because <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> and other work at the station had not yet been completed.|$|E
5|$|Swigmore University, which Moe attends in the episode, is {{a parody}} of Skidmore College. The {{professor}} working at Swigmore University is based on Professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr. from the television series The Paper Chase. Moe's new bar M is a parody on the luxury boutique hotel W in New York City that Gould had visited once. The monitors showing eyeballs are based on similar decorations found in <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> in the St Martin's Lane hotel, where the Simpsons staff hosted a Simpsons festival. The doorman in front of M was modeled after special effects creator and actor Greg Nicotero. The dance that Homer, Carl and Lenny perform in Moe's bar is a takeoff on the dancing in the comedy/drama film Coyote Ugly, in which the dancers performed on the bar counter, much like Homer, Carl and Lenny do in the episode.|$|E
50|$|Commonly {{found in}} hospitals, code-blue service allows an {{elevator}} to be summoned to any floor {{for use in}} an emergency situation. Each floor will have a code-blue recall key switch, and when activated, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> system will immediately select <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> car that can respond the fastest, regardless of direction of travel and passenger load. Passengers inside <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> will be notified with an alarm and indicator light to exit <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> when <b>the</b> doors open.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> in <b>the</b> New City Hall in Hanover, Germany, is a {{technical}} rarity, and unique in Europe, as <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> starts straight up but then changes its angle by 15 degrees {{to follow the}} contour of {{the dome of the}} hall. The cabin therefore tilts 15 degrees during <b>the</b> ride. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> travels a height of 43 meters. The new city hall was built in 1913. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> was destroyed in 1943 and rebuilt in 1954.|$|R
