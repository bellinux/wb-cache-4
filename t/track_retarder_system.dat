40|$|Office {{building}} envelopes {{are generally}} successful in meeting {{a range of}} structural, aesthetic and thermal requirements. However, poor thermal envelope performance does occur due {{to the existence of}} defects in the envelope insulation, air barrier and vapor <b>retarder</b> <b>systems.</b> These defects result from designs that do not adequately account for heat, air and moisture transmission, with many being associated with inappropriate or inadequate detailing of the connections of envelope components. Other defects result from designs that appear adequate but can not be constructed in the field or will not maintain adequate performance over time. Despite the existence of these thermal envelope performance problems, information is available to design and construct envelopes that do perform well. In order {{to bridge the gap between}} available knowledge and current practice, NIST has developed thermal envelope design guidelines for federal office buildings for the General Services Administration. The goal of this project is to transfer the knowledge on thermal envelope design and performance from the building research, design and construction communities into a form that will be used by building design professionals. These guidelines are organized by envelope construction system and contain practical information on the avoidance of thermal performance problems such as thermal bridging, insulation system defects, moisture migration, and envelope air leakage. iii ACKNOWLEDGMENT...|$|R

40|$|Simultaneous {{experiments}} on the moisture behavior of six low-slope roof systems were {{performed in a}} climate simulator. The systems comprised a self-drying design over a conventional metal deck, a self-drying design over a significantly more permeable slotted metal deck and four others over conventional metal decks: a system typical of US construction with a liquid water permeable vapor <b>retarder,</b> a <b>system</b> typical of European construction with a liquid water permeable vapor <b>retarder,</b> a top-ventilated <b>system</b> with a polyethylene vapor retarder, and an impermeable control system with a polyethylene vapor retarder. Total weight of each test panel was measured and recorded continuously, along with temperatures and heat fluxes, to compare {{the behavior of the}} various systems. The authors imposed steady-state temperatures from hot summer to cold winter conditions to obtain the R-values of the construction dry insulations in each panel. Temperature cycles typical of hot summer days and mild winter days were then imposed above the construction dry assemblies to obtain baseline diurnal performance. The authors applied a one-dimensional thermal and hygric model. The solid and slotted deck were assumed to differ only in water vapor permeance. A model was not attempted for the top-ventilated system. The 1 -D model predicted very well the slow rates of wetting in the winter cycles and both the slow then fast rates of drying in the summer cycles before and after water addition, except it overpredicted the drying rate for the US construction with a liquid water permeable vapor retarder...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Stokes {{polarimetry}} for scattering {{light from a}} sample surface. To achieve a high accuracy measurement two approaches of an intensity detector and analysis algorism of a Stokes parameter were proposed. The dynamic range of this detector can achieve up to 1010 by combination of change of neutral-density (ND) filters having different density and photon counting units. Stokes parameters can be measured by dual rotating of a retarder and an analyzer. The algorism of dual rotating polarimeter can be calibrated small linear diattenuation and linear retardance error of the <b>retarder.</b> This <b>system</b> can measured Stokes parameters from − 20 ° to 70 ° of its scattering angle. It is possible to measure Stokes parameters of scattering of dust and scratch of optical device with high precision.

40|$|A three-by-three {{polarization}} {{ray tracing}} matrix method is developed {{to calculate the}} polarization transformations associated with ray paths through optical systems. The relationship between the three-by-three polarization ray tracing matrix P method and the Jones calculus is shown in Chapter 2. The diattenuation, polarization dependent transmittance, is calculated via a singular value decomposition of the P matrix and presented in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4 the concept of retardance is critically analyzed for ray paths through optical systems. Algorithms are presented to separate the effects of retardance from geometric transformations. The parallel transport of vectors is associated with non-polarizing propagation through an optical system. A parallel transport matrix Q establishes a proper relationship between sets of local coordinates along the ray path, a sequence of ray segments. The proper retardance is calculated by removing this geometric transformation from the three-by-three polarization ray trace matrix. Polarization aberration is wavelength and spatial dependent polarization change that occurs as wavefrontspropagate through an optical system. Diattenuation and retardance of interfaces and anisotropic elements are common sources of polarizationaberrations. Two representations of polarization aberrationusing the Jones pupil and a polarization ray tracing matrix pupil, are presentedin Chapter 5. In Chapter 6 {{a new class of}} aberration, skew aberration is defined, as a component of polarization aberration. Skew aberration is an intrinsic rotation of polarization states due to the geometric transformation of local coordinates; skew aberration occurs independent of coatings and interface polarization. Skew aberration in a radially symmetric system primarily has the form of a tilt plus circular retardance coma aberration. Skew aberration causes an undesired polarization distribution in the exit pupil. A principal retardance is often defined within (-π, + π] range. In Chapter 7 an algorithm which calculates the principal retardance, horizontal retardance component, 45 ° retardance component, and circular retardance component for given retarder Jones matrices is presented. A concept of retarder space is introduced to understand apparent discontinuities in phase unwrapped retardance. Dispersion properties of retarders for polychromatic light is used to phase unwrap the principal retardance. Homogeneous and inhomogeneous compound <b>retarder</b> <b>systems</b> are analyzed and examples of multi-order retardance are calculated for thick birefringent plates. Mathematical description of the polarization properties of light and incoherent addition of light is presented in Chapter 8, using a coherence matrix. A three-by-three-by-three-by-three polarization ray tracing tensor method is defined in order to ray trace incoherent light through optical systems with depolarizing surfaces. The polarization ray tracing tensor relates the incident light’s three-by-three coherence matrix to the exiting light’s three-by-three coherence matrix. This tensor method is applicable to illumination systems and polarized stray light calculations where rays at an imaging surface pixel have optical path lengths which vary over many wavelengths. In Chapter 9 3 D Stokes parameters are defined by expanding the coherence matrix with Gell-Mann matrices as a basis. The definition of nine-by-nine 3 D Mueller matrix is presented. The 3 D Mueller matrix relates the incident 3 D Stokes parameters to the exiting 3 D Stokes parameters. Both the polarization ray tracing tensor and 3 D Mueller matrix are defined in global coordinates. In Chapter 10 a summary of my work and future work are presented followed by a conclusion...|$|R
30|$|However, {{in order}} to make a more precise {{spectral}} retardance fit, we combined the LCR with the QWP Fresnel rhomb. The reason for this combination is related to the fact that measurements show the maximum accuracy around quarter-wave retardance values (i.e., where the normalized transmission is 50  %) [10, 12]. The QWP Fresnel rhomb introduces an additional π/ 2 retardance that can be added or substracted to the LCR retardance depending on their relative orientation. In Fig.  4 (a) the LCR and the Fresnel rhomb are oriented such that their retardances add, and therefore the oscillations are shifted to lower wavelengths. In Fig.  4 (b), the LCR is the only <b>retarder</b> in the <b>system.</b> Finally, in Fig.  4 (c) the LCR is rotated by 90 °, and therefore the retardances subtract. In this case the oscillations shift to higher wavelengths. In both cases the shift introduced by the Fresnel rhomb transforms the maxima and minima in Fig.  4 (b) into points at 50  % transmittance, therefore improving the accuracy at these wavelengths. Note that an equivalent technique has been used to measure the retardance of half-wave retarders with monochromatic light [22].|$|R

WUPPE is a O. 5 m Cassegram telescope coupled to a Monk-Gileson spectrometer with a magnesium fluoride polarizing beamsplitter preceded by magnesium fluoride halfwave retarders. Two spectra from 135 to 330 nm with orthogonal polarization are detected simultaneously {{by a pair of}} intensified photodiode arrays; the polarization at each wavelength is derived from {{the difference between the two}} spectra, modulated by changing the angle of the optical axis of the <b>retarder.</b> The total <b>system</b> quantum efficiency is approximately 4 %, polarimetric efficiency 75 %, polarimetric stability and the instrumental polarization (obtained in 4 liglfl from observations of unpolarized stars) was less than 0. 1 %.
