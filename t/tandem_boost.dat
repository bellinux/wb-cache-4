50|$|There {{was also}} a mobile version of the phased array radar {{developed}} in the late 1990s which could provide all-round radar cover with four separate faces but with a much decreased detection range. This version only appeared in public once but was never put into service. The development of Sky Bow 2 started around 1986, this added a <b>tandem</b> <b>boost</b> motor and an active radar homing terminal seeker. Proposals were reported to develop Sky Bow 2 into a surface-to-surface missile; unconfirmed reports suggest that this missile is known as Tien Chi. Modifications {{have been developed for}} Sky Bow 2, changing it into a single-stage rocket and to provide it with a limited capability against shorter-range ballistic missiles; the first test firing against a ballistic missile target was reported in September 2008. Seven batteries of TK-1/2 SAMs are in service and deployed throughout Taiwan, on the Pescadores, and Dong Ying island.|$|E
50|$|The Volkswagen Chico is {{a concept}} car {{produced}} by the German car company Volkswagen in 1992. It is a study for a small two-plus-two hatchback powered by two engines: a 34-hp two-cylinder engine and an 8-hp electric motor, which could work in <b>tandem</b> for a <b>boost</b> in power. The Chico never evolved into a production model.|$|R

Design and fabricating of intermediate layers plays a very impor-tant role to achieve high device performance.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{experimental results}} of applying Subspace Gaussian Mixture Models (SGMMs) in two completely di-verse acoustic scenarios: (a) for Large Vocabulary Continu-ous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) task over (well-resourced) English meeting data and, (b) for acoustic modeling of under-resourced Afrikaans telephone data. In both cases, the per-formance of SGMM models is {{compared with a}} conventional context-dependent HMM/GMM approach exploiting {{the same kind of}} information available during the training. LVCSR systems are evaluated on standard NIST Rich Transcrip-tion dataset. For under-resourced Afrikaans, SGMM and HMM/GMM acoustic systems are additionally compared to KL-HMM and multilingual <b>Tandem</b> techniques <b>boosted</b> using supplemental out-of-domain data. Experimental results clearly show that the SGMM approach (having considerably less model parameters) outperforms conventional HMM/GMM system in both scenarios and for all examined training conditions. In case of under-resourced scenario, the SGMM trained only using in-domain data is superior to other tested approaches boosted by data from other domain.

50|$|After {{four seasons}} with Texas {{and one with}} Boston, Canseco {{returned}} to Oakland in 1997. The A's had been languishing for three seasons with a combined 196-224 record, and were having a nondescript offseason before acquiring him for pitcher John Wasdin. Reuniting him with McGwire, who together were {{once one of the}} most explosive <b>tandems</b> in baseball, <b>boosted</b> the team's ticket sales considerably. McGwire was coming off of a majors-leading 52-homer season, and Canseco remained a threat with his tremendous bat speed. However, McGwire's contract was expiring {{at the end of the}} season, and he was traded mid-season to the St. Louis Cardinals for pitchers T. J. Mathews, Eric Ludwick, and Blake Stein. Canseco's season was just ordinary, and he signed in the offseason with the Toronto Blue Jays, his fourth team in four years. During their careers with Oakland, Canseco and McGwire combined to hit 617 home runs.|$|R
40|$|As {{functional}} recovery following {{peripheral nerve}} injury is dependent upon successful regeneration and target reconnection, combinatorial treatments that enhance different regeneration events may be required for recovery from severe injuries. The neurotherapeutic effects of electrical stimulation (ES) and gonadal steroids have been demonstrated independently and in combination in extratemporal and intratemporal facial nerve injuries. The goals of the first aim were to develop a reliable intracranial facial nerve crush model and to investigate the therapeutic potential of combining ES with testosterone propionate (TP) in this most proximal injury model. Adult male rats were divided into intracranial sham-operated, intracranial crush, and intracranial crush plus ES+TP combination therapy groups. Animals were observed daily for return of facial nerve function and motor nerve conduction studies were done weekly to quantify the return of electrical conduction. Rats treated with the combination therapy recovered partial facial function before untreated rats, suggesting that the combination works in <b>tandem</b> to <b>boost</b> regenerative properties. To begin to determine the generalizability of this treatment strategy, the second aim of this dissertation investigated the effects of ES and TP on recovery from a recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) crush. Following a left RLN crush {{at the level of}} the 7 th tracheal ring, gonadectomized adult male rats were administered only ES, only TP, a combination of both, or left untreated and vocal fold mobility was assessed weekly. Treatments were found to accelerate recovery individually as well as in combination. The purpose of the third aim was to further assess the effects of the combination therapy by comparing functional recovery in two types of injury to the sciatic nerve with or without ES plus TP. The sciatic crush injury was compared to a surgery mimicking an autograft procedure of the sciatic nerve (double transection-repair). Adult male rats were divided into four experimental groups: sciatic crush, sciatic crush with ES+TP treatment, sciatic transection-repair (autograft), and autograft with ES+TP. Animals 2 Ì† 7 gaits were observed with the CatWalk system at 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks post-operative (wpo). Rats treated with the combination therapy recovered partial function earlier than untreated rats in both injury paradigms...|$|R

But the price tag for this "time in a bottle" might be greater than we had imagined. As more of the population enters their "Golden years" they are confronting with serious diseases such as stroke, late onset diabetes, arthritis, and the most sinister of all, Alzheimer&# 039;s disease. Alzheimer&# 039;s disease causes an erosion of cognitive ability, which ultimately results in death. Due {{to the fact that}} there is currently no cure for the disease, treatment focuses on symptoms and maintaining the general health of the sufferer. As the mind looses footing in its battle with the disease, it becomes increasingly important that other outside sources pick up the lost slack. The struggle of those stricken with Alzheimer&# 039;s disease warrants an exploration in to how space and spatial qualities can be manipulated to create an environment that will, in <b>tandem</b> with treatment, <b>boost</b> the well being of the resident. The seriousness of Alzheimer&# 039;s disease places a great demand and responsibility on the shoulders of architects and designers to become more enlightened and informed. By understanding the nature of Alzheimer&# 039;s disease and its symptoms, a design response can be developed that will greatly benefit those living with dementia. The aim of this Masters candidature is to explore and create design projects, in the context of the interior environment, which will provide the Alzheimer&# 039;s sufferer with the support and stimulation needed to live a dignified life in the face of their ever-changing, ever- unfolding disease...|$|R
40|$|The Weyl and Ricci tensors can be algebraically {{classified}} in a Lorentzian spacetime of arbitrary dimensions using alignment theory.

We shall present an analysis of the discriminants of the associated characteristic equation for the eigenvalues of an operator to determine the conditions on (the associated) curvature tensor for a given algebraic type. We will describe an algorithm which enables us to completely determine the eigenvalue structure of the curvature operator, up to degeneracies, in terms of a set of discriminants. We then express these conditions (discriminants) in terms of these polynomial curvature invariants. In particular, we can use the techniques described to study the necessary conditions in arbitrary dimensions for the Weyl and Ricci curvature operators (and hence the higher dimensional Weyl and Ricci tensors) to be of algebraic type II or D, and create syzygies which are necessary for the special algebraic type to be fulfilled. We are consequently able to determine the necessary conditions in terms of simple scalar polynomial curvature invariants in order for the higher dimensional Weyl and Ricci tensors to be of type II or D. We explicitly determine the scalar polynomial curvature invariants for a Weyl or Ricci tensor to be of type II or D in 5 D. A number of simple examples are presented and, in particular, we present a detailed analysis of the important example of a 5 D rotating black ring. Comment: 31 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

40|$|Standard {{radiation}} therapy for patients undergoing primary chemosensitized radiation for carcinomas of the cervix usually consists of external beam radiation {{followed by an}} intracavitary brachytherapy boost. On occasion, the brachytherapy boost cannot be performed due to unfavorable anatomy or because of coexisting medical conditions. We examined the safety and efficacy of using CyberKnife stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as a boost to the cervix after external beam radiation in those patients unable to have brachytherapy to give a more effective dose to the cervix than with conventional external beam radiation alone. Six consecutive patients with anatomic or medical conditions precluding a <b>tandem</b> and ovoid <b>boost</b> were treated with combined external beam radiation and CyberKnife boost to the cervix. Five patients received 45 [*]Gy to the pelvis with serial intensity-modulated {{radiation therapy}} boost to the uterus and cervix to a dose of 61. 2 [*]Gy. These five patients received an SBRT boost to the cervix to a dose of 20 [*]Gy in five fractions of 4 [*]Gy each. One patient was treated to the pelvis to a dose of 45 [*]Gy with an external beam boost to the uterus and cervix to a dose of 50. 4 [*]Gy. This patient received an SBRT boost to the cervix to a dose of 19. 5 [*]Gy in three fractions of 6. 5 [*]Gy. Five percent volumes of the bladder and rectum were kept to â‰¤ 75 [*]Gy in all patients (i. e., V 75 [*]Gy[*]â‰¤[*] 5 %). All of the patients remain locally controlled with no evidence of disease following treatment. Grade 1 diarrhea occurred in 4 / 6 patients during the conventional external beam radiation. There has been no grade 3 or 4 rectal or bladder toxicity. There were no toxicities observed following SBRT boost. At a median follow-up of 14 [*]months, CyberKnife radiosurgical boost is well tolerated and efficacious in providing a boost to patients with cervix cancer {{who are unable to}} undergo brachytherapy boost.
