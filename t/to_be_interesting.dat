5|$|Some reviewers {{enjoyed the}} game's story, but many {{pointed out that}} the campaign's {{conclusion}} was anticlimatic due to its abrupt and unresolved ending. Plagge found the plot <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> because it explored different parts of the Halo universe. She also felt the integration of the narrative with the campaign missions was effectively implemented through the cutscenes and pre-fight dialogue. However, she remarked that characters were underdeveloped and the story did not contribute much to the main Halo arc. Stapleton thought that Isabel was an endearing and emotive character that bolstered the fear induced by the game's antagonist, Atriox. He enjoyed Atriox's strong introduction but felt that the character became less prominent as the story progressed. Eurogamer writer Chris Bratt believed there was potential for an interesting backstory with Atriox and the Banished, but he viewed their motives in the campaign as being too similar to the Covenant, which consequently made the story feel like it was retreading familiar territory. Reactions towards the campaign cutscenes were overwhelmingly positive, with plenty of praise directed towards the high quality production and exceptional animation. While the character dialogue was noted as being cheesy at times, the expressive facial animations kept the cinematics captivating.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka, and produced by Tetsuhisa Tsuruzono. Artwork was produced by manga and anime artist Nobuteru Yūki, while the music was composed by Secret of Mana composer Hiroki Kikuta. Although the game was only published in Japan, English-speaking players {{have been able to}} play Seiken Densetsu 3 due to an unofficial English fan translation, first released in 2000. Seiken Densetsu 3 received considerable acclaim from reviewers, who praised the graphics as among the best ever made for the Super Famicom and the gameplay as an improved version of its predecessor's. The plot received mixed reviews by critics, who found the overlapping stories <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> and to enhance replayability, but the characters and plotlines themselves to be flat and clichéd. Overall, the game is considered by some critics to be a Super Famicom classic {{and one of the best}} role-playing games of the 16-bit era.|$|E

25|$|From Foundation's Edge {{it can be}} {{surmised that}} Galaxia culminates in about FE 800-900 (or more {{precisely}} - R.

However, it is noted by R. Daneel Olivaw in Foundation and Earth {{that it would take}} several more centuries to bring Galaxia about.|$|E

500|$|Reviews for {{the film}} were {{generally}} positive. The Moving Picture World found the story <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> and well acted, giving no criticism of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror's review criticized the weak plot and the satisfactory acting which was diminished by camera consciousness. The review also found that, [...] "n the scene where the child is taken from her mother's death bed too little {{attention is paid to}} the corpse." [...] The Leavenworth Times included a review that was favorable and praised the film's photography.

If one is looking for gags, Aagadu offers them in plenty. But try an overdose of this formula {{and it could be}} tiring." [...] Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "Though this film has many similarities of Srinu Vaitla’s earlier films, but it’s Mahesh Babu who has the audience’s attention throughout. Watch it for him and more rely on him".|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Shawn Sackenheim of Allgame {{also found the}} main downfall of the game to be {{that it is too}} short and too easy. However, he found the new Time Attack mode and the expanded storyline <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> new features that extend playability. Sackenheim stated that despite the minor add-ons and overhauled textures, Jumping Flash! 2 was essentially a technical update of the 1995 original. Other criticisms include that the game is too short despite Game Revolution citing that the game offered a total of 32 levels if including the [...] "repetitive" [...] epilogue. Game Revolution also said that Jumping Flash! 2 was a [...] "very worthy sequel with better graphics, higher jumps, and lots more levels", and that upon release the game [...] "really [...] beyond the competition".|$|E

500|$|Speaking of the gameplay, Fitch {{called it}} a {{combination}} of [...] "classically engrossing MegaTen and Etrian Odyssey", noting that the [...] "same sense of exploration's still there, but there's also a meatier plot pulling you along". Kemps called the dungeon exploration [...] "exciting", but found the lack of help with demon fusion detracted from the experience. Edwards was generally positive about the battle system, which he called [...] "an easy-to-understand, turn-based set-up". Anderson found the gameplay dated, particularly citing the dungeon design and negotiation system, citing the former as being too repetitive <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting.</b> Onyett called the combat [...] "standard", but praised the demon fusion and negotiation mechanics. Kollar said that the Demon Co-op attack system made the game more approachable than previous Shin Megami Tensei series, but found that exploration could become tedious.|$|E

Crane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series Dream On. The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed they were looking {{at a time when the}} future was [...] "more of a question mark." [...] They found the concept <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting,</b> as they believed [...] "everybody knows that feeling", and because it was also how they felt about their own lives at the time. The team titled the series Insomnia Cafe, and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to NBC in December 1993.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} met with {{negative}} reviews by critics and mixed enthusiasm by theater proprietors. The Morning Telegraph found it unbelievable and only {{for the sake of}} the plot that family would be reunited by happenstance. The Moving Picture World was negative finding that it was not a strong offering because of the plot and the camerawork having resulted in a cloudy image quality in parts of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror found the concept of the plot <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting,</b> but the execution to have been poorly executed. [...] The review found that the production was crude, cheap and unconvincing because the set was bare and lacked the presence of onlookers on the city scenes. Advertisers like the Majestic theater of Wellington, Kansas, would prompt it as a [...] "well told story". The Empire in Frederick, Maryland, would be equally promotional and appeal to the audience as having pretty girls in the cast. The Edisonia in Durham, North Carolina, advertised the film as a strong Thanhouser drama that was [...] "thrilling, pathetic, interesting". The film is presumed lost.|$|E

The film had a wide national release, theaters which showed the film are noted in Indiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. Reviews of the film were mixed, with the The Moving Picture World describing the film as a [...] "heart story which will interest because it presents more or less unpleasant possibilities of this character. The acting is well done, and the film will prove popular with most audiences." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer found the film <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting,</b> but stated that it [...] "would have seemed more natural had [...] not recognized [...] as her son until the appearance of , into whose care she had given her child. If two of the scenes had been broken {{it might have been}} more consistent. The men came up to plot their robbery too soon after Jack's hiding. They also appeared in the house immediately after the plan laid to capture them. They surely would have seen the light and would not have ventured so soon." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively in The Moving Picture World which stated, [...] "Apparently someone {{connected with the}} Thanhouser Company has learned something of ward politics, and the methods of controlling a convention are very clearly and bluntly stated. It isn't always possible to expose plots {{such as this one}} was exposed, {{but it would have been}} a good thing if it could be done.... The situations are dramatically worked out and the interest never flags from the beginning to the end. A love story adds a certain degree of interest to the picture, and the development of the plot is strengthened by the young people's lovemaking." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror disagreed with the plausibility of the depicted political manipulation, but found the picture <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> and the acting to be adequate. Later publications would also reference the film for its content, like The Columbia Companion to American History on Film which cites it as an example of a political machine based on graft and deceit. Neither graft nor deceit is actually in play with the production, for pure bribery is the method upon which the politician uses to gain political power. Kay Sloan, author of The Loud Silents: Origins of the Social Problem Film, states that the film explored the problem of political corruption and critics approved because they saw was a realistic portrayal. Another release dealing with political corruption was The Girl Reporter, released by Thanhouser on August 16, 1910.|$|E

500|$|Safran {{called the}} second season more cohesive, {{mirroring}} the first season and [...] "... keep the two-storyline structure". In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority will be what I like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by the FBI and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of the FBI and the CIA. Safran elaborated {{about the differences between}} the FBI and CIA, saying: [...] "We're very interested {{in the fact that the}} FBI's so much about being honest, truthful and living up to your badge. And the CIA is the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> to see. It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When we broke Season 2, we knew we were going to go to one timeline, because it’s about the [...] event, and then it’s about what happens after the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|E
