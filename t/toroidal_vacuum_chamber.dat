50|$|In the {{traditional}} tokamak design, the confinement magnets are normally arranged outside a <b>toroidal</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> holding the plasma. This chamber {{is known as}} the first wall, and defines the minimum distance between the magnets and plasma. In a production design, another layer, the blanket, sits between the first wall and magnets. The blanket serves two purposes, one is to protect the magnets from the high energy neutrons, which will damage them, and the other is to use those neutrons to breed tritium from lithium, producing more fuel for the reactor. However, this arrangement means there is considerable distance between the magnets and plasma, in most designs {{something on the order of}} a meter or more. This places significant limits on the achievable aspect ratio.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the cost}} {{concerns}} for MCF designs like ITER is that the reactor materials {{are subject to the}} intense neutron flux created by the fusion reactions. When high-energy neutrons impact materials they displace the atoms in the structure leading to a problem known as neutron embrittlement that degrades the structural integrity of the material. This is a problem for fission reactors as well, but the neutron flux and energy in a tokamak is greater than most fission designs. In most MFE designs, the reactor is constructed in layers, with a <b>toroidal</b> inner <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber,</b> or [...] "first wall", then the lithium blanket, and finally the superconducting magnets that produce the field that confines the plasma. Neutrons stopping in the blanket are desirable, but those that stop in the first wall or magnets degrade them. Disassembling a toroidal stack of elements would be a time-consuming process that would lead to poor capacity factor, and reducing this requires the use of exotic materials which have not yet been developed.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{possibility}} to produce energy by fusion reactions is being studied in experimental devices called tokamaks where charged particles are confined in a <b>toroidal</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> {{thanks to a}} very large magnetic field. The ITER device currently build in Cadarache (France) {{will be the largest}} tokamak ever realized for these experiments. The large scale dynamics of charged particles in a tokamak as ITER can be described by the Magneto-HydroDynamics equations (MHD). This system of equations contains as an involution the divergence-free constraint of the magnetic field, div B = 0 that has to be maintained by the numerical approximation. The respect of the divergence-free constraint can be achieved in two different ways. The first class consists in adding to the MHD system penalization terms ensuring that the magnetic field will be solenoidal. The second class consists in formulating the MHD system in term of the vectorial potentiel A that satisfies curl A = B, fulfilling thus automatically the divergence-free constraint. The proposed method is a formulation of the MHD system in term of the mixture of the two former classes. The resulting system is divergence-free constraint preserving and can be approximated by standard Finite Volume methods. Various numerical tests on well-known standard problems in MHD show that this approach is an interesting alternative and opens {{possibility to}} use a conservative formulation based on B of the MHD system...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} high {{resolution}} measurements of resonances in {{the spectrum of}} coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) at the Canadian Light Source (CLS). The resonances permeate the spectrum at wavenumber intervals of 0. 074 cm^- 1, and are highly stable under changes in the machine setup (energy, bucket filling pattern, CSR in bursting or continuous mode). Analogous resonances were predicted long ago in an idealized theory as eigenmodes of a smooth <b>toroidal</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> driven by a bunched beam moving on a circular orbit. A corollary of peaks in the spectrum {{is the presence of}} pulses in the wakefield of the bunch at well defined spatial intervals. Through experiments and further calculations we elucidate the resonance and wakefield mechanisms in the CLS vacuum chamber, which has a fluted form much different from a smooth torus. The wakefield is observed directly in the 30 - 110 GHz range by RF diodes, and indirectly by an interferometer in the THz range. The wake pulse sequence found by diodes is less regular than in the toroidal model, and depends on the point of observation, but is accounted for in a simulation of fields in the fluted chamber. Attention is paid to polarization of the observed fields, and possible coherence of fields produced in adjacent bending magnets. Low frequency wakefield production appears to be mainly local in a single bend, but multi-bend effects cannot be excluded entirely, and could play a role in high frequency resonances.

40|$|An {{emerging}} {{method of}} propellant-less formation flight propulsion {{is the use}} of electromagnets coupled with reaction wheels. This technique is called Electromagnetic Formation Flight (EMFF). In order to create a large magnetic field necessary for actuating formation flying spacecraft, EMFF uses high temperature superconducting (HTS) wire since it is able to carry a large current at low power. To achieve superconductivity, the HTS wire needs a cryogenic thermal control system to maintain the wire temperature below the critical temperature and this temperature must be maintained over the entire EMFF coil, which could be as large as two meters in diameter. For commercially available HTS wire, this critical temperature is 110 K. Since EMFF obviates the need for consumables for formation flying maneuvers, the thermal system must also be consumable-free. The research in this thesis investigates a consumable-free method of maintaining isothermalization for a large scale HTS coil. The HTS coil resides inside a thermally conductive jacket which is used for isothermalization. A cryocooler is attached to the thermally conductive jacket and is used for heat extraction. Wrapped around the thermally conductive jacket is multilayer insulation which is used to reduce the heat load into the HTS coil. This thermal system has the ability to maintain constant temperature {{in the presence of a}} rapidly changing thermal environment, such as low Earth orbit. Both a solid conductor and a heat pipe were investigated for use as the thermally conductive jacket. Finite difference models were developed to model a single coil in space and a coil inside a vacuum chamber. In addition, the research in this thesis investigates the design, operation, and testing of a cryogenic heat pipe. The heat pipe uses nitrogen as a working fluid and a stainless steel mesh as the wicking structure. As a proof of concept, an 86 cm long heat pipe was constructed as the thermally conductive jacket enclosing the HTS wire. The working fluid, at saturation condition, maintains a constant temperature below the HTS wire critical temperature. Testing of the heat pipe in a vacuum chamber was conducted to verify the power capacity of the heat pipe. Verifying the proof of concept cryogenic heat pipe led to construction of a full scale circular heat pipe for testing in a two meter diameter <b>toroidal</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber.</b> This system also achieved saturation condition and showed the potential for HTS cooling. The experiments in this thesis demonstrate the feasibility of operating large HTS coils for future formation flying missions. by Daniel W. Kwon. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|ITER is {{the first}} reactor-scale {{scientific}} experiment that aims to demonstrate the scientific and the technological feasibility of fusion energy. It {{is based on the}} tokamak concept of magnetic confinement, in which the fuel, a mixture of deuterium and tritium heated to temperatures in excess of 150 million degrees Celsius, is contained in a <b>toroidal</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>chamber.</b> Among the systems used to reach such high temperature range, a fundamental role is played by the injection of intense beams of neutral particles into the plasma, which is consequently heated by collisions. This process is realized by means of two Neutral Beam Injectors (NBIs), capable of delivering to the plasma a power of 16. 7 MW each. These devices are mainly composed of a negative deuterium ion source, an electrostatic accelerator where a 40 A beam of negative deuterons will be accelerated to 1 MV and a neutralizer which converts part of the beam into high energy neutrals able to penetrate the high magnetic field confining the ITER plasma. The ITER requirements for these devices have never been simultaneously achieved so far in a full scale, full performance device and therefore a neutral beam test facility is being constructed at Consorzio RFX in Padova. The research activity presented in this thesis work is in the framework of the development of the negative ion source (SPIDER) and full injector (MITICA) prototypes for the ITER neutral beam. In particular, it is focused on two main topics: particle transport studies inside the MITICA accelerator {{and the development of a}} tomographic beam diagnostic. A proper modeling of the particle transport inside the MITICA accelerator, considering the main processes that generate secondary particles relevant for the evaluation of the heat loads on the accelerator grids is essential for the thermo-mechanical analysis and the mechanical design of the accelerator. For this reason an upgrade of the relativistic particle tracking code called EAMCC has been undertaken and the simulations performed for evaluating the thermal power deposited on the MITICA accelerator grids are presented in the first part of the present thesis work. For the first time, an entire source called NIO 1 installed at RFX and made of nine beamlets has been simulated in EAMCC considering multi-beamlet effects which were neglected earlier and discarding the axis-symmetry hypothesis of the electric fields imposed by the original version of the code. Results obtained, also presented in the first part, will be used for benchmarking the modifications introduced in the code. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to beam tomography, an important diagnostic for the assessment of the density profile of the beam. A tomography code based on algebraic reconstruction techniques has been developed and numerically tested. Beam emissivity profiles considered for testing the code are calculated by the upgraded version of EAMCC. The tomography code has been developed with the aim of realizing a versatile instrument, applicable to linear accelerators as well as to a tokamak and without adding any hypotheses about the beam characteristics or the emissivity in a particular region of the tomography plane, not to limit the capability of the code of detecting irregularities in the beam profiles. The effects of the instrumental noise on tomography reconstructions have also been studied and, in order to reduce its impact, different filtering techniques have been considered both in the frequency and in the spatial domain, demonstrating the feasibility to filter out the effect of the noise by post-processing the reconstructed image of the bea...|$|E
