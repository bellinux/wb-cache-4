5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that <b>the</b> <b>entity</b> travels from victim to victim like a contagion. At his request, Scully performs an autopsy on Chantara's {{body at the}} morgue. During the procedure, a conversation between Scully and the coroner's assistant (Tara Karsian) causes the latter to panic about a Hantavirus outbreak. <b>The</b> <b>entity</b> suddenly kills her with the disease. When Mulder discusses the death with Scully, he realizes that Wetzel {{is in danger of}} being revisited by <b>the</b> <b>entity.</b> The agents and police return to the crack house, where <b>the</b> <b>entity</b> has trapped an injured Wetzel in an upstairs room. The agents are unable to enter the room until dawn comes, when <b>the</b> <b>entity</b> disappears and spares Wetzel's life. After the incident is over, Scully expresses her sympathies to Mulder that being filmed by a national television crew did not provide the public exposure to paranormal phenomena that he had hoped. However, Mulder remains hopeful, noting that {{it all comes down to}} how the production crew edits the footage together.|$|E
5|$|Several {{more people}} are {{attacked}} and reduced to ash. A search of Eastern European employees leads them to Russian night nurse Tomas (Ravil Isyanov), but he is gone when they search his apartment. Despite being ordered to end the investigation and that the suspect is wanted by the Russian government and the CIA, Broyles tells Olivia (Anna Torv) to continue the case. Walter posits <b>the</b> <b>entity</b> needs radiation, and chooses its victims based on their exposure levels. They learn that Tomas stole his comatose brother, a former cosmonaut, and has been moving him around to both protect him and contain <b>the</b> <b>entity.</b> Fearing capture, Tomas removes his brother from the hospital; Walter speculates that the cosmonaut brought <b>the</b> <b>entity</b> back with him upon returning from space. Walter is finally able to solve the formula, and Broyles sadly tells Tomas over the phone that his brother and <b>the</b> <b>entity</b> cannot be separated. However, during their conversation, <b>the</b> <b>entity</b> escapes his brother's body and kills Tomas. The Fringe team is able to trace the call, and Broyles shoots the host (Tomas' brother) in the head to stop <b>the</b> <b>entity</b> from attacking another victim.|$|E

5|$|Phil {{explains}} to Mulder {{that he wanted}} a divorce from Ellen two years ago, but she got pregnant and would not allow it. He also believes {{that he is the}} reason for this happening and that he somehow summoned <b>the</b> <b>entity.</b> It turns out that Ellen is <b>the</b> <b>entity,</b> which is given away by a cut in her back given by Jenny during the attack. Ellen transforms into the creature, attacks Mulder, and attempts to drown him in a bath tub, but stops when she sees her monstrous reflection in the water. She is placed in a psychiatric hospital, where the doctors diagnose her with multiple personality disorder. Meanwhile, Scully reveals to Mulder that the mysterious prostitute killer was not an X-File at all, but rather a man disguised as a woman who talked to the prostitutes about religion and attempted to help them get out of the prostitution ring.|$|E

40|$|The {{conversion}} of geographical <b>entities</b> between <b>the</b> raster and vector data structures introduces errors in <b>the</b> <b>entities</b> position. <b>The</b> {{vector to raster}} conversion results {{in a loss of}} information, since, when a Boolean classification of each pixel is used, <b>the</b> <b>entities</b> shape must follow the shape of the pixels. Thus, the information about the position of <b>the</b> <b>entities</b> in <b>the</b> vector data structure is lost with the conversion. This loss can be minimized if, instead of making a Boolean classification of the pixels, a fuzzy classification is performed, building Fuzzy Geographical Entities. These entities keep, for each pixel, the information about the pixel area that was inside <b>the</b> vector <b>entities</b> and therefore only the information about the position of <b>the</b> <b>entities</b> boundaries inside <b>the</b> pixels is lost. <b>The</b> Fuzzy Geographical <b>Entities</b> obtained through <b>the</b> previous conversion may be converted back to the vector data structure. An algorithm was developed to reconstruct the boundaries of <b>the</b> vector geographical <b>entities</b> using <b>the</b> information stored in the raster Fuzzy Geographical <b>Entities.</b> Since <b>the</b> grades of membership represent partial membership of the pixels to <b>the</b> <b>entities,</b> this information is valuable to reconstruct <b>the</b> <b>entities</b> boundaries in <b>the</b> vector data structure, generatin...|$|R

50|$|Entity-relationship {{modeling}} (ERM) is {{a conceptual}} modeling technique used primarily for software system representation. Entity-relationship diagrams, {{which are a}} product of executing the ERM technique, are normally used to represent database models and information systems. The main components of the diagram are <b>the</b> <b>entities</b> and relationships. <b>The</b> <b>entities</b> can represent independent functions, objects, or events. The relationships are responsible for relating <b>the</b> <b>entities</b> to one another. To form a system process, the relationships are combined with <b>the</b> <b>entities</b> and any attributes needed to further describe the process. Multiple diagramming conventions exist for this technique; IDEF1X, Bachman, and EXPRESS, to name a few. These conventions are just different ways of viewing and organizing the data to represent different system aspects.|$|R

Later, she hears strange voices and goes outside to investigate. Meanwhile, Ash gives Linda a silver necklace, which she absolutely loves. Cheryl is then attacked and raped by demonically possessed trees, but manages to escape. Unable to convince the others of what happened, she asks Ash to take her into town for the night.

5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges {{from the special}} purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where the value of <b>the</b> <b>entity</b> {{was removed from the}} balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E

The Temenggong intended to create a new administration centre for the Johor Sultanate to create a dynasty under <b>the</b> <b>entity</b> of Temenggong. As the Temenggong already had a close relationship with the British and the British intended to have control over trade activities in Singapore, a treaty was signed between Sultan Ali and Temenggong Ibrahim in Singapore on 10 March 1855. According to the treaty, Ali would be crowned as the Sultan of Johor and receive $5,000 (in Spanish dollars) with an allowance of $500 per month. In return, Ali was required to cede the sovereignty of the territory of Johor (except Kesang of Muar which would be the only territory under his control) to Temenggong Ibrahim.
