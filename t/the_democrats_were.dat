5|$|On October 4, 2013, Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler {{approved}} a second petition to recall Colorado State Senator Evie Hudak, also {{an advocate of}} gun control; the signature gatherers had 60 days to collect 18,300 or more signatures to force a recall election in Colorado Senate District 19 which encompasses Arvada, Colorado and Westminster, Colorado. Hudak later resigned rather than face recall. Because she resigned, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> able to appoint a replacement; {{if she had been}} recalled, the Republicans could have gained a majority in the state senate.|$|E
5|$|For {{the open}} office of {{district}} attorney, vacated by Dilworth {{when he ran}} for mayor, the Democrats nominated city councilman Victor H. Blanc against the Republicans' Wilhelm F. Knauer. Blanc, a veteran of both World Wars and former assistant district attorney, had been elected to city council in an at-large seat in 1951. During his time on the council, {{he was in charge of}} an investigation into corruption in construction at Philadelphia International Airport. Knauer, a state deputy attorney general, was a long-time Republican party leader. His wife, Virginia Knauer, would later be elected to city council. As in the mayor's race, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> victorious, and Blanc was elected. His vote totals led the Democratic ticket, exceeding even Dilworth's numbers.|$|E
5|$|Morehead {{was elected}} the Thirtieth and Thirty-first Congresses, serving from March 4, 1847 until March 3, 1851. During the Thirty-first Congress, the Whig caucus {{considered}} {{him as a}} candidate for Speaker of the House. The voting for speaker began December 3, 1849. The caucus first chose Robert C. Winthrop as their candidate, but after several ballots, Winthrop was still unable to obtain a majority because of sectional rivalries within the caucus. Some Whigs from northern states voted for David Wilmot, a Free Soiler, while five southern Whigs steadfastly voted for Meredith Gentry. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> similarly unable to muster a majority for their candidate, Howell Cobb.|$|E

5|$|Philadelphia's {{municipal}} election of November 5, 1957, involved {{the election of}} the district attorney, city controller, and the remainder of a term for one city council seat, as well as several row offices and judgeships. Democrats were successful citywide, continuing a run of victories racked up after the passage of a new city charter in 1951 despite growing divisions between factions of the party. Victor H. Blanc, the incumbent district attorney, led the Democratic ticket to victory. They held the city council seat and took two citywide offices that Republicans had won in 1953. In the judges' elections, most were endorsed by both parties but in the one race that pitted a Democratic candidate against a Republican, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> successful in seating their candidate, former Congressman Earl Chudoff.|$|E
5|$|Republican Foster A. Dunlap had won {{the office}} in 1953, {{making it one of}} the few his party {{controlled}} in the city. The party renominated him without opposition. Democrat Alexander Hemphill was the organization-backed candidate, and he defeated political outsider George Glick without difficulty. Hemphill, who had worked with reformers in the campaigns that ultimately defeated the Republican organization in 1951, was a lawyer with a long history of involvement in Democratic politics. Unlike in the district attorney's race, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> united on the choice for city controller and Clark and Dilworth both publicly endorsed Hemphill. The result was a solid victory for the Democrats as Hemphill was elected by a thirteen-point margin.|$|E
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> in the minority, Randall {{spent much}} of his time scrutinizing the Republicans' {{appropriations}} bills. During the Grant administration, he questioned thousands of items in the appropriation bills, often gaining the support of Republicans in excising expenditures that were in excess of the departments' needs. He proposed a bill that would end the practice, common at the time, of executive departments spending beyond what they had been appropriated, then petitioning Congress to retroactively approve the spending with a supplemental appropriation; the legislation passed and became law. The supplemental appropriations were typically rushed through {{at the end of a}} session with little debate. Reacting to the large grants of land given to railroads, he also sought unsuccessfully to ban all land grants to private corporations.|$|E

5|$|As the 46th Congress {{convened in}} 1879, the Democratic caucus was reduced, {{but they still}} held a {{plurality}} of seats. The new House contained 152 Democrats, 139 Republicans, and 20 independents, {{most of whom were}} affiliated with the Greenback Party. Many of Randall's fellow Democrats differed with him over protectionism and his lack of support for Southern railroad subsidies, and considered choosing Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of Kentucky as their nominee for Speaker, instead. Several other Southerners' names were floated, too, as anti-Randall Democrats tried to coalesce around a single candidate; in the end, none could be found and the caucus chose Randall as their nominee with 107 votes out of 152. With some Democrats not yet present, however, the Democrats began to fear that the Republicans and Greenbackers would strike a deal to combine their votes to elect James A. Garfield of Ohio as Speaker. When the time for the vote came, however, Garfield refused to make any compromises with the third-party men, and Randall and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> able to organize the House once more.|$|E
5|$|Elijah Hise, Chief Justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, was {{the leading}} {{candidate}} for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, but after the Whig nomination of Crittenden, Hise withdrew from consideration. The Democratic state convention then nominated Congressman Linn Boyd, but Boyd also declined the nomination. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> finally able to nominate Henderson lawyer Lazarus W. Powell. As Crittenden canvassed the state, his opponents charged him with disloyalty to Clay because he refused to support him in the 1848 election. Crittenden maintained that he supported Clay for the presidency over anyone else, but he had believed that Clay {{did not intend to}} seek the Whig nomination in 1848. After Clay announced his candidacy, Crittenden said, he remained neutral in the Whigs' choice. In the gubernatorial election, Crittenden defeated Powell by a vote of 65,860 to 57,397. He resigned his Senate seat to assume the governorship.|$|E
5|$|On Election Day in November 1876, Tillman {{served as}} an {{election}} official at a local poll, as did two black Republicans. One arrived late and was scared off by Tillman. As there was as yet no secret ballot in South Carolina, Tillman threatened to remember any votes cast for the Republicans. That precinct gave 211 votes for the Democrats and 2 for the Republicans. Although almost two-thirds of those eligible to vote in Edgefield were African Americans, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> able to suppress the (Republican) African-American vote, reporting a win for Hampton in Edgefield County with over 60 percent of the vote. Bolstered by this result, Hampton gained a narrow victory statewide, {{at least according to}} the official returns. The Red Shirts used violence and fraud to create Democratic majorities that did not exist, and give Hampton the election.|$|E

5|$|Randall {{began to}} gain {{prominence}} in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures. His delaying tactics against fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens's military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeksâ€”long enough {{to prevent it from}} being voted on until the next session. He likewise spoke against what would become the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Although he opposed the amendment, Randall did favor the idea behind part of it: section 4, which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the federal debt, nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy, nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion. Many Republicans claimed that if <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> to regain power, they would do exactly that, repudiating federal debt and assuming that of the rebels. Despite disagreement on other facets of Reconstruction, Randall stood firmly with the Republicans (and most Northern Democrats) on the debt.|$|E
5|$|Revenue from tariffs {{was then}} {{a major source of}} income for the federal government. There was no federal income tax, and tariff debates were passionate; the 1888 presidential {{election}} had them as a major issue. Many Democrats supported a tariff for revenue onlyâ€”that is, the purpose of tariffs should be to finance government, not to encourage American manufacturers. McKinley disagreed with that and sponsored the McKinley Tariff of 1890. This act, passed by the Republican-dominated Congress, raised rates on imports to protect American industry. McKinley's tariff proved unpopular among many people who had to pay the increased prices, and was seen as a reason not only for his defeat for re-election to Congress in 1890, but also for the Republicans losing control of both House and Senate in that year's midterm elections. Nevertheless, McKinley's defeat did not, in the end, damage his political prospects, as <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> blamed for gerrymandering him out of his seat.|$|E
5|$|Pierce campaigned vigorously {{throughout}} {{his home state}} for Van Buren's re-election in the 1840 presidential election. The incumbent carried New Hampshire but lost the national vote to William Henry Harrison, the military hero, whose Whigs took a majority of seats in the Twenty-seventh Congress. Harrison died after a month in office, and Vice President John Tyler succeeded him. Pierce and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> quick to challenge the new administration, questioning the removal of federal officeholders, and opposing Whig plans for a national bank. In December 1841 Pierce decided to resign from Congress, something he had been planning for some time. New Hampshire Democrats felt that no-one should hold one of the state's Senate seats for longer than one six-year term. Thus, he had little likelihood of re-election. Also, he was frustrated at {{being a member of}} the legislative minority and wished to devote his time to his family and law practice. His last acts in the Senate before resigning in February 1842 were to oppose a bill distributing federal funds to the states â€“ believing that the money should go to the military instead â€“ and to challenge the Whigs to reveal the results of their investigation of the New York Customs House, where the Whigs had probed for Democratic corruption for nearly a year but had issued no findings.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{before the}} 1960 Presidential election, Richard Nixon was alarmed {{when it was}} {{revealed}} that his brother, Donald, received a $205,000 loan from Hughes. It has long been speculated that Nixon's drive to learn what <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> planning in 1972 was based in part on his belief that the Democrats knew about a later bribe that his friend Bebe Rebozo had received from Hughes after Nixon took office.|$|E
25|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> {{grappling}} {{with their own}} troubles, leaders in the Republican party fought to keep elected members focused {{on the issue of}} slavery in the West, which allowed them to mobilize popular support.

He was also particularly disturbed by the tendency of many Republicans to eschew moral attacks on slavery for political and economic arguments.|$|E
