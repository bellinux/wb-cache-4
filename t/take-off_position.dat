Our objective consists of developing a UAV capable of autonomously perform <b>take-off,</b> <b>positioning,</b> navigation and landing in unknown environments.

25|$|Surfing can {{be broken}} into several skills: Paddling strength, Positioning to catch the wave, timing, and balance. Paddling out {{requires}} strength, but also the mastery of techniques to break through oncoming waves (duck diving, eskimo roll). <b>Take-off</b> <b>positioning</b> requires experience at predicting the wave set and where they will break. The surfer must pop up quickly {{as soon as the}} wave starts pushing the board forward. Preferred positioning on the wave is determined by experience at reading wave features including where the wave is breaking. Balance plays a crucial role in standing on a surfboard. Thus, balance training exercises are a good preparation. Practicing with a Balance board or swing boarding helps novices master the art.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a real-time trinocular system to control rotary wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles {{based on the}} 3 D information extracted by cameras located on the ground. The algorithm is based on key features onboard the UAV to estimate the vehicle's position and orientation. The algorithm is validated against onboard sensors and known 3 D positions, showing that the proposed camera configuration robustly estimates the helicopter's position with an adequate resolution, improving the position estimation, especially the height estimation. The obtained {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm is suitable to complement or replace the GPS-based position estimation in situations where GPS information is unavailable or where its information is inaccurate, allowing the vehicle to develop tasks at low heights, such as autonomous landing, <b>take-off,</b> and <b>positioning,</b> using the extracted 3 D information as a visual feedback to the flight controller...|$|R

50|$|Long range twin jets {{such as the}} Boeing 767 and the Airbus A300, A310, and A330 may or may {{not have}} fuel dump systems, {{depending}} upon how the aircraft was ordered, since on some aircraft they are a customer option. Three- and four-engine jets like the Lockheed L-1011, McDonnell Douglas DC-10 / MD-11, Boeing 747 and Airbus A340 usually have difficulty meeting the requirements of FAR 25.119 near maximum structural takeoff weight, thus most of those have jettison systems. A Boeing 757 has no fuel dump capability as its maximum landing weight is similar to the maximum <b>take-off</b> weight. Airbus <b>positions</b> the dumping nozzles on the wing fairing.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Some complex {{application}} {{scenarios for}} micro UAVs (Un-manned Aerial Vehicles) {{call for the}} formation of swarms of multiple drones. In this paper a platform for the creation of such swarms is pre-sented. It consists of modified commercial quadrocopters and a self-made ground control station software architecture. Autonomy of individual drones is generated through a micro controller equipped video camera. Currently it is possible to fly basic maneuvers autonomously, such as <b>take-off,</b> fly to <b>position,</b> and landing. In the future the camera’s image processing capabilities will be used to generate additional control infor-mation. Different co-operation strategies for teams of UAVs are currently evaluated with an agent based simulation tool. Finally complex applica-tion scenarios for multiple micro UAVs are presented. ...|$|R

50|$|As the {{aircraft}} started the takeoff run, the take-off warning system (TOWS) sounded an alarm in the cockpit, indicating that {{the aircraft}} was not correctly configured for the maneuver. The crew ignored the warning and continued the takeoff, not realising that the flaps were not at the required <b>take-off</b> <b>position</b> and were instead fully retracted, thus preventing the aircraft from lifting off. The jet overshot the runway, breaking through the airport's perimeter fence, crossed a road, hitting an automobile, and finally collided with road-construction machinery and a highway median. Fuel spilling over the hot engines and gas leaking from a damaged gas regulation station resulted in a fire that totally destroyed the aircraft.|$|E

Aspects of the Mercure's wing, such as the general layout and individual wing sections, were optimised using a combination of wind tunnel tests and computer-generated simulations by Dassault's design team. The wing had a good lift/drag ratio and a high block efficiency; the flaps formed a continuous spanwise unit when deployed in the <b>take-off</b> <b>position,</b> neither low-speed ailerons or cut-outs to accommodate jet exhaust due to the engines have been fixed low down upon deep pylons.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} current pricing practices at the 200 biggest airports in the European Union. Our analysis shows that airport incentive programs are, in general, a common tool of airport pricing {{as they are}} used at one third of all airports. We also find evidence {{on the presence of}} bilateral agreements between airport operators or regional authorities on one side and airlines on the other side which serve as a substitute for published incentive programs. Geographically, usage of the different tools varies substantially between different EU countries. A detailed assessment of the incentive schemes offered at German airports within our broader European sample reveals that the average level of landing and <b>take-off,</b> parking and <b>positioning</b> and passenger charges is generally reduced by more than 10 %, at smaller airports even by up to 44 %. Given the usually low profit margin of airlines and that airport charges account for up to 10 % of total operating costs, these incentives can have an important influence on the economic viability of a route. Moreover, in an airline's multi-criteria-based assessment of potential market entries or route expansions, such incentive schemes might compensate selected weaknesses of an airport's strategic posture...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade we have seen how small and light weight aerial {{platforms}} - aka, Mini Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MUAV) - shipped with heterogeneous sensors have become a 'most wanted' Remote Sensing (RS) tool. Most of the off-the-shelf aerial systems found in the market provide way-point navigation. However, they do not rely on a tool that compute the aerial trajectories considering all the aspects that allow optimizing the aerial missions. One of the most demanded RS applications of MUAV is image surveying. The images acquired are typically used to build a high-resolution image, i. e., a mosaic of the workspace surface. Although, it may be applied to any other application where a sensor-based map must be computed. This thesis provides a study of this application {{and a set of}} solutions and methods to address this kind of aerial mission by using a fleet of MUAVs. In particular, a set of algorithms are proposed for map-based sampling, and aerial coverage path planning (ACPP). Regarding to map-based sampling, the approaches proposed consider workspaces with different shapes and surface characteristics. The workspace is sampled considering the sensor characteristics and a set of mission requirements. The algorithm applies different computational geometry approaches, providing a unique way to deal with workspaces with different shape and surface characteristics in order to be surveyed by one or more MUAVs. This feature introduces a previous optimization step before path planning. After that, the ACPP problem is theorized and a set of ACPP algorithms to compute the MUAVs trajectories are proposed. The problem addressed herein is the problem to coverage a wide area by using MUAVs with limited autonomy. Therefore, the mission must be accomplished in the shortest amount of time. The aerial survey is usually subject to a set of workspace restrictions, such as the <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>positions</b> as well as a safety distance between elements of the fleet. Moreover, it has to avoid forbidden zones to y. Three different algorithms have been studied to address this problem. The approaches studied are based on graph searching, heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches, e. g., mimic, evolutionary. Finally, an extended survey of field experiments applying the previous methods, as well as the materials and methods adopted in outdoor missions is presented. The reported outcomes demonstrate that the findings attained from this thesis improve ACPP mission for mapping purpose in an efficient and safe manner...|$|R
50|$|The {{apparently}} tumbling {{movements are}} composed {{of a series of}} very rapid separate jumps (each jump of a duration of approximately 80 ms). They result from the beetle's efforts to get itself back into <b>take-off</b> <b>position</b> for flight when it has been in either lateral or dorsal position. Each individual jump should be considered as an extended rotation, performed by one leg of the third leg pair (metapodium). Depending on whether the left or the right metapodium is used as the leg that provides the leverage for take-off, change occurs {{in the direction of the}} jump. The energy for propulsion varies with the beetle's immediate muscle work, so that jump lengths and heights vary, with rotation frequencies recorded up to 48 per second (Mordellochroa abdominalis) around the gravitation centre of the body's longitudinal axis. Additional revolving around the transverse axis (at lower frequency) effects spiralling somersaults that are perceived as tumbling. The pintail (pygidium) is of no significance for the jump. While the pintail is no significance for the jump, meta-trochanter-femur (thighs and surrounding rings of the third leg pair)has a great capacity of free rotation (up to 270 degrees, at one level only). This capacity is due to a screw joint that connects the base of metacoxa to the head of trochanter. The nut gradient is 21 degrees (as seen under a scanning electron microscpoy SEM, 1985). Technically similar jumps, though less powerful, can be observed in family Melandryidae (=Serropalpidae) (genus Orchesia) and family Scraptiidae (genus Anaspis). Their coxa-trochanter-joints are of similar structure. It can be assumed that the capacity of a tumbling form of locomotion is rooted in a common phylogeny and can therefore not be ascribed specifically to Mordellidae.Meanwhile, other authors have also pointed out the uniqueness of the real screw joint in nature. (2011)The weevil of the genus Trigonopterus, Curculionidae in the Asian tropical rainforest, for example, has an even tighter connective construction in the Coxa -Trochanter joint than is found in Mordellidae. This construction, however, does not facilitate an equally high angular velocity of the torque. The joint here serves to provide a better grip on plants and easier climbing.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{investigators}} {{have reported that}} the ability of long jumpers to visually regulate their stride pattern as they approach the take-off board is critical for success. The importance of visual regulation (VA) on long jump (LJ) distance was assessed in six national-class competitors during two simulated competitions. Linear regression analyses indicated that increased VR contributes to a high average approach velocity -a key predictor of LJ distance. Early VA enabled the athletes to make small systematic adjustments to stride length in order to strike the board in an optimal <b>take-off</b> <b>position,</b> without sacrificing approach velocity. Athletes practice their LJ approach by repeating the stride pattern of the approach, but without the take-off. The current study established that these 2 ̆ 7 run-throughs 2 ̆ 7 (AT) don 2 ̆ 7 t accurately simulate the VR characteristics of a LJ approach. One strategy to increase the VA required during RT 2 ̆ 7 s may be to place additional targets across the runway for the athletes to negotiate whilst approaching the take-off board, without compromising approach velocity. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{assertion}} of this thesis is that policy makers' belief systems and economic institutions {{have to change}} their structures and contents as the nation's economic developmental stage is upgraded. Put differently, a state's economic performance or achievement of economic objectives will be facilitated {{if there is no}} cleavage or conflict among economic policy, economic belief systems, and economic institutions. This means that the utility of the developmental state is valid until a nation's economy is in a <b>take-off</b> <b>position.</b> Persistent developmentalism after this stage will result in developmentalism losing its validity and becoming a main obstacle for further economic development. At this time, more liberalised economic policies which are not only supported by changed belief systems and institutions but also compatible with the neo-liberalising international political economy are needed. In other words, this thesis does not seek to answer the question 'which is the better strategy for economic development between developmentalism and neo-liberalism?' but emphasises the importance of the proper timing of transition from developmentalism to a liberalised and deregulated economy which is compatible with a mature civil society and the neo-liberalising international political economy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Dynamics is {{a central}} aspect of ski jumping, {{particularly}} during take-off and stable flight. Currently, measurement systems able to measure ski jumping dynamics (e. g. 3 D cameras, force plates) are complex and only available in few research centres worldwide. This study proposes a method to determine dynamics using a wearable inertial sensor-based system {{which can be used}} routinely on any ski jumping hill. The system automatically calculates characteristic dynamic parameters during <b>take-off</b> (<b>position</b> and velocity of the centre of mass perpendicular to the table, force acting on the centre of mass perpendicular to the table and somersault angular velocity) and stable flight (total aerodynamic force). Furthermore, the acceleration of the ski perpendicular to the table was quantified to characterise the skis lift at take-off. The system was tested with two groups of 11 athletes with different jump distances. The force acting on the centre of mass, acceleration of the ski perpendicular to the table, somersault angular velocity and total aerodynamic force were different between groups and correlated with the jump distances. Furthermore, all dynamic parameters were within the range of prior studies based on stationary measurement systems, except for the centre of mass mean force which was slightly lower...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether or not adding a non-traditional jump entry into a routine is more beneficial to the skater or if there is more value in performing the same jump with a traditional entry. Specifically, the study examined the kinematics of a non-traditional verses a traditional jump entry by looking at the angles of the hip, knee, and ankle joints at take-off and landing. Maximum jump height, airtime, and horizontal displacement were also examined. It was hypothesized that non-traditional entries would change jump kinematics when compared to the same jumps performed from traditional entries. Ten skilled figure skaters volunteered to participate in the study and each was videotaped performing five trails of either a double salchow or a double toe loop using a traditional entry and five trials of the same jump using a non-traditional entry. The collected data were analyzed with DartFish and a series of paired samples t-tests compared the ankle, knee and hip angles at take-off and at landing, maximum jump height, air time, and horizontal displacement between traditional and non-traditional entries. The significance level of. 05 was adjusted using a Bonferonni correction. It was determined that the significant findings were that maximum jump height increased from 0. 36 + 0. 14 m in the traditional entry to 0. 44 + 0. 15 m in the non-traditional entry and the ankle demonstrated more plantar flexion at landing (90. 5 o+ 8. 6 o) in the nontraditional jump than in the traditional jump (85. 7 o+ 12. 9 o). These findings indicate that greater jump height may be a by-product of performing jumps with a more difficult <b>take-off</b> <b>position</b> and the non-traditional jump landing is different when compared to the traditional landing of those jumps because of the greater plantar flexion. Future research should be directed towards studying different aspects of jump difficulty to gain a better understanding of the influence of traditional versus non-traditional entries jumps as a whole...|$|E
