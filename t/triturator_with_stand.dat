The contribution of biomass {{to the total}} forest carbon stocks increased and that of dead organic matter decreased <b>with</b> increasing <b>stand</b> age. • Context Understanding changes in forest carbon stocks over time is important to estimate carbon inventory. Although Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is a main species in Turkey, studies on such changes are still lacking. • Aims We aimed to estimate the changes in carbon stocks, <b>with</b> <b>stand</b> age, of Scots pine stands in Turkey using field work data and a forest carbon model (FBDC model). • Methods Biomass and dead organic matter carbon stocks were investigated to adjust the forest carbon model and to verify the model estimates. Forest carbon stocks <b>with</b> regards to <b>stand</b> age were simulated. • Results The simulated carbon stocks were generally in clear agreement with the observed values on a stand scale. Changes in simulated {{and observed}} carbon stocks of biomass and dead organic matter varied <b>with</b> <b>stand</b> age. The contribution of biomass to total forest carbon stocks increased, and that of dead organic matter decreased, <b>with</b> increasing <b>stand</b> age. • Conclusion We found that the carbon stocks in each pool and their contribution to the total forest carbon stocks varied <b>with</b> <b>stand</b> age. Our results are expected {{to contribute to the}} understanding of annual changes in the carbon stocks of Turkish forests...|$|R

The highest tree density (1, 358 trees ha- 1) was found in CJ 73, where no thinning activity had occurred. Stand tree density declined <b>with</b> <b>stand</b> age and reached its lowest point at approximately 430 trees ha- 1 for the 90 -year-old stands. By contrast, the values for stand characteristics, including canopy height, mean DBH, and BA, increased <b>with</b> <b>stand</b> age. Despite decreasing tree density, the increases in DBH and BA caused the living tree biomass to increase. Live tree biomass C stocks for the 12 selected stands ranged from 165 to 320  Mg C ha- 1 and tended to increase <b>with</b> <b>stand</b> age. For stands at 90 years of age, canopy height, mean DBH, BA, and tree biomass C stocks were nearly 27 m, 48 cm, 82 m 2 ha- 1 and 300 Mg C ha- 1, respectively.|$|R

Tannin levels and nutrient resorption of Casuarina equisetifolia at different developmental phases (juvenile, mature and senescent phases) were examined to evaluate possible nutrient conservation strategies under nutrient limitation. Results showed that C. equisetifolia branchlets contained relatively higher contents of total phenolics, extractable condensed tannin, total condensed tannin contents and protein precipitation capacity in juvenile <b>stands</b> compared <b>with</b> those in mature and senescent stands. Nitrogen (N) concentrations in mature branchlets increased <b>with</b> <b>stand</b> development, while phosphorus (P) concentrations showed a decreasing trend.
