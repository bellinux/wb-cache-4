5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in <b>tensile</b> strength as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest <b>tensile</b> strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest <b>tensile</b> strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are strong in compressive loading and relatively weak in <b>tensile</b> strength, the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and <b>tensile</b> forces well. The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience <b>tensile</b> loads.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{metals in}} pure form, {{tungsten}} {{has the highest}} melting point (3422°C, 6192°F), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1650°C, 3000°F), and the highest <b>tensile</b> strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and <b>tensile</b> strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.|$|E
5|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{industrial use}} of vanadium {{was in the}} steel alloy chassis of the Ford Model T, inspired by French race cars. Vanadium steel allowed for reduced weight while simultaneously increasing <b>tensile</b> strength (ca. 1905).|$|E
5|$|These SiNH {{films have}} much less <b>tensile</b> stress, but worse {{electrical}} properties (resistivity 106 to 1015Ω·cm, and dielectric strength 1 to 5MV/cm).|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{deposited}} by LPCVD contains up to 8% hydrogen. It also experiences strong <b>tensile</b> stress, {{which may}} crack films thicker than 200nm. However, it has higher resistivity and dielectric strength than most insulators commonly available in microfabrication (1016 Ω·cm and 10MV/cm, respectively).|$|E
5|$|Steel is an alloy of {{iron and}} carbon with trace amounts of other elements. Because of its high <b>tensile</b> {{strength}} and low cost, {{it is a major}} component used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, appliances, and weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and <b>tensile</b> strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low <b>tensile</b> strength. Because of the softness of iron, it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tensile</b> {{strength}} {{measures the}} force required to pull an object such as rope, wire, or a structural beam {{to the point}} where it breaks. The <b>tensile</b> strength of a material is the maximum amount of <b>tensile</b> stress it can take before breaking.|$|E
25|$|In the Sn-Pb alloys, <b>tensile</b> {{strength}} {{increases with}} increasing tin content. Indium-tin alloys with high indium content have very low <b>tensile</b> strength.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tensile</b> {{strength}} of a material quantifies how much elongating stress the material will endure before failure. This {{is very important in}} applications that rely upon a polymer's physical strength or durability. For example, a rubber band with a higher <b>tensile</b> strength will hold a greater weight before snapping. In general, <b>tensile</b> strength increases with polymer chain length and crosslinking of polymer chains.|$|E
25|$|A beam bends under bending moment, {{resulting}} in a small curvature. At the outer face (<b>tensile</b> face) of the curvature the concrete experiences <b>tensile</b> stress, while at the inner face (compressive face) it experiences compressive stress.|$|E
25|$|A balanced-reinforced beam is one {{in which}} both the {{compressive}} and <b>tensile</b> zones reach yielding at the same imposed load on the beam, and the concrete will crush and the <b>tensile</b> steel will yield at the same time. This design criterion is however as risky as over-reinforced concrete, because failure is sudden as the concrete crushes at the same time of the <b>tensile</b> steel yields, which gives a very little warning of distress in tension failure.|$|E
25|$|Use of high <b>tensile</b> springs {{front and}} rear.|$|E
25|$|Using high <b>tensile</b> steel on body panels.|$|E
25|$|With the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, truss {{systems of}} wrought iron were {{developed}} for larger bridges, but iron {{does not have}} the <b>tensile</b> strength to support large loads. With the advent of steel, which has a high <b>tensile</b> strength, much larger bridges were built, many using the ideas of Gustave Eiffel.|$|E
25|$|Possible {{detrimental}} effect of residual <b>tensile</b> stress from the plating.|$|E
25|$|Concrete {{reinforced}} with fibers (which are usually steel, glass, or plastic fibers) is {{less expensive than}} hand-tied rebar, while still increasing the <b>tensile</b> strength many times. The shape, dimension, and length of the fiber are important. A thin and short fiber, for example short, hair-shaped glass fiber, is only effective during the first hours after pouring the concrete (its function is to reduce cracking while the concrete is stiffening), {{but it will not}} increase the concrete <b>tensile</b> strength. A normal-size fiber for European shotcrete (1mm diameter, 45mm length—steel or plastic) will increase the concrete's <b>tensile</b> strength.|$|E
25|$|Ductility is a material's {{ability to}} deform under <b>tensile</b> stress. This is often {{characterized}} by the material's ability to be stretched into a wire. Ductility is especially important in metalworking because materials that crack or break under stress cannot be hammered, rolled, or drawn (drawing {{is a process that}} uses <b>tensile</b> forces to stretch metal).|$|E
25|$|White & grey {{aluminium}} oxide abrasives are used on high <b>tensile</b> strength metals, such as carbon and alloy steel, tough iron, and nonferrous alloys. Gray silicon carbide abrasives are used on hard and brittle substances, such as grey iron and cemented carbide, and low <b>tensile</b> strength metals, such as brass, aluminium, and copper. Green chromium (III) oxide is the abrasive used in green compounds that are typically used to finish ferrous metals (steels).|$|E
25|$|The clamp load, {{also called}} preload of a fastener, is created when a torque is applied, and so {{develops}} a <b>tensile</b> preload that is generally a substantial {{percentage of the}} fastener's proof strength. Fasteners are manufactured to various standards that define, among other things, their strength. Torque charts are available to specify the required torque for a given fastener based on its property class (fineness of manufacture and fit) and grade (<b>tensile</b> strength).|$|E
25|$|Copper’s higher <b>tensile</b> {{strength}} (200–250 N/mm2 annealed) {{compared to}} aluminium (100 N/mm2 for typical conductor alloys) {{is another reason}} why copper is used extensively in the building industry. Copper’s high strength resists stretching, neck-down, creep, nicks and breaks, and thereby also prevents failures and service interruptions. Copper is much heavier than aluminum for conductors of equal current carrying capacity, so the high <b>tensile</b> strength is offset by its increased weight.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{buckling}} {{and instability}} {{are associated with}} compression, but buckling and instability can also occur in elastic structures subject to dead <b>tensile</b> load.|$|E
25|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} {{is a kind}} of {{reinforced concrete}} used for overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension. It can be applied to beams, floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary reinforced concrete. Prestressing tendons (generally of high <b>tensile</b> steel cable or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a compressive stress that offsets the <b>tensile</b> stress that the concrete compression member would, otherwise, experience due to a bending load.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} point of Monier's {{idea was that}} it combined steel and concrete {{in such a way}} that the best qualities of each material were brought into play. Concrete is easily procured and shaped. It has considerable compressive or crushing strength, but is somewhat deficient in shearing strength, and distinctly weak in <b>tensile</b> or pulling strength. Steel, on the other hand, is easily procurable in simple forms such as long bars, and is extremely strong. But it is difficult and expensive to work up into customized forms. Concrete had been avoided for making beams, slabs and thin walls because its lack of <b>tensile</b> strength doomed it to fail in such circumstances. But if a concrete slab is reinforced with a network of small steel rods on its undersurface where the <b>tensile</b> stresses occur, its strength will be enormously increased.|$|E
25|$|In most of {{the more}} ancient {{lineages}} of gastropods, the radula is used to graze by scraping diatoms and other microscopic algae off rock surfaces and other substrates. Limpets scrape algae from rocks using radula equipped with exceptionally hard rasping teeth. These teeth have the strongest known <b>tensile</b> strength of any biological material, outperforming spider silk. The mineral protein of the limpet teeth can withstand a <b>tensile</b> stress of 4.9 GPa, compared to 4 GPa of spider silk and 0.5 GPa of human teeth.|$|E
25|$|The notable <b>tensile</b> {{strength}} of spider webs is often exaggerated in science fiction, often as an plot device {{to justify the}} presence of artificially giant spiders.|$|E
25|$|Ropes {{and lines}} {{are made of}} fibre lengths, twisted or braided {{together}} to provide <b>tensile</b> strength. They are used for pulling, but not for pushing.|$|E
25|$|Where UTS is the {{ultimate}} <b>tensile</b> strength in ksi and h is the strip thickness in inches. A CE value of 0.3 or less is considered safe.|$|E
25|$|Concrete piles are {{typically}} made with steel reinforcing and prestressing tendons {{to obtain the}} <b>tensile</b> strength required, to survive handling and driving, and to provide sufficient bending resistance.|$|E
25|$|The {{ultimate}} <b>tensile</b> {{strength of}} these steels is considered secondary to their yield strength. Where this {{is required to}} meet a particular value, it is specified for each order.|$|E
25|$|PMMA has {{a maximum}} water {{absorption}} ratio of 0.3–0.4% by weight. <b>Tensile</b> strength decreases with increased water absorption. Its {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} is relatively high at (5–10)×10−5 °C−1.|$|E
25|$|In {{pre-tensioned}} concrete, the prestressing {{is achieved}} by using steel or polymer tendons or bars that are subjected to a <b>tensile</b> force prior to casting, or for post-tensioned concrete, after casting.|$|E
25|$|A singly {{reinforced}} beam is one {{in which}} the concrete element is only reinforced near the <b>tensile</b> face and the reinforcement, called tension steel, is designed to resist the tension.|$|E
25|$|After {{solution}} treatment, the <b>tensile</b> {{strength of}} the alloy increases, but its Young's modulus decreases. The second stage of artificial aging increases the strength slightly, but also restores or improves the modulus.|$|E
25|$|In {{detail a}} {{dragline}} silk's <b>tensile</b> strength {{is comparable to}} that of high-grade alloy steel (450 − 2000 MPa), and about half as strong as aramid filaments, such as Twaron or Kevlar (3000 MPa).|$|E
