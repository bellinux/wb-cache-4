40|$|Abstract: This paper {{systematically}} discusses <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>and</b> {{privacy concerns}} for e-learning systems. A five-layer architecture of e-learning system is proposed. <b>The</b> <b>security</b> <b>and</b> privacy concerns are addressed respectively for five layers. This paper further examines {{the relationship among}} <b>the</b> <b>security</b> & privacy policy, <b>the</b> available <b>security</b> & privacy technology, {{and the degree of}} e-learning privacy & <b>security.</b> <b>The</b> digital identity attributes are introduced to e-learning portable devices to enhance <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>and</b> privacy of e-learning systems. This will provide significant contributions to the knowledge of e-learning security & privacy research communities and will generate more research interests...|$|R
5|$|In 1975 and 1976, several {{stockholder}} lawsuits {{were filed}} against American Financial, and Keating was {{under fire for}} aspects involving unsecured loans, stock warrants, and {{the sale of the}} Enquirer. <b>The</b> <b>Securities</b> <b>and</b> Exchange Commission launched a major investigation of the company and charged Lindner, Keating and others with having defrauded investors and filing false SEC reports. At particular issue was a $14 million loan that the SEC said was made on preferential terms. Keating resigned from American Financial in August 1976, with conflicting stories {{as to whether or not}} Keating and Lindner had remained close or whether they had fallen out.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, KKR {{filed with}} <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> <b>and</b> Exchange Commission to raise $1.25 billion by selling an {{ownership}} interest in its management company. The filing came {{less than two}} weeks after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, Franken {{proposed}} a financial reform legislation {{amendment that would}} create a board to select which credit rating agency would evaluate a given security. Currently any company issuing a security may select the company that evaluates the security. The amendment was passed; however, the financial industry lobbied to have Franken's amendment removed from the final bill. Negotiations between the Senate and House, whose version of financial reform did not include such a provision, resulted in the amendment's being watered down to require only {{a series of studies}} being done upon the issue for two years. After the studies, if <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> <b>and</b> Exchange Commission has not implemented another solution to the conflict of interest problem, Franken's solution would go into effect.|$|E

5|$|On July 27, 2016, in its {{quarterly}} report to <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> <b>and</b> Exchange Commission, Boeing discussed the potential termination of 747 production due to insufficient demand and {{market for the}} aircraft. With a firm order backlog of 21 aircraft and a production rate of six per year, program accounting {{has been reduced to}} 1,555 aircraft, and the 747 line could be closed {{in the third quarter of}} 2019.

5|$|In {{the case}} of Yeap Wai Kong v. Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. (2012), the High Court {{identified}} various factors {{to determine if the}} decision by Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd. ("SGX-ST") to reprimand a director of a company listed on the Singapore Exchange was properly characterized as a public function. These factors include {{the extent to which the}} SGX-ST is interwoven into the legislative and regulatory matrix, whether the reprimand function has a statutory underpinning, and the nature of the reprimand function. Even though the SGX-ST is not a statutory board, it is an approved exchange under section16 of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> <b>and</b> Futures Act, which provides that it must take into account the interests of both the investing and general public when discharging its obligations. Also, SGX-ST is a vital part of the institutional ecosystem of Singapore's financial sector. Its function to publicly reprimand a listed company's director may potentially result in adverse implications on the company's business reputation and the director's continued service on board committees and directorships of other listed companies. For these reasons, the nature test was satisfied.|$|E
5|$|On February 16, {{the company}} {{announced}} it had filed its registration for the IPO with <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> <b>and</b> Exchange Commission. Burger King began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BKC on May 18, 2006. The stock sale generated $425million in revenue, the largest IPO of a US-based restaurant chain on record. The proceeds from the sale were used by the company help pay back a loan taken out taken by the company in February used to pay dividends to the investment firms. According to one analyst at Renaissance Capital, Wall Street investors were not alarmed by the large payout due to the increased financial stability of the company resulting from changes made by the investor groups during the interim between the purchase in 2002 and the stock offering. Incoming CEO John W. Chidsey backed the payouts, stating that the financial firms spent considerable time and capital turning the company around.|$|E

5|$|The bank's {{expansion}} strategy hit {{trouble with}} {{the stock market crash}} of 1987 and involvement in the financial scandal surrounding the collapse of Blue Arrow. The Department of Trade and Industry report on the affair was critical of the bank's management and resulted in the resignation of several members of the board, including then chairman Lord Boardman. Later, the bank would divest its overseas subsidiaries. The North American operations were sold to Fleet Bank and Hong Kong Bank of Canada, and the Australian and New Zealand branches were sold to Salomon Smith Barney and the National Australia Bank. Thereafter the bank concentrated on its core domestic business as the restyled NatWest Group, reflecting its modern positioning as a portfolio of businesses. In 1993, the NatWest Tower was devastated by a Provisional IRA bomb and the bank vacated the building and later sold it. Then, in 1997, NatWest Markets, the corporate and investment banking arm formed in 1992, revealed that a £50m loss had been discovered, revised to £90.5m after further investigations. Investor and shareholder confidence was so badly shaken that the Bank of England had to instruct the board of directors to resist calls for the resignation of its most senior executives in an effort to draw a line under the affair. The bank's internal controls and risk management were severely criticised in 2000 and its aggressive push into investment banking questioned, after a lengthy investigation by <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> <b>and</b> Futures Authority. The bank's move into complicated derivative products that it did not fully understand seemed to indicate poor management. By the end of 1997 parts of NatWest Markets had been sold, others becoming Greenwich NatWest in 1998.|$|E

The first official restriction on short selling came in 1938, when the SEC adopted a rule known as the uptick rule that dictated that a short sale could only be made {{when the price of}} a particular stock was higher than the previous trade price. The uptick rule aimed to prevent short sales from causing or exacerbating market price declines. In January 2005, <b>The</b> <b>Securities</b> <b>and</b> Exchange Commission enacted Regulation SHO to target abusive naked short selling.
