At another place we had seen before, we dug and found some more corn, two or three baskets full, {{and a bag of}} beans....In all we had about ten bushels, which will be enough for seed. It is with God's help <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> this corn, for how else could we have done it, without meeting some Indians who might trouble us.|$|E

Dr. Robert Weaver, who also served in Roosevelt's Black Cabinet, said of her, [...] "She {{had the most}} marvelous gift of effecting feminine helplessness in order to attain her aims with masculine ruthlessness." [...] When a white Daytona resident threatened Bethune's students with a rifle, Bethune worked to make an ally of him. The director of the McLeod Hospital recalled, [...] "Mrs. Bethune treated him with courtesy and developed such goodwill in him <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> him protecting the children and {{going so far as}} to say, 'If anybody bothers old Mary, I will protect her with my life.'" ...|$|E
500|$|According to Bart Millard, {{the lead}} vocalist for MercyMe, the band enjoys the Christmas season greatly and had {{recorded}} songs for compilation albums like [...] and had liked {{the process of}} taking older Christmas songs and altering them; Millard said that the band [...] "had so much fun doing it <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> ourselves wishing we had a Christmas record of our own". After the band released their third studio album Undone in early 2004, they decided {{to take some time}} off, and realized they could record a Christmas album over that period. Although MercyMe had started as a rock band, they become associated with the adult contemporary genre after their single [...] "I Can Only Imagine" [...] became successful. In creating The Christmas Sessions, the band incorporated more elements from rock music and other genres; Millard described it as [...] "the most 'rock' album we've done" [...] and noted they did not concern themselves with the album's direction, saying [...] "we didn’t have to worry about which direction we went. We just made the record we wanted to make".|$|E

500|$|Several {{songs from}} the band's third album, Vitalogy, were premiered during this tour. The band's April 3, 1994 concert in Atlanta, Georgia at the Fox Theatre was {{broadcast}} live on the radio in the United States. A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't {{think any of us}} would be in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the day <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know if we should play, or if we should just go home, or if we should attend the services. I still have some regrets about that, even though {{in the end it was}} probably better that we played the last two weeks of the tour. I decided I would play those next two weeks and then I'd never have to play again." ...|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E
500|$|Peter Horton, {{expressed}} that his plan of developing Chandra Wilson's character, Miranda Bailey, was {{to focus on}} the similarities between her and the actress, noting that [...] "there's not a mean bone in her body, but she's solid and steady, like a rock." [...] Wilson herself noted a significant evolution in her character's personality, noting a transition from the cold attitude that was characteristic to her in the past, to a maternal outlook on her interns. She also noted a number of similarities between her and her character, describing how considers Miranda Bailey an alter ego of hers, rather than someone living inside her. Wilson also assessed that being a real-life human is what makes Bailey an appreciated character: [...] "She gets to be flawed, she gets to be tired, she can be cranky, she can be grumpy." [...] Showrunner Shonda Rhimes explained that the idea of Miranda Bailey having a child was developed after Chandra Wilson had already been pregnant for six months. Cast member Kate Walsh deemed Wilson's portrayal of her character [...] "sweet and wonderful", naming her a professional: [...] "She makes you be a better actor, just by being there." [...] She also described her performance during her character's labor as [...] "heart-breaking, tender, powerful and wonderful", noting how she managed to transform the strong character into [...] "a weak woman, struggling to fight the unusual situation". Fellow cast member James Pickens, Jr. described Wilson's portrayal of Miranda Bailey as [...] "a breath of fresh air, literally and figuratively", also noting how the force she delivers is mainly due to the start of her career being in theater. Horton also described the production process of the two-part story arc, which he stated to have been planning {{since the beginning of the}} series. He stated that the plot of the episodes had to [...] "fill the demands of the Super Bowl", which was scheduled to air in the same night: [...] "We really wanted something different and Shonda [...] came up with the idea of this bomb, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> simply outstanding!" [...] Visual effects supervisor Scott Milnex noted how [...] "breaking down the story boards was really the key to getting all the departments to work together". He also assessed that the necessity to use Primacord, an element they had been trying to avoid, for the explosion scene proved excessively dangerous, and was ultimately replaced with wood and clothing material. He described the filming process by emphasizing the transition from mannequin to the real actor: [...] "When we filmed it, there was a moment, a fraction of a second, when we changed the body with the actor." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many criticisms {{leveled against}} Allstate (and other insurers), {{including}} Barardinelli's book, involved {{the use of}} a software program called [...] "Colossus" [...] to process claims.

[...] It also agreed to standardize its use of the software.

2500|$|Despite the {{departure}} of Guns, the group continued and toured in support of Waking the Dead with the lineup, in 2003, consisting of Lewis, Riley, Hamilton, former guitarist Brent Muscat and new guitarist Keri Kelli (formerly of Big Bang Babies and Slash's Snakepit). The group eventually recruited guitarist Stacey Blades, with both Muscat and Kelli departing the group, in 2004 while they also released the cover album, titled Rips the Covers Off, the same year. Commenting on Blades addition to the lineup, Lewis stated that [...] "Stacey really is a virtuoso type of guy and player. It was really fortunate <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> him and that he's another Hollywood guy. I’ve read reviews where they called him a Tracii [...] clone, but he's not. He is definitely his own man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jože Dežman, {{head of the}} Commission, {{said that}} that [...] "this is one of 15 Slovenian Srebrenicas". Slovenian {{pathologist}} Jože Balažic commented: [...] "The scenes <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> there indicate that the victims died in agony. All corpses are covered with lime and based on their body position {{it appears that the}} victims had been moving for a time." [...] Pavel Jamnik from the Slovenian Criminal Police Directorate noted that [...] "some victims were probably still conscious when their executioners scattered lime, that is cracked, which means that they moved. Several skeletons are sticking above the surface of the lime and it is obvious that they tried to pull out in agony". Croatian medical doctors offered their assistance in DNA analysis of the remains, which could potentially be used to identify Croat victims.|$|E

[...] and referred to some unspecified female attendees as [...] "corn-fed, no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, hirsute, somewhat fragrant hippie chick pie wagons". The newspaper declined to print the article citing an editing dispute over [...] "basic weaknesses in clarity and readability <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> unacceptable". An explanatory article by the paper {{went on to say}} [...] "Coulter told the online edition of Editor & Publisher magazine that USA Today doesn't like my [...] "tone", humor, sarcasm, etc., which raises the intriguing question of why they hired me to write for them.'"

2500|$|The {{game was}} first shown on April 10, {{at which time}} the {{controls}} were demonstrated. IGN were impressed; [...] "The pointing function works really well in Scarface. Just like the PC version's mouse control, players now have near pin-point weapon precision {{that makes it easier}} and more intuitive to gun down the opposition with the huge assortment of firepower within the experience. You can still target individuals to tighten up your aim using the Z button on the nunchuk, but because the Wii Remote's pointer already does a great job with its precision it's rare <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> ourselves using it." [...] GameSpot were less impressed; [...] "When you're wielding the chainsaw, its movement will be tied to that of the Wii Remote, and by slashing in different directions and at different heights you'll be able to target enemies' heads, legs, and individual arms. With practice you'll purportedly be able to remove all of the aforementioned extremities before the torso hits the ground, but the associate producer showing us the game on this occasion never managed to pull it off." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 29, 2001, White House {{spokesman}} Scott Stanzel [...] "disputed {{reports that}} the anthrax sent to the Senate contained bentonite, an additive that ha been used in Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's biological weapons program". Stanzel said, [...] "Based on the test results we have, no bentonite has been found". The same day, Major General John Parker at a White House briefing stated, [...] "We do know <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> silica in the samples. Now, we don't know what that motive would be, or why it would be there, or anything. But there is silica in the samples. And that led us to be absolutely sure {{that there was no}} aluminum in the sample, because the combination of a silicate, plus aluminum, is sort of the major ingredients of bentonite." [...] Just over a week later, Homeland Security Advisor Tom Ridge in a White House press conference on November 7, 2001, stated, [...] "The ingredient that we talked about before was silicon." [...] Neither Ross at ABC nor anyone else publicly pursued any further claims about bentonite, despite Ross's original claim that [...] "four well-placed and separate sources" [...] had confirmed its detection.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Ishmael cited [...] {{as one of}} ten a fortiori (kal va-chomer) {{arguments}} {{recorded in}} the Hebrew Bible: (1) In [...] Joseph's brothers told Joseph, [...] "Behold, the money <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> in our sacks' mouths we brought back to you," [...] and they thus reasoned, [...] "how then should we steal?" [...] (2) In [...] Moses told God, [...] "Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me," [...] and reasoned that surely all the more, [...] "How then shall Pharaoh hear me?" [...] (3) In [...] Moses said to the Israelites, [...] "Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against the Lord," [...] and reasoned that it would follow, [...] "And how much more after my death?" [...] (4) In [...] "the Lord said to Moses: ‘If her (Miriam's) father had but spit in her face,'" [...] surely it would stand to reason, [...] "‘Should she not hide in shame seven days?'" [...] (5) In [...] the prophet asked, [...] "If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you," [...] is it not logical to conclude, [...] "Then how can you contend with horses?" [...] (6) In 1 Samuel [...] David's men said to him, [...] "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah," [...] and thus surely it stands to reason, [...] "How much more then {{if we go to}} Keilah?" [...] (7) Also in [...] the prophet asked, [...] "And if in a land of Peace where you are secure" [...] you are overcome, is it not logical to ask, [...] "How will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?"

[...] (9) In [...] "The king said to Esther the queen: ‘The Jews have slain and destroyed 500 men in Shushan the castle,'" [...] and it thus stands to reason, [...] "‘What then have they done {{in the rest of the}} king's provinces?'" [...] (10) In [...] God came to the prophet saying, [...] "Behold, when it was whole, it was usable for no work," [...] and thus surely it is logical to argue, [...] "How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is singed?" ...|$|E
