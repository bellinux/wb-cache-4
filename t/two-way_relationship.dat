40|$|Vegetation, soil, and {{hydrology}} in drylands often collectively exhibit strong ecohydrological interrelationships {{in which}} vegetation both influences and {{is influenced by}} runoff, particularly on sites with more gradual slopes. These <b>two-way</b> <b>relationships</b> {{have important implications for}} ecological restoration of disturbed sites, such as those being reclaimed following mining, yet studies from both ecological and hydrological perspectives specifically evaluating how the strength of ecohydrological interrelationships varies for a range of natural and restored conditions are still missing. We assessed <b>two-way</b> <b>relationships</b> between vegetation and soil hydrological properties by evaluating patterns of both plant community structure and soil hydrological characteristics related to runoff for natural sites and restored sites following mining. At the plot scale, we identified eight ecohydrological units based on interrelationships between vegetation communities and hydrological properties associated with runoff along a progression from source to sink patch types. Similarly, at the hillslope scale, which included patches of different types, we found a correspondence between the proportions of source and sink patches and both vegetation community and hydrological properties. The relative strength of ecohydrological interrelationships in hillslope mosaics decreased with decreasing disturbance except for rilled hillslopes, likely because parts of the hillslope become isolated from the others. Our results highlight, in general, how ecohydrological interrelationships are related with degree of disturbance, and in particular, how rilling alters ecohydrological interrelationships, thereby precluding effective restoration...|$|R

The sea surface net heat flux {{is one of the}} key components of oceanic and atmospheric variables. In this study, to better understand the role of seasonal atmosphere-ocean interactions in the mechanism underlying the North Pacific climate variability, the seasonal correlations among the satellite-derived net heat flux (HFN) in the Kuroshio Extension region, the North Pacific index (NPI), the NINO 3. 4 index representing the El Nino-Southern Oscillation events and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index from January, 1989 to December, 2006 are examined. According to the specified criteria, 8 dominant relations with rapid responses shorter than 6 months are identified together with 6 dominant relations with slow responses longer than 12 months. The <b>two-way</b> <b>relationships</b> in the different seasons except between PDO and NINO 3. 4, are detected, i. e., the HFN and NPI respond to PDO and NINO 3. 4, respectively, but the PDO and NINO 3. 4 respond to HFN and NPI, respectively, in different seasons. Among the 14 relations, the February PDO response to the December NPI before 2 months has the highest correlation, the April NINO 3. 4 response to the December HFN before 4 months has the second highest correlation, and the September PDO response to the June NINO 3. 4 before 3 months has the third highest correlation. The spring NINO 3. 4 is found to delay the NPI by 3 years, while the fall NINO 3. 4 leads the NPI by 2 years.

In particular, they propose that quantitative and qualitative methods are incompatible on an epistemological level; therefore, the two kinds of methods are incompatible. HOWE 1998, argues that a principle implicit in the incompatibilist's argument ‘that abstract paradigms should determine research methods in a one-way fashion—is untenable’. That paradigms must demonstrate their worth in terms of how they inform, and are informed by, research methods that are successfully employed. Given such a <b>two-way</b> <b>relationship</b> between methods and paradigms, paradigms are evaluated in terms of how well they square with the demands of research practice and incompatibilism vanishes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Analyzing multivariate {{datasets}} requires {{users to}} understand distributions of single variables {{and at least}} the <b>two-way</b> <b>relationships</b> between the variables. Lower-dimension projection techniques may assist users in finding interesting combinations. To explore the 2 D relationships in a systematic way, we suggest ranking such relationships according to some measure of interestingness. This approach has been proven valuable for continuous data by Seo and Shneiderman [22]; however, metrics for categorical data are a novel contribution. We propose CateRank a tool for analyzing categorical datasets which visualizes one-dimensional relationships as histograms and uses reoderable matrix described by Siirtola [23] for two-dimensional relationships. CateRank implements several metrics based on the histogram and matrix properties that enable users to discover relationships between the two categorical variables. User controls support filtering to remove extreme and uninteresting values. Index Terms—Categorical data, systematic exploration, ranking, reoderable matrix. ...|$|R

In particular, the empirical analysis aims at disentangling: i) the impact of innovation on the economic performance of firms, in terms of productivity and growth; ii) the reverse casual effect, that is the impact of past economic performance on firms’ innovation activities. The results presented show that the high level of productivity and growth boost innovation. Further, innovation has a positive impact both on growth and productivity. In particular, the higher is the level of innovation expenditure in ICTs, the better is the economic performance of firms in terms of productivity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Accountability is best {{understood}} as a referee of the dynamics in <b>two-way</b> <b>relationships,</b> often between unequal partners. The literature on accountability distinguishes between political, fiscal, administrative, legal and constitutional accountability. This paper focuses on accountability mechanisms {{in health care and}} how they mediate between service providers and communities and between different kinds of health personnel at the primary health care level. It refers to case studies of participatory processes for improving sexual and reproductive health service delivery. Information, dialogue and negotiation are important elements that enable accountability mechanisms to address problems by supporting change and engagement between participants. In order to succeed, however, efforts towards better accountability that broaden the participation of users must take into account the social contexts and the policy and service delivery systems in which they are applied, address power relations and improve the representation of marginalised groups within communities an...|$|R
5000|$|Temper is a {{combination}} of a feeling and a judgment about oneself or others. The feeling is related to one of the two types of temper, fear or anger. The judgment is that one has been wronged by another, or that one has done something wrong. [...] "Fearful temper" [...] arises from thoughts that one has made a mistake (has done something wrong) which in turn causes feelings such as fear, shame and inadequacy. [...] "Angry temper" [...] results from the belief that one has been wronged which in turn creates feelings of indignation and impatience. There is a <b>two-way</b> <b>relationship</b> between temper and symptoms. Symptoms induce emotions such as fear and anger, which in turn induce temper, which increases the intensity of the symptoms.|$|E

More health promotion initiatives and policy-making that collaborate directly with the community to increase meeting their needs, should be implemented.|$|E
50|$|A study {{conducted}} by A. Saks serves as an example to explain engagement of employees in organizations. This study uses one of the tenets of social exchange theory to explain that obligations are generated {{through a series of}} interactions between parties who {{are in a state of}} reciprocal interdependence. The research identified that when individuals receive economic and socioemotional resources from their organization, they feel obliged to respond in kind and repay the organization. This is a description of engagement as a <b>two-way</b> <b>relationship</b> between the employer and employee. One way for individuals to repay their organization is through their level of engagement. The more engaged the employee are to their work, the greater amounts of cognitive, emotional, and physical resources they will devote to perform their job duties. When the organization fails to provide economic or emotional resources, the employees are more likely to withdraw and disengage themselves from their roles.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} <b>two-way</b> <b>relationships</b> between Economic Growth (EG) and Human Development (HD), {{building}} {{on an earlier}} work by Ranis, Stewart, and Ramirez (2000). Here, we show that HD {{is not only a}} product of EG but also an important input to it. The paper develops new empirical strategies to estimate the strength of the two-way chains connecting HD and EG. Building on existing growth literature, we explore the empirical determinants of positive growth trajectories running from HD to EG and find that HD plays an essential role in explaining growth trajectories. Our findings point to the empirical relevance of endogenous growth models in general, and threshold effect models in particular. We also develop a measure of the strength of the EG to HD relationship and explore some of its empirical determinants. A strong sequencing implication of our findings is that HD must be given priority for the achievement of both higher EG as well as HD. Human Development, Economic Growth, Threshold Models...|$|R
40|$|The social {{construction}} of geographical information system (GIS) technology requires <b>two-way</b> <b>relationships</b> between technology and people. GIS technology, like any other technology, {{is more than a}} tool; it connects different social groups in the construction of new localized social arrangements. We examine several instances of how GIS technology involves social negotiation by using a construct of boundary objects developed in a social constructivist framework. Much like geographic boundaries, boundary objects separate different social groups {{at the same time that}} they delineate important points of reference between them. Boundary objects stabilize relationships through the negotiation of flexible and dynamic coherences. The negotiation of differences between different groups is fundamental to the construction of GIS technology. Social-constructivist theories and the concept of boundary objects open new ways to understand the relationships between technology and people. We illustrate the application of boundary object theory through studies of the use of GIS data standards and the definition of wetlands. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{simultaneous}} determination of debt, dividend, and inside ownership policies in Sweden. We apply a simultaneous equation model estimated with 3 SLS. The results reveal a positive <b>two-way</b> causal <b>relationship</b> between debt and dividend polices. We also find a <b>two-way</b> causal <b>relationship</b> between inside ownership and dividend policies, but dividends affect inside ownership in a positive way while inside ownership affects dividends in a negative way. Further, we find a relationship between inside ownership and debt policies, but any causality appears to run from inside ownership to debt in a negative way. This study supports the notion that the convergence of interest and the entrenchment theory are not mutually exclusive. We also show that a SEM estimated with 3 SLS is justified empirically over the OLS and that the difference between using 3 SLS compared to 2 SLS is negligible in our model. ...|$|R
