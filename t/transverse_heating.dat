Seronorm certified human urine reference materials and six realistic samples collected locally were used for the method validation. The urines were diluted ten- or five-fold with 0. 2 % HNO 3. Cd and Pb nitrate solutions were employed as standards. Recoveries of the elements from the urine samples were investigated with the analyte addition method. Compared to the <b>transverse</b> <b>heated</b> graphite atomizer (THGA) with a platform, the THFA provided a significant reduction of spectral background and chemical interferences from the urine matrix, without the use of chemical matrix modifiers, a 1. 5 – 2 times increase of the determination sensitivity and, therefore, a reduction of limits of detection up to 0. 018 and 0. 2 mg L 21 for Cd and Pb, respectively. The use of a THFA collector made from carbon fiber and a tungsten wire improved recoveries of lead and cadmium in urine (¢ 92 %). A sampling temperature 150 uC enabled us to skip the drying period, thus a significantly reduced temperature program was obtained.

40|$|Charged {{particle}} acceleration in the Earth inner magnetosphere {{is believed to}} be mainly due to the local resonant wave-particle interaction or particle transport processes. However, the Van Allen Probes have recently provided interesting evidence of a relatively slow <b>transverse</b> <b>heating</b> of eV ions at distances about 2 - 3 Earth radii during quiet times. Waves that are able to resonantly interact with such very cold ions are generally rare in this region of space, called the plasmasphere. Thus, non-resonant wave-particle interactions are expected {{to play an important role}} in the observed ion heating. We demonstrate that stochastic heating by random transverse electric field fluctuations of whistler (and possibly electromagnetic ion cyclotron) waves could explain this weak and slow <b>transverse</b> <b>heating</b> of H+ and O+ ions in the inner magnetosphere. The essential element of the proposed model of ion heating is the presence of trains of random whistler (hiss) wave packets, with significant amplitude modulations produced by strong wave damping, rapid wave growth, or a superposition of wave packets of different frequencies, phases, and amplitudes. Such characteristics correspond to measured characteristics of hiss waves in this region. Using test particle simulations with typical wave and plasma parameters, we demonstrate that the corresponding stochastic transverse ion heating reaches 0. 07 - 0. 2 eV/h for protons and 0. 007 - 0. 015 eV/h for O+ ions. This global temperature increase of the Maxwellian ion population from an initial Ti approx. 0. 3 eV could potentially explain the observations...|$|E
40|$|Powerful {{incoherent}} laser pulses can propagate {{in focusing}} Kerr media much longer distances than can coherent pulses, {{due to the}} fast phase mixing that prevents transverse filamentation. This distance is limited by 4 -wave scattering, which accumulates waves at small transverse wavenumbers, where phase mixing is too slow to retain the incoherence and thus prevent the filamentation. However, we identify how this theoretical limit can be overcome by countering this accumulation through <b>transverse</b> <b>heating</b> of the pulse by random fluctuations of the refractive index. In these new regimes, the laser pulse propagation distances are significantly extended, making feasible {{a new class of}} random lasers, in particular, ultra-powerful random lasers in plasmas...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} heating of outowing oxygen ions at high {{altitude}} above the polar cap {{using data from}} the Cluster spacecraft. oInospheric plasma may flow up from the ionosphere but at velocities which are low enough that the ions are still gravitationally bound. For the ions to overcome gravity, further acceleration is needed. The cusp/polar cap is an important source of outowing oxygen ions. In the cusp/polar cap, <b>transverse</b> <b>heating</b> is more common than eld-aligned acceleration through a magnetic eld-aligned electric eld. It is thus believed that <b>transverse</b> <b>heating</b> of ions is important for ion outow and one of the probable explanations for <b>transverse</b> <b>heating</b> is wave-particle interaction. A general conclusion from our work on high altitude oxygen ion energization is that ion energization and outow occur in the high altitude cusp and mantle. The particles are often heated perpendicularly to the geomagnetic eld and resonant heating at the gyrofrequency is most of the time intense enough to explain the observed O+ energies measured in the high altitude (8 { 15 Earth radii, RE ) cusp/mantle region of the terrestrial magnetosphere. The observed average waves can explain the observed average O+ energies. At lower altitude only a few percent of the observed spectral density around the oxygen gyrofrequency needs to be in resonance with the ions to obtain the measured O+ energies. A difference as compared to low altitude measurements is that we must assume that almost all wave activity is due to waves which can interact with the ions, and of these we assume 50 % to be left-hand polarized. We also have shown a clear correlation between temperature and wave intensity at the gyrofrequency at each measurement point. We have described the average wave intensity and corresponding velocity diffusion oeffcients as a function of altitude in a format convenient for modelers. Furthermore we have shown that the wave activity observed in this high altitude region is consistent with Alfven waves, and inconsistent with static structures drifting past the spacecraft. We have also shown how large the variability of the observed spectral densities is, and how sporadic the waves typically are. Based on three cases we have found that the regions with enhanced wave activity and increased ion temperature are typically many ion gyro radii in perpendicular extent...|$|E

40|$|The 'bowl-shaped' ion {{distributions}} in {{the high}} altitude auroral region observed by Klumpar et al.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of a high-intensity laser beam {{with a solid}} target generates {{a large number of}} fast electrons with long mean free paths. The study of these fast electrons is still the subject of active research, given their relevance to Tabak's [2] proposed fast-ignition approach to inertial confinement fusion. Conventional methods for simulating this system fall into two categories: kinetic and hybrid codes. Kinetic codes (Vlasov Fokker-Planck (VFP) and Particle in Cell (PIC) codes) provide an almost complete description of the system, but are often computationally expensive. Conventional hybrid codes simulate the fast-electrons well using a PIC code, but simplify the simulation of the background by using a rudimentary fluid model. In this thesis I present a new approach to modelling relativistic electrons propagating through a background plasma. This novel approach includes an improved classical transport description of the background plasma by using the VFP code IMPACT [21]. The fast electrons are modelled in two ways. Firstly, a 1 D crude rigid beam model is used for the fast electrons. This gives rise to interesting transport effects in the background, such as <b>transverse</b> <b>heat</b> flow and non-local transport. It is found that the <b>transverse</b> <b>heat</b> flow is sufficient to reverse the `beam hollowing' effect of Davies et al [74], allowing the reemergence of a fast electron collimating magnetic field over picosecond timescales. The second approach is to couple a PIC code into IMPACT to model the dynamic evolution of the fast electron beam. The scheme is tested against relevant beam-plasma phenomena. The code is used to model fast electron transport in 2 D through a near-solid density background plasma. The significant result from this 2 D investigation is the suppression of the filamentation instability by the resistively collimating field that surrounds the main beam. Imperial Users onl...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of heat along and perpendicular to magnetic fields threading quiescent prominences is discussed.

The exact solution to the one-dimensional parallel heat conduction problem is shown to differ significantly from the approximate solution of Ioshpa (1965). It was suggested that uneven heating of a quiescent prominence by the surrounding solar corona may contribute to surges and/or the 'winking' phenomenon recorded in many quiescent prominences.
