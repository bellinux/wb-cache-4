5|$|In 1950 {{a village}} and ma'abara (immigrant <b>transit</b> <b>camp)</b> called Keren Yesha was {{established}} by the Jewish Agency for Yemeni Jews next to Mishmar HaEmek. It was located atop the hill of Abu Shusha where {{the members of the}} kibbutz first settled in 1926. The kibbutz helped the new community by providing various services. In 1953 the village was abandoned and the residents moved to Midrakh Oz.|$|E
5|$|The station building, {{designed}} by Karel Hendrik van Brederode, {{was completed in}} 1865 and expanded in 1904. Train services started on 1 May 1868 and have since been provided by Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen (1868–1937), Nederlandse Spoorwegen (1938–2000), NoordNed (2000–2005), and Arriva (2005–present). During World War II, 500 Jews were transported from the station via the Westerbork <b>transit</b> <b>camp</b> to Nazi concentration camps, where {{most of them were}} killed.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the passing}} of the Holocaust denial law in 1995, it is illegal to deny or attempt to justify the Holocaust. The act follows the Belgian Anti-Racism Law, passed in 1981, which led to the {{establishment}} of the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism, which researches racism and anti-Semitism in Belgium as well as aiding victims of discrimination. Breendonk and Dossin Barracks (at the site of the former Mechelen <b>transit</b> <b>camp)</b> are preserved as museums to the Holocaust and to German repression in Belgium during the occupation.|$|E

5|$|Ashton Court {{has been}} {{the site of a}} manor house since the 11th century, and has been {{developed}} by a series of owners since then. From the 16th to 20th centuries it was owned by the Smyth family with each generation changing the house. Designs by Humphry Repton were used for the landscaping in the early 19th century. It was used as a military hospital in the First World War. In 1936 it was used as the venue for the Royal Show and, during the Second World War as an army <b>transit</b> <b>camp.</b> In 1946 the last of the Smyth family died and the house fell into disrepair before its purchase in 1959 by Bristol City Council.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War {{the estate}} {{was used as}} a {{military}} hospital, and in the Second World War was requisitioned by the War Office and used in turn as a <b>transit</b> <b>camp,</b> RAF HQ and US Army Command HQ. The estate was the venue for the 1936 Royal Show. One of the exhibition buildings, despite its temporary nature, was an innovative piece of modernist architecture still remembered as the Gane Pavilion. It was designed by Bauhaus architect Marcel Breuer as a show house for the Bristol furniture manufacturer Crofton Gane. For most of the 20th century Ashton Court was the venue for the North Somerset Show, however this is now held in Wraxall.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 4 August 1944, the Achterhuis was stormed {{by a group of}} German uniformed police (Grüne Polizei) led by SS-Oberscharführer Karl Silberbauer of the Sicherheitsdienst. The Franks, van Pelses, and Pfeffer were taken to RSHA headquarters, where they were interrogated and held overnight. On 5 August they were {{transferred}} to the Huis van Bewaring (House of Detention), an overcrowded prison on the Weteringschans. Two days later they were transported to the Westerbork <b>transit</b> <b>camp,</b> through which by that time more than 100,000 Jews, mostly Dutch and German, had passed. Having been arrested in hiding, they were considered criminals and sent to the Punishment Barracks for hard labour.|$|E
50|$|During the 2016 Kashmir unrest, <b>transit</b> <b>camps</b> housing Kashmir Pandits in Kashmir were {{attacked}} by mobs. About 200-300 Kashmiri Pandit employees fled the <b>transit</b> <b>camps</b> in Kashmir during night time on 12 July due to the attacks by protesters on the camps and have held protests against the government for attacks on their camp and demanded that all Kashmiri Pandit employees in Kashmir valley be evacuated immediately. Over 1300 government employees belonging to the community have fled the region during the unrest. Posters threatening the Pandits to leave Kashmir or be killed were put up near <b>transit</b> <b>camps</b> in Pulwama allegedly by the militant organisation Lashkar-e-Islam. There were doubts as to who put up the poster with speculations being raised as to whether other groups had put up the poster using the name of Lashkar-e-Islam.|$|R
5000|$|Berijam has a 100-year-old 2-story brick building, partly {{damaged and}} {{blackened}} over the years, {{with a bright}} yellow painted name reading [...] "Britisher's Transit Camp". This {{is one of several}} <b>transit</b> <b>camps</b> built every 15 km for the soldiers to rest along the 230 km British [...] "Escape Route" [...] from Kodaikanal via Top Station and Munnar to Kochi, built during World War II. While most of the <b>transit</b> <b>camps</b> are now either dilapidated or demolished, the one at Berijam still stands.|$|R
50|$|When {{the mass}} arrest {{of more than}} 13,000 Jews, the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, {{was carried out in}} Paris on 16 July 1942, Léon's parents sent him and his two {{brothers}} into hiding with a neighbour. His parents were arrested; his father was held at Beaune-la-Rolande and <b>Camp</b> of Royallieu <b>transit</b> <b>camps</b> before being deported to Auschwitz concentration camp on 31 July 1942. His mother and two brothers (Henry, 11 and Max, 8) were held at the Pithiviers and Drancy <b>transit</b> <b>camps,</b> and deported to Auschwitz on 19 August 1942.|$|R
5|$|The camp housed about 2,000 inmates when it opened. At {{its peak}} of {{operations}} in 1944, {{a staff of}} 636 guards oversaw 25,000 permanent inmates, and an additional 150,000 people passed through the camp in {{its role as a}} <b>transit</b> <b>camp.</b> Göth personally murdered prisoners on a daily basis. His two dogs, Rolf and Ralf, were trained to tear inmates to death. He shot people from the window of his office if they appeared to be moving too slowly or resting in the yard. He shot to death a Jewish cook because the soup was too hot. He brutally mistreated his two maids, Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig and Helen Hirsch, who were in constant fear for their lives, as were all the inmates.|$|E
5|$|The first convoy from Belgium, {{carrying}} stateless Jews, left Mechelen <b>transit</b> <b>camp</b> for Auschwitz on 4 August 1942 and {{was soon}} followed by others. These trains left for extermination camps in Eastern Europe. Between October 1942 and January 1943, deportations were temporarily halted; by this time 16,600 people have been deported on 17 rail convoys. As the result of Queen Elisabeth's intervention with the German authorities, all of those deported in this first wave were not Belgian citizens. In 1943, the deportations resumed. By the time that deportations to extermination camps had begun, however, nearly 2,250 Belgian Jews had already been deported as forced laborers for , a civil and military engineering group, which {{was working on the}} construction of the Atlantic Wall in Northern France.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, {{the station}} {{building}} was expanded with a porch and additional waiting room. From 1938 to 2000, train services {{were provided by}} the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Netherlands Railways), when the Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen merged with the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij (Hollandic Iron Railroad Company). In 1942, during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, approximately 500 Jews from Winschoten were transported by train to the Westerbork <b>transit</b> <b>camp</b> {{and from there to}} Nazi concentration camps in Germany and Poland, where 446 of them were killed. As a result of the war, the German border at the railway was closed for passenger transport from 1944 to 1954. In 1967, the roofed bus station was built next to the station building. In {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century, the station building's porch was replaced.|$|E
5000|$|The camp in Zamość {{processed}} 31,536 Poles {{according to}} Germany's own records, or 41,000 based on postwar estimates. Dispossessed Polish families {{were sent to}} other <b>transit</b> <b>camps</b> as well including Zwierzyniec in the Zamość County, which processed 20,000-24,000 Poles (12,000 between July and August 1943). <b>Transit</b> <b>camps</b> existed in Budzyń, Frampol, Lublin (on Krochmalna street), Stary Majdan, Biłgoraj County, Tarnogród, Wola Derezieńska, Old Wedan, Biłgoraj and also in Puszcza Solska. Race selections based on forcible abduction of children from their parents were conducted in all of them. The term [...] "Children of Zamojszczyzna" [...] originates from the multitude of those locations.|$|R
5|$|The {{capitulation}} {{agreement between}} the Home Army and German forces stipulated that insurgents were {{to be treated as}} regular prisoners of war. The city's civilians were to be transferred to <b>transit</b> <b>camps</b> and afterward released.|$|R

5|$|The {{battalion}} headquarters {{was opened}} at Darley Camp, near Bacchus Marsh, and by 8 October 1941, a nucleus of officers and senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs), {{many of whom}} had experience from World War I, had prepared the battalion for the arrival of the soldiers or other ranks (ORs) that would bring it up to its required establishment. On 10 October 1941, the first draft of nine officers and 523 men from the 3rd Infantry Division assembled at Caulfield Racecourse <b>Transit</b> <b>Camp</b> and were transported by rail to Darley Camp. The following day numbers increased further with the arrival of another seven officers and 400 men from the 2nd Cavalry and 4th Infantry Divisions. Later, in June 1942, after it had arrived in New Guinea, the battalion's strength was bolstered with the transfer of 16 officers from the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), including a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel William Owen.|$|E
5|$|After a posting in Prague {{to assist}} in setting up an {{emigration}} office there, Eichmann was transferred to Berlin in October 1939 to command the Central Office for Jewish Emigration for the entire Reich under Heinrich Müller, head of the Gestapo. He was immediately assigned to organise the deportation of 70,000 to 80,000 Jews from Ostrava district in Moravia and Katowice district in the recently annexed portion of Poland. On his own initiative, Eichmann also laid plans to deport Jews from Vienna. Under the Nisko Plan, Eichmann chose Nisko as the location for a new <b>transit</b> <b>camp</b> where Jews would be temporarily housed before being deported elsewhere. In {{the last week of}} October 1939, 4,700 Jews were sent to the area by train and were essentially left to fend for themselves in an open meadow with no water and little food. Barracks were planned but never completed. Many of the deportees were driven by the SS into Soviet-occupied territory and others were eventually placed in a nearby labour camp. The operation soon was called off, partly because Hitler decided the required trains were better used for military purposes for the time being. Meanwhile, as part of Hitler's long-range resettlement plans, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans were being transported into the annexed territories, and ethnic Poles and Jews were being moved further east, particularly into the General Government.|$|E
5|$|In early March 1941, the 2nd New Zealand Division (including Div Cav) was {{earmarked}} for W Force, the British Commonwealth force sent to Greece to bolster its defence against imminent German invasion. The regiment embarked for Greece on 18 March 1941 on the Greek ship Ionia, with its vehicles aboard the cargo ship Anglo-Canadian. The ships arrived at Piraeus on 21 March and the troops {{stayed at the}} <b>transit</b> <b>camp</b> at Kifisia. The regiment advanced northward, reaching its position on the Aliakmon Line near Katerini on 26 March. Its mission was to destroy the Aliakmon River bridges, delaying the German advance. E Troop of the 5th Field Regiment and O Troop of the 7th Anti-Tank Regiment were attached to the regiment. On 4 April, the regiment sent two troops of Marmon-Harrington armoured cars to reinforce the British 1st Armoured Brigade on the Macedonian plain; in exchange, the regiment received seven cruiser tanks. The two troops withdrew with the 1st Armoured Brigade when it retreated on 8 April and reached Perdikkas by the following day. The regiment and E Troop, 5th Field Regiment, were the only units left on the plain between Mount Olympus and the Aliakmon on 8 April. The next day, A Squadron demolished the main bridge across the Aliakmon, after the 1st Armoured Brigade had withdrawn southward.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, Nazi Germany {{occupied}} the Netherlands (1940-1945). The Nazis transported Jewish and other prisoners from the Netherlands via the <b>transit</b> <b>camps</b> Amersfoort and Westerbork to concentration camps such as Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen.|$|R

25|$|During the Nazi occupation, a Romani {{camp was}} built in Salzburg-Maxglan. It was an Arbeitserziehungslager (work 'education' camp), which {{provided}} slave labour to local industry. It also operated as a Zwischenlager (<b>transit</b> <b>camp),</b> holding Roma before their deportation to German extermination camps or ghettos in German-occupied territories in eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Between March and July 1933, 85,937 {{people living}} in Moscow were arrested and {{deported}} because they lacked passports; 4,776 {{people living in}} Leningrad were also deported.

25|$|Zohar {{grew up in}} a ma'abara (<b>transit</b> <b>camp)</b> on {{the border}} of Bat Yam and Jaffa, where the family's {{ramshackle}} hut was not even sufficient to protect them from the elements. Due to the unsavory conditions of the neighborhood, Zohar's father encouraged the children to play football in order to stay off the streets. His family was so poor, that often Zohar would find himself walking back from football practices because he could not afford the bus.|$|E
50|$|The German {{authorities}} also incarcerated {{a number}} of children in concentration <b>camps</b> and <b>transit</b> <b>camps.</b> SS physicians and medical researchers used {{a number of}} children, including twins, in concentration camps for medical experiments that often resulted in the deaths of the children. Concentration camp authorities deployed adolescents, particularly Jewish adolescents, at forced labor in the concentration camps, where many died because of conditions. The German authorities held other children under appalling conditions in <b>transit</b> <b>camps,</b> such as the case of Anne Frank and her sister in Bergen-Belsen, and non-Jewish orphaned children whose parents the German military and police units had killed in so-called anti-partisan operations. Some of these orphans were held temporarily in the Lublin/Majdanek concentration camp and other detention camps.|$|R
