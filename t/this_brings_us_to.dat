60|$|And <b>this</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> a point. Some of {{the master}} minds before mentioned, having {{conceived}} the idea that telegraphic communication might be carried on under water, set about experimenting. Between the years 1839 and 1851 enterprising men in the Old World and the New suggested, pondered, planned, and placed wires under water, along which our Spark ran more or less successfully.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{a second}} {{characteristic}} of philosophical propositions, namely, {{that they must}} be a priori. A philosophical proposition must be such as can be neither proved nor disproved by empirical evidence. Too often we find in philosophical books arguments based upon the course of history, or the convolutions of the brain, or the eyes of shell-fish. Special and accidental facts of this kind are irrelevant to philosophy, which must make only such assertions as would be equally true however the actual world were constituted.|$|E

60|$|In {{these three}} voyages the evident {{purpose is to}} strip off the veil of habit and custom, with which men deceive themselves, and show the crude vices of {{humanity}} as Swift fancies he sees them. In the fourth voyage the merciless satire is carried out to its logical conclusion. <b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{the land of the}} Houyhnhnms, in which horses, superior and intelligent creatures, are the ruling animals. All our interest, however, is centered on the Yahoos, a frightful race, having the form and appearance of men, but living in unspeakable degradation.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> Holbach's {{treatment}} of Morals. The moment {{had come to}} France, which was reached at an earlier period in English speculation, when the negative course of thought in metaphysics drove men to consider the basis of ethics. How were right and wrong to hold their own against the new mechanical conception of the Universe? The same question is again urgent in men's minds, because the Darwinian hypothesis, and the mass of evidence for it, have again given a tremendous shake to theological conceptions, and startled men into {{a sense of the}} precariousness of the official foundations of virtue and duty.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{the point}} of the matter. For if you compare the prodigious diversities in {{education}} and manner of life which reign in the different orders of the civil condition, with the simplicity and uniformity of the savage and animal life, where all find nourishment in the same articles of food, live in the same way, and do exactly the same things, you will easily understand to what degree the difference between man and man must be less in the state of nature than in that of society.[185] Physical inequality is hardly perceived in the state of nature, and its indirect influences there are almost non-existent.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} stated {{objectives}} of the Favela Bairro program was to allow squatter settlements {{to become part of}} the formal city. The focus of the study is to assess how different project solutions in the Favela Bairro program have used urban design tools to achieve this objective. A subsequent question concerns the extent to which urban design factors helped to improve the social integration of the settlements, and specifically to overcome poverty and exclusion conditions. <b>This</b> <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> a another group of problems related to indicators to measure the attainment of these objectives from four perspectives: Spatial, Social, Economical and Political (citizenship and participation) This analysis highlights the major difficulties confronted by the design teams, and allows pinpointing the positive and negative impacts of the interventions on the communities and the cit...|$|R

As {{shown in the}} {{previous}} sections (4) and (5), we can estimate the second-order statistics by averaging the outer products of the compound received signals (22)-(23). <b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> back <b>to</b> the notion of building pre-filters using only second-order statistics. We will now consider extensions of the previous algorithms for the more complex frequency selective channel.|$|R
6000|$|But <b>this</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{our other}} question, namely, how is our {{principle}} {{known to be}} true? Obviously, since it is required to justify induction, it cannot be proved by induction; since it goes beyond the empirical data, it cannot be proved by them alone; since it is required to justify all inferences from empirical data to what goes beyond them, it cannot itself be even rendered in any degree probable by such data. Hence, if it is known, {{it is not known}} by experience, but independently of experience. I do not say that any such principle is known: I only say that it is required to justify the inferences from experience which empiricists allow, and that it cannot itself be justified empirically.[11] ...|$|E
60|$|A {{very common}} causal group {{consists}} of volitions {{and the consequent}} bodily acts, though exceptions arise (for example) through sudden paralysis. Another very frequent connection (though here the exceptions are much more numerous) is between a bodily act and the realisation of the purpose {{which led to the}} act. These connections are patent, whereas the causes of desires are more obscure. Thus it is natural to begin causal series with desires, to suppose that all causes are analogous to desires, and that desires themselves arise spontaneously. Such a view, however, is not one which any serious psychologist would maintain. But <b>this</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the question of the application of our analysis of cause to the problem of free will.|$|E
60|$|And <b>this</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{the period}} {{at which we}} may resume our story. One word we must say as to Caroline. During the winter she had seen her lover repeatedly, and had written to him repeatedly. Their engagement, therefore, had by no means been broken. But their {{meetings}} were cold, and their letters equally so. She would have married him at once now if he would ask her. But he would not ask her. He was quite willing to marry her if she would herself {{say that she was}} willing so far to recede from her former resolution. But she could not bring herself to do this. Each was too proud to make the first concession to the other, and therefore no concession was made by either.|$|E
50|$|The final {{story in}} <b>this</b> miniseries <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> Northern Ireland. Liam, a mutant {{with the ability}} to blow things up, is dragged unwillingly into the turmoil and {{terrorism}} that has disturbed Northern Ireland for many years. Unwilling, Liam resists with all his might, disgusted and loathing of the terrorists who simply want to use his mutant powers to better their own position.|$|R
60|$|THE day {{returns and}} <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> the petty round of irritating {{concerns}} and duties. Help <b>us</b> <b>to</b> play the man, help <b>us</b> <b>to</b> perform them with laughter and kind faces, let cheerfulness abound with industry. Give <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go blithely on our business all <b>this</b> day, <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> our resting beds weary and content and undishonoured, and grant {{us in the}} end the gift of sleep.|$|R
60|$|The {{instinct}} {{with which}} our bore finds out another bore, and closes with him, is amazing. We {{have seen him}} pick his man out of fifty men, {{in a couple of}} minutes. They love to go (which they do naturally) into a slow argument on a previously exhausted subject, and to contradict each other, and to wear the hearers out, without impairing their own perennial freshness as bores. It improves the good understanding between them, and they get together afterwards, and bore each other amicably. Whenever we see our bore behind a door with another bore, we know that when he comes forth, he will praise the other bore {{as one of the most}} intelligent men he ever met. And <b>this</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the close of what we had to say about our bore, we are anxious to have it understood that he never bestowed this praise on us.|$|R
6000|$|Rule I.--It is {{not good}} form to climb onto the table. There is no doubt a great temptation to this. When you are {{struggling}} with a duck, and he wobbles over just as {{you think you have}} him, you forget yourself. The common plan is not to leap upon the table all at once. This is the more usual process: The carver begins to carve sitting. By-and-by he is on his feet, and his brow is contracted. His face approaches the fowl, {{as if he wanted to}} inquire within about everything except that the duck is reluctant to yield any of its portions. One of his feet climbs onto his chair, then the other. His knees are now resting against the table, and, in his excitement, he, so to speak, flings himself upon the fowl. <b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> ...|$|E
60|$|The expedition, however, was unsuccessful, as most {{commercial}} expedients {{are prone}} to be, where the dull patronage of government is counted upon to outvie the keen activity of private enterprise. What government failed to effect, however, with all its patronage and all its agents, was at length {{brought about by the}} enterprise and perseverance of a single merchant, one of its adopted citizens; and <b>this</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> speak of the individual whose enterprise is the especial subject of the following pages; a man whose name and character are worthy of being enrolled in the history of commerce, as illustrating its noblest aims and soundest maxims. A few brief anecdotes of his early life, and of the circumstances which first determined him to the branch of commerce of which we are treating, cannot be but interesting.|$|E
6000|$|If we {{have been}} right in our {{analysis}} of mind, the ultimate data of psychology are only sensations and images and their relations. Beliefs, desires, volitions, and so on, appeared to us to be complex phenomena consisting of sensations and images variously interrelated. Thus (apart from certain relations) the occurrences which seem most distinctively mental, and furthest removed from physics, are, like physical objects, constructed or inferred, {{not part of the}} original stock of data in the perfected science. From both ends, therefore, the difference between physical and psychological data is diminished. Is there ultimately no difference, or do images remain as irreducibly and exclusively psychological? In view of the causal definition of the difference between images and sensations, <b>this</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> a new question, namely: Are the causal laws of psychology different from those of any other science, or are they really physiological? ...|$|E
5000|$|The Superintendent of the L.A. County Office of Education {{said about}} MOSAIC: “This is not {{something}} where I call you in and give you the third degree. I give myself the third degree because parents want to know why. It just can't be, ‘I don't like your child, I don't like what he does, and I can't explain why.’ <b>This</b> is <b>bringing</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> a higher level." ...|$|R
60|$|This answer {{shows that}} {{physiology}} {{can account for}} our perception of motion. But physiology, in speaking of stimulus and sense-organs and a physical motion distinct from the immediate object of sense, is assuming the truth of physics, and is thus only capable of showing the physical account to be possible, not of showing it to be necessary. <b>This</b> consideration <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the psychological answer.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> back <b>to</b> step 1: measure consumption. One of the {{specificities}} of M&T {{is that it}} is {{an ongoing}} process, requiring constant feedback in order to consistently improve performance. Once the targets are set and the desired measures are implemented, repeating the procedure from the start ensures that the managers are aware of {{the success or failure of}} the measures, and can then decide on further action.|$|R
60|$|The {{first step}} in this {{direction}} is to arrange scientific method and positive knowledge in order, and <b>this</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> another cardinal element in the Comtist system, the classification of the sciences. In {{the front of the}} inquiry lies one main division, that, namely, between speculative and practical knowledge. With the latter we have no concern. Speculative or theoretic knowledge is divided into abstract and concrete. The former is concerned with the laws that regulate phenomena in all conceivable cases; the latter is concerned with the application of these laws. Concrete science relates to objects or beings; abstract science to events. The former is particular or descriptive; the latter is general. Thus, physiology is an abstract science; but zoology is concrete. Chemistry is abstract; mineralogy is concrete. It is the method and knowledge of the abstract sciences that the Positive Philosophy has to reorganise in a great whole.|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} the case of another no less momentous relationship, and the kind of compromise in the matter of religious conformity which it justifies or imposes. It constantly happens that the husband has wholly ceased to believe the religion to which his wife clings with unshaken faith. We need not enter into the causes why women remain in bondage to opinions which so many cultivated men either reject or else hold in a transcendental and non-natural sense. The only question with which we are concerned is the amount of free assertion of his own convictions which a man should claim and practise, when he knows that such convictions are distasteful to his wife. Is it lawful, as it seems to be in dealing with parents, to hold his conviction silently? Is it lawful either positively or by implication to lead his wife to suppose that he shares her opinions, when in truth he rejects them? ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>this</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the {{ultimate}} {{analysis of this}} singular influence that has prevented doctrinal demands by the English people. There are, I believe, some who still deny that England is governed by an oligarchy. It is quite {{enough for me to}} know that a man might have gone to sleep some thirty years ago over the day's newspaper and woke up last week over the later newspaper, and fancied he was reading about the same people. In one paper he would have found a Lord Robert Cecil, a Mr. Gladstone, a Mr. Lyttleton, a Churchill, a Chamberlain, a Trevelyan, an Acland. In the other paper he would find a Lord Robert Cecil, a Mr. Gladstone, a Mr. Lyttleton, a Churchill, a Chamberlain, a Trevelyan, an Acland. If this is not being governed by families I cannot imagine what it is. I suppose it is being governed by extraordinary democratic coincidences.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{argue about}} a {{conceptual}} approach to quantum formalism.

30|$|Using the {{iterative}} algorithm above, in 2011, Moudafi [9] also {{obtained a}} weak convergence theorem for the split commonfixed point problem of quasi-nonexpansive mappings in Hilbert spaces. After that, someauthors also proposed some iterative algorithms to approximate a split common fixedpoint of other nonlinear mappings, such as nonspreading type mappings [16], asymptotically quasi-nonexpansive mappings[12], κ-asymptoticallystrictly pseudononspreading mappings [17],asymptotically strictly pseudocontraction mappings [18]etc., {{but they just}} obtained weak convergence theoremswhen those mappings do not have semi-compactness. <b>This</b> naturally <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> thefollowing question.|$|R
