5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances are stronger <b>than</b> swords, swords are stronger <b>than</b> axes, and axes are stronger <b>than</b> lances. In magic, fire is stronger <b>than</b> wind, wind is stronger <b>than</b> thunder, and thunder is stronger <b>than</b> fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes are stronger <b>than</b> axes and bows, axes and bows were stronger <b>than</b> lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken are stronger <b>than</b> swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|E
5|$|About 12% of {{children}} are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools. Just over 2% {{of children}} are homeschooled. The U.S. spends more on education per student <b>than</b> any nation in the world, spending more <b>than</b> $11,000 per elementary student in 2010 and more <b>than</b> $12,000 per high school student. Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.|$|E
5|$|Air {{transport}} particularly favors light, {{expensive and}} small products: electronic media rather <b>than</b> books, for example, and refined drugs rather <b>than</b> bulk food.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} canal {{system remains}} from the Industrial Revolution, {{with the city}} having more miles of canal <b>than</b> Venice, although because Birmingham is much larger <b>than</b> Venice the canals are less of a prominent feature <b>than</b> they are in Venice. Nowadays the canals are mainly used for leisure purposes, and canalside regeneration schemes such as Brindleyplace have turned the canals into tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|And if an RNA {{structure}} is tertiary rather <b>than</b> bi-secondary (that is, if it requires more <b>than</b> two pages in its diagram), then determining the page number is again NP-hard.|$|E
5|$|As Asian populations develop {{negative}} {{health consequences}} {{at a lower}} BMI <b>than</b> Caucasians, some nations have redefined obesity; Japan have defined obesity as any BMI greater <b>than</b> 25kg/m2 while China uses a BMI of greater <b>than</b> 28kg/m2.|$|E
5|$|As {{for public}} {{expenditures}} on higher education, the U.S. trails some other OECD nations but spends more per student <b>than</b> the OECD average, and more <b>than</b> all nations in combined {{public and private}} spending. , student loan debt exceeded one trillion dollars, more <b>than</b> Americans owe on credit cards.|$|E
5|$|Because the Von der Tann was {{designed}} {{to fight in the}} battle line, her armor was much thicker <b>than</b> that of the British battlecruisers. Von der Tann weighed over 2,000tonnes more <b>than</b> the , and used 10% more of her weight for armor <b>than</b> the battlecruisers she faced at the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{can live}} for more <b>than</b> 40 years. Females typically live 5-10 years longer <b>than</b> males, with some females exceeding 60 years. This extreme age is rare and less <b>than</b> 2% of all Bottlenose dolphins will live longer <b>than</b> 60 years. Bottlenose Dolphin can jump at {{a height of}} 6 meters (20 feet) up in the air; they use this to communicate with one another.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower <b>than</b> those to chlorine but higher <b>than</b> those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent <b>than</b> chlorine but a stronger one <b>than</b> iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states <b>than</b> iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination. Bromine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Br bonds.|$|E

5|$|Coma Berenices is not {{particularly}} bright, as none of its stars are brighter <b>than</b> fourth magnitude, although there are 66 stars brighter <b>than</b> or equal to apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E
5|$|Compile-time {{performance}} is generally worse in aspect weavers <b>than</b> their traditional compiler counterparts {{due to the}} additional work necessary for locating methods which match the specified pointcuts. A study done showed that the AspectJ compiler ajc is about 34% slower <b>than</b> the Sun Microsystems Java 1.3 compiler and about 62% slower <b>than</b> the Java 1.4 compiler.|$|E
5|$|Confederate Naval Caps {{were made}} of steel gray cloth. They {{were not to be}} less <b>than</b> three inches and a half, nor more <b>than</b> four inches in height.

5|$|Controversies during {{construction}} involved escalating costs and delays; both the pavilion and park opened {{four years later}} <b>than</b> originally planned and cost millions of dollars more <b>than</b> expected.|$|E
5|$|Damping {{occurs at}} two {{different}} scales, {{with the process}} working more quickly over short ranges <b>than</b> over longer distances. Here, a short length {{is one that is}} lower <b>than</b> the mean free path of the photons. A long distance is one that is greater <b>than</b> the mean free path, if still less <b>than</b> the diffusion length. On the smaller scale, perturbations are damped almost instantaneously. On the larger scale, anisotropies are decreased more slowly, with significant degradation happening within one unit of Hubble time.|$|E
5|$|During 2014 Edinburgh Trams lost almost £450,000, {{though this}} was less <b>than</b> {{expected}} due to higher <b>than</b> predicted passenger numbers. In 2015 losses were down to £24,922.|$|E
5|$|During Chaffee's Navy service he logged more <b>than</b> 2,300 hours flying time, {{including}} more <b>than</b> 2,000 hours in jet aircraft. On February 1, 1966, {{he was promoted}} to lieutenant commander.|$|E
5|$|During El Niño events, {{winter and}} early spring {{temperatures}} are cooler <b>than</b> average with above average precipitation {{in the central}} and eastern {{parts of the state}} and drier weather in the western part.

5|$|During World War I many Shetlanders {{served in}} the Gordon Highlanders, a further 3,000 {{served in the}} Merchant Navy, and more <b>than</b> 1,500 in a special local naval reserve. The 10th Cruiser Squadron was {{stationed}} at Swarbacks Minn (the stretch of water {{to the south of}} Muckle Roe), and during a single year from March 1917 more <b>than</b> 4,500 ships sailed from Lerwick as part of an escorted convoy system. In total, Shetland lost more <b>than</b> 500 men, a higher proportion <b>than</b> any other part of Britain, and there were further waves of emigration in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Early {{forecasts}} remarked {{the potential}} {{to be more of a}} threat to Hawaii <b>than</b> Pauline because Rick was further south <b>than</b> Pauline and thus less likely to weaken since Rick was over of warmer sea surface temperatures <b>than</b> Pauline. It did indeed approached the islands, coming close enough to require a high surf advisory. Even though Rick's intensity was much greater <b>than</b> Pauline's, Hurricane Pauline re-curved sooner <b>than</b> Rick. While the surf did rise somewhat, the waves were significantly lower <b>than</b> the heights experienced during Pauline. The U.S. Coast Guard received a report of an overdue sailing vessel en route to the Hawaiian Island group. However, it is unknown if Pauline or Rick affected the boat's course.|$|E
5|$|FIU {{currently}} has over 180,000 alumni {{around the world}} in more <b>than</b> 30 countries.

Biofuels provide 1.8% of the world's transport fuel and recent estimates indicate a continued high growth. The main producing countries for transport biofuels are the USA, Brazil, and the EU.|$|E
5|$|Historically, storms of such {{magnitude}} {{and with such}} high wind velocities have not lasted more <b>than</b> four or five hours. The Great Lakes storm, however, raged for more <b>than</b> 16hours, with an average speed of 60mph (100km/h), and frequent bursts of more <b>than</b> 70mph (110km/h).

5|$|In 2013, a {{study by}} Ragna Redelstorff e.a. {{concluded}} that the bone histology of Kentrosaurus indicated {{that it had a}} higher growth rate <b>than</b> reported for Stegosaurus and Scutellosaurus, in view of the relatively rapid deposition of highly vascularised fibrolamellar bone. As Stegosaurus was larger <b>than</b> Kentrosaurus, this contradicts the general rule that larger dinosaurs grew quicker <b>than</b> smaller ones.|$|E
