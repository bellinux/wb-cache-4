40|$|This thesis investigates value {{co-creation}} {{within the}} context of the Australian international <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> <b>service.</b> Value co-creation is an emerging area of interest in services marketing and one that is germane to the increasingly important international <b>service</b> sector, <b>tertiary</b> <b>education.</b> In Australia, the international <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> sector is one of the country’s top exports, valued at approximately $ 18 billion. However, the Australian international <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> sector is facing a number of challenges, impacting its future viability and global competitiveness. Aggressive international student recruiting from competitors, a strong Australian dollar, poor visa practices, crime involving international students and changing student expectations, are present challenges faced by the sector. To effectively address these challenges, a rethink of the strategic approach of the Australian international <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> sector is required. As such, this thesis aims to provide a new perspective in marketing international education—value co-creation via community engagement—as a potential catalyst to help sustain the viability of the Australian international <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> sector over time.

40|$|On the one hand, {{trade in}} {{tertiary}} education is highly regulated; {{on the other}} hand, it is a considerably liberalized area of services. This {{is especially true in}} the case of Mode 3 of international services trade, namely oversea campuses. In the case of Japan, foreign universities are/were free to open campuses in Japan to supply <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> <b>services,</b> but those were regarded informal education that was not recognized by the Japanese government until 2004. For campuses in Japan established by foreign universities to supply formal education services in Japan, they are required to satisfy the criteria set by the government to be examined by the University Council and the Minister; but no foreign university campus in Japan actually obtained a formal school status. Moreover, program at the campuses in Japan were not regarded as an equivalent to the program provided at the home campuses abroad. It was only in 2004 when the Japanese government introduced a new scheme called "Japanese Branches of Foreign Universities", under which they can receive the treatment similar to formal Japanese universities except taxation, though only four campuses obtained this status so far. This paper reviews the development of regulatory status of services trade in <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> <b>services,</b> especially education through oversea campuses, and considers the policy implications on two critical issues regarding the regulation of services industry: (i) who {{between the government and the}} University Council the regulator is; and (ii) who between the home country and host country has the jurisdiction over the oversea branches of universities...|$|E

25|$|A {{compulsory}} {{introductory course}} to Swedish for all pupils in primary education {{was introduced in}} the 1960s as a part of modernization of the primary education system, where the nine-year school (peruskoulu, grundskola) was made universally compulsory. Until then there had been mandatory courses only in secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>education.</b> Administrative <b>services</b> have, {{since the end of the}} 19th century, been offered in both domestic languages; therefore, theoretically employees should be proficient in both Finnish and Swedish. The reform was to some extent based on a political ambition to strengthen the ties with the Western world through Scandinavia, and to show that Finland was still a part of the Nordic countries, and not an Eastern Bloc country. It also sought to improve social mobility by ensuring that a decision on language in the early school years would not become an obstacle for applicants to the civil service.|$|R
40|$|Cross-border <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> has {{received}} growing attention {{in recent years}} as more and more students choose to study abroad, enrol in foreign educational programmes and institutions in their home country, or simply use the Internet to take courses at colleges or universities in other countries. This trend has led governments and education stakeholders to reconsider many aspects of their <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> systems and strategies. While many countries focus on the possible benefits of exporting <b>education</b> <b>services,</b> they often overlook the potential benefits of importing such services as a complement to existing domestic <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> offerings; importation of <b>education</b> <b>services</b> can help strengthen or accelerate national development goals. An import strategy for <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> considers the use of foreign <b>education</b> <b>services,</b> and encourages the outward mobility of domestic students and scholars or the inward mobility of foreign educational programmes and institutions. Governments are often ill-prepared to reap the benefits of cross-border <b>tertiary</b> <b>education,</b> as well as to assure education quality. In 2002, in Constructing Knowledge Societies: New Challenges for <b>Tertiary</b> <b>Education,</b> the World Bank analysed how <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> contributes to building up a country’s capacity for participation in an increasingly knowledge-based world economy and outlined policy options for <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> that have the potential to enhance economic growth and reduce poverty. Since 2001, the OECD has been examining the internationalisation of <b>tertiary</b> <b>education,</b> including trade in such educational services.

40|$|Objectives: This paper {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> eligibility on crime in Sweden. The hypothesis tested is that continuing to higher education decreases crime rates since it allows young people to escape inactivity and idleness, which are known to trigger crime. However, to qualify for <b>tertiary</b> <b>education,</b> individuals have to meet the eligibility requirements in upper-secondary school. <b>Tertiary</b> <b>education</b> eligibility may therefore affect crime rates. Methods: This paper uses a panel data set of 287 Swedish municipalities over the period 1998 – 2010 to estimate the <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> eligibility effect on crime. However, estimating educational effects on crime is challenging, because investment in education is an endogenous decision. In Sweden, substantial grade inflation, increased <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> eligibility by more than 6 % points between 1998 and 2003. Thus, since the eligibility increase is exogenous to the educational achievements of a student cohort, i. e. not accompanied by a corresponding knowledge increase, {{we can use the}} increase to identify the effect of <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> eligibility on crime. Results: It is found that increasing the <b>tertiary</b> <b>education</b> eligibility rate decreases both property and violent crime substantially. Conclusions: The results show that when young people have the opportunity to attend <b>tertiary</b> <b>education,</b> and thus escape unemployment or inactivity, their propensity to commit crime decreases...|$|R
