Applewhite and Nettles told their followers {{that they would be}} visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to believe that their bodies were <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement, and American popular culture.|$|E

500|$|Two large lakes, called meres, {{were formed}} {{alongside}} the castle by damming a local stream. <b>The</b> southern <b>mere,</b> still visible today, had {{its origins in}} a smaller, natural lake; once dammed, it covered [...] and had an island with a dovecote built on it. <b>The</b> <b>meres</b> were used for fishing {{as well as for}} boating, and would have had extensive aesthetic appeal. It is uncertain exactly when <b>the</b> <b>meres</b> were first built. One theory suggests that <b>the</b> <b>meres</b> were built in the early 13th century, although there is no documentary record of them at least until the 1380s. Another theory is that they were formed {{in the first half of}} the 14th century, at around the same time as the Lower Court was constructed. A third possibility is that it was the Howard family who introduced <b>the</b> <b>meres</b> in <b>the</b> late 15th century as part of their modernisation of the castle.|$|R

The large cutting {{tools of the}} Acheulian technocomplex become smaller, as more complex tools are better suited towards the needs of highly diversified environments. Composite tools represent {{a new level of}} innovation in their increased efficacy and more complex manufacturing process. The ability to conceptualize beyond <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> reduction of stone cores demonstrates cognitive flexibility, and the use of glue, which was often processed with ochre, to attach flakes to hafts demonstrates an understanding of chemical changes that can be utilized beyond the simple use of color. Adhesives were used to construct hafted tools by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|E

5|$|The {{opinion that}} Eclogue 4 was a {{reference}} to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the early Church, however. St. Jerome, an early Church writer noted for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil could not have been a Christian prophet without having accepted Christ, and claimed that anyone that had accepted that Virgil was a pre-Christian prophet was being childish. Classicist Ella Bourne, however, noted that <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> fact that St. Jerome responded to the idea {{is a testament to the}} belief's pervasiveness.|$|E

5|$|Alexios was {{replaced}} as commander by John Tarchaneiotes, first cousin of Andronikos II, and {{disappeared from the}} scene for 30 years. His successors proved greatly inferior, and by 1323, Byzantine possessions in Asia had been greatly reduced. At that point, Patriarch Jesaias urged Andronikos to recall the aged general. A desperate Andronikos agreed and pardoned Alexios in 1324. Alexios was tasked with relieving the isolated exclave of Philadelphia, which had been long under siege {{and was ready to}} fall. He was given no army, but, according to the Byzantine chroniclers, <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> news of Alexios's approach, and the respect in which the Turks held him, was enough for the siege to be lifted. Alexios was appointed governor of the city, a position he retained until 1327.|$|E
5|$|Although Captain Edward Edwards {{discovered}} the atoll in 1791, Ducie {{was not considered}} a British possession. In 1867 Ducie was claimed by the United States under the Guano Islands Act, which established that an uninhabited territory with guano deposits could be claimed as a US possession, {{so long as it}} was unclaimed by any other country. Despite claims on several other territories, based on various documents such as the Guano Islands Act, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom recognised the sovereignty claimed by each other. Neither of the two considered that <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> discovery of an island was sufficient to claim sovereignty over it, and often a formal act of possession was considered the proper procedure to claim rights over a territory. Ultimately, the United States did not assert its sovereignty over most of its claimed territories.|$|E

Five of <b>the</b> <b>meres</b> showed strong evidence for nitrogen limitation, while two meres showed strong evidence of phosphorus limitation. A number of <b>the</b> <b>meres</b> showed temporal variation in nutrient limitation and were not clearly limited by a single nutrient.

The treaty promoted development of an Anglo-American alliance; its completion was Taylor's last action as president.|$|E
5|$|By late 1585, {{although}} Ernst's {{brother had}} made significant inroads into the Electorate of Cologne, both sides had reached an impasse. Sizable {{portions of the}} population subscribed to the Calvinist doctrine; to support them, Calvinist Switzerland and Strassburg furnished {{a steady stream of}} theologians, jurists, books and ideas. The Calvinist barons and counts understood the danger of Spanish intervention: it meant the aggressive introduction of the Counter-Reformation in their territories. France, in the person of Henry III, was equally interested, since the encirclement of his Kingdom by Habsburgs was cause for concern. Another sizable portion of the electorate's populace adhered to the old faith, supported by Wittelsbach-funded Jesuits. The supporters of both sides committed atrocities of their own: in the city of Cologne, <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> rumor of Gebhard's approaching army caused rioters to murder several people suspected of sympathizing with the Protestant cause.|$|E
