5000|$|His {{business}} flourished, producing <b>town</b> <b>plans,</b> atlases, wall <b>maps,</b> {{and more}} than 600 sheet maps. He made maps of places in Europe and North America, including New Spain, places fortified by Vauban, the Low Countries, and the War of the Spanish Succession. In 1698, de Fer published a map of North America, which included a depiction of beavers building dams near Niagara Falls. Seventeen years later, Herman Moll published a map which plagiarized elements of de Fer's work, particularly the beaver scene. It {{became known as the}} [...] "Beaver map". De Fer became the official geographer for His Catholic Majesty in 1720. Two of his sons-in-law, Guillaume Danet and Jaques-François Bénard, continued the company after de Fer's death on 25 October of that year until around 1760.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The city {{development}} of Germany follows three main directions, which {{are influenced by}} the demographical development. Conversion of industrial, military and non used train track areas to housing and service centres, the economical concentration and more densely built up inner cities are named as new urbanity. Climatologically speaking this development leads to an increase of heat island, air pollution and a reduced ventilation of the cities. At the example of Kassel {{it can be seen that}} this development has positive and negative factors. Urban climate studies can be used to support ideas of architects and planners without destroying thermal and air quality comfort. Especially the importance of open spaces and the thermal conditions there are taken as example to create a climatologically approved urban design. From the definition of an ideal urban climate the different planning levels and climatic scales are combined. Key words: urban climate, <b>town</b> <b>planning,</b> climate <b>maps.</b> Àííîòàöèÿ: Ïîä âëèÿíèåì äåìîãðàôè÷åñêîãî ðîñòà, ðàçâèòèå ãîðîäîâ Ãåðìàíèè ïðîèñõîäèò â òðåõ îñíîâíûõ íàïðàâëåíèÿõ: ïåðåïëàíèðîâêà ïðîìûøëåííûõ çîí, òåððèòîðèé âîåííûõ îáúåêòîâ è íåèñïîëüçóåìûõ æåëåçíîäîðîæíûõ ïóòåé â ðàéîíû æèëîé çàñòðîéêè è öåíòðû îáñëóæèâàíèÿ; ýêî-íîìè÷åñêàÿ êîíöåíòðàöèÿ; óïëîòíåíèå ãîðîäñêîé çàñòðîéêè.

Monitoring provides the planners and decision- makers with required information about the current state of development and the nature of changes that have occurred. The study on development of urban lands and the changes in the surface water resources in and around Tiruchirapalli town, Tamil Nadu has been monitored by using IRS- 1 C PAN (1 : 25, 000; 1997), IRS- 1 A LISS-II (1 : 50, 000; 1989) satellite data, Aerial Photos (NRSA, 1 : 20, 000; 1979), the <b>Town</b> and Country <b>Planning</b> <b>map</b> (1980) and Survey of India Toposheets (1971 and 1928) with limited field checks.
