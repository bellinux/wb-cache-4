When cattle are taken off <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> rich grass and shipped to a feedlot to be fattened on <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> deficient grain, they begin losing their store of this beneficial fat. Each day that an animal spends in the feedlot, the amount of <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in its meat is diminished.|$|R
50|$|<b>Omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are {{important}} for normal metabolism. Mammals are unable to synthesize <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> but can obtain the shorter-chain <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> ALA (18 carbons and 3 double bonds) through diet {{and use it to}} form the more important long-chain <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> EPA (20 carbons and 5 double bonds) and then from EPA, the most crucial, DHA (22 carbons and 6 double bonds). The ability to make the longer-chain <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> from ALA may be impaired in aging.

50|$|<b>Omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> {{supplements}} {{from plants}} or fish sources {{do not appear}} to benefit or harm people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. It is unclear if taking <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> supplements can improve other types of dementia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> {{may also}} be used as a {{treatment}} for bipolar disorder, particularly as a supplement to medication. An initial clinical trial by Stoll et al. produced positive results. However, since 1999 attempts to confirm this finding of beneficial effects of <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in several larger double-blind clinical trials have produced inconclusive results. It was hypothesized that the therapeutic ingredient in <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> preparations is eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and that supplements should be high in this compound to be beneficial. A 2008 Cochrane systematic review found limited evidence to support the use of <b>Omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> to improve depression but not mania as an adjunct treatment for bipolar disorder.|$|R
50|$|While {{fish oil}} has become {{famous for its}} <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> content, fish don't {{actually}} produce omega-3s, instead accumulating their omega-3 reserves by consuming microalgae. These <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> can be obtained in the human diet directly from the microalgae that produce them.|$|R
50|$|As a {{percentage}} of total fat, flaxseeds contain 54% <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (mostly ALA), 18% omega-9 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (oleic acid), and 6% omega-6 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (linoleic acid); the seeds contain 9% saturated fat, including 5% as palmitic acid.

50|$|Some {{research}} suggests that the anti-inflammatory activity of long-chain <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> may translate into clinical effects.

5000|$|<b>Omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> [...] <b>Omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are {{a family}} of {{polyunsaturated}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> This {{is one of the}} two Essential <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> so called because humans cannot manufacture it and must get it from food. <b>Omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are mostly obtained from oily fish caught in high-latitude waters. They are comparatively uncommon in vegetable sources, including margarine. However, one type of <b>Omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA) can be found in some vegetable oils. Flax oil contains 30-50% of ALA, and is becoming a popular dietary supplement to rival fish oils; both are often added to premium margarines. An ancient oil plant, camelina sativa, has recently gained popularity because of its high Omega-3 content (30-45%), and it has been added to some margarines. Hemp oil contains about 20% ALA. Small amounts of ALA are found in vegetable oils such as soybean oil (7%), rapeseed oil (7%) and wheat germ oil (5%).|$|R

Several clinical trials suggest that <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> supplementation does not have significant effects in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease—which in turn may suggest that the protective benefits of <b>omega-3</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> supplementation could depend on the scope of the disease and other confounding factors. [...] A diet that is rich in antioxidants will also help get rid of free radicals in your body, which could be a cause for Alzheimer's. The buildup of Beta Amyloid plaques, a marker highly associated with Alzheimer's disease, generates cell damaging free radicals. Therefore, the role of antioxidants as protectants against Alzheimer's disease has become a hot topic of study. Simple dietary modification, towards fewer highly processed carbohydrates and relatively more fats ad cholesterol, is likely a protective measure against Alzheimer's disease.|$|R
