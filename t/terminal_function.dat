The <b>terminal</b> cost <b>function</b> is constructed on a predefined partition by solving a linear program for a given piecewise affine system, a stabilizing piecewise affine controller, an invariant set and a piecewise convex stage cost <b>function.</b> The constructed <b>terminal</b> cost <b>function</b> satisfies the sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability if it is used in an MPC scheme. In general, the constructed <b>terminal</b> cost <b>function</b> will be nonconvex.

5000|$|When an axon is severed, {{the segment}} of the axon distal to the cut degenerates and is absorbed by Schwann cells. The {{proximal}} segment fuses, retracts, and swells, forming a [...] "retraction bulb". The synaptic <b>terminal</b> <b>function</b> is lost, as axoplasmic transport ceases and no neurotransmitters are created. The nucleus of the damaged axon undergoes chromatolysis in preparation for axon regeneration. Schwann cells in the distal stump of the nerve and basal lamina components secreted by Schwann cells guide and help stimulate regeneration. The regenerating axon must connect to the appropriate receptors to make an effective regeneration. If proper connections to the appropriate receptors are not established, aberrant reinnervation may occur. If the regenerating axon is halted by damaged tissue, neurofibrils may create a mass known as a neuroma.|$|E
50|$|Cyclin G-associated kinase is a two domain cystolic protein. The {{domain of}} {{interest}} is the C-terminal domain which consists of three subdomains such as a C-terminal J domain, a clathrin-binding domain, and a tension-like N-terminal domain. The other domain is the N terminal kinase domain which is a functional Ser/Thr protein kinase. The N-terminal kinase domain is able to phosphorylate histone H1. The subdomain tension-like N <b>terminal</b> <b>function</b> has not yet determined, though the domain shares high homology to the tumor suppressant PTEN. The key characteristic is the cysteine group which is required for phosphorylation; however the tension-like N terminal subdomain is absent of some important functional residues that PTEN has. The C-terminal J domain {{is responsible for the}} interaction with Hsc70, which is a molecular chaperone responsible for the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles during endocytosis. The clathrin-binding domain gathers clathrin into baskets. At pH 7 GAK allows Hsc70 to uncoat clathrin baskets and at pH 6 Hsc70 binds clathrin baskets without uncoating clathrin. Without taking into account GAK’s kinase domain, GAK is 43% identical to auxilin, a neuronal cell uncoating clathrin cofactor, in its amino acid composition. GAK is 57% homologous to auxilin if conserved residues are included in the comparison. Though similar domains of these two molecules suggest and have similar functions, the proteins carry these functions out in different manners. GAK initiates the assembly of clathrin baskets stoichiometrically, but at the different pHs it will either bind the Hsc70 to the baskets or induce the Hsc70 to uncoat the clathrin baskets catalytically which is one difference between auxilin and GAK. This catalytic route explains why less GAK than auxilin is needed to carry out a similar function.|$|E

40|$|Dendrimers are hyperbranched and {{monodisperse}} macromolecules, {{generally considered}} as a special class of polymers, but synthesized step-by-step. Most dendrimers have a uniform structure, with a single type of <b>terminal</b> <b>function.</b> However, it is often desirable {{to have at least}} two different functional groups. This review will discuss the case of bifunctional phosphorus-containing dendrimers, and the consequences for their properties. Besides the terminal functions, dendritic structures may have also a function at the core, or linked off-center to the core, or at the core of dendrons (dendritic wedges). Association of two dendrons having different terminal functions leads to Janus dendrimers (two faces). The internal structure can also possess functional groups on one layer, or linked to one layer, or on several layers. Finally, {{there are several ways to}} have two types of terminal functions, besides the case of Janus dendrimers: either each <b>terminal</b> <b>function</b> bears two functions sequentially, or two different functions are linked to each terminal branching point.

40|$|Background: Formation of {{cholesterol}} oxidation products is a suggested mechanism of neurodegenerative disorders. Neuronal cell death is mediated by an increased release of excitotoxic glutamate from the presynaptic nerve endings. Tyrosine-specific protein kinases modulate neurotransmitter release at the nerve terminals. Tyrphostin AG 126 has anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects. However, it remains uncertain whether tyrphostin AG 126 has a preventive {{effect on the}} alteration of nerve <b>terminal</b> <b>function</b> induced by cholesterol oxidation products. Methods: The present study was performed to assess the effect {{of cholesterol}} oxidation products against nerve <b>terminal</b> <b>function</b> using synaptosomes isolated from rat cerebrum. We determined the preventive effect of tyrphostin AG 126 against oxysterol toxicity by measuring the effects on the glutamate release, depolarization of the membrane potential, changes in Ca 2 + levels, and Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Results: Synaptosomes treated with 7 -ketocholesterol or 25 -hydroxycholesterol exhibited a sustained release of glutamate, depolarization of membrane potential, early rapid increase in cellular Ca 2 + levels and decrease in Na+/K+-ATPase activity. Those responses were concentration-dependent. Treatment of tyrphostin AG 126 interfered with alteration of synaptosomal functions and decrease in Na+/K+-ATPase activity induced by 7 -ketocholesterol or 25 -hydroxycholesterol.

40|$|The aim {{of these}} studies was to {{characterize}} {{the involvement of the}} serine/threonine phosphatases 1 and 2 A in cholinergic nerve <b>terminal</b> <b>function.</b> This was studied in rat hippocampal formation using the specific inhibitors of phosphatases I and 2 A, calyculin A (Cal A) and okadaic acid (OKA). The first set of experiments demonstrated that treatment with OKA or Cal A reduced tissue ACh content, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, choline uptake and [3 H] ACh synthesis in rat hippocampal formation, but spontaneous ACh release was not affected. Thus, it is clear that phosphatase activity plays a role in presynaptic central cholinergic nerve <b>terminal</b> <b>function,</b> particularly in the regulation of ACh synthesis. The mechanisms that regulate ACh transport activity and vesicle mobilization are not fully understood. Thus, the objective of the second study was to examine whether Cal A or OKA alter the subcellular distribution of ACh and explore the relationship between transmitter release and stores. Cal A and OKA depleted the occluded ACh of the P 3 fraction but not the ACh contained in the cytoplasmic (S 3) fraction. Cal A and OKA reduced ACh of a monodispersed fraction (D) of synaptic vesicles, but other nerve terminal bound pools (E-F and G-H) were not so affected. K+-evoked ACh release was decreased in the presence of Cal A and OKA. This loss of ACh from synaptic vesicle fractions appeared not to result from a reduced ability to take up ACh: when tissue synthesized [3 H] ACh from [3 H] choline, the ratio of [3 H] ACh in the S 3 to P 3 fractions was not much changed by Cal A or OKA, and the specific activity of ACh of the D fraction was not reduced disproportionately to that of cytosolic ACh. Therefore, Cal A and OKA appear to produce selective depletion of tissue ACh in a sub-population of synaptic vesicles, suggesting that phosphatases play a role in ACh compartmentation. The third series of experiments investigated the effects of Cal A and OKA on the cytosolic., ionically-bound, and membranous forms of ChAT. Enzyme activity, measured by radioenzymatic assay and enzyme amount quantitated by ELISA in each of these subfractions, showed parallel changes. The findings reported in this thesis strongly implicate the serine/threonine phosphatases I and 2 A in the modulation of cholinergic nerve <b>terminal</b> <b>function,</b> particularly on ACh synthesis. Thus, the phosphatase inhibitors are useful tools to add to the repertoire of neurochemical and pharmacological approaches used to investigate cholinergic mechanisms...|$|E
