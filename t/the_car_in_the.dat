5|$|Large {{sections}} of the game feature a car which resembles a gutted-and-rebuilt 1969 Dodge Charger. It {{appears to have been}} tuned for performance. A radar system is installed later in the game, allowing the player to locate Rebel supply caches. In the final battle, a rear-mounted storage rack for Magnusson Devices is added and the radar is adjusted to track enemies and Magnusson Device dispensers. A homing unit is also installed so the player can quickly locate <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chaos of the final battle via a readout in the Hazardous Environment suit.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E
5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player can point at certain features, such as headlights, wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better immerse <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E

5|$|Hornish {{returned}} to the Sprint Cup Series for one race in Penske's No. 12: the STP 400 at Kansas Speedway. Starting in 10th place, he led for seven laps and finished 19th (one lap behind). Midway through the season, Hornish replaced A. J. Allmendinger in Penske's No. 22 car after Allmendinger was suspended by NASCAR for failing a drug test. Allmendinger qualified in eighth place, but due to the driver change Hornish had {{to move to the}} rear of the field. He finished 33rd, after a mid-race crash required ten laps of repair time. Hornish drove <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remaining races, with a season-best fifth place at Watkins Glen. Aside from that race, his best finishes were a trio of eleventh places at Atlanta, Richmond and Chicagoland. Hornish's best start of the season was fourth at Dover, where he finished 25th (seven laps behind).|$|E
5|$|Menard {{remained}} leading, as Bowyer and Burton {{moved to}} {{the third and fourth}} positions on lap53. On the following lap, they moved to first and second after passing Menard. On lap 57, the sixth caution was given after Brian Vickers' car stalled. The front runners made pit stops during the caution, as McMurray and Montoya reclaimed the first two positions at the restart. On lap61, Johnson returned to the race after his team repaired <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garage. Also on the same lap, Ku. Busch overtook McMurray to become the leader, as both McMurray and Montoya fell to the 17th and 18th positions. On the 63rd lap, Logano, with assistance from Stewart, moved into the fifth position, as Kasey Kahne moved to tenth. By lap65, Logano and Stewart had fallen to seventh and eighth. On the next lap, Burton moved into the first position. On the 67th lap, Keselowski moved to third, as Smith became the leader. Smith remained the leader until lap72 when Jeff Burton and Bowyer passed him. By lap73, the race had 26 lead changes. On the following lap, Burton passed Bowyer for the first position. Three laps later, Kvapil prompted the caution after spinning sideways. At the lap78 restart, Bowyer was the leader ahead of Earnhardt, Jr. in second.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} {{working on the}} cable line. They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have {{led him to the}} murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps outside for a break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman near the house, who escapes from him. Climbing up on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E

25|$|As {{locomotive}} technology progressed in {{the mid-19th}} century, trains grew {{in length and}} weight. Passenger cars grew along with them, first getting longer {{with the addition of}} a second truck (one at each end), and wider as their suspensions improved. Cars built for European use featured side door compartments, while American car design favored a single pair of doors at one end of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car's vestibule; compartmentized cars on American railroads featured a long hallway with doors from the hall to the compartments.|$|E
25|$|The No. 55 {{returned}} in 2012 with Aaron's {{moving from the}} No. 00 car and Mark Martin hired to drive 24 races {{in the car for}} the next two seasons.

25|$|The use {{of false}} camera {{mountings}} was banned. Teams had previously exploited a loophole in the regulations {{that allowed them}} to add additional pieces of bodywork to <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> place of camera mountings and take advantage of the aerodynamic benefits. From 2014, this loophole was closed, with the regulations rewritten to only allow camera mountings to be used for cameras. This rule was later updated to force the teams to mount the cameras on an external piece of bodywork after Red Bull fitted its cameras within the nose of the RB10 chassis.|$|E
25|$|Midway {{through the}} second week of practice, Roger Penske consummated a deal with Al Sr. to drive the third car. Penske promised Unser a well-funded effort, and a brand new Cosworth engine, the same chassis/engine {{combination}} that had won the previous four Indy 500s. The year-old March was removed from a Penske Racing display at a Sheraton hotel in the team's hometown of Reading, Pennsylvania, and hurriedly prepared for a return to active competition. Unser easily put <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field on the third day of time trials.|$|E

Supporters, furious with referee De Braeckel's decisions to annul two Cercle goals for unclear reasons and to award Anderlecht a goal that looked offside, chased De Braeckel from the stadium. Two Cercle fans proposed to the Cercle Brugge board that they give the referee {{a ride to the}} Bruges railway station; the board accepted, but the fans instead drove the referee toward Zedelgem, where they threw him from <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of nowhere.|$|E

25|$|What {{is now the}} No. 33 car {{started as}} the No. 90 car in 2003. RCR entered the No. 90 Chevrolet in the fall Talladega race with John Andretti driving. The car was {{sponsored}} by AOL 9.0 and was numbered 90 for marketing purposes. Ron Hornaday, Jr. ran the No. 90 in the season-ending Ford 400 with Childress Vineyards on the hood. In 2004, {{it was announced that}} Kerry Earnhardt would drive the car (renumbered to 33) in five NASCAR Nextel Cup races. Mike Skinner would run <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Daytona 500, finishing 22nd. Earnhardt drove <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other three restrictor plate races with Bass Pro Shops sponsoring, getting his best finish of 24th. He attempted all of the restrictor plate races again in 2005, finishing 17th at Talladega. In addition, road course ringer Brian Simo brought home a 10th-place finish at Infineon Raceway. Clint Bowyer (Childress' Busch Series driver) made his Nextel Cup debut in this car with a Sylvania sponsorship at Phoenix in April 2005. Scott Wimmer ran the season finale in 2005, attempted two races in 2006 (making one start), and only made one start out of seven attempts in 2007. On May 2, 2008, Wimmer attempted but failed to qualify for the 2008 Crown Royal presents the Dan Lowry 400 at Richmond. Wimmer had sponsorships from Holiday Inn and Camping World/RVs.com. Ken Schrader and Mike Wallace ran one race apice in 2008.|$|E
25|$|When {{they get}} to the lake, George pulls the car's choke to feign it is out of gas in order to hide <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods. He acts visibly nervous when he rents a boat from a man who seems to deduce that George gave him a false name; the man's suspicions are aroused more when George asks him whether any other boaters are on the lake (none are). While they are out on the lake, Alice confesses her dreams about their happy future {{together}} with their child. As George apparently takes pity on her, and, judging from his attitude, decides not to carry out his murderous plan, Alice tries to stand up in the boat, causing it to capsize, and Alice drowns.|$|E
25|$|Mario Andretti {{drove in}} place of Miles in the next race at the Nürburgring, but crashed heavily on the first lap, badly {{damaging}} the chassis. At the International Gold Cup Jochen Rindt was forced to drive the 63, despite protesting furiously to Chapman, and in an under-strength field of F1 and F5000 cars came second, some way behind Jacky Ickx's Brabham. In the remaining races of the season Miles drove <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Italian, Canadian and Mexican races, retiring from all three with engine, gearbox and fuel pump failures, with Andretti retiring at Watkins Glen with broken suspension. After losing both championships to Jackie Stewart's Matra, Chapman finally {{decided that it was}} time to abandon the 4WD car and concentrate on the designs for the Lotus 72.|$|E
30|$|For Category 1, {{the driving}} {{behaviors}} of the respondents are considered as same as the driving behaviors of one <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> household. Such assumption is statistically reasonable if each driver only drives his/her own <b>car</b> or <b>the</b> driving behaviors distribute equally among all <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> household. Bias on the driving patterns is introduced with such assumption under certain situations. For example, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> household may be functionally divided such as daily commuting and leisure driving for all <b>the</b> drivers <b>in</b> some cases when {{there is more than}} one <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> household.
