5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond of <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going {{down the sides of}} the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{exploration of}} the original Mass Effect was completely revamped. Instead of having large barren landscapes, the designers opted to build distinct and interesting places. The goal was to encourage players to keep exploring the galaxy by changing their expectations about what they could find. Originally, developers experimented with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> vehicle {{that could be used}} to navigate the planetary terrain in a more flexible way than in the original title. However, the vehicle was ultimately removed from the final build of the game. The context-sensitive interrupt system, which was originally meant to be a feature in the original Mass Effect, was introduced in Mass Effect 2 to help blend the dialogue better with the rest of the action.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of Bianca Casfafiore in the story– a famous opera singer, {{pursued by the}} press, and changing her outfit for every occasion– {{was influenced by the}} life of the opera singer Maria Callas. One of the new characters that Hergé introduced into the story was the stonemason Arthur Bolt (M. Boullu in the original French version), whose characterisation was based on a real individual who worked for Hergé. Hergé's {{depiction of}} the paparazzi within the story may have been influenced by his own repeat encounters with the press throughout his career. The reporter and the photographer, Christopher Willoughby-Droupe and Marco Rizotto (Jean-Loup de la Battelerie and Walter Rizotto respectively in the original French version) of the Paris Flash, are introduced into the series here, and would later be retroactively added into a re-drawing of The Black Island (1938) by Bob de Moor, also making a reappearance in Tintin and the Picaros (1976). <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> proposed marriage between Castafiore and Haddock was based on a reader's suggestion that Haddock marry.|$|E

5|$|In February 2002, Haze {{appeared}} in a scene for Jill Kelly Productions (JKP), directed by Jill Kelly herself. Kelly was impressed by her performance and JKP offered Haze an exclusive performing contract. This was soon followed by offers from other companies, but in April 2002 Haze decided to sign with JKP, as they offered the extra flexibility she needed to make money and build her career. The company to her {{was more than just}} a business, but a family too. She also enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> group of girls around her and working for a company run by a woman. Soon after signing with JKP, she formed a serious relationship with an industry cameraman and began a three-year period of performing exclusively with women. At the 2003 AVN Awards ceremony, Haze was named Best New Starlet and her masturbation scene in Big Bottom Sadie was awarded Best Solo Sex Scene. In 2004, she appeared on the HBO show Pornucopia, a six-part documentary on the pornography industry in California.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{initially}} intended Ocarina of Time to {{be played}} in a first-person perspective to enable players {{to take in the}} vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as to be able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. This concept was overridden once <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> child Link was introduced, and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link to be visible on screen. Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was so heavily modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the final products entirely different engines. One major difference between the two is camera control; the player has a lot of control over the camera in Super Mario 64, but the camera in Ocarina of Time is largely controlled by the game's AI. Miyamoto says the camera controls for Ocarina of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario.|$|E
5|$|Originally, a {{redevelopment}} of Nadderud was proposed, but in 1999 Stabæk players {{launched the}} idea of building a new stadium at Fornebu, which became subject to an urban redevelopment project after the 1998 closing of Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The initial proposal was named Blue Dream Arena, would have seating for 25,000 spectators, blue artificial turf and a retractable roof. Other proposed amenities were movable seating which would also allow the stadium to both host athletics and be configured as an intimate football stadium. The idea called for Bruce Springsteen to hold a concert before the first match, which would be played against Barcelona. Several of the initial concepts of the stadium were never materialized. International rules disallowed blue artificial turf; instead, the flooring in the boxes were made in a blue, artificial turf-inspired material. Also <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> retractable roof was discarded, both because of technical difficulties and cost issues.|$|E

Released on bail, Paul convinces Steph of his innocence, causing trouble in her and Mark's relationship. Tyler is later questioned and Mark {{is removed from the}} case. Mark raises the subject of having children with Steph and she tells him she is open to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> child with him in the future. Mark starts to think Paul could be innocent, but is threatened with dismissal if he continues to investigate. He later discovers that Jacka Hills (Brad McMurray) caused the explosion on Julie Quill's (Gail Easdale) orders.

In deciding the personality she would have, the authors were inspired by the strong character from their beautician. Publications for manga, anime and other media praised Yūko for her personality and role in the series. She has also been popular within readers following both xxxHolic and Tsubasa.|$|E
25|$|Although having Dange as its leader, AICP was {{not able}} to attract any major {{nationwide}} following for two main reasons. Firstly, the Soviet Union did not give any political support to the new party. The founders of AICP were upholding the pro-Soviet CPI policy of cooperating with the National Congress, but the Soviets were not interested in a split within CPI. Secondly, the Congress showed limited interest towards <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> national alliance with the new party.|$|E

25|$|Sonya and Toadie undergo {{fertility}} {{tests and}} Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) tells them that Toadie {{has a low}} sperm count. After almost giving up on <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> baby, Sonya takes a standard pregnancy test before donating blood, and Rhys tells her she is pregnant. Troy returns to town and moves next door to Sonya and Toadie. He tries to gain custody of Callum and takes an intervention order out on Toadie, causing Sonya to collapse from the stress. When Troy refuses to let Callum leave his house, Sonya and Jade force their way in and Troy locks them inside. When Sonya and Jade escape, Troy falls and sustains a head injury. After he discharges himself from hospital, Troy goes to Callum's school and is confronted by Sonya and Toadie. Troy leaves, but falls unconscious {{at the wheel of}} his truck and dies. Toadie's cousin, Georgia (Saskia Hampele), moves in and bonds with Sonya over the baby. Toadie proposes to Sonya and she accepts. Sonya goes into labour two weeks early and due to complications, she has to be rushed to hospital, where she gives birth to Nell (Scarlett Anderson) via caesarean section.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel, who wanted to do an episode that had two things; a [...] "go to work with your parents day" [...] and Bart getting a driver's license. The [...] "go to work with your parents day" [...] idea appealed to Appel because it was {{something}} he [...] "lost the right" [...] to do when he went from public school to private school as a child. Appel considered those days to be his favorites because he [...] "didn't have to do anything" [...] at his parents' job. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> driver's license was something that Appel dreamed about when he was younger.|$|E

[...] <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> band was unspecified. Williams remarked, [...] "I forget who was in band.

But in 2010, he dispelled any rumors of the band breaking up, saying:"I love what I do and think that, yes, it might be tiring and complicated at times [...] we don't have any plans on disbanding any time soon".

500|$|De Havilland and {{her sister}} Joan Fontaine are the only {{siblings}} to have won Academy Awards in a lead acting category. According to biographer Charles Higham, the sisters always had an uneasy relationship, starting in early childhood when Olivia had trouble accepting <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> younger sister, and Joan resenting her mother's favoring Olivia. Olivia would rip up the clothes that her sister was given to wear as hand-me-downs, forcing Joan to stitch them together again. [...] This tension was made worse by Fontaine's frequent childhood illnesses, which led to her mother's overly protective expression, [...] "Livvie can, Joan can't." [...] DeHavilland {{was the first to}} become an actress, and for several years Fontaine was overshadowed by her sister's accomplishments. When Mervyn LeRoy offered Fontaine a personal contract, her mother told her that Warner Bros. was [...] "Olivia's studio" [...] and that she could not use the family name, [...] "deHavilland".|$|E
500|$|Ira Steven Behr and Robert Hewitt Wolfe {{conceived}} {{the story and}} wrote the script for [...] "Heart of Stone", and intended the Odo/Kira storyline to be the A-Plot. Behr later thought that the performances of Eisenberg and Brooks elevated the Nog/Sisko story to equal status and {{would result in a}} better reaction by fans. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> character trapped was taken from the Ken Kesey novel Sometimes a Great Notion in which a character is trapped under a log and drowned by rising water. Behr described the same scene in the 1971 film as [...] "a great scene in a not so great movie". The episode was intended to be low budget, but heavy on characterisation. At one point it was intended for Odo to sing the 1955 Richard Berry song [...] "Louie Louie", which the character described as a sea shanty, but producers couldn't acquire the rights in time.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Feuer, Martin and Steinbeck {{intended}} {{the work to}} be composed by Loesser, but he was busy with a project which eventually became The Most Happy Fella. With Loesser's refusal, Feuer and Martin approached Rodgers and Hammerstein with their project, then titled The Bear Flag Café. From the beginning, the prudish Hammerstein was uncomfortable with the setting, telling Feuer [...] "We do family shows." [...] However, Hammerstein found himself attracted to the characters. Doc and Suzy were culturally mismatched but drawn to each other, with Doc rather moody and Suzy somewhat intense. Similar pairings had led to success, {{not only in the}} pair's Carousel and South Pacific, but in Hammerstein's work before his collaboration with Rodgers, such as The Desert Song and Rose-Marie. During early 1953, Steinbeck sent Hammerstein early drafts of the novel. Rodgers was also concerned about <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> prostitute be the female lead, but eventually gave in. The two agreed to write and produce the adaptation.|$|E
