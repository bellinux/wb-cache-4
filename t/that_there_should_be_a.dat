5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas {{was estimated to be}} 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E
5|$|In 1766, John Gwynn {{complained in}} his work London and Westminster Improved {{that there was a}} lack of {{planning}} throughout the West End and that it would be useful to construct a thoroughfare linking Marylebone Park (now Regent's Park) with the Prince Regent's Carlton House. John Fordyce was appointed as Surveyor-General to the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests in 1793 and concluded <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> suitable road in place by 1811, when the lease for Marylebone Park ran out and ownership reverted to the Crown. It was hoped the road could link Pall Mall and the Haymarket, of which has since declined in quality. A further problem was increased congestion around Charing Cross, which would benefit from road improvements.|$|E
5|$|Peter Cane has {{distinguished}} between {{cases where the}} courts have found that an applicant has standing to represent identifiable individuals (associational standing), and cases where the applicant purports to represent the public interest (public interest standing). Under this analysis, ex parte Greenpeace may be regarded {{as an example of}} the former, and ex parte World Development Movement the latter. In 1994, the Law Commission recommended <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> two-track system for standing. An applicant should have standing in one of two situations: either in his or her personal capacity, in which case a remedy lies ex debito justitae ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right); or at the discretion of the court if it considers that it is in the public interest to accord standing.|$|E

5|$|The Civil War {{brought with}} it {{the end of the}} {{consensus}} among English Protestants <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> single church imposed by the state, though there was still not complete freedom of religion. The ideals of the dissenting brethren of the Assembly were significant in the rise of denominationalism, the doctrine that the church is found in several institutions rather than a single one in a given location. Though Protestants already commonly recognized the validity of churches in different territories, the outcome of the Assembly's debates marks the wider acceptance of the idea that several true churches may be found in the same territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> large opulent hotel in New York for {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.|$|E
5|$|Under the new constitution, Zimbabwe's Presidency was a {{ceremonial}} role with no governmental power; the first President was Canaan Banana. Mugabe had previously offered {{the position to}} Nkomo, who had turned it down in favour of becoming Minister of Home Affairs. Although working together, there remained an aura of resentment and suspicion between Mugabe and Nkomo. Mugabe gave ZAPU four cabinet seats, but Nkomo demanded more. In contrast, some ZANU-PF figures argued that ZAPU should not have any seats in government, suggesting that Zimbabwe be converted into a one-party state. Tekere and Enos Nkala were particularly adamant <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> crackdown on ZAPU. After Nkala called for ZAPU to be violently crushed during a rally in Entumbane, street clashes {{between the two parties}} broke out in the city.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched the idea <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode {{had a lot of}} potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E
5|$|In 1799 Joseph Fox {{started to}} give a series of lectures on dental surgery at Guy’s Hospital, and was {{appointed}} dental surgeon in the same year. Thomas Bell succeeded Fox as dental surgeon either in 1817 or 1825. Frederick Newland Pedley, who was appointed assistant dental surgeon at Guy’s Hospital in 1885, advocated {{the establishment of a}} dental school within the hospital, and he flooded the two dental schools in London, the Metropolitan School of Dental Science and the London School of Dental Surgery, with patients to prove that a further hospital was needed. In December 1888, Guy’s Hospital Dental School was established. Guy’s Hospital Dental School was recognised as a school of the University of London in 1901. In the 1970s, since there was a decline in the demand for dental services, the Department of Health of the UK suggested <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{decrease in the number of}} dental undergraduate students as well as the duration of all courses. In response to the recommendations, Royal Dental Hospital of London School of Dental Surgery amalgamated with the Guy’s Hospital Dental School of the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals on 1 August 1983.|$|E

25|$|The optimal {{shape for}} {{the tip of}} a {{lightning}} rod has been controversial since the 18th century.

In 2001, former Boulder County prosecutor Trip DeMuth and Boulder County sheriff's Detective Steve Ainsworth stated <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> more aggressive investigation of the intruder theory.|$|E
25|$|David M. Scienceman is an Australian scientist; {{he changed}} his name from David Slade by deed poll in 1972.

60|$|He who {{believes}} in separate and innumerable acts of creation may say, that in these cases it has pleased the Creator to cause a being of one type {{to take the place}} of one belonging to another type; but this seems to me only restating the fact in dignified language. He {{who believes}} in the struggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection, will acknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring to increase in numbers; and that if any one being varies ever so little, either in habits or structure, and thus gains an advantage over some other inhabitant of the same country, it will seize on the place of that inhabitant, however different that may be from its own place. Hence it will cause him no surprise <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> geese and frigate-birds with webbed feet, living on the dry land and rarely alighting on the water, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> long-toed corncrakes, living in meadows instead of in swamps; <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> woodpeckers where hardly a tree grows; <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> diving thrushes and diving Hymenoptera, and petrels with the habits of auks.|$|R
25|$|In the {{following}} year, the plague came to Bern. The deaths {{due to the}} plague converted many of the citizens to the Reformation.

Still there was a conflict about the mass, as some congregations still observed it. It was decided <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> religious disputation at Bern, on 6 January 1528, to settle these questions.|$|E
25|$|Carnot's talents as 'the {{organizer}} of victory' are beyond dispute, but his tactical skills were minimal, a defect he concealed by a careful rewriting of history. To drive away a poorly led covering force of 20,000 with the 45,000 {{available to the}} Army of the North should have posed no great problem, but the business was sadly bungled. Carnot insisted <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> double encircling movement, a favorite maneuver of his, combined with a frontal attack, thus carefully dispersing the French numerical superiority.|$|E

25|$|A tournament between Barbados, British Guiana and Trinidad {{took place}} in 1891. Each team played the other {{and then there was}} a final between the leading two teams.

25|$|When Yang and Mills {{proposed}} the theory, {{there was no}} candidate vector boson. J. J. Sakurai in 1960 predicted <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> massive vector boson which is coupled to isospin, and predicted that it would show universal couplings. The rho mesons were discovered a short time later, and were quickly identified as Sakurai's vector bosons. The couplings of the rho to the nucleons and to each other were verified to be universal, as best as experiment could measure. The fact that the diagonal isospin current contains part of the electromagnetic current led {{to the prediction of}} rho-photon mixing and the concept of vector meson dominance, ideas which led to successful theoretical pictures of GeV-scale photon-nucleus scattering.|$|E
