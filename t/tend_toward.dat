5|$|The opening {{lines of}} the poem contain a {{dedication}} to Miles de Nanteuil, an early 13th-century churchman who was elected (but not confirmed) in 1201 as archbishop of Reims, and later became bishop of Beauvais, in northern France; he died circa 1235. According to Todd, the nobleman de Nanteuil {{may have been too}} young and wild to be elevated to the , but this would have made him a good candidate for Renart's dedication. This, plus evidence based on other names found in the poem, led Todd to conclude that the poem was composed around the year 1200. Later critics and researchers, however, date the poem between 1204 and 1228, and <b>tend</b> <b>toward</b> the earlier date.|$|E

25|$|During {{formation}} of macroscopic objects, constituent atoms and ions usually combine to form structures composed of neutral ionic compounds electrically bound to neutral atoms. Thus macroscopic objects <b>tend</b> <b>toward</b> being neutral overall, but macroscopic objects are rarely perfectly net neutral.|$|E
25|$|Three {{dimensional}} {{modeling of}} loudspeaker output patterns {{can be used}} to predict their performance. A number of polar plots are required, taken at a wide selection of frequencies, as the pattern changes greatly with frequency. Polar plots help to show that many loudspeakers <b>tend</b> <b>toward</b> omnidirectionality at lower frequencies.|$|E
2500|$|Each of {{the four}} earthly {{elements}} has its natural place. All that is earthly <b>tends</b> <b>toward</b> {{the center of the}} universe, i.e., the center of the Earth. Water <b>tends</b> <b>toward</b> a sphere surrounding the center. Air <b>tends</b> <b>toward</b> a sphere surrounding the water sphere. Fire <b>tends</b> <b>toward</b> the lunar sphere (in which the Moon orbits). When elements are moved out of their natural place, they naturally move back towards it. This is [...] "natural motion" [...] – motion requiring no extrinsic cause. So, for example, in water, earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up; in air, rain falls and flame rises. Outside all the other spheres, the heavenly, fifth element, manifested in the stars and planets, moves in the perfection of circles.|$|R
30|$|The Markov process {{asymptotically}} <b>tends</b> <b>toward</b> {{a stable}} coalition structure state, where no player has any incentive {{to change its}} power.

25|$|While {{strongly}} desiring intimacy, {{people with}} BPD <b>tend</b> <b>toward</b> insecure, avoidant or ambivalent, or fearfully preoccupied attachment patterns in relationships, {{and they often}} view the world as dangerous and malevolent. BPD, like other personality disorders, is linked to increased levels of chronic stress and conflict in romantic relationships, decreased satisfaction {{on the part of}} romantic partners, abuse, and unwanted pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Most popular {{constant}} directivity horns (also {{known as}} CD horns) suffer from non-spherical wavefronts, limitations in arrayability, distortion at high sound pressure levels {{as well as}} reflections and distortions related to the transition from diffraction slot to secondary horn. They <b>tend</b> <b>toward</b> a narrowing of dispersion pattern at the higher frequencies whose wavelengths approach {{the width of the}} throat or the width of the diffraction slot.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1863, a 10-cent stamp was {{released}} bearing {{the profile of}} Jefferson Davis in blue. This issue was designed and engraved on steel by John Archer and transferred to either copper plates or steel plates. Many shades of exist for these stamps, ranging from light milky blue and darker blue to shades that <b>tend</b> <b>toward</b> greenish blue and green. There are four similar designs of engraved ten cent stamps.|$|E

25|$|Another medieval {{emphasis}} foreshadowed in Marcellus is {{a concern}} for locating ingredients in their native environment, replacing the exotic flora and fauna prescribed in texts from antiquity with indigenous species. Recipes in both Marcellus and the medieval writers <b>tend</b> <b>toward</b> “polypharmacy,” {{or the use of}} a great number of ingredients in a single preparation. Many recipes in De medicamentis contain at least ten ingredients, and one, the antidotus Cosmiana (29.11), is compounded of 73.|$|E
25|$|Solutions of {{the heat}} {{equation}} are characterized by a gradual smoothing of the initial temperature distribution by the flow of heat from warmer to colder areas of an object. Generally, many different states and starting conditions will <b>tend</b> <b>toward</b> the same stable equilibrium. As a consequence, to reverse the solution and conclude something about earlier times or initial conditions from the present heat distribution is very inaccurate except over the shortest of time periods.|$|E
25|$|Hunters have meticulous turnout and <b>tend</b> <b>toward</b> very quiet, {{conservative}} horse tack and rider attire. Hunter bits, bridles, crops, spurs, and martingales are tightly regulated. Jumpers, while {{caring for}} their horses and grooming them well, are not scored on turnout, are allowed {{a wider range of}} equipment, and may wear less conservative attire, so long as it stays within the rules. Formal turnout always is preferred; a neat rider gives a good impression at shows.|$|E

Many theme ingredients reflect the Japanese {{origin of the}} show—river eel, tofu, udon—though ingredients more familiar in the West, such as bell peppers, summer corn, and peaches, are spotlighted as well. In one episode devoted to asparagus, the challenger boasted that he used over $1,000 worth of lobster (which he then discarded) simply to flavor his asparagus in this battle against Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto.|$|E
25|$|After {{his father}} died {{suddenly}} in 1896, Benson was sent {{on a trip to}} the Middle East to recover his own health. While there he began to question the status of the Church of England and to consider the claims of the Roman Catholic Church. His own piety began to <b>tend</b> <b>toward</b> the High Church tradition, and he started exploring religious life in various Anglican communities, eventually obtaining permission to join the Community of the Resurrection.|$|E
25|$|Sufism {{is popular}} in such African {{countries}} as Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Senegal, {{where it is}} seen as a mystical expression of Islam. Sufism is traditional in Morocco but has seen a growing revival with the renewal of Sufism under contemporary spiritual teachers such as Hamza al Qadiri al Boutchichi. Mbacke suggests that one reason Sufism has taken hold in Senegal is because it can accommodate local beliefs and customs, which <b>tend</b> <b>toward</b> the mystical.|$|E

25|$|Homoscedasticity: , {{which means}} that the error term has the same {{variance}} σ2 in each observation. When this requirement is violated this is called heteroscedasticity, in such case a more efficient estimator would be weighted least squares. If the errors have infinite variance then the OLS estimates will also have infinite variance (although by the law of large numbers they will nonetheless <b>tend</b> <b>toward</b> the true values so long as the errors have zero mean). In this case, robust estimation techniques are recommended.|$|E
25|$|Orienting vowels {{are written}} by {{rotating}} the vowel {{to match the}} incoming angle of the preceding character, then mirrored along the axis of that character to avoid the following character crossing. They come in two varieties, defined by whether they will <b>tend</b> <b>toward</b> the right or left if the adjacent characters will allow either. Nasal vowels are considered a special case of an orienting vowel, and will act as orienting vowels, except in the Chinook script, where nasals can appear as diacritics.|$|E
25|$|This {{pervasive}} use {{of stainless}} steel almost certainly had a distinctive effect on both New Zealand wine styles and the domestic palate. The early wines which made a stir internationally were lauded for the intensity and purity of the fruit in the wine. Indeed, the strength of flavor in the wine favored very dry styles despite intense acidity. While stainless steel did not produce the intensity of fruit, it allowed for its exploitation. Even today, New Zealand white wines <b>tend</b> <b>toward</b> the drier end of the spectrum.|$|E

40|$|After {{a period}} of growing disconnectedness of {{regional}} markets following the 1992 price liberalization in Russia, a process of improvement in market integration started since about 1994. This paper analyzes the spatial pattern of goods market integration {{in the country in}} 1994 - 2000, characterizing Russian regions into three states: integrated with a benchmark region, not integrated but <b>tending</b> <b>toward</b> integration with it, and not integrated and not <b>tending</b> <b>toward</b> integration. The standard AR(1) model serves to test for market integration. To capture a movement toward integration (price convergence), a nonlinear time series model with an asymptotically decaying trend is proposed. The results obtained suggest that only a bit more than one fifth of the Russian regions can be deemed not integrated and not <b>tending</b> <b>toward</b> integration with the benchmark region over 1994 – 2000...|$|R
