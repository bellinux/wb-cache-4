We had fun. And so, if nothing else, it was a good experience... and diva-ism, whatever." ...|$|E
500|$|Many episodes {{written by}} Lawrence develop {{and explore the}} {{relationship}} between Karen and her husband. Lawrence has stated that he feels Karen makes Plankton-focused episodes more humorous and that her presence helps portray him as a multidimensional character. In a 2009 interview with Andy Goodman, he said, [...] "I want more Karen on the show... The married life of an evil genius is the funniest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> so in that regard [...] definitely enhances Plankton's stories, making him more than just your typical bad guy." ...|$|E

500|$|Creation of a 3D effect {{required}} the design team {{to use an}} assortment of low-poly meshes, or 3D geometric models. Using a variety of animation and special effects techniques, these images were later superimposed [...] "with painstaking care" [...] to avoid a sterile, digitized look. Clair said, [...] "The most crucial <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was that this didn't feel digital, {{so we went to}} great lengths to incorporate as much organic imagery as possible." [...] For some stills, the design team created digital doubles to develop more texture. The sequence's final cut was polished using optical glitching and motion distortion techniques. The Sydney Morning Herald included the opening sequence in a list of ten of the best title sequences on television.|$|E
500|$|The {{musical score}} for [...] "The Winds of Winter" [...] was {{composed}} by Ramin Djawadi. Djawadi {{has worked on}} the series since its inception, and additionally composed the show's main theme. In an interview, Djawadi spoke about the score he created {{for the beginning of}} the episode, titled [...] "Light of the Seven", which largely consisted of piano, something unusual for the series. Djawadi stated, [...] "The interesting <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was the use of the piano. When we started the season, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, and Miguel Sapochnik, the director of the episode, reached out to me and said, 'There's something coming up in episode 10.' We talked about 'The Light of the Seven', and how it needed to be a new piece of music. Any kind of character theme could tip it, and we didn't want to tip the audience. Miguel brought it up: 'What about the piano?' We discussed it. The piano is not really {{in the language of the}} Game of Thrones score." ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Holmes from Destructoid {{questioned}} {{the controversy over}} the decision by stating [...] "While there are surely plenty of folks who adore seeing their screen filled with frilly thong shots, I imagine there may be even more players out there who'd find the sudden prioritization of arse in their fighting games to be little out of place." [...] Chris Carter at Destructoid commented [...] "It's still a bit weird that something this goofy was removed, especially with the design Laura has in general," [...] and noted that a character like Necalli is [...] "probably far more harmful" [...] for children's eyes. In another article by Destructoid, Carter stated [...] "It's such a weird <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> because R. Mika's butt is still very visible, she just doesn't lightly tap it a few times per match." [...] Likewise, ND Medina at iDigitalTimes expressed confusion over the change, noting that her full butt was still being exposed. The butt slap was later restored as a mod for the PC version, albeit in a different pose.|$|E

2500|$|Crabb {{has said}} that his early {{experiences}} informed his views on welfare: [...] "The most powerful <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> looking back, {{is the way that}} my mother went through a crisis in her life and became welfare dependent. She started working just a few hours each week, increasing her hours and then moving to a position where with extra training she was able to move into full-time work, become a car owner, and reach full economic independence." [...] He also said: [...] "I was brought up in a home where a huge amount of emphasis was put on work...so work and education as routes out of poverty were drummed into us".|$|E
2500|$|... "These kids don't need steroids {{to become}} players... we overemphasize the steroids {{and not the}} {{athletic}} ability and skills of these people.

He is the closest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> genetically. And in my prime I was a super athlete". [...] "My twin brother used the same chemicals, same workouts, the same nutrition. Why didn't he make it in the big leagues? That is the perfect example that we are giving steroids way too much credit. If steroids are that great it would have made him a superstar." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the April of {{his first}} year in Australia he {{attended}} a picnic to farewell Charles St Julian, who had been appointed Chief Justice of Fiji. In responding to a toast, the 17-year-old Celua said in Fijian: [...] "I thank you for so heartily drinking this toast. Speechmaking is a new <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> you must therefore please excuse my words being few. I come from a once dark land – a land of cannibal cruelty – but Christianity has raised us from the lowest degradation, and now we are a Christian people. We are now trying to establish law and order in our land, and I ask you to help us. We most earnestly desire the establishment of law, and if you will help us it can be done. We want to govern Fiji in every respect as this land is governed. I have come to white man's land to be trained at Newington College. I am anxious to be taught. You were born in the light, I in the darkness. You were born in a Christian land, I in a heathen country. I wish to be trained here that I may be of service in the government of my own country. Again I thank you for so heartily drinking prosperity to Fiji." ...|$|E
