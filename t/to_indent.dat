25|$|By 1881 the Volta Associates {{had succeeded}} in {{improving}} an Edison tinfoil phonograph significantly. They filled the groove of its heavy iron cylinder with wax, then instead of wrapping a sheet of foil around it and using a blunt stylus <b>to</b> <b>indent</b> the recording into the foil, as Edison did, they used a chisel-like stylus to engrave the recording into the wax. The result was a clearer recording. Rather than apply for a patent at that time, however, they sealed the machine into a metal box and deposited it at the Smithsonian, specifying {{that it was not}} to be opened without the consent of two of the three men. By 1937 Tainter was the only one of the Associates still living, and the box preserved at the Smithsonian was opened with his permission. For the occasion, descendants of Alexander Graham Bell gathered in Washington, but Tainter, who held a lifelong admiration of Bell, was too ill to attend and remained at home in San Diego.|$|E

2500|$|The basic {{distinction}} between the Edison's first phonograph patent and the Bell and Tainter patent of 1886 was the method of recording. Edison's method was <b>to</b> <b>indent</b> the sound waves {{on a piece of}} tin-foil while Bell and Tainter's invention called for cutting or [...] "engraving" [...] the sound waves into an ozokerite wax record with a sharp recording stylus. At each step of their inventive process the Associates also sought out the best type of materials available in order to produce the clearest and most audible sound reproduction.|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{evidence}} proving that Christopher Smart wrote A Song to David while locked away in a mental asylum for seven years.

2500|$|Fischer {{takes the}} short line 12 {{to be the}} {{beginning}} of the text, reasoning {{that it would have been}} easier <b>to</b> <b>indent</b> the first line than to estimate how long the last line would be when fitting it in, and that the large glyphs in line 13 past the end of line 12 were written that way to fill in the gap. However, he does note that there are remnants of pre-inscription tracings that would have enabled such an estimate. Horley (2011) makes a case that 12 was the last line: That the text starts at line 11, wraps around (in descending order) to 13, and that 12 was fit into the gap between the slightly skew lines 11 and 13. The way lines 12 and 13 squeeze together (the glyphs are 12–14mm high at the thick end of the staff, but only 8–10mm high at the end of line 12 where 13 takes over) is consistent with these being the last lines engraved.|$|E

The results of this paper support the conclusions of England and McKenzie (1982) regarding the role of gravity in governing the deformation of a thin viscous layer subject <b>to</b> <b>indenting</b> boundary conditions.
