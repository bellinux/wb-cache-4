5|$|During a 2016 Interview at NAMM Show, bassist Nick Schendzielos {{revealed}} that the band was writing new music and had four new songs at the time. He went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> hope to release new music in late 2017 that would follow the musical direction of Sun Eater.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} talk of {{building}} a replica of the memorial. On 31 May 2008 on Anzac Parade, Canberra, the formal dedication of a site in which will be placed a new national Boer War memorial was held. A National Boer War Memorial Committee was formed prior to that date, and they will be conducting a national competition to find a design for the new memorial. In the design brief for the memorial, the committee state that it is their desire to build a memorial along the same lines as Adelaide's: going so far as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be willing to accept a replica of the statue from the South Australian memorial if the original mould could be located or if a duplicate could otherwise be produced.|$|E
5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are going to the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E
30|$|The {{main goal}} {{for each of}} the {{decision}} makers in the hierarchy is to achieve a value which is not very far from their own ideal solution. <b>That</b> is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> minimize the deviation d^-_i such that μ _i[F_i(X)] + d^-_i = 1 for all i = 1, 2, 3, and for all X ∈ S.|$|R
50|$|In the book, for example, Kingsley {{argues that}} no person is {{qualified}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> something <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{have never seen}} (like a human soul or a water baby) does not exist.|$|R

25|$|Each of the {{arguments}} below aims {{to show that a}} particular set of gods does not exist—by demonstrating them to be inherently meaningless, contradictory, or at odds with known scientific or historical facts—or that there is insufficient proof <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do exist.|$|E
25|$|The poet {{moves to}} a jewelry shop in the third stanza and asks the {{goldsmith}} what ornaments they manufacture. They reply; necklace, wrist-lets, anklets, rings, and continued <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>they</b> also make bells for blue pigeons that are tied to their feet. The bells are as delicate as a dragonfly’s wing. Simultaneously they make gold girdles for dancers and scabbards for the kings to keep their swords.|$|E
25|$|<b>To</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have a {{key role}} to play is an understatement. Finance is {{connected}} to most, if not all, of the key business processes within the organization. It should be steering the stewardship and accountability systems that ensure that the organization is conducting its business in an appropriate, ethical manner. It is critical that these foundations are firmly laid. So often they are the litmus test by which {{public confidence in the}} institution is either won or lost.|$|E
50|$|This was {{an actual}} event on an actual date or dates that was {{potentially}} {{going to be}} run which people would attend. The name Class led to some confusion with the users as people were used <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were “going on a Course” but in Registrar speak they were actually “going on a Class”. As this terminology was only used by the administration people themselves they soon got used to it.|$|R

25|$|Luisa {{is often}} {{troubled by the}} antics of her grandchildren and when she sees her {{youngest}} granddaughter, Nicky (Carly Hillman), kissing Martin Fowler (James Alexandrou), the shock is too much and she suffers a stroke shortly before Bruno's birthday in July 1998. She recovers but remains frail and in December Bruno and Luisa decide to take a trip to Italy to discover their homeland together, {{before it is too}} late. When they get there they like it so much that they decide to stay. A few weeks later they telephone Rosa <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not returning.|$|E
25|$|Apollinaire took Picasso to {{the opening}} of the {{exhibition}} in 1911 to see the cubist works in Room 7 and 8. At about the time of this exhibition, Gleizes, through the intermediary of Apollinaire, meets Picasso and sees the work of Picasso and Braque for the first time. He gives his reaction in an essay published in another shortlived Abbaye dominated literary magazine, La Revue Indépendante. He considers that Picasso and Braque, despite the great value of their work, are engaged in an 'Impressionism of Form', which is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> give an appearance of formal construction which does not rest on any clearly comprehensible principle.|$|E
25|$|Someone {{wanting to}} claim ESA {{will need a}} medical certificate, i.e. a sick-note, signed by their GP <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not fully fit for work. The new {{claimant}} must then contact the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), usually by phone, who will log their claim and usually post them a questionnaire to complete (except in rare circumstances where a full assessment isn't required, such as when a doctor has officially certified the claimant as being likely to die within six months). The completed form must then be sent in the envelope provided to the Health Assessment Advisory Service - the trading name of the assessment provider, Maximus.|$|E

40|$|We {{review the}} global issues {{associated}} to gauge fixing ambiguities and their consequence for glueball spectroscopy. To avoid infrared singularities {{the theory is}} formulated in a finite volume. The examples of a cubic and spherical geometry {{will be discussed in}} some detail. Our methods are not powerful enough to study the infinite volume limit but the results clearly indicate that for low-lying states, wave functionals are sensitive to global gauge copies which we will argue is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are sensitive <b>to</b> the geometric and topological features of configuration space...|$|R
25|$|The {{settlers}} {{explored the}} snow-covered area and discovered an empty native village, {{now known as}} Corn Hill in Truro. The curious settlers dug up some artificially made mounds, some of which stored corn, while others were burial sites. Nathaniel Philbrick claims that the settlers stole the corn and looted and desecrated the graves, sparking friction with the locals. Philbrick goes on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> explored the area of Cape Cod for several weeks as they moved down the coast {{to what is now}} Eastham, and he claims that the Pilgrims were looting and stealing native stores as they went. He then writes about how they decided to relocate to Plymouth after a difficult encounter with the Nausets at First Encounter Beach in December 1620.|$|E
25|$|In Leon Festinger's {{cognitive}} dissonance experiment, {{participants were asked}} to perform a boring task. They were divided into 2 groups and given two different pay scales. At the study's end, some participants were paid $1 <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> enjoyed the task and another group of participants was paid $20 to say the same lie. The first group ($1) later reported liking the task better than the second group ($20). Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group being paid only $1 is not sufficient incentive for lying and those who were paid $1 experienced dissonance. They could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the task. Being paid $20 provides a reason for the doing the boring task, therefore no dissonance.|$|E
25|$|Traditionalist Catholics {{other than}} sedevacantists {{recognize}} as legitimate {{the line of}} Popes leading to and including Pope Francis. Some of them hold that {{one or more of}} the most recent popes have held and taught unorthodox beliefs, but do not go so far as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have been formal heretics or have been widely and publicly judged to be heretics. Sedevacantists, on the other hand, claim that the infallible Magisterium of the Catholic Church could not have decreed the changes made in the name of the Second Vatican Council, and conclude that those who issued these changes could not have been acting with the authority of the Catholic Church. Accordingly, they hold that Pope Paul VI and his successors left the true Catholic Church and thus lost legitimate authority in the Church. A formal heretic, they say, cannot be the Catholic pope.|$|E

25|$|The {{recognized}} {{founder of}} Bagua Zhang, Dong Hai Chuan, was reputed to have fought Guo Yunshen with neither able {{to defeat the}} other - though {{it is possible that}} they were training together. It would have been controversial at the time for Dong Hai Chuan to have studied under Guo Yunshen, since Dong was the older of the two. The most neutral viewpoint would be <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> trained together, which may explain the stylistic similarities between Bagua Zhang and the Xing Yi Quan monkey shape. Frantzis argues that this encounter never took place and that Guo and Dong had little contact with each other. Frantzis argues that a Xing Yi - Bagua exchange was more likely to have occurred in Tianjin c. 1900 where xingyi masters Li Cunyi and Zhang Zhaodong, Bagua master Cheng Tinghua, and four other xingyi and bagua teachers lived together (Frantzis, 1998, p.179).|$|E
25|$|While {{the sign}} system in ISL {{appears to be}} largely indigenous, {{elements}} in ISL are derived from British Sign Language. For example, most ISL signers nowadays use fingerspelling based on British Sign Language fingerspelling, with only isolated groups using an indigenous devanagari-based fingerspelling system (for example, Deaf students and graduates of the school for the deaf in Vadodara/Baroda, Gujarat). In addition, more recently contact with foreign Deaf has resulted in rather extensive borrowing from International Signs and (either directly or via International Signs) from American Sign Language. A small number of the Deaf in and around Bengaluru are often said to use American Sign Language (owing to a longstanding ASL deaf school there); however it is probably more correct <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> use a lexicon based largely on ASL (or Signed English), while incorporating also a not inconsequential ISL element. Furthermore, regardless of the individual signs used, the grammar used is clearly ISL and not ASL.|$|E
500|$|On 19 June Richard Lichtheim of the Jewish Agency in Geneva, who had {{received}} {{a copy of the}} report from Mantello, wrote to the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> knew [...] "what has happened and where it has happened", and reported the Vrba–Wetzler figure that 90 per cent of Jews arriving at Birkenau were being killed. Vrba and Oscar Krasniasnky met Vatican Swiss legate Monsignor Mario Martilotti at the Svätý Jur monastery on 20 June. Martilotti had seen the report and questioned Vrba about it for six hours.|$|E

500|$|Writer Rob Edwards {{stated that}} [...] "it was {{extremely}} challenging" [...] {{to take a}} classic novel and set it in outer space, and that they did away {{with some of the}} science fiction elements ("things like the metal space ships and the coldness") early on. Edwards goes on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> [...] "did {{a lot of things to}} make the film more modern" [...] and that the idea behind setting the film in outer space was to [...] "make the story as exciting for kids now as the book was for kids then".|$|E
500|$|Crawford starred as Blanche Hudson, an old, wheelchair-bound former A-list {{movie star}} {{who lives in}} fear of her {{psychotic}} sister Jane, in the highly successful psychological thriller What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962). Despite the actresses' earlier tensions, Crawford reportedly suggested Bette Davis {{for the role of}} Jane. The two stars maintained publicly that there was no feud between them. The director, Robert Aldrich, explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers and commented, [...] "It's proper <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> really detested each other, but they behaved absolutely perfectly." ...|$|E
500|$|Any given {{organisation}} {{cannot be}} easily {{reduced to a}} particular form of power. For instance, the police and army are quite obviously instruments of force and coercion, {{but it would be}} facile <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have power simply because of their ability to physically coerce. Rather, the police are regarded as instruments of a legitimate institution by some population, and the organisation depends upon propaganda and habit to maintain popular deference to their authority. Similarly, economic organisations operate by the use of conditioning, in the form of money; but the strength of an economy arguably depends in large part on the functional operation of law enforcement which makes commerce possible, by the regulation of peace and property rights. (Russell 1938:25,95) ...|$|E
