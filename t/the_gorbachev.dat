5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> Era, Brezhnev's {{rule was}} {{considered}} less successful {{than that of}} Joseph Stalin; in an opinion measurement poll only 7 percent chose the Brezhnev Era as good, while 10 percent picked the Stalin Era as good. Following {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union and Boris Yeltsin's subsequent market reforms, many Russians viewed the Brezhnev era with nostalgia; they missed the stability of that era which had subsequently been lost during <b>the</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> and Yeltsin eras.|$|E
5|$|Ryzhkov was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of <b>the</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> policy calling {{for an increase in}} {{the quantity and quality of}} goods planned for production during the period of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (19861990). To achieve these goals, the government pumped money into the machine-building sector but as time went by, Gorbachev increasingly diverged from his original stance. He now wanted to increase overall investment in nearly all industrial sectors; a move which Ryzhkov knew was a budgetary impossibility. However, Ryzhkov's economic policies were not much better as he continued to advocate an unreasonable increase in the production of consumer goods. Gorbachev and Ligachev's anti-alcohol campaign was opposed by Ryzhkov, who agreed with the State Planning Committee and the Ministry of Trade that such a drive would deprive from the state billions of rubles in income. Nevertheless, the campaign went ahead, losing the Soviet Government millions in revenues. Ryzhkov's opposition to the campaign was strengthened by his belief that both Gorbachev and Ligachev placed ideology before practical considerations, and he instead advocated an alternative long-term program rather than one designed to have immediate effect.|$|E
25|$|Gorbachev's {{policy of}} glasnost (literally openess) meant the gradual {{democratisation}} of the party. Because of this, {{the role of}} the Central Committee was strengthened. Several old apparatchiks lost their seats to more open-minded officials during <b>the</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> era. The plan was to make the Central Committee an organ where discussion took place; and in this Gorbachev succeeded.|$|E

He had {{a dispute with}} Rome over the property rights of the Greek-Catholic Church in Ukraine, which had emerged from Soviet control after <b>the</b> <b>Gorbachev's</b> liberalisation of Russia. He nevertheless had good relations with Latin-rite Christians in France and was friends with Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, who invited him to the country shortly before his death.|$|R
25|$|From 1902 to 1933, the {{historian}} of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, Dmytro Yavornytsky, was Director of the Dnipro Museum, which was later named after him. Before his death in 1940, Yavornytsky wrote a History of the City of Ekaterinoslav, which lay in manuscript for many years.

25|$|Since his resignation, Gorbachev has {{remained}} involved in world affairs. He founded <b>the</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> Foundation in 1992, headquartered in Moscow.

25|$|The late 1980s, during <b>the</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> era, were {{characterized}} by increasing unrest in the Caucasus, initially over the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. The ethnic strife revealed the shortcomings of the Communist Party {{as a champion of}} national interests and, in the spirit of glasnost, independent publications and political organizations began to emerge. Of these organizations, by far the most prominent was the Popular Front of Azerbaijan (PFA), which by the fall of 1989 seemed poised to take power from the Communist Party. Soon, the movement for the independence from the USSR started off, of which the PFA rose as one of the major leaders.|$|E

25|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> era, {{a variety}} of {{departments}} made up the Central Committee apparatus. The Party Building and Cadre Work Department assigned party personnel in the nomenklatura system. The State and Legal Department supervised the armed forces, KGB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the trade unions, and the Procuracy. Before 1989 the Central Committee had several departments, but several were abolished in that year. Among these departments there was a Central Committee Department responsible for {{the economy as a}} whole, one for machine building, and one for the chemical industry, and so on. The party abolished these departments in an effort to remove itself from the day-to-day management of the economy in favor of government bodies and a greater role for the market, {{as a part of the}} perestroika process.|$|E

25|$|Afraid {{that the}} {{movement}} would now spin out of control, Deng Xiaoping asked that the Square be cleared for <b>the</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> visit. Executing Deng's request, Zhao used a soft approach, and directed his subordinates to coordinate negotiations with students immediately. Zhao believed he could appeal to the students' patriotism, and that the students understood signs of internal turmoil during the Sino-Soviet summit would embarrass the nation (not just the government). On the morning of 13 May, Yan Mingfu, head of the Communist Party's United Front, called an emergency meeting, gathering prominent student leaders and intellectuals, including Liu Xiaobo, Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao. Yan said the government was prepared to hold immediate dialogue with student representatives, but that the Tiananmen welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev would be cancelled whether the students withdraw or not—in effect removing the bargaining power the students thought they possessed. The announcement sent the student leadership into disarray.|$|E
25|$|The {{students}} {{remained in}} the Square during <b>the</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> visit; his welcoming ceremony {{was held at the}} airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, {{the first of its kind}} in some thirty years, marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. That the smooth proceedings of this event had been derailed by the student movement embarrassed the leadership on the global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more 'hardliner' path. The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the Great Hall of the People amidst the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square. When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told the Soviet leader, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the 'paramount authority' in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. The statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.|$|E
500|$|Gennady Ivanovich Yanayev ( [...] ; 26 August 1937 – 24 September 2010) was a Soviet {{politician}} {{who served as}} the first and only Vice President of the Soviet Union.

After years in local politics, he rose to prominence as Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, but he also held other lesser posts such as deputy of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.|$|E

Born in the city of Moscow, then part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Pavlov began his political career in the Ministry of Finance in 1959. Later, during the Brezhnev Era, he became head of the Financial Department of the State Planning Committee. Pavlov was appointed to the post of Chairman of the State Committee on Prices during <b>the</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> Era, and later became Minister of Finance in Nikolai Ryzhkov's second government.

2500|$|In September 1987 {{an amnesty}} was {{announced}} by <b>the</b> <b>Gorbachev</b> Politburo, but it required individual prisoners {{to write an}} appeal for clemency, and to sign a statement promising not to commit [...] "illegal" [...] behavior in the future, before they were freed.
