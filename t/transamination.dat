25|$|If {{the amino}} group {{is removed from}} an amino acid, it leaves behind a carbon {{skeleton}} called an α-keto acid. Enzymes called transaminases can easily transfer the amino group from one amino acid (making it an α-keto acid) to another α-keto acid (making it an amino acid). This {{is important in the}} biosynthesis of amino acids, as for many of the pathways, intermediates from other biochemical pathways are converted to the α-keto acid skeleton, and then an amino group is added, often via <b>transamination.</b> The amino acids may then be linked together to make a protein.|$|E
25|$|The BCKA decarboxylase enzyme is {{composed}} of two subunits in a tetrameric structure (A2B2) and {{is essential for the}} synthesis of branched-chain fatty acids. It is responsible for the decarboxylation of α-keto acids formed by the <b>transamination</b> of valine, leucine, and isoleucine and produces the primers used for branched-chain fatty acid synthesis. The activity of this enzyme is much higher with branched-chain α-keto acid substrates than with straight-chain substrates, and in Bacillus species its specificity is highest for the isoleucine-derived α-keto-β-methylvaleric acid, followed by α-ketoisocaproate and α-ketoisovalerate. The enzyme’s high affinity toward branched-chain α-keto acids allows it to function as the primer donating system for branched-chain fatty acid synthetase.|$|E
25|$|The {{branched-chain}} {{fatty acid}} synthesizing system uses α-keto acids as primers. This system {{is distinct from}} the branched-chain fatty acid synthetase that utilizes short-chain acyl-CoA esters as primers. α-Keto acid primers are derived from the <b>transamination</b> and decarboxylation of valine, leucine, and isoleucine to form 2-methylpropanyl-CoA, 3-methylbutyryl-CoA, and 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively. 2-Methylpropanyl-CoA primers derived from valine are elongated to produce even-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 14-methyl-pentadecanoic (isopalmitic) acid, and 3-methylbutyryl-CoA primers from leucine {{may be used to}} form odd-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 13-methyl-tetradecanoic acid. 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA primers from isoleucine are elongated to form anteiso-series fatty acids containing an odd number of carbon atoms such as 12-Methyl tetradecanoic acid. Decarboxylation of the primer precursors occurs through the branched-chain α-keto acid decarboxylase (BCKA) enzyme. Elongation of the fatty acid follows the same biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli used to produce straight-chain fatty acids where malonyl-CoA is used as a chain extender. The major end products are 12–17 carbon branched-chain fatty acids and their composition tends to be uniform and characteristic for many bacterial species.|$|E
40|$|Four {{aminotransferases}} {{were identified}} and characterized from Methanococcus aeolicus. Branched-chain aminotransferase (BcAT, EC 2. 6. 1. 42), aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT, EC 2. 6. 1. 1), and two aromatic aminotransferases (EC 2. 6. 1. 57) were partially purified 175 -, 84 -, 600 -, and 30 -fold, respectively. The apparent molecular weight, substrate specificity, and kinetic properties of the BcAT {{were similar to those}} of other microbial BcATs. The AspAT had an apparent molecular weight of 162, 000, which was unusually high. It had also a broad substrate specificity, which included activity towards alanine, a property which resembled the enzyme from Sulfolobus solfataricus. An additional alanine aminotransferase was not found in M. aeolicus, and this activity of AspAT could be physiologically significant. The apparent molecular weights of the aromatic aminotransferases (ArAT-I and ArAT-II) were 150, 000 and 90, 000, respectively. The methanococcal ArATs also had different pIs and kinetic constants. ArAT-I may be the major ArAT in methanococci. High concentrations of 2 -ketoglutarate strongly inhibited valine, isoleucine, and alanine <b>transaminations</b> but were less inhibitory for leucine and aspartate <b>transaminations.</b> Aromatic amino acid <b>transaminations</b> were not inhibited by 2 -ketoglutarate. 2 -Ketoglutarate may {{play an important role in}} the regulation of amino acid biosynthesis in methanococci...|$|R
50|$|The {{bacteria}} Stapylococcus carnosus and Enterococcus faecalis {{are often}} used in tandem with other lactic acid bacterium to begin the meat fermentation process. BCATs in these two bacteria perform <b>transaminations</b> during meat fermentation, producing the corresponding α-ketoacids from amino acids.

Both {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} (NAD) EC 1.4.1.2] and {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADP) dependent GluDH [...] enzymes are present in Plasmodia; the NAD-dependent GluDH is relatively unstable and not useful for diagnostic purposes. Glutamate dehydrogenase provides an oxidizable carbon source used for the production of energy as well as a reduced electron carrier, NADH. Glutamate is a principal amino donor to other amino acids in subsequent <b>transamination</b> reactions. The multiple roles of glutamate in nitrogen balance make it a gateway between free ammonia and the amino groups of most amino acids. Its crystal structure is published. The GluDH activity in P.vivax, P.ovale and P. malariae has never been tested, but given the importance of GluDH as a branch point enzyme, every cell must have a high concentration of GluDH. It is well known that enzymes with a high molecular weight (like GluDH) have many isozymes, which allows strain differentiations (given the right monoclonal antibody).

40|$|A soluble, stable, L-glutamine:aminocyclitol aminotransferase {{has been}} {{purified}} 100 -fold from mature mycelia of the gentamicin producer Micromonospora purpurea ATCC 15835. An absorbance maximum at 415 nm indicated {{the presence of}} pyridoxal phosphate in the enzyme; its involvement in the reaction, and hence its location at the active site, was indicated by abolition of the absorbance maximum upon addition of amino donors, and its restoration upon addition of amino acceptors. In addition, inhibition of the aminotransferase activity by carbonyl reagents was partially reversed by pyridoxal phosphate but not pyridoxal, confirming the importance of pyridoxal phosphate for reactivity. The keto-acid reaction product of <b>transaminations</b> with L-glutamine was identified as 2 -ketoglutaramate, which exists in equilibrium with the inactive lactam, 2 -hydroxy- 5 -oxoproline. Substrate specificity studies indicated that this aminotransferase is distinct from the commonly encountered aminotransferases since it did not readily catalyze <b>transaminations</b> with L-glutamate, L-aspartate, L-alanine, 2 -ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate, or pyruvate. Active as amino donors were N(' 3) -methyl- 2 -deoxystreptamine, 2 -deoxystreptamine, streptamine, scyllo-inosamine, and L-glutamine. Active as amino acceptors were scyllo-inosose, D,L-epi-inosose, and 2 -ketoglutaramate. This aminotransferase preparation was able to catalyze <b>transaminations</b> which are compatible with both aminotransferase steps in the 2 -deoxystreptamine biosynthetic pathway. Appearance of the enzyme during growth of M. purpurea, plus the substrate specificity, indicated that this aminotransferase is an idiophase enzyme, specific for 2 -deoxystreptamine biosynthesis. A 2 -deoxystreptamine-less idiotroph, M. purpurea ATCC 31119, was examined and found to be an excellent alternative source for the purification of this aminotransferase. The L-glutamine:aminocyclitol aminotransferase from crude extracts of idiophase cells of the neomycin producer, Streptomyces fradiae ATCC 10745, exhibited a substrate specificity {{very similar to that}} of the aminotransferase from M. purpurea. In addition, a 2 -ketoglutaramate-hydrolyzing amidase activity was identified in both M. purpurea and S. fradiae.

40|$|Abstract: Coenzyme B 6 is an {{important}} cofactor participating in many diverse biotransformations. W e the function of this coenzyme in enzyme catalysis has been well established, recent studies have led to two novel coenzyme B 6 -dependent reactions whose catalyses involve unique mechanistic variants of usual coenzyme B 6 chemistry. These are a C- 0 bond cleavage and a C-C bond cleavage reaction catalyzed by CDP- 6 -deoxy-L-threo-D-glycero- 4 -hexulose- 3 -dehydrase (El) and 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate deaminase (ACC deaminase), respectively. Enzyme El is the only known pyridoxamine 5 '-phosphate (PMP) dependent iron-sulfur containing dehydratase, {{and it is one}} of a few &dependent enzymes with a radical mechanism.

40|$|Hindquarters from starved rats were perfused without {{substrates}} but in {{the presence}} of an O 2 - and CO 2 -carrying perfluorocarbon emulsion to evaluate principally the metabolism of individual endogenous and protein-derived amino acids by this muscle preparation. This experimental model was shown, by a battery of metabolite measurements, to maintain cellular homoeostasis for at least 2 h. The net appearance of most amino acids closely approximated their frequency of occurrence in muscle proteins, showing that they are not significantly metabolized. Exceptions were the branched-chain amino acids, methionine and those amino acids that are interconvertible with intermediates of the citrate cycle and pyruvate through coupled <b>transaminations.</b> The evidence indicates that only valine, isoleucine, aspartate and probably methionine can be catabolized by skeletal muscle to provide carbon precursors for glutamate/glutamine and alanine that are formed de novo by protein-catabolic muscle.

Although each decreased proteolysis and the net appearance of free amino acids, they were generally without effect on the ratios of amino acids formed. 2 -Chloro- 4 -methylvalerate selectively stimulated the removal rate for the branched-chain amino acids, confirming the idea that the branched-chain oxo acid dehydrogenase normally limits the rate of their oxidation by muscle.

No NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD–IDH) activity was recorded in cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs). ALT, AST, NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydro-genase (NADP–IDH) and MDH enzymatic units remained constant in cumulus cells and oocytes during IVM. Specific activities increased in oocytes and decreased in cumulus cells as a result of IVM (P < 0. 05). Similar activity of both transaminases was detected in cumulus cells, unlike in the oocyte, in which activity of AST was 4. 4 times greater than that of ALT (P < 0. 05). High NADP–IDH and MDH activity was detected in the oocyte. Addition of alanine, aspart-ate, isocitrate + NADP, oxaloacetate or malate + NAD to maturation media increased the percentage of denuded oocytes reaching maturation (P < 0. 05), in contrast to COCs in which differences were not observed by addition of these substrates and co-enzymes.

40|$|A {{model for}} the origin of {{biochemistry}} at an alkaline hydrothermal vent has been developed {{that focuses on the}} acetyl-CoA (Wood–Ljungdahl) pathway of CO 2 fixation and central intermediary metabolism leading to the synthesis of the constituents of purines and pyrimidines. The idea that acetogenesis and methanogenesis were the ancestral forms of energy metabolism among the first free-living eubacteria and archaebacteria, respectively, stands in the foreground. The synthesis of formyl pterins, which are essential intermediates of the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway and purine biosynthesis, is found to confront early metabolic systems with steep bioenergetic demands that would appear to link some, but not all, steps of CO 2 reduction to geochemical processes in or on the Earth's crust. Inorganically catalysed prebiotic analogues of the core biochemical reactions involved in pterin-dependent methyl synthesis of the modern acetyl-CoA pathway are considered. The following compounds appear as probable candidates for central involvement in prebiotic chemistry: metal sulphides, formate, carbon monoxide, methyl sulphide, acetate, formyl phosphate, carboxy phosphate, carbamate, carbamoyl phosphate, acetyl thioesters, acetyl phosphate, possibly carbonyl sulphide and eventually pterins. Carbon might have entered early metabolism via reactions hardly different from those in the modern Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, the pyruvate synthase reaction and the incomplete reverse citric acid cycle. The key energy-rich intermediates were perhaps acetyl thioesters, with acetyl phosphate possibly serving as the universal metabolic energy currency prior to the origin of genes. Nitrogen might have entered metabolism as geochemical NH 3 via two routes: the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate and reductive <b>transaminations</b> of α-keto acids. Together with intermediates of methyl synthesis, these two routes of nitrogen assimilation would directly supply all intermediates of modern purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis.

Metabolic responses to substitution of fishery products have been shown to impact growth performance and immune system of fish as well as their subsequent nutritional value, particularly in marine fish species, which exhibit low capacity for biosynthesis of long-chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA). The main objective {{of the present study was}} to analyse the effects of a plant-based diet on the hepatic transcriptome of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Results We report the first results obtained using a transcriptomic approach on the liver of two half-sibfamilies of the European sea bass that exhibit similar growth rates when fed a fish-based diet (FD), but significantly different growth rates when fed an all-plant diet (VD). Overall gene expression was analysed using oligo DNA microarrays (GPL 9663). Statistical analysis identified 582 unique annotated genes differentially expressed between groups of fish fed the two diets, 199 genes regulated by genetic factors, and 72 genes that exhibited diet-family interactions. The expression of several genes involved in the LC-PUFA and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways was found to be up-regulated in fish fed VD, suggesting a stimulation of the lipogenic pathways. No significant diet-family interaction for the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis pathways could be detected by microarray analysis. This result was in agreement with LC-PUFA profiles, which were found to be similar in the flesh of the two half-sibfamilies. In addition, the combination of our transcriptomic data with an analysis of plasmatic immune parameters revealed a stimulation of complement activity associated with an immunodeficiency in the fish fed VD, and different inflammatory status between the two half-sibfamilies. Biological processes related to protein catabolism, amino acid <b>transaminations,</b> RNA splicing and blood coagulation were also found to be regulated by diet, while the expression of genes involved in protein and ATP synthesis differed between the half-sibfamilies.
