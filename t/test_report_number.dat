40|$|Evidence from self-consistent {{solar system}} n-body {{simulations}} {{is presented to}} argue that the Earth-Moon system (EM) plays an important dynamical role in the inner solar system, stabilizing the orbits of Venus and Mercury by suppressing a strong secular resonance of period 8. 1 Myr near VenusÏs helio-centric distance. The EM thus appears to play a kind of “ “ gravitational keystone ÏÏ role in the terrestrial precinct, for without it, the orbits of Venus and Mercury become immediately destabilized. The mecha-nism of the resonance, driven by the giant planets, is described. Approximate limits are provided for the mass and heliocentric distance required of EM to perform this role, and results from several additional empirical <b>tests</b> are <b>reported.</b> A <b>number</b> of avenues of further investigation are suggested.

40|$|Presented at the 25 th Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference. 2009. Miami, FL, USA. The International Organization for Standardization defines {{tests that}} {{characterize}} the properties of wheelchair cushions (ISO 16840 - 2). The impact damping test (IDT) characterizes cushions' abilities to reduce impact loading on tissues and to help maintain postural stability. The ISO <b>test</b> <b>reports</b> the <b>number</b> of rebounds greater than 10 % of the peak impact acceleration and {{the ratio of the}} second to first rebound acceleration {{in order to determine the}} damping properties. We performed IDTs on three different wheelchair cushions: 3 " elastic foam (EF), 3 " viscoelastic foam (VEF), and a 3 " laminar cushion (LC); a viscous fluid bladder on the top of an elastic foam. The LC had two rebounds greater than 10 % of the peak acceleration while the EF and VEF had one. The LC had high-est ratio (0. 48) followed by the EF (0. 29) and the VEF (0. 25). According to ISO, these results indicate that EF and VEF dampen impacts quicker than LC and have superior abilities to help maintain postural stability. Based upon this analysis, three critical issues about the ISO IDT have been identified. The first is the ISO should incorporate impact magnitude in the analysis, since impact loading on tissues is a stated purpose. The second is the ISO should use impact instead of re-bound accelerations. Results show that nonlinear responses are evident in rebounds in all three cushions. The third issue is that oscillation from impact is not a simple second order damped harmonic. Analysis showed that three to five natural frequencies are embedded in the damped harmonic oscillation, so simple ratios of accelerations do not represent the damping properties of cushions. In conclusion, the ISO IDT should utilize impact accelerations and employ more complex analysis to better characterize the damping properties of wheelchair cushions...|$|R

40|$|Crowdsourcing is an {{appealing}} and economic solution to software application testing {{because of its}} ability to reach a large international audience. Meanwhile, crowdsourced testing could have brought a lot of bug reports. Thus, in crowdsourced software testing, the inspection of a large <b>number</b> of <b>test</b> <b>reports</b> is an enormous but essential software maintenance task. Therefore, automatic prediction of the severity of crowdsourced <b>test</b> <b>reports</b> is important because of their high numbers and large proportion of noise. Most existing approaches to this problem utilize supervised machine learning techniques, which often require users to manually label a large number of training data. However, Android <b>test</b> <b>reports</b> are not labeled with their severity level, and manual labeling is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the above problems, we propose a Knowledge Transfer Classification (KTC) approach based on text mining and machine learning methods to predict the severity of <b>test</b> <b>reports.</b> Our approach obtains training data from bug repositories and uses knowledge transfer to predict the severity of Android <b>test</b> <b>reports.</b> In addition, our approach uses an Importance Degree Reduction (IDR) strategy based on rough set to extract characteristic keywords to obtain more accurate reduction results. The results of several experiments indicate that our approach is beneficial for predicting the severity of android <b>test</b> <b>reports...</b>|$|R
