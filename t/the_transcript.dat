5|$|The NEDD9 {{promoter}} has 2 transcriptional start sites. <b>The</b> <b>transcript</b> variants NM_006403.3 and NM_001142393.1 encode {{proteins that}} have distinct N-termini (MKYK and MWTR, respectively). In mouse, the two alternative first exons are MKYK and MWAR. Their function is not known. NM_001142393 initiates translation at an upstream location compared to NM_006403.3, but both transcripts have 7 exons. Shorter transcripts with missing exons or an alternative 3' terminal exon {{have been detected}} in various studies; however, {{their role in the}} cell is unclear.|$|E
5|$|The RNA is {{typically}} cleaved before transcription termination, as CstF also binds to RNA polymerase II. Through a poorly understood mechanism (as of 2002), it signals for RNA polymerase II to slip off of <b>the</b> <b>transcript.</b> Cleavage also involves the protein CFII, {{though it is}} unknown how. The cleavage site associated with a polyadenylation signal can vary up to some 50 nucleotides.|$|E
5|$|Three prime untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of {{messenger}} RNAs (mRNAs) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally cause RNA interference. Such 3'-UTRs often contain both binding {{sites for}} microRNAs (miRNAs) {{as well as}} for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of <b>the</b> <b>transcript.</b> The 3'-UTR also may have silencer regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of a mRNA.|$|E

5|$|In October 1971, the {{journalist}} Numa Sadoul conducted a wide-ranging interview with Hergé, {{in which the}} latter opened up about {{many of the problems}} he had experienced in his personal life. Sadoul planned to publish the interview as a book, but Hergé made many alterations to <b>the</b> <b>transcript,</b> both to improve its prose and to remove sections which cast him in a negative light. Editors at Casterman then removed even further sections, particularly those in which Hergé expressed a negative view of Catholicism. The interview was published as Tintin et moi ("Tintin and I") in 1975. Hergé followed this by agreeing to be the subject of a documentary film produced by Henri Roane, Moi, Tintin ("I, Tintin"), which premiered in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Strauss and Senator Brien McMahon, {{author of}} the 1946 McMahon Act, pushed Eisenhower to revoke Oppenheimer's {{security}} clearance. On December 21, 1953, Strauss told Oppenheimer that his security clearance had been suspended, pending resolution {{of a series of}} charges outlined in a letter, and discussed his resigning. Oppenheimer chose not to resign and requested a hearing instead. The charges were outlined in a letter from Kenneth D. Nichols, General Manager of the AEC. The hearing that followed in April–May 1954, which was initially confidential and not made public, focused on Oppenheimer's past Communist ties and his association during the Manhattan Project with suspected disloyal or Communist scientists. The US Department of Energy made public the full text of <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> in October 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} by Brazil's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos, CENIPA). Data from the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were downloaded by the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States commencing July 20 and 23 respectively. Based on preliminary data from the FDR, on July 25 Airbus cautioned A320 operators to ensure that both thrust levers are set to idle during flare. <b>The</b> <b>transcript</b> of the CVR was released on August 1. It shows that the pilots were aware of the wet runway conditions and the deactivated thrust reverser.

To {{find out if}} <b>the</b> unpublished <b>transcripts</b> contained cues, Marks and Kammann wrote to Targ and Puthoff requesting copies. It is almost unheard of for a scientist to refuse to provide his data for independent examination when asked, but Targ and Puthoff consistently refused to allow Marks and Kammann to see copies of <b>the</b> <b>transcripts.</b> Marks and Kammann were, however, able to obtain copies of <b>the</b> <b>transcripts</b> from <b>the</b> judge who used them. <b>The</b> <b>transcripts</b> were found to contain a wealth of cues.|$|R
50|$|Roberts was {{hampered}} {{in writing}} Book 2 {{by the absence}} of two court-martial transcripts: the trial of Lieutenant Stevens (who was the leader of the troops that took the food away from Fort Wentworth in Book 1) and the trial of Rogers himself, which was a key element in Book 2. <b>The</b> <b>transcripts</b> had been lost for over one hundred years, and several historians had claimed that <b>the</b> <b>transcripts</b> had been suppressed by Rogers' allies such as Amherst to cover up embarrassing details about Rogers. Roberts, however, believed that <b>the</b> <b>transcripts</b> had probably been destroyed by Rogers' enemies, Gage and Johnson, and that copies still might exist at the Colonial Office in England. To that end, he hired a full-time English researcher to hunt for <b>the</b> <b>transcripts.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{testimony}} of Henry Davis and Oscar Davis's sons proved damning, and several witnesses also testified {{that they had}} heard Waller declare he would come home with his wheat or kill Oscar Davis. In an analysis of <b>the</b> <b>transcript,</b> Sherman proposes that the phrasing of these witnesses was so similar {{that they may have}} been coached by prosecutors, but the defense counsel did not pursue this possibility. On September 27, 1940, after less than an hour's deliberation, the jury found Waller guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to death, a verdict praised by the Virginia press covering the trial. His execution was scheduled for December 27 of that year.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale {{continued}} to be hailed as a relevant writer during the ten years following his death, and his wors went through new critical editions. Pajere was published in spring 1936, having been edited by Marica Caragiale-Sion and Alexandru Rosetti. Later in the year, a volume of collected works, Opere, was published by Rosetti and featured prints made by Mateiu Caragiale at various moments during his lifetime. Large portions of the diaries kept by Mateiu Caragiale are lost. <b>The</b> <b>transcript</b> made by Perpessicius was criticized for having selectively discarded much content, while originals kept by Rosetti were mysteriously lost during the Legionnaires' Rebellion of 1941. Additional notes, which notably featured Caragiale's criticism of his father, were preserved for a while by Șerban Cioculescu, before being borrowed to Ecaterina Logadi, Ion Luca's daughter, and never recovered. A significant number of his drawings and paintings, which Vianu assumed had survived by 1936, have also been misplaced.|$|E
5|$|Stephenie Meyer {{says that}} the idea for Twilight came {{to her in a}} dream on June 2, 2003. The dream was about a human girl, and a vampire who was in love with her but thirsted for her blood. Based on this dream, Meyer wrote <b>the</b> <b>transcript</b> of what is now chapter 13 of the book. Despite having very little writing experience, in a matter of three months she had {{transformed}} that dream into a completed novel. After writing and editing the novel, she signed a three-book deal with Little, Brown and Company for $750,000, an unusually high amount for a first time author. Meyer's literary agent, Jodi Reamer of Writers House, discovered her only because the inexperienced assistant who received Meyer's original letter did not know that young adult books are supposed to be 40,000 to 60,000 words in length, not 130,000 words. Megan Tingley, the Little, Brown editor who signed Meyer, said that halfway through the reading of the Twilight manuscript, she realized that she had a future bestseller in her hands. The book was released in 2005.|$|E

40|$|Transcription of the clpP-clpX operon of Escherichia coli {{leads to}} the {{production}} of two different sizes of transcripts. In log phase, the level of <b>the</b> longer <b>transcript</b> is higher than the level of <b>the</b> shorter <b>transcript.</b> Soon after <b>the</b> onset of carbon starvation, the level of <b>the</b> shorter <b>transcript</b> increases significantly, and the level of <b>the</b> longer <b>transcript</b> decreases. <b>The</b> longer <b>transcript</b> consists of <b>the</b> entire clpP-clpX operon, whereas <b>the</b> shorter <b>transcript</b> contains <b>the</b> entire clpP gene but none of the clpX coding sequence. The RpoH protein is required for the increase in the level of <b>the</b> shorter <b>transcript</b> during carbon starvation. Primer extension experiments suggest that there is increased usage of the ς 32 -dependent promoter of the clpP-clpX operon within 15 min after the start of carbon starvation. Expression of the clpP-clpX operon from the promoters upstream of the clpP gene decreases to a very low level by 20 min after the onset of carbon starvation. Various pieces of evidence suggest, though they do not conclusively prove, that production of <b>the</b> shorter <b>transcript</b> may involve premature termination of <b>the</b> longer <b>transcript.</b> <b>The</b> half-life of <b>the</b> shorter <b>transcript</b> is much less than that of <b>the</b> longer <b>transcript</b> during carbon starvation. E. coli rpoB mutations that affect transcription termination efficiency alter the ratio of <b>the</b> shorter clpP-clpX <b>transcript</b> to <b>the</b> longer <b>transcript.</b> <b>The</b> E. coli rpoB 3595 mutant, with an RNA polymerase that terminates transcription with lower efficiency than the wild type, accumulates a lower percentage of <b>the</b> shorter <b>transcript</b> during carbon starvation than does the isogenic wild-type strain. In contrast, the rpoB 8 mutant, with an RNA polymerase that terminates transcription with higher efficiency than the wild type, produces a higher percentage of <b>the</b> shorter clpP-clpX <b>transcript</b> when E. coli is in log phase. These and other data are consistent with the hypothesis that <b>the</b> shorter <b>transcript</b> results from premature transcription termination during production of <b>the</b> longer <b>transcript...</b>|$|R
