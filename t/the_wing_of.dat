The first mystery is established when her friend Parker Lee (Julie Gonzalo) becomes the latest victim of the Hearst serial rapist in a storyline begun in a second-season episode. Feeling guilty for not helping her, Veronica sets herself to catching the rapist. The next mystery, a murder, commences in the same episode that {{the identity of the}} rapist is discovered.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Laighton {{says that}} the artist who adorned Trinity Church in New York with {{sculpture}} wanted some real wings from which to imitate <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> cherubim.

5|$|A {{speculator}} to {{his very}} core, Little never put away {{any of his}} fortune {{to prepare for a}} rainy day; any money he made on the stock market, he immediately invested back into it. Thus when the Panic of 1857 destroyed his investment fortune, Little was left penniless. He would live out {{the rest of his life}} under <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> his last protége, David Groesbeck. Little was only ever able to make small trading returns to the market in his later years, and the magnitude of his fall was often the target of mockery from his former peers. He died a broken man. Little died on March 28, 1865, and his funeral was held on March 31 at New York's Grace Church. His pall-bearers included Jesse Hoyt and Edward Prime; Reverend Thomas House Taylor officiated at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|Back in 1959 a Laotian Lieutenant Colonel of the {{minority}} Hmong tribe had been taken under <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the CIA effort in Laos. The highland Hmong were more aggressive than the lowland Lao and Vang Pao was quickly elevated to their leadership in hopes of creating a paramilitary force that would counter the Pathet Lao in the northeast. During 1961, the first weapons were delivered to the Hmong and their training was begun. Nine CIA specialists, nine U.S. Army Special Forces personnel, and 99 Thai members of the Police Aerial Reconnaissance Unit (PARU) participated in the training and equipping of {{what became known as}} the Armée Clandestine or the secret army.|$|E
5|$|Butlin's, {{the holiday}} camp giant {{purchased}} No. 46229 Duchess of Hamilton following {{the withdrawal of}} this locomotive in February 1964 and it was put {{on display at the}} Minehead holiday camp. In 1975, following a slow deterioration due to the Minehead's salty atmosphere and the looming maintenance costs, Butlin's signed a twenty-year loan agreement for it to be taken under <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the National Railway Museum. In 1976, following a cosmetic overhaul, No. 46229 was put on static display in the museum's York premises. In due course a fundraising appeal allowed an overhaul to take place as a precursor to letting the locomotive operate on the national rail network once more.|$|E

5|$|The 747-500X concept {{featured}} {{an increased}} fuselage length of 18ft (5.5m) to 250ft (76.2m) long, and the aircraft was to carry 462 passengers over a range up to 8,700nautical miles (10,000mi, 16,100km), with a gross weight of over 1.0Mlb (450tonnes). The 747-600X concept featured a greater stretch to 279ft (85m) with seating for 548 passengers, {{a range of}} up to 7,700nmi (8,900mi, 14,300km), and a gross weight of 1.2Mlb (540tonnes). A third study concept, the 747-700X, would have combined <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the 747-600X with a widened fuselage, allowing it to carry 650 passengers over the same range as a 747-400. The cost of the changes from previous 747 models, in particular the new wing for the 747-500X and -600X, {{was estimated to be}} more than US$5billion. Boeing was not able to attract enough interest to launch the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{tells the}} arrival of Merlin (Colin Morgan) {{as a young man}} in Camelot, where magic is banned by King Uther Pendragon (Anthony Head). Taken under <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> Camelot's physician, Gaius (Richard Wilson), he is warned that he must keep his innate magical ability a secret. In Camelot, he meets Uther's heir, the arrogant Prince Arthur (Bradley James), as well as Lady Morgana (Katie McGrath) and her handmaid, Guinevere (Angel Coulby). As a witch (Eve Myles) plans revenge on the King's heir for the {{execution}} of her son, Merlin is informed by a cryptic dragon (John Hurt) that his destiny is to protect Arthur.|$|E
5|$|After Gallagher's {{team had}} {{returned}} to the Special Forces Camp, Van Cleeff waited on the runway for two minutes to extract the survivors, but when nobody appeared he pulled the throttle and took off. As soon as Van Cleeff's aircraft was airborne, another C-130 pilot reported to General McLaughlin that the evacuation had been completed, and the facility could now be destroyed at will. Van Cleeff quickly notified all aircraft in the vicinity that he had just reinserted the CCT. Gallagher's team searched the Special Forces compound, the Americal Division battalion command post, and the artillery compound, but everybody either had been evacuated or was dead. Additionally, Khâm Đức was in North Vietnamese hands, so Gallagher and the other two men ran to the ditch beside the runway, where they tried to make contact with the aircraft overhead, but the radio was disabled along with all other equipment. While waiting for a miracle, members of the CCT clashed with North Vietnamese troops who had set up a machine gun position beneath <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> Delmore's crashed C-130, and successfully disabled their opponent's weapon.|$|E

5000|$|Before the Fall {{semester}} begins, 25 cadets entering their {{sophomore year}} at the Academy are hand-selected from approximately 200 applicants for an upgrade program into <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> <b>of</b> Blue, known informally as the [...] "Wings of Green". In their first semester in AM-491 they fine tune their free fall skills, completing the various stages of advanced military free fall. In the Spring semester the students enter AM-492, where they complete the rigorous training to become jumpmasters, and instruct an AM-490 class {{under the supervision of}} senior cadets on <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> <b>of</b> Blue. After a year <b>of</b> training <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> <b>of</b> Green graduate onto <b>the</b> <b>Wings</b> <b>of</b> Blue and are recognized not only as AM-490 instructors, but qualified aircrew members for the 98th Flying Training Squadron operations.|$|R

5|$|Another {{feature of}} the wing was its washout. The {{trailing}} edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span, the angle of incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the wing roots to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This washout was first featured in <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of the wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E
5|$|During his convalescence, he {{was visited}} by the General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters), Generalleutnant Adolf Galland, who offered Graf command {{of his old}} unit, JG52. Graf {{accepted}} {{with the proviso that}} his Roten Jäger football team went with him. Once criticized for its low scoring rate early in the war, it was now the pre-eminent Geschwader, with over 10,000 victories. His return was celebrated with a welcome dinner at its headquarters in Kraków, southern Poland, on 20 September 1944. He was officially appointed on 1 October. Ongoing weakness in his left arm kept Graf on the ground. In the two years since he had left the Eastern Front, {{the quantity and quality of}} the Soviet pilots had greatly improved, as had their equipment. For the remainder of the war he oversaw his three separated fighter groups shuttled up and down the front, in emergency responses to each new Soviet offensive. Several times the crews had to evacuate as Soviet tanks and artillery were shelling their airfield. The German fuel crisis severely curtailed the amount of flight-time. Consequently, the November total for <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> only 369 Soviet aircraft shot down was the lowest monthly total of the eastern campaign. As the winter weather got worse, the lull allowed Graf to organise a football match between his Roten Jäger and a local Kraków team, watched by 20,000 German soldiers.|$|E
