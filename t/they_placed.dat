Shaza Abdelrahman and Dalia El-Gebaly, veterans of the 2008 tournament, represented Egypt in the duet, where <b>they</b> <b>placed</b> 24th and last. In the team competition, the nation finished seventh out of eight nations, ranking higher than Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Alceste {{entered the}} Adriatic and on 4–5 May, she and Belle Poule {{participated in a}} raid at Parenza, (Istria). Having chased a brig into the harbour, but unable to follow due to the rocks and shallow water, the two frigates stood outside and opened fire on her and the battery {{protecting}} her. After an hour, the brig was forced to move nearer the shore, out of range. At 23:00, the British landed 200 seamen and all their marines on an island nearby, and also landed two 9-pounders and two howitzers that <b>they</b> <b>placed</b> in one battery, and a field piece that <b>they</b> <b>placed</b> further away. From there, {{they were able to}} engage the French in Parenza in a five-hour mutual bombardment. The brig was eventually destroyed and the men and cannons returned to their ships. Belle Poule had one man killed and three wounded, and Alceste had two men killed during the action. All casualties occurred ashore.|$|E

Healy ended the season with 78 runs at 11.14. She also played in two Twenty20 interstate matches. She scored two and made a stumping in the first match, and neither batted nor kept wicket in the latter. New South Wales prevailed in both.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Canadian women's 34-point 4 × 100 m {{freestyle}} relay and 4 × 100 m medley relay teams, Mortimer did not medal. Although her freestyle-relay team clocked 4:38.23 (missing the 2000 Canadian record by 0.22 second), <b>they</b> <b>placed</b> seventh in the finals. With Katarina Roxon, Morgan Bird and Brianna Nelson in the medley relay, Mortimer's team finished seventh and last. Her times of 32.35 for the 50-metre and 1:06.37 for the 100-metre were the fastest for her legs of the events. At the 2012 Olympics, Mortimer's four medals were the most for any Canadian athlete or para-athlete.|$|E
5|$|Fleury {{missed the}} first two months of the season before being reinstated. While out with {{teammates}} in January 2003, he was involved in a drunken brawl with bouncers at a strip club in Columbus, Ohio, that left him bloodied; he has no memory of the night and described it as among the lowest points of his life. He was not suspended, but the incident contributed to a collapse in the standings by the Blackhawks, and <b>they</b> <b>placed</b> him on waivers in March. No team claimed him, and Fleury finished the season with the Blackhawks, recording 12goals and 21assists in 54games. Following the season, in April 2003, he was suspended again by the league for violations of its substance abuse program. The suspension ended his NHL career.|$|E
5|$|In 837, a Muslim army under Abd al-Salam ibn Abd al-Wahhab {{attacked}} Enna, but {{was defeated}} by the Byzantines, and Abd al-Salam himself was taken prisoner. The Muslims responded by reinforcing their position around Enna, which <b>they</b> <b>placed</b> under siege. During the following winter, one of the besiegers discovered an unguarded path leading to the town, allowing the Muslims to take the entire lower town. The Byzantines however managed to maintain control of the citadel, and after negotiations secured a Muslim withdrawal {{in exchange for a}} large ransom.|$|E

5|$|In Halifax he {{was sent}} to Wellington Barracks, the city's peacetime barracks, where he {{wrestled}} freight onto large army vehicles and dug ditches. Tired of the work, Babcock took the opportunity to volunteer for the Royal Canadian Regiment when fifty recruits were called on, claiming that his age was 18. Officials quickly discovered that he was only 16, however, and <b>they</b> <b>placed</b> him in a reserve battalion known as the Boys (or Young Soldiers) Battalion in August 1917. Babcock then undertook an ocean voyage to England and, in Liverpool, he was stationed with the 26th Reserve and sent to Bexhill-on-Sea where he trained with about 1,300 others, about a third of whom were veterans from battles in France.|$|E
5|$|Israel fielded a {{squad of}} two {{synchronized}} swimmers {{to compete in the}} women's duet by virtue of their twelfth-place finish at the FINA Olympic test event in Rio de Janeiro. Anastasia Gloushkov competed in her fourth Olympics, becoming the first Israeli woman to compete in four Olympics. Even though Gloushkov gave birth after the London Olympics, she still trained enough to compete in the Rio Olympics. The duo scored 79.4488 points in the technical routine, placing 20th in that portion. <b>They</b> <b>placed</b> 21st in the free routine, scoring 78.9000 points. Their combined score was 158.3488, garnering 20th place overall. To qualify for the finals, they required a score better than 170.3304 points.|$|E
5|$|Marcelo Weksler {{and colleagues}} removed {{most of the}} species then placed in Oryzomys from the genus in 2006, {{retaining}} only the marsh rice rat and related species, including O.gorgasi. They also kept O.curasoae in the genus and suggested {{that it may not}} be distinct from O.gorgasi. In a 2009 paper, R.S. Voss and Weksler examined the two and concluded that they represented the same species on the basis of direct comparisons and a phylogenetic analysis. The resultant tree placed O.curasoae and O.gorgasi sister to each other and closer to O.couesi than to the marsh rice rat. Accordingly, <b>they</b> <b>placed</b> O.curasoae as a junior synonym of the earlier described O.gorgasi.|$|E

5|$|Members of Task Force Manchu {{who escaped}} from Hill 209 brought back {{considerable}} intelligence information of North Korean {{activity in the}} vicinity of the Paekchin ferry crossing site. At the ferry site the North Koreans had put in an underwater bridge. A short distance downstream, each night <b>they</b> <b>placed</b> a pontoon bridge across the river and took it up before dawn the next morning. Carrying parties of 50 civilians guarded by four North Korean soldiers crossed the river continuously at night, an estimated total of 800-1,000 carriers being used at this crossing site.|$|E
5|$|Soon, all {{the bodies}} except that of Alexey, which was never found, had been recovered. Those {{of the last}} three to die—De Long, Ambler and Ah Sam—were some {{distance}} from the rest, where they had evidently attempted to set up a final camp on higher ground. Melville's party wrapped all the bodies in canvas, and carried them to a hill high enough to be safe from seasonal flooding. There <b>they</b> <b>placed</b> them in a large coffin improvised from driftwood, which they covered with rocks surmounted by a large wooden cross, inscribed with the names of the lost men. Melville's group left the site on April 7, 1882, then spent a further month in the delta, searching without success for signs of Chipp and his crew.|$|E
5|$|The club {{performed}} the pre-game festivities {{for the final}} game of the 1984 World Series at Tiger Stadium, but their performance was overshadowed by scenes of violence and rioting after the game. Their tour bus was set upon by rioters, who vandalised it, while the singers fled to safety. A more favourable appearance occurred the following year when, under the direction of Patrick Gardner, the club undertook a 36-day tour across Europe, which culminated in another appearance at Llangollen, where <b>they</b> <b>placed</b> third.|$|E
