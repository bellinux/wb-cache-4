40|$|We have {{designed}} and constructed {{a machine that}} synthesizes two standard 96 -well plates of oligonucleotides in a single run using standard phosphoramidite chemistry. The machine is capable of making a combination of standard, degenerate, or modified oligos in a single plate. The run time is typically 17 hr for two plates of 20 -mers and a reaction scale of 40 nm. The reaction vessel is a standard polypropylene 96 -well plate with a hole drilled {{in the bottom of}} each well. The <b>two</b> <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> in separate vacuum chucks and mounted on an xy table. Each well in turn is positioned under the appropriate reagent injection line and the reagent is injected by switching a dedicated valve. All aspects of machine operation are controlled by a Macintosh computer, which also guides the user through the startup and shutdown procedures, provides a continuous update on the status of the run, and facilitates a number of service procedures that need to be carried out periodically. Over 25, 000 oligos have been synthesized for use in dye terminator sequencing reactions, polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), hybridization, and RT–PCR. Oligos up to 100 bases in length have been made with a coupling efficiency in excess of 99 %. These machines, working in conjunction with our oligo prediction code are particularly well suited to application in automated high throughput genomic sequencing...|$|E

40|$|Shielding {{principles}} {{are essential for}} guiding the efficient design of effective shields. In this paper, equivalent magnetic dipoles are first introduced to discuss shielding mechanism and characteristics of finite-width metal <b>plates.</b> It <b>is</b> found that the magnetic field contributed by a plate decays with 1 /r(2) or 1 /r(3) generally. Magnetic shielding is effective if both equivalent and source dipoles have the same orientation. Such shielding retains even at infinity. Shielding is ineffective if their orientations are different. In such a case, an edge effect is observed no matter what material the <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> made of. The edge effect of conducting <b>plates</b> can <b>be</b> eliminated if <b>two</b> connected <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> around the source. Shielding against a monopole source is observed in the near region, even with a conductive plate.

Impact of other parameters, such as plate location, size and material, is addressed and interpreted physically using the equivalent dipoles. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the experimental investigations on the load bearing capacity of innovative cold-formed steel members built-up by different steel sheets assembled through mechanical fasteners.

The shape of the beams is finally characterized by web openings and diagonal beads to prevent early buckling phenomena. The experimental investigations, performed through four-point bending tests on full-scale prototypes whose cross section depth is equal to 400 mm, have been carried out in order to assess the influence of different parameters on the strength, stiffness and ductility of the beams. In particular, the effects of different connection spacing on local buckling of the compression flanges have been evaluated. Finally the influence on the structural performances of diagonal beads placed along the web has been also investigated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract For {{efficient}} use of water, accurate measurement of flow in (field/laboratory) channels is required for many water resource projects. The present work is aimed to study the flow characteristics of a twin <b>plate</b> weir (<b>two</b> sharp-crested <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> one behind the other at some distance) under free and submerged flow conditions. Experiments are performed with four spacing of the twin plate weir ranging from 10 cm to 40 cm under free and submerged flow conditions. It was observed that the coefficient of discharge (Cd) {{is a function of}} head over the crest (H 1) and height of the plate of the weir (P) in free flow condition. The critical submergence (H 2 /H 1) increases as the discharge increases, for a particular spacing of the twin plate weir (L). The critical submergence also increases with the increase in the spacing of the weir plates for any discharge. When some material fills the space between the <b>two</b> <b>plates,</b> the Cd increases as the percentage of filling increase. The device may prove quite useful when siltation occurs between the twin plate weirs. The device could be utilized i...|$|R
