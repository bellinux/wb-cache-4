25|$|Barcelona {{is governed}} by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a {{four-year}} term by universal suffrage. As {{one of the two}} biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the Carta Municipal (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006. According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organised in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administrates the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level. This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions. It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city <b>traffic,</b> <b>road</b> safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.|$|E

2500|$|The bridge {{transformed}} Runcorn from {{an effective}} cul-de-sac into {{a town with}} through <b>traffic.</b> <b>Road</b> communications between north Cheshire and south Lancashire were immediately improved. Trade at the Port of Runcorn increased sixfold between 1960 and 1970. The presence of the bridge enabled {{the development of the}} New Town in Runcorn in the late 1960s and the 1970s. The amount of traffic using the bridge trebled between 1961 and 1970; this led to such severe congestion that in 1975 the bridge was widened and the approach roads were improved. The carriageway was widened to incorporate the footpaths, giving it four lanes, and a cantilevered footway was built {{on the east side of}} the bridge. This work was completed in 1977 and in that year the bridge was renamed from Runcorn Bridge to the Silver Jubilee Bridge to commemorate the Queen's Silver Jubilee. [...] Since 1994 the bridge has been illuminated at night by floodlights. Repairs to chloride corrosion of the bridge's deck were carried out in the early 21st century using an innovative electrolytic method; they were shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Award for Better Public Building of 2010.|$|E

Objective: To outline systematically the global distribution of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> deaths by <b>road</b> user groups (pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, motorised four-wheeler occupants). Methods: Comprehensive searches of PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, TransportLink, grey literature and reference lists and communication with experts from international organisations and country-level institutions were conducted to identify eligible studies and data sources. All data sources that provided a breakdown of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> deaths by <b>road</b> user group at the national or sub-national level were eligible for inclusion.

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>traffic</b> {{with its}} share from 2 / 3 to 3 / 4 {{of the total}} volume of {{transport}} service represents rather large and complicated social and production system with several subsystems that include roads, transport facilities, <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> organization, law enforcement, personnel training, <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> service and others. <b>Road</b> <b>traffic</b> quality can be quantitatively evaluated in accordance with values of losses pertaining to social and economic cost of discretionary (unenforced) expenses for <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> process. <b>Road</b> <b>traffic</b> contains accident, ecological, economic and social risks. Accidence is considered {{as the most important}} risk for participants involved in <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> because it directly concerns their life, health and welfare. So accident response has rather high social significance and it is considered as a matter of national importance. In this connection role of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> organization has become very important and it is directed on improvement of its quality including security in the accident clusters. Methodological principles for improvement of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> quality have been developed in the paper. These principles presuppose the following: maximization of danger while selecting investigation object; minimization of total losses while evaluating quality and selecting solutions on improvement in <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> safety; balanced accountability of accidental and ecological losses while selecting solutions on higher <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> safety in ambiguous situations; minimization of total cost pertaining to object operation while selecting measures on improvement of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> safety; obligatory operative control evaluation of accidence on the basis of method for conflict situations while introducing measures of <b>road</b> <b>traffic</b> safety.
