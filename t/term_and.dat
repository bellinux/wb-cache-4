40|$|Thick <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> {{concepts}} in ethics (e. g. selfish, cruel and courageous) somehow combine evaluation and non-evaluative description. The non-evaluative aspects of thick <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> concepts underdetermine their extensions. Many writers {{argue that this}} underdetermination point is best explained by supposing that thick <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> concepts are semantically evaluative in some way such that evaluation {{plays a role in}} determining their extensions. This paper argues that the extensions of thick <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> concepts are underdetermined by their meanings in toto, irrespective of whether their extensions are partly determined by evaluation; the underdetermination point can therefore be explained without supposing that thick <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> concepts are semantically evaluative.
