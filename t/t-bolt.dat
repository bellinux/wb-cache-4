50|$|The type of door will {{determine}} whether it needs its own safety device. The <b>T-bolt</b> door is intrinsically safe, and the ASME code does not mandate an interlock for it. The other door types do require an interlock to prevent the possibility of opening when there is ~½ psi or more inside the vessel. Every autoclave will have this much; it's the absolute least that is legal. However, a prudent autoclave operator {{ought not to be}} willing to settle for the very least that is required. Even the best made components are not perfect, so the conservatively designed autoclave uses backup interlocks in both hardware and control software to reduce risk to the lowest level reasonably attainable. For example, if the control system senses any pressure in the vessel, it blocks the door opening cylinders with fail-safe valves, thus precluding any attempt to bypass the safety interlock manually. This is in addition to the code-mandated interlock. If desired, an additional interlock can be installed on a <b>T-bolt</b> door, too.|$|E
50|$|Within the United States, SAE International {{maintains}} Specification J1508 for thirty-two different {{hose clamp}} designs, including screw, spring, and <b>t-bolt</b> styles. It also maintains Specification J1610 for the testing the sealing of hoses. The US Army TACOM maintains Commercial Item Description (CID) A-A-52506 that {{provides for the}} standardized acquisition of hose clamps by the Department of Defense; the CID references the SAE specifications. The CID superseded Federal Specification WW-C-440 for hose clamps in 1994.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of fast-opening doors {{commonly}} used. The simplest and most primitive type of door, a bolted plate or flanged cap {{on some sort of}} hinge, is no longer considered even minimally acceptable for production autoclaves because it is anything but quick in opening and closing. For vessels up to four feet in diameter and rated at not much over 125 psi, a hinged semi-elliptical door secured by lever-operated cam-locking <b>T-bolts</b> works essentially as quickly and as easily as the more commonly used rotating locking ring door. This door design uses up to a dozen or so latching <b>T-bolts</b> on the door hub (see photos), the stationary part fitted to the cylindrical vessel itself, which engage matching lugs welded to the door. When the operating levers are rotated over center, the <b>T-bolts</b> draw the lugs closer and seal the door by means of an O-ring gasket.|$|R
5000|$|The school's mascot is the Thunderbolt, but its student populace {{are more}} colloquially {{known as the}} <b>T-Bolts</b> or just the Bolts. This moniker was unintentionally gained from a {{basketball}} commentator in the school system's early years (circa 1960s), who, while watching the high school boys' team racing {{back and forth across}} the court, exclaimed that they zipping back and forth like [...] "thunderbolts." ...|$|R
5000|$|Early in the <b>T-Bolts</b> short {{existence}} in Cleveland, John Kuczek was implicated {{in a federal}} securities fraud case in Florida. Prior to the team’s second season in 1993, Kuczek divested himself of ownership in the club {{and placed it in}} a trust for his grandchildren. Son Jeff continued as the front office leader of the organization. Kuczek was ultimately convicted on one count of the indictment. The day before he was due to begin serving his sentence in February 1995, he committed suicide in a Salem, Ohio hotel room.|$|R
5000|$|Manual High School {{graduated}} {{its first}} senior class in 2011 since re-opening from closure {{in the spring}} of 2006. With Manual's graduating class of 2011 the school showed renewed preparation for making students college bound. Manual High School has made a commitment to leave no <b>T-Bolt</b> behind and to do [...] "whatever it takes to ensure that students stay in school and are prepared for success in college, career and in life." ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} door types available. These are {{proprietary}} designs having special characteristics which suit {{them to a}} variety of applications. For example, some door designs are simpler than the locking ring type, having no notched cutouts at all in the locking rings. They are easily operated by hand or power and intrinsically safe, much like the <b>T-bolt</b> configuration, in that any movement of the locking mechanism from closed toward open will release pressure well before the door and hub actually separate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{absence of}} the JSA and of Johnny Thunder did not last long. In 1992 DC {{published}} Armageddon: Inferno, the mini-series which brought the JSA out of limbo and into the post-Crisis world. This was followed by Justice Society of America (1992-1993). This series showed how the heroes were adjusting to a 'normal' life. Johnny is depicted as an overweight man, not as old as his friends, but nostalgic for the past. It is explained that before he had entered into limbo he had lent his foster daughter {{a few thousand dollars}} and during his time fighting for the universe, she had created Peachy's Frozen Yogurt, a very successful chain of which Johnny is half owner and now very wealthy. Of greater import to Johnny is his discovery that the Bahdnesians have all but disappeared. A visit to the island of Bahdnesia (now under the ownership of Pol St. Germain) proves that no Bahdnesians are left there. In issue #7 Johnny states: [...] "There were never very many of them... and the island magic had worn out. <b>T-Bolt</b> was all that was left, and he was with me in limbo. They had to leave or starve to death." [...] This series also introduced the young Kiku, according to the Thunderbolt, the last remaining Bahdnesian.|$|E
5000|$|After the Thunderbolts {{had turned}} on Zemo and Techno, they found {{themselves}} fugitives hated by heroes and villains alike. The Crimson Cowl saw {{this as an opportunity}} to induct the remaining Bolts into her Masters of Evil. She sent Cyclone to bait the Thunderbolts into walking into an ambush. After defeating the <b>T-bolts</b> she made her [...] "proposal:" [...] join her and enjoy all the amenities that come with being in her organization or defy her and she would tell all of the Thunderbolts' enemies how to find them. The Thunderbolts were given time to think over the situation but in the end decided they would rather take down the Crimson Cowl instead. When next they fought, it looked like the Crimson Cowl had won until Hawkeye, disguised as Dreadknight, saved the team. Hawkeye offered to become the new Thunderbolts leader and one of his first actions as leader was to promise the media the capture of the Masters of Evil.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{details of}} structural static test {{carried out on}} a specimen joint simulating the blade root connection of a 500 kW wind turbine blade that was developed by NAL under NMITLI program. The objectives of the test are to demonstrate the structural integrity of the joint and to measure percentage load acting on the bolt when the joint is subjected to external load corresponding to the critical load case. The <b>T-bolt</b> connection is chosen for blade root joint for its simplicity compared to other joints and its effectiveness to improve fatigue life of the bolt. A design preload of 120 kN and an external load of 88 kN corresponding to class III gust wind load case, as defined by Germanischer Lloyd (GL), were considered to test the joint. A small segment of the blade root at highly loaded region is considered for testing. The Glass-Epoxy composite laminate of 60 mm thickness representing blade root shell thickness is fabricated using glass fiber and epoxy resin through wet lay-up process. After each of the T-bolts is preloaded to 120 kN, a total load of 264 kN (for 3 bolts) is applied on the simulated blade root-hub joint using a Universal Testing Machine. The maximum strain recorded in the <b>T-bolt</b> and composite laminate after preload were 2370 and 1721 µs respectively. The maximum strain in <b>T-bolt</b> and composite laminate after application of external load were 2780 and 4465 µs respectively. The joint successfully withstood the design ultimate load without any failure and only 24 % of external load acted on the <b>T-bolt</b> as predicted meeting all the design objectives...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a finite element {{technique}} {{to predict the}} torsional load capacity of V-band clamp joints is presented. The development of this complex, multi-step analysis is explained and the results compared with alternate theories which ignore or take account of transverse friction in the band to flange contact region. It is shown that accounting for transverse friction yields a better comparison with the finite element results for lower coefficients of friction whilst ignoring this component gives better results for higher coefficients of friction. Torsional load capacity is shown to increase with band diameter and <b>T-bolt</b> tension but to be less dependent on the coefficient of friction...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{evolution}} is described of a spacecraft Appendage Tie Down Mechanism (ATDM). Particular emphasis {{is paid to}} the mechanical aspects of using dry lubricants {{to increase the efficiency}} of acme threads and worm gearing. The ATDM consists of five major components. These are a dc torque motor, a worm gear speed reducer, the tension bolt (or <b>T-bolt),</b> nut capture and centering jaws and the capture nut. In addition, there are several minor components such as limit switch assemblies and an antibackdrive mechanism which couples the drive motor to the worm shaft. A development model of the ATDM in various configurations was under test for some time. In its latest version, it has successfully completed thermal vacuum testing, vibration testing, and extended life testing...|$|E
40|$|V-band clamps {{offer an}} {{efficient}} clamping solution in diverse applications including process equipment, exhaust systems and air handling. This paper studies {{the distribution of}} interface contact pressure between the V-band and flange when the coupling is established. The determination of the contact area and pressure distribution in a joint is essential information, as it determines {{the integrity of the}} coupling. A three dimensional finite element model has been developed for this purpose. Contrary to the previous assumption in developing axisymmetric models, the 3 D results showed that the contact pressure is non-uniform around the circumference of V-band with maximum contact pressure near the <b>T-bolt</b> area. This is in agreement with the theory in the literature. The presence and magnitude of friction has a noticeable influence on the form of the interface pressure distribution curve. It is also shown that the diameter of the band interacts with the effect of friction...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{trend to}} {{increase}} the length of wind turbine blades {{in an effort to}} reduce the cost of energy (COE). This causes manufacturing and transportation issues, which have given rise to the concept of segmented wind turbine blades. In this concept, multiple segments can be transported separately. While this idea is not new, it has recently gained renewed interest. In this review paper, the concept of wind turbine blade segmentation and related literature is discussed. The motivation for dividing blades into segments is explained, and the cost of energy is considered to obtain requirements for such blades. An overview of possible implementations is provided, considering the split location and orientation, as well as the type of joint to be used. Many implementations draw from experience with similar joints such as the joint at the blade root, hub and root extenders and joints used in rotor tips and glider wings. Adhesive bonds are expected to provide structural and economic efficiency, but in-field assembly poses a big issue. Prototype segmented blades using <b>T-bolt</b> joints, studs and spar bridge concepts have proven successful, as well as aerodynamically-shaped root and hub extenders...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of the contribution, {{laboratory}} investigations are described on the influence of humidity and hailstone impact (single and in combination) on the behaviour of glass-epoxy (Gl-Ep) in rotor blades of wind turbines. Laminates of 2 mm thickness were exposed in air of 90 % relative humidity up to saturation. Then they were partly impacted by ice balls simulating hailstones. Static properties were tested like tensile, compression, interlaminar shear strength and stiffness as well as the fatigue behaviour at a stress ratio of R = - 1. No significant degradation exists on the specimens due to impact. Moisture, however, reduces drastically the static strength and also the lifetime in the higher region of strains. No fatigue degradation compared to non-exposed specimens was observed at strains of 0. 8 % and lower which are the applicable strain areas for rotor blade structures. On the basis of statistical evaluated #epsilon#-N curves a proposal is made for a new design allowable. In the second part of the project, high-load level fatigue tests were carried out on two Gl-Ep rotor blades with <b>T-bolt</b> load attachment principle up to 10 " 6 and 2 x 10 " 6 load cycles respectively. Residual strength tests concluded the investigation. As expected, the blades failed due to instability effects. No fatigue of the Gl-Ep parts of the structures could be observed. (orig.)

40|$|This report {{presents}} briefly {{the structural}} design {{analysis of a}} 500 kW two-bladed downwind type wind turbine indigenous developed under NMITLI program. The major components developed were rotor blades, teetered hub, rotor shaft, platform and yaw system whereas gear box and alternator were procured. Several configurations were initially explored for each subsystem and finally the suitable one for a prototype was fabricated. The wind turbine developed composed of minimum elementary systems required for prototype testing. The design has been rationalized/ simplified for single set/piece fabrication. The aerodynamic design of the blade {{was carried out in}} a separate exercise and the aerodynamic loads obtained were used for this structural analysis. Further, a special purpose code, “BLADED’ was used to generate aerodynamic loads for some cases. The critical loads in all phases of wind turbine existence were identified and used in the design. The blade apart from generating power is the source from where all the dynamic loads originates. The blade shell was made out of glass-epoxy laminates. The load carrying spar integrated with the shell of the blade composed of more UD layers. Foam sandwich construction was employed in non-critical area. The blade was attached to the hub flange with use of T-Bolts embedded into the root. Preload was introduced into the <b>T-Bolt</b> to improve it’s the fatigue life. Shaft and teeter pin were made out of forged EN 24 steel whereas hub, platform and yaw system were fabricated out of plates by welding. Thus, the design exercise was focused for the prototype wind turbine development...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} briefly {{the details}} of full scale structural static test that was carried out on the composite blade of 500 kW wind turbine. The objectives of the structural static test were to assess the strength and stiffness parameters of the blade for the critical wind load case, to experimentally determine the deflections and strains at critical locations and finally to validate the design. Though the blade was designed for class III, as defined by Germanischer Lloyd (GL), the blade was tested for a load case corresponding to a wind velocity of 25 m/s; since this is the maximum wind velocity measured in the installation site over last 25 years. A rig was designed using tubular truss members to withstand the moments produced by the thrust load and the gravity load. The blade was mounted on the test rig using <b>T-bolt</b> {{in the same way}} it is attached the hub. The gust load on the entire blade was applied as four discrete concentrated loads. The loads were applied by means of mechanical screws and a winch. The deflections at selected locations were measured using pointer and graph sheet. The strains were measured using foil type electrical resistance strain gauges and a data logger system. A maximum deflection of 685 mm was measured at the blade tip and a maximum compressive strain of - 787 µs was measured on the suction surface of the blade at a distance of 12500 mm from blade root. The measured value of deflection and strain were in good agreement with FEA predicted values. Thus the blade responded in the test as per the design...|$|E
