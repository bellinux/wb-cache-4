The tour does not go as planned, with most of the dinosaurs failing to appear and the group encountering a sick Triceratops. The tour is cut short as a {{tropical}} storm approaches Isla Nublar. Most of the park employees evacuate on a boat to the mainland while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles, except Ellie who stays with the park's veterinarian to study the Triceratops.|$|E

The Orange Line does not run 24 hours a day (unlike the Blue Line, which has 24-hour service to O'Hare), but does operate from about 4:00am to 1:00am, at an average of 8-minute intervals. <b>The</b> <b>trip</b> <b>from</b> Midway to the Loop takes 25 minutes.|$|E

25|$|The Central City Parkway is a four-lane {{highway in}} Colorado, running from I-70 near Idaho Springs to the {{historic}} mining town and gambling area of Central City. Opened on November 19, 2004, the Parkway provides direct access to Central City. The length of the Parkway is 8.4 miles (13km), {{and it can be}} traveled in about twelve minutes.

25|$|The Sausalito Land and Ferry Company service, {{launched}} in 1867, eventually became the Golden Gate Ferry Company, a Southern Pacific Railroad subsidiary, the largest ferry {{operation in the}} world by the late 1920s. Once for railroad passengers and customers only, Southern Pacific's automobile ferries became very profitable and important to the regional economy. The ferry crossing between the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco and Sausalito in Marin County took approximately 20 minutes and cost US$1.00 per vehicle, a price later reduced to compete with the new bridge. <b>The</b> <b>trip</b> <b>from</b> the San Francisco Ferry Building took 27 minutes.|$|E
25|$|By March 1929, with dam {{construction}} underway (see above), up to 60 letters {{arrived in}} the village every day or two, whenever a vehicle made <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>from</b> Cowra to Wyangala. With over 350 workers and their families already in the growing village, {{the lack of a}} post office or telegraph office was a great inconvenience to the residents. To alleviate this issue, and to provide the residents with a reliable postal service, Wyangala Dam Post Office was opened on 14 March 1929. The newly opened post office stamped mail with a Type 2C postmark, which had a full stop after the ‘W’ of ‘N.S.W.’.|$|E

25|$|Chinatown buses {{typically}} run nonstop {{express service}} between the departure and destination points. This typically results in shorter travel times. For instance, <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>from</b> State College, Pennsylvania, to New York City takes {{about four hours}} on the Chinatown bus, compared to more than seven hours on Greyhound. However, although the Chinatown buses are often cheaper than alternative modes of transport like Amtrak and airplanes, they are also slower; for example, Amtrak and airplanes take about 2.75 to 3.5 hours to travel from New York City to Washington, D.C., while Chinatown buses take 4 to 5 hours. These intercity buses run at least 2,500 weekly trips.|$|E
25|$|The {{paradoxical}} {{aspect of}} the twins' situation arises {{from the fact that}} at any given moment the travelling twin's clock is running slow in the earthbound twin's inertial frame, but based on the relativity principle one could equally argue that the earthbound twin's clock is running slow in the travelling twin's inertial frame. One proposed resolution is that the earthbound twin is at rest in the same inertial frame throughout the journey, while the travelling twin is not: in the simplest version of the thought-experiment, the travelling twin switches at the midpoint of <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>from</b> being at rest in an inertial frame with velocity in one direction (away from the earth) to being at rest in an inertial frame with velocity in the opposite direction (towards the earth).|$|E
25|$|The 130th {{anniversary of}} the {{founding}} of Petah Tikva provided further opportunities for public reference to the Ballad. On November 5, 2008, five riders dressed in period costume re-enacted <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>from</b> Jaffa to Petah Tikva. Taharlev had already imagined Salomon and his companions as those riders. In an ‘updated’ version of the Ballad, a 170-year-old Yoel Moshe Salomon and his companions get stuck in traffic between Jaffa and Petah Tikva. The actual re-enacted ride was timed to arrive at Founders Square in Petah Tikva at 4 pm, where a set of five sculptures by Shmuel Ben-Ami were unveiled. Ben-Ami’s sculptures were commissioned by a local Petah Tikva company. He had been instructed to replace Mazaraki, for whom no model was available, by a representation of Yehuda Raab. Though acknowledged as one of Petah Tikva’s founders, Raab is not mentioned in the Ballad.|$|E

25|$|Returning to New York City in 1809, Eckford {{bought out}} his partner Beebe and became sole {{owner of a}} new {{shipyard}} he established which would remain his main place of business {{for the rest of}} his life. For Astor, he built the brig Fox in 1809 and the ship Hannibal in 1810. Fox in particular was noted for her great speed thanks to the streamlined hull form Eckford designed for her, making <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>from</b> Calcutta, India, to New York City in only 90 days – a record that would stand for 40 years – and making the round trip from New York to Calcutta and back in only seven months and 14 days. It was the speed of his ships thanks to their revolutionary hull form that gained Eckford great fame in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|At the January 24 {{meeting of}} the board of health {{superintendent}} Mark Summers of the Hammon Consolidated Gold Fields proposed a dogsled relay, using two fast teams. One would start at Nenana and the other at Nome, and they would meet at Nulato. <b>The</b> <b>trip</b> <b>from</b> Nulato to Nome normally took 30 days, although the record was nine. Welch calculated that the serum would only last six days under the brutal conditions of the trail. Summers' employee, the Norwegian Leonhard Seppala, was chosen for the 630-mile (1,014km) round trip from Nome to Nulato and back. He had previously made the run from Nome to Nulato in a record-breaking four days, won the All-Alaska Sweepstakes three times, and had become something of a legend for his athletic ability and rapport with his Siberian huskies. His lead dog, the 12-year-old Togo, was equally famous for his leadership, intelligence, and ability to sense danger.|$|E
25|$|The French police, {{headed by}} Bousquet, arrested 7,000 Jews in the {{southern}} zone in August 1942. 2,500 of them transited through the Camp des Milles near Aix-en-Provence before joining Drancy. Then, on 22, 23 and 24 January 1943, assisted by Bousquet's police force, the Germans organized a raid in Marseilles. During the Battle of Marseilles, the French police checked the identity documents of 40,000 people, and the operation succeeded in sending 2,000 Marseillese people in the death trains, leading to the extermination camps. The operation also encompassed the expulsion of an entire neighborhood (30,000 persons) in the Old Port before its destruction. For this occasion, SS-Gruppenführer Karl Oberg, {{in charge of the}} German Police in France, made <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> <b>from</b> Paris, and transmitted to Bousquet orders directly received from Heinrich Himmler. It is another notable case of the French police's willful collaboration with the Nazis.|$|E
