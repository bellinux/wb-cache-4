5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving vertices {{and faces}} that is valid for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula {{in which the}} roles of the vertices and faces have been swapped. Euler's formula, which is self-dual, is one example. Another given by Harary involves the handshaking lemma, according to which the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any graph equals <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of edges. In its dual form, this lemma states that in a plane graph, the sum of the numbers of sides of the faces of the graph equals <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of edges.|$|E

In the 1780s, British-built ships {{typically}} carried 1.75slaves per ton of the ship's capacity; on the Zong, the ratio was 4.0 per ton. A British slave ship of the period would carry around 193slaves and it was extremely unusual for a ship of Zong relatively small size to carry so many.|$|E

5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards. The game is played {{in exactly the same}} way as normal bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of pieces available.|$|E
5|$|The decade {{began with}} 25 million {{registered}} automobiles on the road, {{most of which}} predated World War II and were in poor condition; no automobiles or parts were produced during the war owing to rationing and restrictions. By 1950, most factories had made {{the transition to a}} consumer-based economy, and more than 8 million cars were produced that year alone. By 1958, there were more than 67 million cars registered in the United States, more than <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> {{at the start of the}} decade.|$|E

5|$|Confederate forces {{still at}} Columbus blocked the Union army's {{access to the}} lower Mississippi. Grant, and General James B. McPherson, {{came up with a}} plan to bypass Columbus and with a force of 25,000 troops, move against Fort Henry on the Tennessee River and then ten miles east to Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River, with the aid of gunboats, opening both rivers and {{allowing}} the Union access further south. Grant presented his plan to Henry Halleck, his new commander under the newly created Department of Missouri. Halleck was considering the same strategy, but rebuffed Grant, believing he needed <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of troops. However, after Halleck telegraphed and consulted McClellan about the plan, he finally agreed on condition that the attack be conducted in close cooperation with navy Flag Officer, Andrew H. Foote. After Foote's gunboats had silenced most of the guns at the fort, Grant's troops moved in and easily captured Fort Henry on February 6, 1862.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{learned to}} swim at Bankstown {{at the age}} of 7. She was {{initially}} slow to learn, and her coach used a long pole attached to a rope and belt to maintain her safety. This allowed him to fish her out of the water if she fell into difficulty. Due to her slow learning, Morgan was given <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of lessons as the other students. At the age of eight, she won the district championship, and in 1953, aged 11, she won the New South Wales (NSW) Primary School Championships. In February 1956, aged 13, she was taken for serious training. Her father transferred her to the tutelage of Frank Guthrie in Enfield. At the time, Guthrie was {{regarded as one of the}} best coaches in the state; his students included Gary Chapman, Kevin O'Halloran and Lorraine Crapp. All three (plus Morgan) would win medals at the 1956 Summer Olympics. Her mother had to drive her to Enfield, as her father was busy with the plumbing business.|$|E
5|$|Sailing {{directly}} from his blockade station off Cadiz, Saumarez's squadron consisted of six ships of the line, <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> under Linois's command. Discovering the French at anchor in Algeciras {{on the morning}} of 6 July, Saumarez launched an immediate attack on the anchorage through the complicated shoals of Algeciras Bay. Although the initial attack caused severe damage to the French ships, light winds and shallow water led to the British ship HMS Hannibal grounding under heavy fire while the French vessels were driven on shore to prevent their capture. With his intentions frustrated, Saumarez ordered his squadron to withdraw, five of his ships limping out of the bay while the batted Hannibal remained trapped. Isolated and unable to manoeuvre, Captain Solomon Ferris on Hannibal endured the enemy fire for another half an hour before surrendering his ship.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the army was hampered by the poor economy of the kingdom, and this continued through the 1920s. In 1929, King Alexander changed {{the name of the}} country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, at which time the army became the VKJ. The army budget remained tight, and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s, it became hard to secure weapons and munitions from other countries. Consequently, at the time World War II broke out in September 1939, the VKJ had several serious weaknesses, which included reliance on draught animals for transport, and the large size of its formations. For example, Yugoslav infantry divisions had <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of men of contemporary British infantry divisions. These characteristics resulted in slow, unwieldy formations, and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower. Older generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I were combined with an army that was not equipped or trained to resist the fast-moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in Poland and France.|$|E
5|$|The {{restructuring}} {{also called}} for the reduction of four services on the Meråker Line and two services to Oppdal, terminating all commuter train services on the lines. For the service to Oppdal, NSB had an operating deficit of NOK1.7 million and 21,000 passengers in 1998. The Meråker Line had about <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of passengers. The National Rail Administration stated that if any private companies wanted to operate the routes without subsidies, they were free to do so. As compensation, travelers between Trondheim and Rennebu and Oppdal with month passes were allowed to not pay for seat reservations on the intercity services. Sør-Trøndelag County Municipality applied to the ministry to take over responsibility and purchase the commuter train services, so they could continue the service to Oppdal, but this {{was rejected by the}} ministry.|$|E
5|$|During Memphis's 1873 {{yellow fever}} {{epidemic}}, he—along with other Memphis rabbis and leading Jews—remained {{in the city}} rather than fleeing. During the seven weeks the epidemic lasted, 51 people were buried in B'nai Israel's cemetery, almost <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> typically buried there in a whole year. When another yellow fever epidemic broke out in 1878, Samfield stayed again, ministering to the dead and dying of all faiths. During that epidemic 78 people were buried in the congregation's cemetery. The city's frequent yellow fever epidemics decimated its Jewish community, which dropped from 2,100 to 300. They also hurt B'nai Israel's finances; members did not pay their dues, {{and for a time}} the congregation could not afford to pay Samfield. By 1880, however, membership had increased to 124 families, and finances had improved. By this time, the synagogue was more typically called Children of Israel. Beth El Emeth was affected more severely than Children of Israel by the epidemics; its rabbi (Peres) died of yellow fever in 1879. In 1882, Beth El Emeth disbanded, and transferred its property to Children of Israel, though most Beth El Emeth members joined the Orthodox Baron Hirsch Synagogue. The property included land on Second Street, and Beth El Emeth's cemetery.|$|E

The school-age population was expected to grow 4.4% by 2030, in contrast to a small decline in the city as a whole. The elderly population was forecast to grow by 57.9%, with the borough adding 108,000 persons ages 65 and over, compared to 44.2% growth citywide. However, these 2006 projections may have become outdated, as Lower Manhattan has been experiencing a baby boom, well above the overall birth rate in Manhattan, with the area south of Canal Street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010, 12% greater than 2009 and over <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> born in 2001.
