5000|$|Phonon noise, {{also known}} as <b>thermal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> noise, arises from the random {{exchange}} of energy between a thermal mass and its surrounding environment. This energy is quantized {{in the form of}} phonons. Each phonon has an energy of order , where [...] is Boltzmann's constant and [...] is the temperature. The random exchange of energy leads to fluctuations in temperature. This occurs even when the thermal mass and the environment are in thermal equilibrium, i.e. at the same time-average temperature. If a device has a temperature-dependent electrical resistance, then these fluctuations in temperature lead to fluctuations in resistance. Examples of devices where phonon noise is important include bolometers and calorimeters. The superconducting transition edge sensor (TES), which can be operated either as a bolometer or a calorimeter, {{is an example of a}} device for which phonon noise can significantly contribute to the total noise.|$|E
5000|$|Electrons {{can move}} (slowly) through an {{insulator}} {{by the following}} method. The electrons are generally trapped in localized states (loosely speaking, they are [...] "stuck" [...] to a single atom, and not free to move around the crystal). Occasionally, random thermal fluctuations will give that electron enough energy {{to get out of}} its localized state, and move to the conduction band. Once there, the electron can move through the crystal, for a brief amount of time, before relaxing into another localized state (in other words, [...] "sticking" [...] to a different atom). The Poole-Frenkel effect describes how, in a large electric field, the electron doesn't need as much thermal energy to get into the conduction band (because part of this energy comes from being pulled by the electric field), so it does not need as large a <b>thermal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> and will be able to move more frequently.|$|E
50|$|Historically it {{was assumed}} that the {{nucleation}} rate of new recrystallized grains would be determined by the <b>thermal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> model successfully used for solidification and precipitation phenomena. In this theory it is assumed {{that as a result of}} the natural movement of atoms (which increases with temperature) small nuclei would spontaneously arise in the matrix. The formation of these nuclei would be associated with an energy requirement due to the formation of a new interface and an energy liberation due to the formation of a new volume of lower energy material. If the nuclei were larger than some critical radius then it would be thermodynamically stable and could start to grow. The main problem with this theory is that the stored energy due to dislocations is very low (0.1-1 Jm−3) while the energy of a grain boundary is quite high (~0.5Jm−2). Calculations based on these values found that the observed nucleation rate was greater than the calculated one by some impossibly large factor (~1050).|$|E

5000|$|Materials conduct {{electricity}} if {{they contain}} mobile charge carriers. There {{are two types}} of charge carriers in a semiconductor: free electrons (mobile electrons) and electron holes (mobile holes which are missing electrons from the normally occupied electron states). A normally bound electron (e.g., in a bond) in a reverse-biased diode may break loose due to a <b>thermal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> or excitation, creating a mobile electron-hole pair. If there is a voltage gradient (electric field) in the semiconductor, the electron will move towards the positive voltage while the hole will move towards the negative voltage. Usually, the electron and hole will simply move to opposite ends of the crystal and enter the appropriate electrodes. Under the right circumstances, however, (i.e., when the electric field is strong enough) the mobile electron and/or hole may be accelerated to high enough speeds to knock other bound electrons free, creating more free-electron-hole pairs (i.e. more charge carriers), increasing the current and leading to further [...] "knocking out" [...] processes and creating an avalanche. In this way, large portions of a normally insulating crystal can begin to conduct.|$|E

40|$|Current-induced {{domain wall}} motion in {{magnetic}} nanowires {{is affected by}} <b>thermal</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> In order to account for this effect, the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation includes a <b>thermal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> field and literature often utilizes the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to characterize statistical properties of the <b>thermal</b> <b>fluctuation</b> field. However, the theorem is not applicable to the system under finite current since {{it is not in}} equilibrium. To examine the effect of finite current on the <b>thermal</b> <b>fluctuation,</b> we adopt the influence functional formalism developed by Feynman and Vernon, which is known to be a useful tool to analyze effects of dissipation and <b>thermal</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> For this purpose, we construct a quantum mechanical effective Hamiltonian describing current-induced domain wall motion by generalizing the Caldeira-Leggett description of quantum dissipation. We find that even for the current-induced domain wall motion, the statistical properties of the thermal noise is still described by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem if the current density is sufficiently lower than the intrinsic critical current density and thus the domain wall tilting angle is sufficiently lower than pi/ 4. The relation between our result and a recent result, which also addresses the <b>thermal</b> <b>fluctuation,</b> is discussed. We also find interesting physical meanings of the Gilbert damping alpha and the nonadiabaticy parameter beta; while alpha characterizes the coupling strength between the magnetization dynamics (the domain wall motion in this paper) and the thermal reservoir (or environment), beta characterizes the coupling strength between the spin current and the thermal reservoir.
