5|$|In the meantime, Kyle, Stan and Kenny watch America's Stupidest Home Videos; {{they hear}} there's a $10,000 grand prize for the stupidest home video. They decide {{to enter the}} {{competition}} with the video they made of Cartman. Cartman approaches Kyle and Stan (Kenny was dragged to a train track by Stan's go-cart and killed by an oncoming train) with the depressing news about his lack of funds to find out his real father. Stan and Kyle agree that if they win the video contest <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> Cartman the $3,000 needed for the DNA testing. Cartman is overjoyed, but quickly becomes extremely angry after seeing the aired video. Though they do not win the competition, as Stan's grandfather wins with a videotape he made of Kenny's death, they receive a $3,000 runner-up prize instead, which is still enough for the DNA test. Dr. Mephesto calls together Cartman, his mother and all potential fathers (including the 1989 Denver Broncos), when he gets the test results which is where Kenny comes back to life. When {{he is about to}} reveal the identity of Cartman's father, a narrator states that the answer will be revealed in the new South Park episode four weeks later, much to Cartman's annoyance and anger.|$|E

25|$|The actual {{ratios of}} fusion to Bremsstrahlung power {{will likely be}} {{significantly}} lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that {{the energy of the}} fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves must remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and will remain some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.|$|E

The women had been assured that {{they would be able to}} present their issues, but the chair, Representative John J. Fitzgerald of New York, refused to allow it. Undaunted, Whitney and Stevens continued their planning efforts for the Panama Pacific Exposition CUWS Congress in San Francisco. In San Francisco at the CUWS headquarters in 1915, Stevens discussed the strategy of employing a [...] "million-vote smile", positing that smiling was a useful tool in the fight to win over men's support. [...] "Smile on men and <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> you a vote. Look severe and they won't," [...] she stated. However, when Alice Paul arrived two weeks before the event, she canceled choral events, a parade and a mass meeting that had been planned for the Scottish Rite Hall. Stevens had been involved in supervising each of these events, though local women planned and orchestrated them. Paul did keep the luncheon and a ball to be held at the California building of the exposition. After the September Congress, Stevens had planned to remain in San Francisco and run the exposition booth of CUWS, but she was forced to return to Washington because the eastern delegate Margaret Whittemore had left due to her marriage. Stevens immediately began planning for a convention to be held in Washington in December.|$|E

500|$|When he escapes the {{building}} and enters the mall, Hall feels he is disturbed by advertisements calling to him by name not only because <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> away his presence, {{but also because they}} remind him of his lost place in society, and he begins [...] "to see through the false consciousness his (illusory) previous position as fixed subject had allowed him." [...] Spielberg said that Anderton is being punished for his previous callous unconcern for anything but the effectiveness of the PreCrime program. [...] "He's dirtied {{by the fact that he}} doesn't spend much time thinking about the moral consequences. It's just like a sporting event almost — and then suddenly that whole sporting event makes him the soccer ball." [...] His doubts about his own future lead him to examine his previous life to better understand himself according to Hall. He runs through his role in the PreCrime system, and his son's disappearance [...] "to reconstruct his past." [...] After Leo Crow in fact kills himself, Anderton becomes healed, and later has [...] "recreated himself as the subject he was previously through the knowledge that he is not a killer." [...] Although he has satisfactorily repaired his self-image, Anderton is not the same person, as he not longer believes in the PreCrime system. Hall says that Burgess' final dilemma; namely, his desire to keep PreCrime running, his inability to bring himself to kill Anderton, and his desire to live, drives him to see his only suitable action to be suicide. [...] "Burgess has been left truly alone by events," [...] argues Hall. [...] "His wife fainted when she saw the images of the murder and Anderton has been the cause of this rupture." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{consumption}} of dog meat {{is not a}} feature of modern Japanese culture. There is a belief in Japan that certain dogs have special powers in their religion of Shintoism and Buddhism. Dog meat was consumed in Japan until 675 AD, when Emperor Tenmu decreed a prohibition on its consumption during the 4th through 9th months of the year. Normally a dog accompanied the emperor for battle, so {{it was believed that}} eating a dog gave emperors bad luck.

As the Don, this player can drop waypoints anywhere, directing their teammates to strategic areas. Additionally, specific areas of the map, called [...] "capture nods," [...] can be controlled by either team. Once controlled by a team, the Don can activate the nod to do one of three things; give a health boost, give an armored vest, or explode when members of the enemy team approach. The mode also lets Dons wager in-game cash prior to the commencement of the battle. Dons sets the amount they wish to wager, and how much <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> to their team should they win. However, if a player loses, all cash wagered will be removed from their single-player campaign.|$|E
