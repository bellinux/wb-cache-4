5|$|Texas {{place at}} the top of the BCS rankings lasted only one week. On October 29, 2005, Texas {{initially}} trailed but rallied to beat an Oklahoma State Cowboys team that had held a losing record through the season so far. Texas retained the top spot in the computer rankings, but not by enough <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> USC in the overall BCS standings.|$|E
5|$|It spent {{its first}} {{four weeks of}} {{theatrical}} release as the highest-grossing film at the U.S. box office. Meet the Parents was displaced from No.1 during the weekend of November 3–5 by the newly released Charlie's Angels while still managing <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> The Legend of Bagger Vance, another new release that debuted at number 3. It remained in the Top 10 grossing films until its 11th week. In the United Kingdom, the film had its theatrical premiere on December 15, 2000 and was distributed by United International Pictures (UIP). There, it managed to earn over $21 million during its run. In Australia, also being distributed by UIP, it was released on December 26, 2000 where it earned over $11 million during the theatrical run.|$|E
5|$|On lap 28, Kimi Räikkönen was {{the first}} of the top runners to pit, coming out in fourth, but spun at the hairpin in a repeat of an {{incident}} from 2014. The incident cost him twelve seconds and allowed Valtteri Bottas <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> him in third after he made a pit stop on lap 30. Hamilton made a pit stop on the same lap with Rosberg following suit two laps later, both without incident. At this point, Rosberg was about 1.5 seconds behind his teammate. Another four laps later, Sebastian Vettel came in for his second and final stop of the race. Massa came in for his only stop on lap 38, putting on the super-soft tyres, and dropped from sixth to ninth. Räikkönen made a pit stop again on lap 42, staying in fourth position ahead of the Lotus of Romain Grosjean.|$|E

5|$|Early {{during the}} {{development}} of the TV series, Martin told major plot points to producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. (The New York Times reported in 2011 that, at age 62, Martin was by all accounts in robust health.) Martin was confident he would have published at least The Winds of Winter before the TV series overtook him. Nevertheless, there was general concern about whether Martin would be able <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the show. As a result, head writers Benioff and Weiss learned more future plot points from Martin in 2013 to help them set up the show's new possible seasons. This included the end stories for all the core characters. Deviations from the books' storylines are also being considered, but a two-year show hiatus to wait for new books is not an option for them as the child actors continue to grow and the show's popularity would wane. Martin indicated he would not permit another writer to finish the book series. On January 2, 2016, Martin confirmed that the sixth volume would not be published {{before the start of the}} sixth season of the HBO series.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race on Sunday, Hamilton got away slowly but was able to keep both Pérez and Räikkönen behind him while Rosberg {{retained}} the lead. Further back, Fernando Alonso made contact with Felipe Nasr and then crashed into Pastor Maldonado, who was forced to retire. Alonso needed to pit for a new front wing and was later given a drive-through penalty, dropping him {{to the end of the}} field. Meanwhile, Nico Hülkenberg and Sebastian Vettel made up places, sitting in fifth and twelfth respectively after the first lap. Valtteri Bottas on the other hand lost positions, finding himself in tenth. Rosberg soon built a lead of over one second, giving Hamilton no chance to deploy DRS for an overtake manoeuvre. By lap 5, both Kvyat and Nasr had come into the pits for the harder compound tyre, followed by Ricciardo, Massa and Pérez one lap later. On lap seven, both Hülkenberg and Sainz Jr. made pit stops. While Hülkenberg was able <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> Massa, Sainz's stop was unfortunate and he lost time due to a problem with the tyre change. Another two laps later, Valtteri Bottas pitted and was sent out into the path of Button, damaging his front wing, which he needed to replace the following lap. He also received a five-second penalty to be served at his next scheduled stop. The leaders pitted for new tyres around laps ten and eleven, with the order now being Rosberg ahead of Vettel, who was yet to stop, Hamilton, and Räikkönen. Romain Grosjean, who started on the harder tyres just as Vettel, was up to sixth.|$|E
5|$|Vettel and Alonso traded fastest laps as {{they pushed}} hard {{in their efforts}} to build up a {{sufficient}} lead over Webber to maintain first and second positions after their pit stops. Massa, Petrov, Buemi and Alguersuari all passed Glock on lap 17 thus eliminating the queue of cars. By lap20, Alonso was leading Vettel by 3.2 seconds; he in turn was a further 11 seconds in front of Hamilton. Button was in fourth, 20 seconds behind Alonso, with Rosberg 3.3 seconds behind the World Champion in fifth. Webber changed his engine settings to give him a higher top speed in an attempt to get past Barrichello and decrease the time gap to Hamilton on lap 22. He avoided colliding with an Armco barrier at the entry of turn eighteen one lap later. Hamilton was told to increase his pace on the 24th lap to try <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> Webber after the pit stop phase. But his car had a large amount of oversteer, as his rear, super-soft, compound tyres began to deteriorate, causing his lap times to drop off the leader's pace. Trulli drove to the pit lane and was pushed by his mechanics into the Lotus garage to retire with an hydraulic issue on lap28. Hamilton made the first scheduled stop for tyres on lap29 and re-emerged in eighth position behind Webber. Alonso and Vettel made simultaneous pit stops on the following lap; Alonso retained his lead despite Vettel's pit crew completing their pit stop first; Vettel avoided stalling and drove away in second gear. With newer tyres which provided more grip, Vettel recorded faster lap times than Alonso to close the time gap as the two came across slower cars.|$|E

25|$|McLaren {{brought in}} both Hamilton and Heikki Kovalainen for their second stops, and Timo Glock also pitted. The Safety Car was not deemed {{necessary}} to clear Webber's car, giving Jenson Button, {{who had been}} following Kovalainen, the opportunity {{to put in a}} series of fast laps before his pit stop. With Barrichello running in seventh after a small problem at his second pit stop, Button had an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> his teammate and extend his Championship lead. He pitted on lap 51, emerging in a net fifth position behind the impressively recovering Vettel and ahead of Barrichello.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{exploratory}} dig, and of the earlier investigations, Jones' contract was extended and she was appointed director of the full scale excavations. She was joined by her husband Tom and in 1965 (after the crops had been harvested) they began the mammoth task that was to last for the next 14years on the Mucking hill top. The excavation was unusual in that it continued through the winter, unlike most excavations which only took place in the summer.

In hindsight, his organisation's ability to even stage the games at such short notice was a triumph and excellent fine-tuning for what was to come.

25|$|The tension {{was high}} {{between the two}} Mercedes {{teammates}} going into the weekend when Hamilton {{was found to have}} altered his car settings during the latter stages of the Spanish Grand Prix, using a higher-powered engine setting than the team had previously allowed in order <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> teammate Rosberg. Rosberg was then discovered to have done the same while chasing down Hamilton {{at the end of the}} Bahrain Grand Prix, though he failed to get past. Despite losing the Drivers' Championship lead to teammate Hamilton in Spain, Rosberg stated he would not be changing his approach and was not heavily focused on the championship but expected the battle to remain tight. Hamilton reckoned his increased comfort with the F1 W05 Hybrid would put Rosberg under pressure in Monaco, saying it was a track where he performed well but the 2013 race was where he was unable to extract the most amount of performance from his car although he hoped to get more out of his Mercedes and wanted to have the Ferrari and Red Bull cars battling him for the victory.|$|E

500|$|The song {{has been}} used to {{perpetuate}} the myth of Johnson selling his soul to the Devil for his musical ability. [...] The lyrics do not contain any references to Satan or a Faustian bargain, but they have been interpreted as a description of the singer's fear of losing his soul to the Devil (presumably in exchange for his talent). [...] Music historian Elijah Wald believes that Johnson's verses do not support the idea. [...] Delta bluesman Tommy Johnson promoted himself as having made a deal with the Devil and Southern folklore identifies a crossroads or graveyard as the site of such a pact, which Wald identifies as likely sources of the myth. [...] However, musicologist Robert Palmer points out that Johnson was [...] "fascinated with and probably obsessed by supernatural imagery." [...] His song [...] "Hellhound on My Trail" [...] tells of trying <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> the demon hound which is pursuing him and in [...] "Me and the Devil Blues" [...] he sings, [...] "Early this mornin' when you knocked upon my door, and I said 'Hello Satan I believe it's time to go'". [...] These songs contribute to the Faustian myth; how much Johnson promoted the idea is debated, although many agree [...] "the 'devil angle' made for good marketing".|$|E
