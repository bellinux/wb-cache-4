5|$|The {{principal}} {{application of}} Apollonius' problem, as formulated by Isaac Newton, is hyperbolic <b>trilateration,</b> {{which seeks to}} determine a position from the differences in distances to at least three points. For example, a ship may seek to determine its position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three synchronized transmitters. Solutions to Apollonius' problem were used in World War I to determine the location of an artillery piece from the time a gunshot was heard at three different positions, and hyperbolic <b>trilateration</b> is the principle used by the Decca Navigator System and LORAN. Similarly, the location of an aircraft may be determined from the difference in arrival times of its transponder signal at four receiving stations. This multilateration problem {{is equivalent to the}} three-dimensional generalization of Apollonius' problem and applies to global positioning systems such as GPS. It is also used to determine the position of calling animals (such as birds and whales), although Apollonius' problem does not pertain if the speed of sound varies with direction (i.e., the transmission medium not isotropic).|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a decentralized algorithm for coordinating {{a swarm of}} identically-programmed mobile agents to spatially self-aggregate into arbitrary shapes using only local interactions. Our approach, called SHAPEBUGS, generates a consensus coordinate system by agents continually performing local <b>trilaterations,</b> and achieves shape formation by simultaneously allowing agents to disperse within the defined 2 D shape using a Contained Gas Model. This approach has several novel features (1) agents can easily aggregate into arbitrary user-specified shapes, using a formation process that is independent {{of the number of}} agents (2) the system automatically adapts to influx and death of agents, as well as accidental displacement. We show that the consensus coordinate system is robust and provides reasonable accuracy in the face of significant sensor and movement error...|$|R
40|$|The inverse/direct {{kinematics}} of trilaterable serial/parallel manipulators can {{be stated}} {{as a system}} of distance constraints whose set of solutions can be determined using a sequence of <b>trilaterations,</b> possibly involving points at infinity. It is possible to decide whether a mechanism is trilaterable by relying only on its topology. Based on this fact, we here enumerate all trilaterable serial and in-parallel robots with six degrees of freedom. The relevance of the obtained family of manipulators is established when it is shown to contain the best-known commercial serial robots. As {{a result of this}} analysis, we come up with a general method to solve the inverse/direct kinematics of a wide family of manipulators.

500|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} also be {{formulated}} as the problem of locating one or more points such that the differences of its distances to three given points equal three known values. Consider a solution circle of radius r's and three given circles of radii r1, r2 and r3. If the solution circle is externally tangent to all three given circles, the distances between {{the center of the}} solution circle and the centers of the given circles equal , [...] and , respectively. Therefore, differences in these distances are constants, such as they depend only on the known radii of the given circles and not on the radius r's of the solution circle, which cancels out. This second formulation of Apollonius' problem can be generalized to internally tangent solution circles (for which the center-center distance equals the difference of radii), by changing the corresponding differences of distances to sums of distances, so that the solution-circle radius r's again cancels out. The re-formulation in terms of center-center distances is useful in the solutions below of Adriaan van Roomen and Isaac Newton, and also in hyperbolic positioning or <b>trilateration,</b> which is the task of locating a position from differences in distances to three known points. For example, navigation systems such as LORAN identify a receiver's position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three fixed positions, which correspond to the differences in distances to those transmitters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—There {{are only}} three 6 -SPS {{parallel}} manipulators with triangular base and platform, i. e., the octahedral, the flagged, and the partially flagged, which are studied in this paper. The forward kinematics of the octahedral manipulator is algebraically intricate, while {{those of the other}} two can be solved by three <b>trilaterations.</b> As an additional nice feature, the flagged manipulator is the only parallel platform for which a cell decomposition of its singularity locus has been derived. Here, we prove that the partially flagged manipulator also admits a well-behaved decomposition, technically called a stratification, some of whose strata are not topological cells, however. Remarkably, the adjacency diagram of the 5 -D and 6 -D strata (which shows what 5 -D strata are contained in the closure of a 6 -D one) is the same as for the flagged manipulator. The availabil-ity of such a decomposition permits devising a redundant 7 -SPS manipulator, combining two partially flagged ones, which admits a control strategy that completely avoids singularities.

3000|$|The {{construction}} techniques {{developed in}} this article, namely, building spanning trees, bilaterations, <b>trilaterations</b> are obtained via topology control algorithms. Topology-control phase takes place between measurement and location update phases. We note that we implement these topology constructions so that location estimation {{can be implemented}} in linear time. An advantage of this construction-based approach is that during deployment, sensors can first perform simple topology control (using, for example, measurement power control) to construct a topology with simple connectivity-based properties. Then using our construction-based operation (e.g., power control), the network constructs a localizable topology. References [32] and [38] provide a comprehensive survey on existing techniques. The topology of a network {{is determined by the}} subset of active nodes and the set of active links along which direct communication can occur. A topology-control algorithm takes a graph G = (V, E) representing the network, where V is the set of all nodes in the network and there is an edge (v 1, v 2) ∈ E ⊆ V 2 if and only if nodes v 1 and v 2 can directly communicate with each other, and transforms it to a graph G [...]...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{locate the}} {{biosensor}} peptide DPc 10 bound to ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca 2 + channels, we developed {{an approach that}} combines fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), simulated-annealing, cryo-electron microscopy, and crystallographic data. DPc 10 {{is identical to the}} 2460 – 2495 segment within the cardiac muscle RyR isoform (RyR 2) central domain. DPc 10 binding to RyR 2 results in a pathologically elevated Ca 2 + leak by destabilizing key interactions between the RyR 2 N-terminal and central domains (unzipping). To localize the DPc 10 binding site within RyR 2, we measured FRET between five single-cysteine variants of the FK 506 -binding protein (FKBP) labeled with a donor probe, and DPc 10 labeled with an acceptor probe (A-DPc 10). Effective donor positions were calculated from simulated-annealing constrained by both the RyR cryo-EM map and the FKBP atomic structure docked to the RyR. FRET to A-DPc 10 was measured in permeabilized cardiomyocytes via confocal microscopy, converted to distances, and used to trilaterate the acceptor locus within RyR. Additional FRET measurements between donor-labeled calmodulin and A-DPc 10 were used to constrain the <b>trilaterations.</b> Results locate the DPc 10 probe within RyR domain 3, ∼ 35  Å from the previously docked N-terminal domain crystal structure. This multiscale approach may be useful in mapping other RyR sites of mechanistic interest within FRET range of FKBP...|$|R
40|$|Some in-parallel robots, {{such as the}} 3 - 2 - 1 and the 3 / 2 manipulators, have {{attracted}} attention because their forward kinematics can be solved by three consecutive <b>trilaterations.</b> In this paper, we identify a class of these robots, which we call flagged manipulators, whose singularity loci admit a well-behaved decomposition, i. e., a stratification, derived {{from that of the}} flag manifold. Two remarkable properties must be highlighted. First, the decomposition has the same topology for all members in the class, irrespective of the metric details of each particular robot instance. Thus, we provide explicitly all the singular strata and their connectivity, which apply to all flagged manipulators without any tailoring. Second, the strata can be easily characterized geometrically, because it is possible to assign local coordinates to each stratum (in the configuration space of the manipulator) that correspond to uncoupled rotations and/or translations in the workspace.
