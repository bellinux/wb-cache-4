50|$|China {{has long}} been {{considered}} {{the exception to the}} general use of bloomeries. It was thought that the Chinese skipped the bloomery process completely, starting with the blast furnace and the finery forge to produce wrought iron: by the 5th century BC, metalworkers in the southern state of Wu had invented the blast furnace and the means to both cast iron and <b>to</b> <b>decarburize</b> the carbon-rich pig iron produced in a blast furnace to a low-carbon, wrought iron-like material. Recent evidence, however, shows that bloomeries were used earlier in China, migrating in from the west as early as 800 BC, before being supplanted by the locally developed blast furnace. Supporting this theory was the discovery of 'more than ten' iron digging implements found in the tomb of Duke Jing of Qin (d. 537 BCE), whose tomb is located in Fengxiang County, Shaanxi (a museum exists on the site today).|$|E
5000|$|During {{the folding}} process, {{most of the}} {{impurities}} are removed from the steel, continuously refining the steel while forging. By the end of forging, the steel produced was among the purest steel-alloys of the ancient world. Due to the continuous heating the steel tends <b>to</b> <b>decarburize,</b> so a good quantity of carbon is either extracted from the steel as carbon dioxide or redistributed more evenly through diffusion, leaving a nearly eutectoid composition (containing 0.77 to 0.8% carbon). The edge-steel itself will generally {{end up with a}} composition that ranges from eutectoid to slightly hypoeutectoid (containing a carbon content under the eutectoid composition), giving enough hardenability without sacrificing ductility The skin-steel generally has slightly less carbon, often in the range of 0.5%. The core-steel, however, remains nearly pure iron, responding very little to heat treatment. Cyril Stanley Smith, a professor of metallurgical history from MIT, performed an analysis of four different swords, each from a different century, determining the composition of the surface of the blades: ...|$|E
5000|$|Steel {{contains}} {{a relatively small}} percentage of carbon, which can migrate freely within the gamma iron. When austenized steel is exposed to air {{for long periods of}} time, the carbon content in the steel can be lowered. This is the opposite from what happens when steel is heated in a reducing environment, in which carbon slowly diffuses further into the metal. In an oxidizing environment, the carbon can readily diffuse outwardly, so austenized steel is very susceptible to decarburization. This is often used for cast steel, where a high carbon-content is needed for casting, but a lower carbon-content is desired in the finished product. It is often used on cast-irons to produce malleable cast iron, in a process called [...] "white tempering." [...] This tendency <b>to</b> <b>decarburize</b> is often a problem in other operations, such as blacksmithing, where it becomes more desirable to austenize the steel for the shortest amount of time possible to prevent too much decarburization.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan forge to the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig iron in liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid phase is actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron and needs <b>to</b> be <b>decarburized</b> <b>to</b> produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|R
50|$|Backyard steel {{furnaces}} {{were used}} {{by the people of}} China during the Great Leap Forward (1958-62). These small steel blast furnaces were constructed in the backyards of the communes, hence their names. People used every type of fuel they could to power these furnaces, from coal to the wood of coffins. Where iron ore was unavailable, they melted any steel objects they could get their hands on, including pots and pans, and even bicycles, to make steel girders, but these girders were useless, as the steel was impure and of poor quality and thus cracked easily. Unbeknownst to the Communist Party officials, the result was not steel, but high carbon pig iron, which needs <b>to</b> be <b>decarburized</b> <b>to</b> make steel.|$|R
2500|$|The {{inexpensive}} {{process for}} making good quality wrought iron was puddling, which became widespread after 1800. [...] Puddling involved stirring molten cast iron until small globs sufficiently <b>decarburized</b> <b>to</b> form globs of hot wrought iron that were then removed and hammered into shapes. Puddling was extremely labor-intensive. Puddling was used until {{the introduction of}} the Bessemer and open hearth processes in the mid and late 19th century, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{fracture}} {{samples of}} spring steel stabilizer bars in 60 Si 2 Mn were researched in this paper. Through the {{methods such as}} macro-and micro-fracture analysis, SEM fracture morphology observation, microstructure observation (surface and internal organization), and macro-hardness testing to analysis the failure causes for earlier fracture of the stabilizer bars. The results were showed that the fatigue crack source for the non-stress stabilizer bar was on the surface. The earlier fracture cause was due <b>to</b> the <b>decarburized</b> layer {{on the surface and}} the uneven organization in the internal, which lead to the fatigue resistance at the non-severe stress, was greatly decreased. And the fatigue crack of stabilizer bar in the normal stress was originated at the deformation on the surface in the processing...|$|R
40|$|Carbon is {{the most}} {{important}} element going in the steels composition since it largely contributes to their mechanical performance. During the heat treatment of steels, a part of atoms of carbon could be removed from the superficial zone of the steel, which {{is the result of the}} atmospheric oxygen attraction by forming gaseous carbon monoxide. This phenomenon, called decarburizing, can change microstructure in a large extent and, as a result, mechanical properties of the steel. This could lead to unsuitable properties for the service life of mechanical parts. In order to prevent such part from breaking in service, it is necessary to know the affected zone by the decarburizing process. For this purpose, the most used technique is a visual observation by optical microscopy of a cross section of the material. This technique is often associated to the hardness profile obtained by Vickers or Knoop indentations in the same section. Depending on the material and on the specimen preparation, some discrepancies are often observed between the two informations. On the other hand, these techniques require a long preparation and cautious interpretation. Then we propose here to use eddy current testing, which is widely employed to detect fatigue cracks, to give some information about changes in microstructure and to examine carburizing of steel from both mechanical and microstructural point of view. For carburizing, eddy current has been successfully connected to the increase of micro-hardness near the surface. This last result has particularly motivated us to use eddy current <b>to</b> analyze <b>decarburizing.</b> In the present work, different durations in the furnace at a temperature of 920 Â°C before oil quenching were performed on 54 SiCrV 6 (SAE 92 V 45) steel in order to obtain various morphologies of the decarburized zone. We show that eddy current test may be used to qualify the level of decarburizing since, after a convenient Fourier transformation, three components of the amplitude of the signal are directly linked to the duration of the heat treatment. Associated to optical and hardness measurements, it is also shown that the eddy current signal is well related <b>to</b> the <b>decarburizing</b> depth...|$|R
25|$|Cast iron {{is rather}} brittle and {{unsuitable}} for striking implements. It can, however, be <b>decarburized</b> <b>to</b> steel or wrought iron by heating it in air for several days. In China, these ironworking methods spread northward, and by 300 BC, iron was {{the material of}} choice throughout China for most tools and weapons.

The artifacts recovered from this grave are variously made of wrought iron, cast iron, malleabilized cast iron, and quench-hardened steel, with only a few, probably ornamental, bronze weapons.|$|R
5000|$|If {{iron ores}} are heated with carbon to 1420 - 1470 K, a molten liquid is formed, an alloy of about 96.5% iron and 3.5% carbon. This product is strong, can be cast into {{intricate}} shapes, but is too brittle to be worked, unless {{the product is}} <b>decarburized</b> <b>to</b> remove most of the carbon. The vast majority of Chinese iron manufacture, from the Zhou dynasty onward, was of cast iron. However forged swords began {{to be made in}} the Warring-States-period: [...] "Earliest iron and steel jian also appear, made by the earliest and most basic forging and folding techniques." ...|$|R

40|$|Usual heat {{treatments}} of steels like austenitization are generally conducted in air. In such atmosphere, {{a part of}} the atoms of carbon could be removed from the superficial zone of steel. Indeed, those atoms of carbon, combined with oxygen present in atmosphere, can take gaseous form of carbon monoxide due to the great attraction between atoms of carbon and oxygen. This well-known phenomenon is called decarburizing. It can change microstructure to a large extent and, as a result, bring dramatic modifications of mechanical properties of steel, like decrease of fatigue lifetime. To characterize the extent of decarburizing phenomenon, observations by optical microscopy and/or hardness profiles measurements must be performed in a cross section, as it is advised by international standard. Until today, the eddy current technique is used to detect superficial defects. In practice, the control consists to create two groups of available samples or not, from a large sampling. In this study, we propose <b>to</b> estimate the <b>decarburizing</b> extent. In the present work, different durations of austenitizing at 920 Â°C temperature before oil quenching (50 Â°C) were performed on the SAE 92 V 45 steel in order to obtain various morphologies and different total depths of the decarburized zone. We will show, in the continuation, how eddy currents control is used to assess the level of decarburizing after a Fourier transformation performed on the output signal. This analysis allows us to link the harmonic decomposition of the signal to the duration of the heat treatment and/or <b>to</b> the total <b>decarburizing</b> depth and, consequently, to the mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{decarburization}} of high silicon {{spring steel}} in ambient air was studied. The experimental results confirmed the decarburized mechanism under AC 1 temperature, in the temperature range of AC 1 -AC 3 and AC 3 -G. Under AC 1 temperature, pearlite spheroidization and surface decarburization {{are carried out}} simultaneously and pearlite spheroidization is reinforced. Considering the oxidation loss depth, the âtrue ferrite decarburized depthâ at 850 Â°C (AC 3 -G) is still smaller than that at 760 Â°C (AC 1 -AC 3). That is because an âincubation periodâ must pass away before ferrite decarburization occurs in the temperature range of AC 3 -G, and the ferrite decarburized rate is limited to being equal <b>to</b> the partial <b>decarburized</b> rate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. High-manganese {{austenitic}} steels {{are promising}} emerging automotive steels demonstrating high strength and ductility. The main deformation products observed in these steels are mechanical twins and Îµ-martensite, where the dominant deformation products vary quite strongly with stacking fault energy (SFE), {{which in turn}} is a very strong function of the alloy carbon content. In this research, a Fe- 22 Mn- 0. 6 C sheet steel was <b>decarburized</b> <b>to</b> achieve a variety of through-thickness C gradients, thereby varying the dominant deformation products through the sheet thickness, with the overall objective of producing unique microstructures and mechanical properties. Microstructural analyses after interrupted tensile testing indicated that the amount of both mechanical twins and Îµ-martensite increased with increasing true strain, where the deformation products changed from mechanical twins at the higher-C core to Îµ-martensite at the lower-C surface. The spring-back properties of the C graded steels were also compared with reference to the effect of differential carbon concentration gradient...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} heating {{to fracture}} test (CHF) developed at McGill {{was used to}} study the effect of decarburization on the incipient melting temperature. In the CHF test, a sample was deformed at a constant true strain rate, while its temperature is increased at a constant rate. This test allows the incipient melting temperature to be determined using a single test, instead of the several required by isothermal tensile testing. An isothermal decarburization step, <b>to</b> create a <b>decarburized</b> layer at {{the surface of the}} sample, was added prior to the CHF test. Analysis of the true stress vs temperature curves obtained by CHF testing allows the incipient melting temperature to be determined. Optical metallography was used to determine the effect of decarburization time on the observed depth of decarburization. The heat transfer characteristics of induction heating were studied, since this heating technique is known to create a significant temperature gradient at the surface of the piece being heated. Since the decarburized layer is in the high temperature zone, and also has a higher melting point due to its lower carbon content, it {{plays an important role in}} the melting process. A phenomenological model was derived to describe the melting process. It allows for both the temperature gradient due to induction heating and the melting point gradient due to decarburization. The hypothesis is advanced that melting takes place at the position, within the sample, where the temperature profile crosses the incipient melting temperature gradient. From this study, it appears that decarburization acts so as to limit the risk of hot shortness on a workpiece being forged at high temperatures. This is because decarburization raises the IMT, and in this way widens the temperature window of optimum workability...|$|R
