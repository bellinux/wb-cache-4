50|$|While {{the novel}} uses {{many of the}} themes and plot devices that have already seen {{treatment}} in other works by the author, it treads new ground in taking on <b>the</b> fallibility <b>of</b> <b>memory,</b> specifically <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> children (in this case, <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protagonist Jack Burns).

40|$|What {{does it mean}} to {{bear witness}} to <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> {{previous}} generations’ trauma victims? What lessons should we learn from those who came before us to ensure a happier future? This thesis explores <b>the</b> trauma and <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased or older generation found in J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series. I intend to analyze the character of Harry Potter as he interacts with <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous generation, which he is able to resurrect in embodied forms through the use of magic. By testifying to <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous generations’ trauma, Harry is able to break the cycle of violence and create a seemingly happy ending to his life’s story. Through critically studying Harry Potter as a transgenerational narrative, readers are able to learn how to bear witness to <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> those with whom they associate in their own live and create a more empathetically inclined world...|$|R

5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} relies on <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> the would-be predator; {{a bird that}} has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> a bad experience attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E

5|$|But {{above all}} Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime.

In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of the}} Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> the regime for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{violence}} of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> the revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E

Some lack immunity to this disease of evil because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha’s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with an oxygen tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E
