25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of Badang, a slave {{who gained}} super human {{strength}} by eating the vomit {{of a river}} spirit. He used this to win his freedom. Contrary to popular belief, Badang was born in Sayong Pinang, Johor. Upon hearing his strength, he was summoned by the Seri Rama Wira Kerma of Temasik where he displayed his skills. Challengers were sent by foreign kingdoms to defeat him. Among them were King of Kalinga I from India who sent Nadi Bijaya Pikrama, a fierce wrestler, and the noblemen of Perlak who sent Benderang. Badang emerged victorious from both fights and eventually stayed in Temasik until his death.|$|E

His second work, also in Russian, was his Letters on the Study of Nature (1845–46). In 1847 appeared his novel Who is to blame? <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about how the domestic happiness of a young tutor, who marries the unacknowledged daughter of a Russian sensualist of the old type, dull, ignorant and genial, is troubled by a Russian sensualist of the new school, intelligent, accomplished, and callous, with there being no possibility of saying who is most to blame for the tragic ending.|$|E

In the end however, the book was dedicated to Lucie Carr. Stephanie would receive the dedication to The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher in 1906.|$|E

500|$|Shearer {{said in an}} {{interview}} that [...] "The animating impulse was to do rock 'n' roll right. The four of us had been around rock 'n' roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but we wanted to get it right." [...] When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, [...] "No, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that's pretty familiar to people. We're not introducing them to anything they don't really know," [...] so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public. The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a cult following, after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema and it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".|$|E
500|$|Reviewing [...] "The Long Game" [...] for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins {{gave it a}} {{grade of}} [...] "B-". He found it [...] "inessential" [...] and commented {{that it was not}} very clear on the motives of the Editor and Jagrafess, but Pegg's {{performance}} was almost enough to make up for it. Overall he felt that the story [...] "presents a few too many simple ideas, with the cumulative effect that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that feels slight at best, underdeveloped at worst. The episode is hardly a failure, {{but it could have been}} so much more." [...] In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described the episode as [...] "entertaining, if unspectacular." [...] He called Pegg the best guest star so far, and stated that Langley did a [...] "superb job" [...] at conveying Adam, but he felt that the episode did not have much else beside the failed companion storyline. Burk criticised the satire for not being subtle enough and borrowing from other stories such as Nineteen Eighty-Four. He also remarked that it was a shame Adam's motives were cut, as well as development between Rose and Adam. Burk's coauthor Robert [...] was more positive, opining that a satire did not have to be subtle to be effective, and that viewers could still relate it to the news media today. He also praised the way [...] "The Long Game" [...] showed the Ninth Doctor as an [...] "inspirational figure." [...] The two also questioned the decision to leave Adam in the 21st century with future technology.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a survey}} of children's books which [...] "teach about {{emotional}} life," [...] Laura Jana wrote, [...] "On the one hand, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of how an undeniably quirky teenage boy clings to order, deals with a family crisis, and tries {{to make sense of}} the world as he sees it. But it also provides profound insight into a disorder—autism—that leaves those who have it struggling to perceive even the most basic of human emotions. In so doing, The Curious Incident leaves its readers with a greater appreciation of their own ability to feel, express, and interpret emotions. This mainstream literary success made its way to the top of the New York Times bestseller list for fiction at the same time it was being touted by experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism-spectrum disorder as an unrivaled fictional depiction of the inner workings of an autistic teenage boy." ...|$|E

[...] Horn Book, giving it its highest rating of outstanding, said the book was [...] "a rousing adventure story". [...] Booklist contended it was not just an adventure story, saying the dynamic between Charlotte and Zachariah [...] "allows the story to rise above swashbuckling adventure, though that element is there too.
