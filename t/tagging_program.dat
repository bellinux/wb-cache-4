50|$|Some {{well known}} tagging {{programs}} in the United States are the South Carolina Marine Game Fish <b>Tagging</b> <b>Program</b> and the Virginia Game Fish <b>Tagging</b> <b>Program.</b> The South Carolina Marine Game Fish <b>Tagging</b> <b>Program</b> began in 1974 {{and it is now}} the largest public <b>tagging</b> <b>program</b> in the Southeastern United States. Anglers are trained and then receive a tag kit with tags, applicator, and instructions. When they tag a fish, anglers use a reply postcard they receive in advance to send the information on the tag number, tag date, location, species, and size. This program issues anglers who tag and release 30 or more eligible species within a year a conservation award. When an angler recaptures a tagged fish, he then should report the recapture. If possible the tag number and the mailing address should be reported along with the location and date of the recapture as well with the measurement of the fish. The objective is to provide biologists with the necessary information to determine growth rate through an accurate measurement. The Virginia Game Fish <b>Tagging</b> <b>Program</b> started operations in 1995 and keeps records on recaptured fish since then. This is an annual program that starts in January and it is limited to 160 anglers. Anglers receive training workshops in February and March.|$|E

Whether enrollment caps at colleges posed a barrier for applicants is unclear. In the program's first year, 516 of the nearly 2, 500 eligible applicants did not use the grants. About 21 percent of the institutions in which applicants expressed interest restrict the number of out-of-state students that they will accept, although the extent to which this played a role in limiting access to these institutions is unclear. Enrollment at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) changed little during the <b>TAG</b> <b>program's</b> first year. The <b>TAG</b> <b>program</b> and UDC appeared to serve different freshmen populations, which may account for the <b>TAG</b> <b>program's</b> minimal impact on UDC enrollment.

The recruitment of gifted Hispanic English language learners (ELLs) for talented and gifted (<b>TAG)</b> <b>programs</b> {{is but one}} of the many unsettled issues which plague school districts nationwide. The pervasive underrepresentation of this group in TAG education is particularly unacceptable since Hispanics (1) represent the largest and fastest growing minority group; (2) continue to suffer a devastatingly high dropout rate of 30 % as compared to whites 8 % and blacks 13 %; (3) are more likely to come from economically disadvantaged (ED) families; and, (4) belong to one of the least likely minority groups to receive TAG education (Hispanic Dropout Project, 1996). As, noted in the Jacob K. Javits Act, “Students with talent are found in all cultural groups, across all economic strata, and in all areas of human endeavor” (p. 1) and therefore can certainly be found among Hispanic ELLs (P. L. 100 – 297). ^ The purpose of this research was to conduct a detailed study of the process used by an exemplary <b>TAG</b> <b>Program</b> to identify, nominate, and accept Hispanic kindergarten ELLs for TAG Education. A social constructivist perspective of the identification process used by a school district such as the Park City School System served to provide an in depth description of the sociocultural context of a <b>TAG</b> <b>Program</b> which (1) is strongly committed to identifying and serving students as early as the kindergarten level; (2) is based on philosophies and policies of inclusion with respect to Hispanic ELLs; and, (3) refrains from relying heavily on standardized test scores to identify students. ^ Ethnographic techniques were used with a total of 16 participants from both Bilingual and <b>TAG</b> <b>Programs.</b> Data collected from various sources revealed the critical components of an exemplary <b>TAG</b> <b>Program</b> to include: consistent financial support from A Board of Education and Superintendent of Schools; Ownership of the Program; a curriculum which fosters high order critical thinking skills; capable, dedicated, and knowledgeable staff members representative of the community they serve; and the use of a labor intensive identification system which employs a variety of criteria to identify students. ...|$|R

50|$|Many {{different}} types of tags {{are used in the}} TOPP <b>tagging</b> <b>program,</b> each designed for different marine animals and {{different types}} of data. Archival tags, though small, are very powerful, and can last up to 10 years. Researchers surgically implant them into the bellies of tuna, where the tags record, as often as every few seconds, pressure (for depth of dives), ambient light (to estimate location), internal and external body temperature, and, in some cases, speed of travel. The tags are small and light enough to be attached to the outside of an animal, such as the tail feathers of red-footed boobies. However, they do have a drawback, they have to be retrieved. So, they are useful for fish likely to be caught as seafood, such as bluefin or yellowfin tuna, or animals that return to rookeries or nesting beaches, such as boobies and leatherback turtles.|$|E

5000|$|In 2016, the NMFS {{caused the}} death of the L95 orca of the {{critically}} endangered Southern Resident orca population. The Southern Resident orca population travels along the coast of both the United States and Canada, and Canada does not use barbed satellite tags to track orcas because the method is invasive, but the NMFS made the unilateral decision to tag Southern Resident orcas. The L95 orca died five weeks after being shot with a barbed satellite tag and the Canadian necropsy concluded the barb caused a lethal fungal infection. Prior to L95's tagging, Center for Whale Research Senior Scientist Ken Balcomb documented tag detachment issues and was assured by the NMFS that these issues were [...] "fixed," [...] but the tag on L95 broke off and pieces of the barb remained in L95 until death. Although Ken Balcomb documented infections where barbs had failed to detach on orcas and presented his findings to the NMFS, the NMFS site read years later in October 2016, [...] "Our experience with previous occurrences of tag attachment failure has shown no impact to the whale’s general health." [...] Though ocean water could enter the wound and orca skin is not sterile, the NMFS stated the fungal infection may have occurred because the barbed tag was dropped in the ocean and was sterilized with only alcohol, rather than both alcohol and bleach, prior to being aimed again at the orca. Two other orca of the Southern Resident orca population disappeared within weeks of being tagged by the NMFS and are presumed dead, although the cause of death is uncertain as the bodies were not recovered.
