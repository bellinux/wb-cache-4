5|$|During the {{interviews}} and in later correspondence, Josephine and Wyatt {{went to great}} lengths to keep her name out of Lake's book. Lake wrote Earp that he planned to send portions of the book to his New York agent, but Earp objected because he wanted to read it first. After Earp's death on January 13, 1929, Josephine continued <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> Lake to leave her and Earp's former wife, Mattie Blaylock, out of the book, even threatening legal action. Lake finally published Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal in 1931, two years after Earp's death.|$|E
5|$|In late 1164 Roger led a {{deputation}} from Henry II that {{visited the}} papal court, or curia, <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> Alexander III that any {{decision on the}} deposition of Becket should take place in England under a papal legate, rather than in Rome. While Becket was in exile, Roger also managed to secure papal permission for archbishops of York to carry their cross {{in front of them}} anywhere in England, a right that had long been a bone of contention between Canterbury and York. Later, the pope rescinded the permission, but consistently refused to give primacy to either Canterbury or York in their struggles.|$|E
5|$|Around 21:30 on August 14, Hatanaka's rebels {{set their}} plan into motion. The Second Regiment of the First Imperial Guards {{had entered the}} palace grounds, {{doubling}} {{the strength of the}} battalion already stationed there, presumably to provide extra protection against Hatanaka's rebellion. But Hatanaka, along with Lt.Col. Jirō Shiizaki, convinced the commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, Colonel Toyojirō Haga, of their cause, by telling him (falsely) that Generals Anami and Umezu, and the commanders of the Eastern District Army and Imperial Guards Divisions were all in on the plan. Hatanaka also went to the office of Shizuichi Tanaka, commander of the Eastern region of the army, <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> him to join the coup. Tanaka refused, and ordered Hatanaka to go home. Hatanaka ignored the order.|$|E

5|$|Automatic {{closure of}} public schools which racially {{integrate}} — The legislation required that any school which integrated (voluntarily or not) must be immediately and automatically closed. However, the governor was given the discretion to take over integrated school(s) and reopen the school(s) on a segregated basis rather than close the entire district. Integrated schools {{did not have to}} stay closed, however. A school district could petition the governor to take over one or more schools (or the entire district) that had closed and reopen them as segregated schools. Whether exercising his discretion or acting on a petition from the school district, the governor was authorized to act only as an agent of the Assembly. The governor was also required <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> the African American child to return to his or her racially segregated school, so that the schools could reopen on a segregated basis.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1217, a French fleet arrived off {{the coast}} of Sandwich, {{bringing}} Louis soldiers, siege engines and fresh supplies. Hubert de Burgh, Henry's justiciar, set sail to intercept it, resulting in the Battle of Sandwich. De Burgh's fleet scattered the French and captured their flagship, commanded by Eustace the Monk, who was promptly executed. When the news reached Louis, he entered into fresh peace negotiations. Henry, Isabella, Louis, Guala and William came to agreement on the final Treaty of Lambeth, also known as the Treaty of Kingston, on the 12 and 13 September. The treaty was similar to the first peace offer, but excluded the rebel clergy, whose lands and appointments remained forfeit. Louis accepted a gift of £6,666 to speed his departure from England, and promised <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> King Philip to return Henry's lands in France. Louis left England as agreed and joined the Albigensian Crusade in the south of France.|$|E
5|$|Over £840 {{million in}} cash from more than 100 UK local {{authorities}} was invested in Icelandic banks. Representatives from each council met <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> the Treasury to secure {{the money in the}} same way that customers' money in Icesave was fully guaranteed. Of all the local authorities, Kent County Council has the most money invested in Icelandic banks, currently £50 million. Transport for London, the organisation that operates and coordinates transport services within London, also has a large investment at £40 million. Local authorities were working under government advice to invest their money across many national and international banks as a way of spreading risk. Other UK organisations said to have invested heavily include police services and fire authorities, and even the Audit Commission. It is hoped that about one-third of the deposited money will be available fairly rapidly, corresponding to the liquid assets of the UK subsidiaries: liquidation of other assets, such as loans and offices, will take longer.|$|E
5000|$|From the mid-1960s, McDonald devoted much of {{his time}} <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> journalists, {{politicians}} and his colleagues that UFOs were the most pressing issue facing American science. He gave dozens of lectures, and wrote volumes of letters to newspapers, to his peers (especially at scientific journals) and to politicians. McDonald wrote to the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, arguing that they needed to radically shift what he saw as their superficial perspective towards UFOs. In response, the Air Force determined that they needed to [...] "fireproof" [...] themselves against McDonald's statements because of his unquestionable qualifications and credibility.|$|R

We want it to pervade and penetrate all the utterances of life, social and political, domestic and artistic, educational and recreational. There should be propaganda by word and action, the platform and the press, the street corner, the workshop, and the domestic circle, acts of revolt, and the example of our own lives as free men.

25|$|By {{the start}} of April, the {{conflict}} seemed closer to resolution. NATO countries began to deliberate about invading Kosovo with ground units. U.S. President Bill Clinton was reluctant to commit US forces for a ground offensive. At the same time, Finnish and Russian negotiators continued <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> Milošević to back down. Faced with little alternative, Milošević accepted the conditions offered by a Finnish-Russian mediation team and agreed to a military presence within Kosovo headed by the UN, but incorporating NATO troops.|$|E

50|$|When Benteen tells Sloane that {{he intends}} to {{petition}} the US government for a land grant so that the colonists can remain together as an intentional community, Sloane is aghast at the idea and says he should discuss it with the colonists rather than assuming their approval. When he does so, he learns the colonists have already made plans to settle in different states, and have no enthusiasm for his plan to stay together. He resorts <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> them <b>to</b> stay on V9-Gamma by characterizing Earth as a place of violence and hardship. When they still unanimously choose to return home, Benteen, having convinced himself of his new negative image of Earth, says that he will remain behind, alone if he must.|$|R

25|$|A {{delegation}} {{from the}} Arab League came to New York <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> {{the architects of}} the UN draft, France and USA, to base it on the Siniora Plan. This, combined with a strong opposition to the existing draft from several of the 15 Council members, especially Qatar, resulted in a change of France's position. In order to avoid a total collapse of the UN efforts to end the hostilities, this eventually led to a substantial revision of the draft proposal (with several re-drafts in between), which included many elements from the Siniora Plan.|$|E

Friends also said that Tanguy did not like Sage’s painting and felt jealous of the fame that came to her. The couple must have shared different feelings in private, however, because all accounts agree that Sage was devastated by Tanguy’s death. “Yves was my only friend who understood everything,” she wrote to Jehan Mayoux, {{an old friend of}} Tanguy’s, about a month after Tanguy’s fatal stroke.|$|E
