25|$|These criticisms {{are also}} voiced by non-libertarian transhumanist advocates, {{especially}} self-described democratic transhumanists, {{who believe that}} the majority of current or future social and environmental issues (such as unemployment and resource depletion) need to be addressed by a combination of political and <b>technological</b> <b>solutions</b> (like a guaranteed minimum income and alternative technology). Therefore, on the specific issue of an emerging genetic divide due to unequal access to human enhancement technologies, bioethicist James Hughes, in his 2004 book , argues that progressives or, more precisely, techno-progressives must articulate and implement public policies (i.e., a universal health care voucher system that covers human enhancement technologies) in order to attenuate this problem as much as possible, rather than trying to ban human enhancement technologies. The latter, he argues, might actually worsen the problem by making these technologies unsafe or available only to the wealthy on the local black market or in countries where such a ban is not enforced.|$|E
25|$|Support Branch is sub-divided {{into five}} divisions. Field Division is {{responsible}} for coordinating policy matters relating to firearms, equipment, uniforms and operational procedures. Projects undertaken by the Division during the year included the force-wide introduction of the OC Foam and the new, expandable baton. It had also been instrumental in developing <b>technological</b> <b>solutions</b> {{to a number of}} policing problems and is currently conducting a review of police uniforms including the cap and the shoes as well as other accoutrements. General Division handles policy matters relating to station procedures; the security and management of the Police Headquarters (PHQ) complex; and diverse other duties. During the year, the Division {{played a major role in}} the streamlining of station procedures; making arrangements for the reallocation of offices and facilities; formulating a new policy for parking at the PHQ as required by the PHQ Redevelopment Project and such other duties as coordinating the Force involvement in the District Council elections. Transport Division {{is responsible for}} the management and deployment of the Force fleet of approximately 2,400 vehicles, driver establishment and the acquisition of new police vehicles. It also administers all policy matters relating to police transport requirements. Force Data and Access to Information Coordination Unit is responsible for coordinating the Force response to devising internal policy on and ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance and the Code on Access to Information. Police Licensing Office acts as the licensing authority for a number of licences and permits.|$|E
500|$|By this logic, market-based {{solutions}} to ecological crises (ecological economics, environmental economics, green economy) are rejected as technical tweaks {{that do not}} confront capitalism's structural failures. [...] "Low-risk" [...] technology/science-based solutions such as solar power, sustainable agriculture, and increases in energy efficiency are seen as necessary but insufficient. [...] "High-risk" [...] <b>technological</b> <b>solutions</b> such as nuclear power and climate engineering are entirely rejected. Attempts made by businesses to [...] "greenwash" [...] their practices are regarded as false advertising, and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology (such as Walmart's proposition to supply their electricity with solar power) has the effect opposite of reductions in resource consumption, viz. further economic growth. Sustainable business models and the triple bottom line are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the distribution of wealth to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable/unsustainable. Ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerate—and capitalist governments to implement—constraints on maximum profit (such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures) renders environmental reforms incapable of facilitating large-scale change: [...] "History teaches us that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements ... at a certain point, at which the system's underlying accumulation drive is affected, its resistance to environmental demands stiffens." [...] They also note that, up until the event of total ecological collapse, destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation; thus, capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters (i.e. convert to sustainable/ecological production).|$|E

2500|$|As a {{background}} to this change of ownership, the general climate {{for science and}} technology was becoming less favourable. [...] Faith in scientific and <b>technological</b> <b>solutions</b> was diminished by some spectacular failures: the de Havilland Comet suffered catastrophic in-flight failures; thalidomide caused tragic birth defects. [...] Government procurement projects were frequently out of control: the BAC TSR-2 was cancelled after enormous overspend in development and only 24 test flights; the de Havilland Blue Streak missile was also abandoned in 1960 after great expense.|$|E
2500|$|The {{challenges}} of the environment required sophisticated agricultural technology. Unlike the Middle East, the Andes lacked easily domesticated and large-seeded plants such as wheat and barley and large and easily domesticated animals such as horses and cattle. [...] Agriculture on the desert coast required the development of irrigation. In the mountains, the climate and steep terrain required a range of <b>technological</b> <b>solutions</b> such as terraces (andenes), exploitation of micro climates, and selective breeding. Due to the climatic uncertainties, farmers traditionally farmed several crops at several elevations and exposures. [...] At a macro level, societies and states {{did the same with}} the vertical archipelago, establishing colonies at different elevations and locations to increase the possibilities of agricultural success.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Technological</b> <b>solutions</b> to {{mitigate}} large-scale wind energy type intermittency exist such as increased interconnection (the European super grid), Demand response, load management, diesel generators (in the British National Grid, Frequency Response / National Grid Reserve Service type schemes, {{and use of}} existing power stations on standby. Studies by academics and grid operators indicate {{that the cost of}} compensating for intermittency is expected to be high at levels of penetration above the low levels currently in use today [...] Large, distributed power grids are better able to deal with high levels of penetration than small, isolated grids. [...] For a hypothetical European-wide power grid, analysis has shown that wind energy penetration levels as high as 70% are viable, and that the cost of the extra transmission lines would be only around 10% of the turbine cost, yielding power at around present day prices. [...] Smaller grids may be less tolerant to high levels of penetration.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} why a <b>technological</b> <b>solution</b> {{is chosen}} {{to solve a}} problem with malnourished elderly in the nursing home Akaciegården at Frederiksberg in Denmark. The solution is not yet a reality but the plan is {{to use it as a}} way for the staff to document how much food they serve for the elderly at the nursing home, so that the kitchen manager can find the ones who doesn’t do their job properly. The project uses Mary Douglas’ theory ‘Risk and Blame’ and Evgeny Morozov’s description of the ideology Morozov calls ‘Solutionism’. Based on observations, interviews and the theories we argue that the culture on Akaciegården is based on a blaming-system and that the technology serves as an alibi, so that the staff won’t risk getting accused or blamed for something they haven’t done. Furthermore we argue that the kitchen manager wants a <b>technological</b> <b>solution</b> that can prove that her job is important and by that legitimize her position at the nursing home. The biggest problem with Akaciegården’s project is, that there is no real problem to solve. We therefore argue that the <b>technological</b> <b>solution</b> won’t ever be more than a technological fix...|$|R

2500|$|In some cases, {{laboratory}} mix-ups (misidentified gametes, {{transfer of}} wrong embryos) have occurred, leading to {{legal action against}} the IVF provider and complex paternity suits. An example {{is the case of}} a woman in California who received the embryo of another couple and was notified of this mistake after the birth of her son. This has led to many authorities and individual clinics implementing procedures to minimise the risk of such mix-ups. [...] The HFEA, for example, requires clinics to use a double witnessing system, [...] the identity of specimens is checked by two people at each point at which specimens are transferred. Alternatively, <b>technological</b> <b>solutions</b> are gaining favour, to reduce the manpower cost of manual double witnessing, and to further reduce risks with uniquely numbered RFID tags which can be identified by readers connected to a computer. The computer tracks specimens throughout the process and alerts the embryologist if non-matching specimens are identified. Although the use of RFID tracking has expanded in the USA, it is still not widely adopted. However, In other cases there has been not mix-up of embryos or gametes, but the intentional use of embryos of another couple or gamete donor, without informed consent of parents, both: receptors or donors. Some of these cases are taking a legal and judicial course.|$|E
