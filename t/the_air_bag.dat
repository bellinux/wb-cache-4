25|$|An air bag is {{a safety}} feature {{designed}} to protect automobile passengers in a head-on collision. Most cars today have driver's side airbags and many have one {{on the passenger side}} as well. Located in the steering wheel assembly on the driver's side and in the dashboard on the passenger side, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> device responds within milliseconds of a crash. The original safety cushion was first created by John W. Hetrick in 1952. After a car accident that his family was involved in, Hetrick drew sketches of compressed air stored in a container. When a spring-loaded weight senses the car decelerating at a rapid enough rate, it opens a valve that allows the pressure in the container to fill a bag. With this knowledge, he developed his design until he was able to obtain a patent on the device on August 5, 1952. Later in 1967, Dr. Allen S. Breed invented and developed a key component for automotive use in 1967, the ball-in-tube inertial sensor for crash detection. Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation to Chrysler.|$|E
50|$|Blobbing is {{an outdoor}} water {{activity}} in which a participant sits {{on the end of}} a partially inflated air bag (known as a water trampoline or blob) and is launched into the water when another participant jumps onto <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> from a platform on the opposite side. The activity is popular at summer camps in North America. Various tricks may also be performed while the participant is in the air. <b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> is approximately 10 m long by 2 m wide.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of driver side <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> loads for out-of-position (OOP) occupants at the ISO- 1 (chin on bag) position was performed using the 50 th per-centile THOR-NT dummy. The main objective was to observe {{the response of the}} dummy under expo-sures to various types of <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b> Dummy sensitivity to <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> was evaluated in terms of upper neck loads and head acceleration. Five types of late-model fleet <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> modules were used in a total of ten tests (two repeat tests per <b>air</b> <b>bag).</b> Sealed tank tests were also performed to characterize <b>the</b> five different <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> inflators. For one bag, the THOR-NT produced very repeatable measurements. For other bag types, the THOR-NT exposed the variability of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>bags,</b> especially in its upper neck moment measurements. The high-speed videos confirmed the inflation vari-ability of those <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b> <b>The</b> THOR-NT was able to segregate the moment at the head/neck pin joint (rep-resenting human occipital condyles) from the total head/neck cross-sectional moment. The THOR-NT performed smoothly throughout the test and was gen-erally user-friendly. A limitation is recognized that only two <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> for each model were used for repeat tests...|$|R

50|$|In Europe, airbags {{were almost}} entirely absent from {{mainstream}} cars {{until the early}} 1990s. By 1991, four manufacturers - BMW, Honda, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo - offered <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> on some of their higher-end models, but shortly afterwards, airbags became a common feature on more mainstream cars.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> vest is a {{personal}} safety device worn by some motorcyclists that has found greatest use among equestrian competitors. The device is worn over a standard padded vest and is automatically inflated by gas released from a carbon dioxide canister when a tether attached to the horse's saddle is extended during a fall.|$|E

50|$|On November 8, 2012, Chrysler {{announced}} the recall on certain model year 2002 though 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee vehicles manufactured February 13, 2001, through May 23, 2003. A component in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> control module may fail causing the front airbags, side curtain airbags, and/or seatbelt pretensioners to deploy inadvertently while {{the vehicle is}} being operated.|$|E
50|$|The {{installation}} and configuration {{of these systems}} varies for different makes and models but the underlying principle remains the same. The metal spring (coil or leaf) is removed, and an air bag, {{also referred to as}} an air spring, is inserted or fabricated to fit in the place of the factory spring. When air pressure is supplied to <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>bag,</b> the suspension can be adjusted either up or down (lifted or lowered).|$|E

5000|$|The {{design of}} the TS-50's fuze gives it a large degree of {{resistance}} to explosive overpressure clearance techniques, because the short sharp shock from an explosion does not last long enough to force enough air into <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> to trigger the mine. This feature, combined {{with the use of}} non-magnetic metals used in the mine, make it difficult to clear using conventional techniques. A metal [...] "detector" [...] disc is provided with the mine to make it more detectable, however it is rarely used.|$|E

50|$|Air line {{failure is}} {{a failure of the}} tubing which connects <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> or struts to the rest of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> system, and is {{typically}} DOT-approved nylon air brake line. This usually occurs when <b>the</b> <b>air</b> lines, which must be routed to <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> through <b>the</b> chassis of the vehicle, rub against a sharp edge of a chassis member or a moving suspension component, causing a hole to form. This mode of failure will typically take some time to occur after the initial installation of the system, as the integrity of a section of air line is compromised to the point of failure due to the rubbing and resultant abrasion of the material. An air-line failure may also occur if a piece of road debris hits an air line and punctures or tears it, although this is unlikely to occur in normal road use. It does occur in harsh off-road conditions but it still not common if correctly installed.|$|R
