5|$|The National Diet is the legislature, {{the organ}} of the Legislative branch. It is bicameral, {{consisting}} of two houses with the House of Councillors being the upper house, and the House of Representatives being the lower house. Its members are directly elected from <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> the source of sovereignty. The Supreme Court and other inferior courts make up the Judicial branch, and they are independent from the executive and the legislative branches.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E
25|$|Cosmopolitan {{democracy}}, {{also known}} as Global democracy or World Federalism, is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale, either directly or through representatives. An important justification {{for this kind of}} system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who, by definition, cannot vote. By contrast, in a cosmopolitan democracy, <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> affected by decisions also have a say in them.|$|E

In the period of the divided monarchy it was only used to refer to the inhabitants of the northern Kingdom of Israel, and it is only extended to cover the people of the southern Kingdom of Judah in post-exilic usage.|$|E
25|$|One {{objection}} is that {{a democratic}} republic built on freedom of dissent should not require its citizens to pledge allegiance to it, and that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right to refrain from speaking or standing, which itself is also a form of speech {{in the context of}} the ritual of pledging allegiance. Another objection is that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> most likely to recite the Pledge every day, small children in schools, cannot really give their consent or even completely understand the Pledge they are making. Another criticism {{is that a}} government requiring or promoting this phrase violates protections against the establishment of religion guaranteed in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} seats always exceeds the number available. Members {{of the public}} are {{admitted}} to the College through the main gate on King's Parade from 7:30 am (though some start queueing the night before), and each person is given an information leaflet which must be retained and shown to the duty porter for re-entry {{if he or she}} desires to leave the queue temporarily. People joining the queue before 9:00 am will usually gain admission to the Chapel, but this is not guaranteed. Porters monitor the number of people joining the queue, and once there are as many people as there are seats available, the others are advised that it is unlikely {{they will be able to}} attend the service. Members of Collegium Regale (the Choral Scholars of King's College Choir) usually sing Christmas carols to entertain <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> queueing.|$|E

25|$|The {{general public}} are {{familiar}} with the names of the High Secure Hospitals due to the frequency that they are mentioned in the news reports about <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> sent there. Those in England include, Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside; Broadmoor Hospital in Crowthorne, Berkshire and Rampton Secure Hospital in Retford, Nottinghamshire and in Scotland is The State Hospital, Carstairs. Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man have their own Medium and Low Secure units but use the mainland faculties for High Secure, which smaller Channel Islands also transfer their patients to as Out of Area Referrals under the Mental Health Act 1983. Of the Medium Secure units, there are many more of these in number scattered throughout the UK. As of 2009 there were 27 women only units in England alone. Irish units include those at prisons in Portlaise, Castelrea, and Cork.|$|E
25|$|Device {{fingerprinting}} is {{a fairly}} new technology that is useful in fraud prevention and safeguarding any information from one's computer. Device fingerprinting uses data from the device and browser sessions to determine the risk of conducting business with the person using the device. This technology allows companies to better assess the risks when business is conducted through sites that include, e-commerce sites, social networking and online dating sites and banks and other financial institutions. ThreatMetrix {{is one of the}} leading vendors of device fingerprinting. This company employs a number of techniques to prevent fraud. For example, ThreatMetrix will pierce the proxy to determine the true location of a device. Due to the growing number of hackers and fraudsters using 'botnets' of millions of computers that are being unknowingly controlled, this technology will help not only the companies at risk but <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> unaware their computers are being used.|$|E
25|$|Studying {{earthquakes}} {{has shown}} to be a difficult task when considering all the limitations created by natural disasters. Clinical interviews are difficult because of the widespread damage to infrastructure and roads, which leads to reliance on self-report. Self-report can introduce bias to results, leading to skewed data. Researchers are unable to reliably compare an individual's mental health status to their health status previous to the trauma because they must rely on retrospective self-report. Retrospective self-report is affected greatly by the individual's current state of distress. The displacement of large numbers of citizens following a trauma poses as a problem for researchers of natural disasters. It is predicted that <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> displaced experience the worst of the damage, and therefore the reported levels of PTSD and depression are often lower than they would have been had the displaced citizens been available to collect data from. Because large number of citizens are being displaced, it is difficult to find a representative sample population. For example, after the Christchurch earthquakes, studies reported that older educated females of European New Zealand descent were over represented in their sample population, which isn't accurate of the Christchurch population as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Above all I want no long {{faces and}} no show of grief at the burying ground. Kindly observe the final {{wishes of the}} {{undersigned}} and avoid reading the so-called Christian burial service which, {{in view of the}} language employed in it, I regard {{as one of the most}} cruel and paganish things inherited by our forebears from our remote pagan ancestors. In deference to the faith of our dear mother who was through her lifetime a loyal though never bigoted communicant of that congregation, perhaps the current pastor of the First Presbyterian Church would consent to read the Twenty-third Psalm, which was her favorite passage in the Scriptures and is mine since it contains no charnel words, no morbid mouthings about corruption and decay and, being mercifully without creed or dogma, carries no threat of eternal hell-fire for those parties we do not like, no direct promise of a heaven which, if one may judge by <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> surest of going there, must be a powerfully dull place, populated to a considerable and uncomfortable degree by prigs, time-servers and unpleasantly aggressive individuals. Hell may have a worse climate but undoubtedly the company is sprightlier. The Catholics, with their genius for stage-management, handle this detail better. The officiating clergyman speaks in Latin and the parishioners, being unacquainted with that language are impressed by the majesty of the rolling, sonorous periods without being shocked by tressing allusions and harrowing references.|$|E

500|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{identify}} the influence of Kafka's legal background and the role of law in his fiction. Most interpretations identify aspects of law and legality as important in his work, in which the legal system is often oppressive.

These are hidden from the individual but control the lives of <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> innocent victims of systems beyond their control.

500|$|The two [...] "co-protagonists" [...] of {{the book}} are 5-Liu Hsing and 5-Nova Luis.

As with other members of their generation, Hsing and Luis grow up in an environment devoid of terrestrial ties, as a result of which they are, as children, unfamiliar with the terms [...] "hill", [...] "sky" [...] and [...] "wind". Despite not having an understanding of a planetary existence, Hsing and Luis are among <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not convinced by the beliefs of the angels.
