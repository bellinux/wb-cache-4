Club said {{although}} {{he liked the}} pilot episode, he thought jokes in [...] "Canvassing" [...] were [...] "pretty thin on the ground", the supporting cast lacked good material and the Leslie character was less likable than the previous week. Phipps, who gave the episode a C grade, said, [...] "This wasn’t a terrible half-hour of comedy by any stretch. It drifted by easily enough. But I’m already having to scour my notes <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> {{of the stuff that}} was funny." [...] "Canvassing" [...] was first broadcast in Australia on Channel Seven on December 8, 2009, and received a positive review from The Sydney Morning Herald writer Mark Ellis.

Brooks viewed Gaga's interview with Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes, which prompted Al Jean to write a script and send her a letter of approval {{to appear on the}} show. [...] "She was really excited about the whole thing," [...] Jean recalled. [...] "After she signed on to do it, she came in to record dialogue twice, and we showed her a rough cut the second time." [...] Recording sessions for the episode took place in Los Angeles during a period of four days from August 22–26. Gaga was initially apprehensive while recording on set, which led her to review the satirical nature of the show to get a better understanding on how to perform. [...] "Their characters are so awesomely convincing and sincere and wild and funny, I had <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> constantly of the sincerity of the humor," [...] she explained. [...] "That's what I was trying to focus on—not putting on a character too much, and really being as sincere as I could with the lines." [...] Despite such emotions, Gaga professed that working with the staff of the show was [...] "one of the coolest things that [...] has ever done".|$|E
500|$|Silent Hill 2 {{received}} {{praise from}} video game journalists {{at the time}} of its release and in retrospect. Andy Greenwald of Spin magazine praised it as a frightening but [...] "restrained" [...] game. Jon Thompson of AllGame stated: [...] "Silent Hill 2 feels a bit rushed, and although it might not live up to the dizzying horror of the first game, it packs enough of its own punch to make it a worthy sequel." [...] IGN's Doug Perry wrote: [...] "It's frightening, deep, clever, and tries to improve the genre, if just a little, and in the end, that's all I really want in a survival horror game." [...] Joe Fielder of GameSpot concluded, [...] "Silent Hill 2 is a much prettier, somewhat smarter but less a compelling game than the original." [...] In [...] (2010), Tristian Donovan described Silent Hill 2 as the [...] "high point" [...] of the series. In a retrospective article on the survival horror genre, IGN writer Jim Sterling praised the game's plot as [...] "one of the finest examples of narrative construction in gaming to this day". In another retrospective article on survival horror, fellow IGN writer Travis Fahs credited the game as a factor in the [...] "short-lived period of renewed interest in horror games". Online game critic for [...] The Escapist Magazine Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw lists this game as among his top five favourite games of all time, praising it for its thick and unsettling atmosphere creating tension and fear for players. In his review of the game he commented, [...] "Silent Hill 2 is the game I replay every now and again <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> that for all the shiny brown, quick-time event, RPG element space marines, gaming is still worth defending," [...] and that [...] "It's a fascinating voyage of pain and despair that leaves you emotionally drained and satisfied." ...|$|E

Anyone who saw them in any of the films or plays in which they co-starred will know how well they played together professionally. As you watch them together now, complementing (and complimenting) each other, you can't help wondering how much of their professional success was a spin-off from a stimulating partnership off-screen or off-stage. It seems timely to pay tribute to them for what they achieved in the performing arts in Australia and elsewhere...|$|R

This episode is Hannigan's third {{crossover}} into Angel; she previously appeared {{on the phone to}} Cordelia in [...] "Disharmony", and delivered the news of Buffy's death at the end of [...] "There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb". Hannigan, involved in both American Pie and Buffy while this episode filmed, was excited to work with her fiance, Alexis Denisof, whom she met while the two were on Buffy. Denisof was also excited.

He also learned Arabic grammar thanks to the cheikh Mohamed Belkadhi. Nevertheless, also French teachers marked him such as Mr. Collières who taught him French. [...] "I {{can assure you that}} neither in Lycée Carnot nor, years later in university, did I have to acquire new skills to perfect this language [...] He had taught us the art of french writing. His teaching methods were remarkable. And if I learned to write articles in the admired perfect articulation and harmonious balance, it is to him that I owe that".|$|E

There is some point where I learnt enough about myself to know that I don't have the {{tolerance}} to create other hurdles as well." [...] In 1999, Cornell said about depression, [...] "No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, but try <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 1987 she {{was asked}} at an {{editorial}} conference to [...] "go and have tea" [...] with the right-wing militant Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging leader Eugène Terre'Blanche. She later admitted, [...] "I had not heard of him" [...] as {{she had not been}} a particularly [...] "political person" [...] and that he was a strange subject for a newspaper she described as [...] "extreme centre". On 31 January 1988, the Sunday Times published Allan's interview with Terre'Blanche for Allan's Face to Face column. In the interview, Allan wrote of her fascination with Terre'Blanche: [...] "Right now I've got <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> to breathe ... I'm impaled on the blue flames of his blowtorch eyes." [...] Despite claiming that she became the [...] "heroine of the newsroom" [...] for her frankness, she later told the Sunday Times journalist Stuart Wavell that she regretted describing Terre'Blanche in these terms, not realising the political veneration that would be read into them. She pointed towards the lack of knowledge she had about the Hitler personality cult [...] "It sounds farfetched, but we are only taught South African history at school." [...] Although Wavell identified that the words were not significant compared to her other material; [...] "a perusal of her interviews shows a fondness for such extravagant language." [...] Allan later told a journalist that [...] "From the moment that interview was published, my life was over. It has destroyed my career in South Africa." ...|$|E

I now loathe the United States and what it has done to Iraq and the rest of the helpless world," [...] despite [...] "remembering the many Americans that I know and respect." [...] She wrote of her distress at images of the war, her objections to Jack Straw about the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, and [...] "American imperialism, American infantilism, and American triumphalism about victories it didn't even win." [...] She recalled George Orwell's words in Nineteen Eighty-Four about [...] "the intoxication of power" [...] and [...] "the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - for ever." [...] She closed by saying, [...] "I hate feeling this hatred. I have <b>to</b> keep <b>reminding</b> <b>myself</b> that if Bush hadn't been (so narrowly) elected, we wouldn't be here, and none of this would have happened. There is another America.

40|$|Master of EducationI {{present the}} {{introduction}} and concluding {{chapter in the}} first person in an ontological acknowledgement of self as one who practised my profession and reformed my practice, and who has reflected on my practice as a teacher, as a researcher, and as teacher-researcher. I wrote the other chapters in the formal language of the third person to assist me in developing some degree of objectivity about my practice; it served as a constant reminder to me that I was writing about something that could be considered, to some degree, as other than myself. I was investigating a teacher's practice, my past practice, and as such I strove for a non-egocentric assessment, yet acknowledge that it was my practice at a unique time in my career, a period through which my practice has now grown. This reflection on- practice was not easy, either intellectually or emotionally, and I needed <b>to</b> constantly <b>remind</b> <b>myself</b> that I could be simultaneously a merciless critic, and an empathic one. I moved from the role of teacher to researcher and into teacher-researcher as the moment required and used the third person to present my experience from these perspectives as seemed most appropriate and for presenting the narrative elements of the lived moment.
