5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) is {{a member}} of a Singaporean {{opposition}} political party who, according to the Constitution and Parliamentary Elections Act, is declared to have been elected a Member of the Parliament of Singapore despite having lost in a general election by virtue of having been one of the best-performing losers. NCMPs enjoy most of the privileges of ordinary Members of Parliament. They are, however, not allowed to vote on several types of bills such as bills to amend the Constitution and motions of no confidence in the Government. An election candidate who has been offered an NCMP seat may decline to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
5|$|On September 4, 1980, {{the newly}} proclaimed Islamic Republic of Iran {{replaced}} the Red Lion and Sun with the Red Crescent, consistent with most other Muslim nations. Though the Red Lion and Sun has now fallen into disuse, Iran {{has in the}} past reserved the right to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> again at any time; the Geneva Conventions continue to recognize it as an official emblem, and that status was confirmed by Protocol III in 2005 even as it added the Red Crystal.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji's early {{preoccupation with}} the occult subsided, and he became more {{interested}} in other religions, {{although it is not}} known whether he practised any. He was enthusiastic about Parsi culture, but became disillusioned with Parsis after visiting India in 1932. He embraced only a few of aspects of Zoroastrianism, and in later years he was interested in Roman Catholicism, although he did not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> For much of his life he practised yoga, but it is not known what branch of it.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, Paul filed {{to run for}} {{re-election}} to his Senate seat in 2016. Had he become the Republican presidential (or vice-presidential) nominee, state law would prohibit him from simultaneously running {{for re-election}}. In March 2014, the Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate passed {{a bill that would}} allow Paul to run for both offices, but the Democratic-controlled Kentucky House of Representatives declined to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Paul spent his own campaign money in the 2014 legislative elections, helping Republican candidates for the State House in the hopes of flipping the chamber, thus allowing the legislature to pass the bill (Democratic Governor Steve Beshear's veto can be overridden with a simple majority). However, the Democrats retained their 54–46 majority in the State House. Paul has since given his support to the idea that the Kentucky Republican Party could decide to hold a caucus rather than a primary, potentially giving Paul more time to decide whether he should run for U.S. Senator or continue a potential bid for President.|$|E

25|$|Due to the emblem's {{association}} with the Iranian monarchy, the Islamic Republic of Iran replaced the Red Lion and Sun with the Red Crescent in 1980, consistent with two existing Red Cross and Red Crescent symbols. Though the Red Lion and Sun has now fallen into disuse, Iran {{has in the past}} reserved the right to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> again at any time; the Geneva Conventions continue to recognize it as an official emblem, and that status was confirmed by Protocol III in 2005 even as it added the Red Crystal.|$|E
25|$|Between films, Denny overheard {{a racket}} {{next door and}} went to investigate. He found the neighbor's son {{attempting}} to start {{one of the earliest}} radio control model airplanes. Denny attempted to help, but they instead ended up destroying the model. While attempting to get it fixed, Denny became acquainted with the newly forming model industry, one of whom convinced him to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> as a hobby. In 1934 he started a small hobby shop with a partner on Hollywood Boulevard, but after two years it went out of business.|$|E

25|$|Day/night cricket, {{also known}} as Floodlit cricket is a cricket match that is played either totally, or more usually partially, under {{floodlights}} in the evening. The first regular cricket to be played under floodlights occurred during World Series Cricket, unsanctioned by the International Cricket Council, attracting large crowds {{to see some of}} the world's best players compete in Australia and the West Indies. In 1979, when the ICC and World Series Cricket came to an understanding, the first floodlit One Day International was played, also in Australia. Floodlit cricket has since been played around the world, although England was slow to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> due to their climate.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} {{the trauma of the}} expedition, Charles Houston was keen to make another attempt on K2, and {{requested}} permission for further expedition in 1954. He was extremely disappointed that a large Italian expedition had booked the mountain that year. The Italian expedition was successful, and while Houston had permission for 1955 he did not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> and gave up mountaineering in order to concentrate on his career researching high altitude medicine. Pete Schoening, however, returned to the Karakoram in 1958 and, with Andy Kauffman made the first ascent of Gasherbrum I; at 8080m the highest first ascent ever made by an American team.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of flying the Jolly Roger {{was adopted by}} some other submarines during World War I, but became more widespread in World War II. Flotilla commanders began to issue flags to submarines, and procedures were drafted for usage. Although some sources report {{the use of the}} flag being a universal practice among British submariners, some submarine captains did not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> as the felt the practice was boastful and the achievements could not always be confirmed. Usage of the Jolly Roger was copied by some Allied submarines during World War II, and the flag has also been used by submarines from other Commonwealth nations.|$|E

25|$|Blackburn {{was born}} on 26 July 1918. He {{was the son of}} Brigadier Arthur Seaforth Blackburn VC and Rose Ada Blackburn (née Kelly). His father was at that time a Commissioner of the now defunct Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. His father had {{previously}} been a prominent legal practitioner in South Australia. Blackburn was educated at St Peter's College, Adelaide and was an undergraduate at St Mark's College at the University of Adelaide. He graduated with First Class Honours in English Literature from the University of Adelaide. He won the John Howard Clark Prize as the candidate who was placed highest in the final examination. He was chosen as the Rhodes Scholar for South Australia in 1940, but did not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> immediately because of the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Ipomadon {{travels the}} world, {{fighting}} in tournaments, becomes King of Apulia following his father's death, and hears {{one day that}} the Proud is being besieged in her city by a knight called Lyoline. This ugly knight is threatening to take her away with him to India. Ipomadon {{makes his way to}} King Maleager's court once again, just in time to witness the arrival of the Proud's messenger, begging for some assistance for her lady. But curiously, Ipomadon has chosen to arrive at King Maleager's court {{in such a way that}} he is not recognised, not even by the queen. He pretends to be a fool, and the reader (or listener) is treated to a comic scene in which the fool Ipomadon is first ridiculed and then accepted by the knights and noblemen, little knowing who he really is. Cabanus is conveniently absent from court on this occasion. The maiden who has been sent as a messenger by the Proud is mightily unimpressed that a fool should wish to take on the challenge, but since nobody else in the court seems at all inclined to offer their services, the king allows Ipomadon the fool to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Grand Duke {{informs the}} King that Cinderella, who remains anonymous, has escaped, {{and that the}} Prince wishes to marry her. The lost glass slipper is the only piece of evidence. The King issues a royal {{proclamation}} ordering every maiden in the kingdom to try on the slipper for size {{in an effort to}} find the girl. After this news reaches Cinderella's household, Tremaine realizes her stepdaughter is that girl when hearing her humming the waltz played at the ball and locks her in her attic bedroom. Later, the Duke arrives at the château, and Jaq and Gus steal the key from Tremaine's dress pocket and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to the attic as Anastasia and Drizella unsuccessfully try on the slipper. Tremaine's cat, Lucifer, ambushes the mice, but Bruno chases him out of the house, allowing the mice to free Cinderella. As the Duke is about to leave, Cinderella appears and asks to try on the slipper. Knowing it will fit, Lady Tremaine trips the footman as he brings the Duke the slipper, causing it to shatter on the floor. Much to her horror, Cinderella presents the Duke with the other slipper, which fits perfectly. The film ends with a now-married Prince and Cinderella at their wedding, sharing a kiss as they leave.|$|E

500|$|One well-received {{number was}} [...] "Keep It Gay", a song which in {{rehearsal}} {{had been assigned}} to several different performers before ending with Bob. The song was liked in part due to the novelty of its setting: it begins with Bob singing from the light bridge high above the stage; following a blackout the internal play performers <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> on the stage below, and following another blackout, the performers are seen in their workout clothes, at a rehearsal some weeks later. Hammerstein gave credit for the scene to Mielziner, and suggested that it demonstrated one way in which the book had affected the music.|$|E
500|$|Kafka {{was invited}} to the 2010 NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, which started on February 24, along with {{teammates}} Corey Wootton and Sherrick McManis. Kafka chose Mike McCartney of Priority Sports of Chicago as his agent, who also represents Wootton. Priority hired former Chicago Bears quarterback Erik Kramer and a trainer in Phoenix, Arizona, to help Kafka prepare for the NFL Scouting Combine. To prepare for the Combine, Kafka worked out twice a day in Arizona, and held practice sessions with Notre Dame wide receiver Golden Tate. At the Combine, Kafka said, [...] "I {{want to be an}} NFL starter. I'm not going to the league to be a No. 2. I think my whole game can go to another level. I'm ready to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> another notch." ...|$|E
500|$|Just {{minutes after}} the game ended, Appalachian State {{students}} began celebrating on the two main streets in Boone, North Carolina: King Street and Rivers Street. The group eventually advanced to Kidd Brewer Stadium, Appalachian State's home field, and tore {{down one of the}} goalposts. The students proceeded to carry the goalpost over a mile before depositing it in the front yard of the school's chancellor, Kenneth E. Peacock. He was fine with this, saying [...] "as good as today was for Appalachian State, they can <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> there and put it down. I can't wait to get there and see it." [...] Several students jumped nude into the duck pond behind ASU's dining hall, a campus tradition for celebrating big football victories. When the team returned to their stadium in buses at 11:00p.m., they were greeted by a crowd of thousands of students and fans. It took the team 20minutes to get from their buses to the locker room due to the crowd. The celebration in Boone was not limited to Appalachian State's campus; the Boone Mall was [...] "flooded" [...] with cars, and a sports apparel shop carrying ASU gear, Sports Fanatic, reported that sales were seven times higher than normal.|$|E
