5|$|The 3rd Duke of Norfolk, {{also called}} Thomas, made far less {{use of the}} castle, using first Stoke-by-Nayland and then Kenninghall as his {{principal}} residence. <b>Thomas</b> <b>was</b> attainted in 1547 {{for his part in}} supporting the claim of Mary to the throne; Henry VIII died the day before <b>Thomas</b> <b>was</b> due to be executed at the Tower, and his successor, Mary's half-brother Edward VI, reprieved Thomas but kept him in the Tower, giving Framlingham to Mary. When Mary seized power in 1553 she collected her forces at Framlingham Castle before successfully marching on London. <b>Thomas</b> <b>was</b> released from the Tower by Mary as a reward for his loyalty, but retired to Kenninghall rather than Framlingham. The castle was leased out but when the 4th Duke, another <b>Thomas,</b> <b>was</b> executed for treason by Elizabeth I in 1572 the castle passed back to the Crown.|$|E

5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle is a 14th-century {{fortification}} on {{the coast}} of Northumberland in northern England, between the villages of Craster and Embleton. The castle was built by Earl Thomas of Lancaster between 1313 and 1322, taking advantage of the site's natural defences and the existing earthworks of an Iron Age fort. <b>Thomas</b> <b>was</b> a leader of a baronial faction opposed to King Edward II, and probably intended Dunstanburgh to act as a secure refuge, should the political situation in southern England deteriorate. The castle also served as a statement of the earl's wealth and influence, and would have invited comparisons with the neighbouring royal castle of Bamburgh. Thomas probably only visited his new castle once, before being captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge as he attempted to flee royal forces for the safety of Dunstanburgh. <b>Thomas</b> <b>was</b> executed, and the castle became the property of the Crown before passing into the Duchy of Lancaster.|$|E
