50|$|Securities {{markets can}} be split into below two levels. Primary markets, where new {{securities}} are issued and secondary markets where existing securities {{can be bought}} and sold. Secondary markets can further be split into organised exchanges, such stock exchanges and over-the-counter where individual parties come together and buy or sell securities directly. For securities holders knowing that a secondary market exists in which their securities may be sold and converted into cash increases the willingness of people to hold stocks and bonds and thus increases the ability of firms <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>securities.</b>|$|E
50|$|If a {{firm has}} <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>securities</b> to finance an investment, the {{existence}} of floatation costs needs a larger amount of securities to be issued. Therefore, the pay out of dividends depend on whether any profits are left after the financing of proposed investments as floatation costs increases the amount of profits used. Deciding how much dividends to be paid is not the concern here, in fact the firm has to decide how much profits to be retained and the rest can then be distributed as dividends. This is the theory of Residuals, where dividends are residuals from the profits after serving proposed investments.|$|E

The Consortium would also be able <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>securities</b> and loans from the U.S. Treasury to provide capital to state-run insurers for catastrophe related risks.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the factors that}} affect the decision of U. S. companies <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>securities</b> offshore compared with inside the United States. Utilizing a data set of 1, 444 domestic private placements and offshore offerings from 1993 to 1997, the paper reports that firms that experienced a private securities fraud lawsuit in the past resort to foreign sources of capital more frequently. Similarly, companies in standard industrial classification groups that are targeted more often with private securities fraud litigation {{are also more likely}} <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>securities</b> offshore than to conduct domestic private placements. Not all issuers, however, choose to exit the U. S. regime. The paper employs past experience with a SEC investigation as a proxy for the amount of risk that the issuer may pose to investors. Issuers with private securities fraud litigation experience that also encountered a past SEC investigation are more likely to raise capital through a domestic offering, consistent with the hypothesis that some issuers choose to raise capital in the United States when the bonding and signaling value of the U. S. legal liability regime outweighs the costs associated with antifraud liability. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{several new}} patterns associated with firms issuing {{stocks and bonds}} in foreign markets that motivate the need for and help guide the direction of future research. Three major patterns stand out. (1) A large and growing fraction of capital raisings, especially debt issuances, occurs in international markets, but {{a very small number}} of firms accounts for the bulk of international capital raisings, highlighting the cross-firm heterogeneity in financial globalization. (2) Changes in firm performance following equity and debt issuances in international markets are qualitatively similar to those following domestic issuances, suggesting that capital raisings abroad are not intrinsically different from those in domestic markets. (3) Firms continue <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>securities</b> both abroad and at home after accessing international markets, suggesting that international and domestic markets are complements, not substitutes. Existing theories do not fully account for these patterns. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} securities issues where the quality of securities is private information to the issuer, and firms of higher quality are more reluctant <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>securities</b> than low quality firms. We show that, when the issuer directly trades with investors, market breakdown may occur. This {{is caused by the}} issuer’s attempts to signal his type through the offering price. Things change if we introduce a financial intermediary which: i) underwrites the issue, ii) influences the offering price. Underwriting creates a wedge between the interests of the intermediary and those of the issuer, which allows trade with investors to be restored. A by-product of this conflict of interest is that trade is characterized by underpricing. Another implication is that the intermediary may act as a reliable screening device when she possesses private information about the firm’s quality. In general, our analysis suggests that collusion between the intermediary and the issuer hinders trade, whereas collusion between the intermediary an...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the prospects for}} securitization of real estate assets in Brazil. Brazilian real estate securitization is in its infancy. The economical importance of the country, its relatively well-developed financial markets, the globalization of capital markets, and the increasing demand for real estate securities, however, argues {{for the advancement of}} real estate securitization in Brazil. Real estate operations have been financed with debt and equity securities over the last years. On the debt side, the S. F. I. (Sistema Financeiro Imobiliario), an initiative designed to parallel the mortgage backed securities model in the U. S., is intended to broaden the supply of real estate financing in Brazil and to create a secondary mortgage market.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} 310 {{structured note}} lawsuits in Taiwan between 2000 and 2013 to examine courts’ attitude {{in dealing with}} claims of misselling retail structured notes. We find that courts were generally not favorable to retail investors. This provides a contrast with the financial regulator’s efforts to improve financial consumer protection since 2008. By examining plaintiffs’ key arguments and courts’ rulings, we find {{that it was difficult}} for investors to fulfill their burden of proof and courts were reluctant to award remedies when investors did sign on a contractual document confirming his knowledge on a few matters. While regulators are right to strengthen financial consumer protection, this article argues that Taiwan courts’ inactivism to protect retail investors could be justified. However, regulators should pick up from what courts have left to ensure that customers fully comprehend the consequences when they sign on contractual documents, to avoid banks classifying customers as active investors too easily, and to clarify banks’ duties toward a customer after a contract is signed. Regulators should also reconsider its regulatory structure to ensure foreign banks would not be able <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>securities</b> to raise funds from local investors by way of a shadow banking system...|$|E
