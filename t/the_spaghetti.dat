5|$|The freeway {{enters the}} Salt Lake Valley {{on the former}} {{alignment}} of North Temple Street until it passes the Salt Lake City International Airport, where the freeway veers slightly south and leaves the North Temple Street corridor which leads to Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City. The Green Line of the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) TRAX system briefly parallels I-80 before traveling {{down the center of}} North Temple Street. I-80 becomes concurrent with I-15 after interchanges with SR-58 and 600South and continues south for about , passing along the western and southern edges of downtown Salt Lake City. The southern interchange with I-15, which also includes SR-201 (21st South Freeway) and marks the end of the concurrency, is known as <b>the</b> <b>Spaghetti</b> Bowl,. In the southwestern corner of <b>the</b> <b>Spaghetti</b> Bowl is another portion of the UTA TRAX Green Line as it travels towards West Valley City. After separating from I-15, the freeway continues easterly through South Salt Lake, loosely following an alignment just south of 2100South and the UTA S Line streetcar through the Sugar House neighborhood and past Sugar House Parkonce the home of the Sugar House Prison towards the clockwise terminus of the I-215 270° belt route around Salt Lake. It continues through Parley's Canyon, where the freeway joins the historical route of the Lincoln Highway. Between the mouth of the canyon and the Summit county line, the route re-enters the Wasatch National Forest.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve a}} {{harmonious}} visual look, producer designer Hans Bacher and art director Ric Sluiter, along with Robert Walker and Head of Backgrounds Robert Stanton collaborated {{to establish a}} proper chronological location for the film in Chinese history. Since there was no general consensus {{on the time of}} Mulan's existence, they based on the visual design on the Ming and Qing dynasties. An important element of Bacher's design was to turn the art style closer to Chinese painting, with watercolor and simpler design, as opposed to the details of The Lion King and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Bacher further studied more than thirty-five film directors ranging from the silent era German Expressionism, British and American epics of the 1950s and 60s, and <b>the</b> <b>spaghetti</b> westerns for inspiration for composition, lighting, and staging that would establish settings that enhanced the characters, and additional inspiration was found in the earlier Disney animated films such as Bambi, Pinocchio, and Dumbo to establish a sense of staging.|$|E
5|$|According to Henderson, {{newspaper}} articles on <b>the</b> Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster attracted <b>the</b> attention of book publishers; {{he said that}} at one point, there were six publishers interested in <b>the</b> Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster.

5|$|In August 2005, the Swedish concept {{designer}} Niklas Jansson {{created an}} adaptation of Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam, superimposing <b>the</b> Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster over God.

The Hunger Artists Theatre Company produced a comedy called <b>The</b> Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster Holiday Pageant in December 2006, detailing the history of Pastafarianism. The production has spawned a sequel called Flying Spaghetti Monster Holy Mug of Grog, performed in December 2008.

5|$|Interstate 80 (I-80) {{is a part}} of the Interstate Highway System {{that runs}} from San Francisco, California, to Teaneck, New Jersey. The portion of the highway in the U.S. state of Utah is , through the {{northern}} part of the state. From west to east, I-80 crosses the state line from Nevada in Tooele County and traverses the Bonneville Salt Flatswhich are a part of the larger Great Salt Lake Desert. It continues alongside the Wendover Cut-offthe corridor of the former Victory HighwayU.S. Route 40 (US-40) and the Western Pacific Railroad Feather River Route. After passing the Oquirrh Mountains, I-80 enters the Salt Lake Valley and Salt Lake County. A short portion of the freeway is concurrent with I-15 through Downtown Salt Lake City. At <b>the</b> <b>Spaghetti</b> Bowl, I-80 turns east again into the mouth of Parley's Canyon and Summit County, travels through the mountain range and intersects the eastern end of I-84 near Echo Reservoir before turning northeast towards the Wyoming border near Evanston. I-80 was built along the corridor of the Lincoln Highway and the Mormon Trail through the Wasatch Range. The easternmost section also follows the historical routes of the First Transcontinental Railroad and US-30S.|$|E
5|$|Now {{with three}} lanes in each direction, the highway {{straddles}} {{the boundary between}} Salt Lake City and West Valley City, another suburb of the former. The road continues due east with diamond interchanges at 5600 West (SR-172) and Bangerter Highway (SR-154). Immediately following a single-point urban interchange (SPUI) at 3200 West, the freeway intersects I-215 {{in the form of}} a cloverleaf interchange. The road dips to the south slightly and, following two SPUIs at Redwood Road (SR-68) and 900 West, the freeway terminates at <b>the</b> <b>Spaghetti</b> Bowl interchange, giving eastbound motorists on SR-201 the option of continuing to I-15, I-80, 1300 South and 900 South. However, an eastbound traveler wanting to continue on the surface portion of SR-201 to State Street must exit on 900 West, head north briefly and then turn eastbound on 2100 South; a westbound traveler on 2100 South wishing to connect to the freeway must take an on-ramp from the surface street just before 900 West. Prior to 1997, this connection was direct. Now on the four-lane 2100 South, a secondary surface street, the route runs along the Salt Lake City-South Salt Lake border. State maintenance of 2100 South ends at the intersection of State Street (US-89).|$|E
5|$|The route {{crosses the}} Passaic River again into Wayne in Passaic County. The median splits {{as the road}} passes {{to the north of}} the Willowbrook Mall, with an exit serving the mall, before {{reaching}} <b>the</b> <b>Spaghetti</b> Bowl interchange with partial access to I-80 and full access to Route 23. Within this interchange, US 46 passes under the Montclair-Boonton Line again. From here, it passes businesses and many shopping centers with RIRO access as a six-lane highway, heading into Totowa. In this area, the route has interchanges with CR 640 and Route 62/CR 646. The road turns southeast, crossing the Passaic River a third time into Little Falls. At this point, US 46 runs along the Little Falls/Woodland Park border, interchanging CR 639 and Browertown Road. After the exit for Lower Notch Road, the route enters more wooded surroundings, interchanging with Notch Road/Rifle Camp Road before entering Clifton. Upon reaching Clifton, US 46 has an interchange with the western terminus of Route 3 and Valley Road (CR 621), with the Valley Road exit stitched into the Route 3 side of the highway fork. Prior to reconstruction of the interchanges, the Valley Road ramp exited before Route 3 began, and Route 3 branched off immediately after Valley Road.|$|E

In 1995 Van Halen released Balance, a multi-platinum seller {{that would be the}} band's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals. In 1996 David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement, former Extreme singer Gary Cherone, was fired soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album Van Halen III and Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004. Guns N' Roses' original lineup was whittled away throughout the decade. Drummer Steven Adler was fired in 1990, guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late 1991 after recording Use Your Illusion I and II with the band. Tensions between the other band members and lead singer Axl Rose continued after the release of the 1993 covers album <b>The</b> <b>Spaghetti</b> Incident? Guitarist Slash left in 1996, followed by bassist Duff McKagan in 1997.

2500|$|The Gospel {{begins with}} the {{creation}} of the universe by an invisible and undetectable Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster. On <b>the</b> first day, <b>the</b> Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster separated <b>the</b> water from the heavens; on the second, because He could not tread water for long and had grown tired of flying, He created the land—complemented by a beer volcano. Satisfied, <b>the</b> Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster overindulged in beer from the beer volcano and woke up hungover. Between drunken nights and clumsy afternoons, <b>the</b> Flying <b>Spaghetti</b> Monster produced seas and land (for a second time, accidentally, because he forgot that he created it the day before) along with Heaven and a [...] "midgit", which he named Man.

500|$|Rebuilding of {{the first}} {{portions}} of I-80 began in October 1990 with a [...] stretch near Redwood Road in Salt Lake City. By 1991, UDOT estimated that the reconstruction of all federally funded highways in the state would cost up to $4.3billion (equivalent to $ in [...] ). <b>The</b> <b>Spaghetti</b> Bowl interchange was first proposed in 1996 to accommodate traffic for the 2002 Winter Olympics being held in the city.

[...] The filmmakers studied various films and magazine issues of that decade for inspiration on the color palette. Racking focuses were highly stylized for scenes set in the 1960s, similar to <b>the</b> <b>Spaghetti</b> Westerns of that era. Hand-held cameras were used for scenes set in the 1970s, an homage to the films of Sidney Lumet, Mike Nichols and Alan J.
