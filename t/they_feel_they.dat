5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio {{argued that}} dissonance {{was caused by}} {{aversive}} consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad. Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> have not done anything wrong. For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when {{the consequences of their}} statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.|$|E

25|$|Transsexual self-identified people {{sometimes}} wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, secondary characteristics, or both, because <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> {{will be more}} comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the most}} {{traditional}} version of cricket, with rules most closely replicating the original rules of cricket from the 16th and 17th century. It is a single innings game with a set time limit for the entire game to be completed in. To win the game, a side must both score the highest aggregate number of runs and take all ten of the opposition wickets. It {{is up to the}} side batting first to declare when <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> have enough runs to be able to win the match.

25|$|The {{top five}} levels contain one {{division}} each and are nationwide in scope.

At the lower levels the existence of leagues becomes intermittent, although in some of the more densely populated areas there are leagues more than twenty layers below the Premier League. There are also leagues {{in various parts of the}} country which are not officially part of the system as they do not have formal agreements with other leagues, but are recognised at various levels by county football associations. Clubs from these leagues may, if <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> meet the appropriate standard of play and have suitable facilities, apply to join a league which does form part of the system.|$|E

25|$|Provisions from Dodd–Frank {{found in}} section 922 also address whistle blower protection. Under new {{regulations}} any whistle blowers who voluntarily expose inappropriate behavior in public corporations can {{be rewarded with}} substantial compensation and will have their jobs protected. Regulations entitle whistle blowers to between ten and thirty percent of any monetary sanctions put on the corporation above one million dollars. These provisions also enact anti-retaliation rules that entitle whistle blowers {{the right to have}} a jury trial if <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> have been wrongfully terminated as a result of whistle blowing. If the jury finds that whistle blowers have been wrongfully terminated, then they must be reinstated to their positions and receive compensation for any back-pay and legal fees. This rule also applies to any private subsidiaries of public corporations. The SEC put these regulations in place in May 2011.|$|E
25|$|An individual's FOK {{judgments}} {{are not necessarily}} accurate, and attributes of all three metamemory hypotheses are apparent in {{the factors that influence}} FOK judgments and their accuracy. For example, a person is more likely to give a higher FOK rating, indicating that they do know the answer, when presented with questions <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> should know the answer to. This is in keeping with the cue familiarity hypothesis, as the familiarity of the question terms influences the individual's judgment. Partial retrieval also impacts FOK judgments, as proposed by the accessibility hypothesis. The accuracy of an FOK judgment is dependent upon the accuracy of the partial information which is retrieved. Consequently, accurate partial information leads to accurate FOK judgments, while inaccurate partial information leads to inaccurate FOK judgments. FOK {{judgments are}} also influenced by the number of memory traces linked to the cue. When a cue is linked to fewer memory traces, resulting in a low level of competition, a higher FOK rating is given, thus supporting the competition hypothesis.|$|E

The team has 100 seconds to agree on who should receive which share. Once the clock starts, the money begins to drain away. Each {{contestant}} must claim a different share, and the team must lock it in to stop the clock and claim the remaining money. If after 50 seconds, no agreement is made, the clock stops briefly, and each contestant, in turn, is given 10 seconds to explain which share <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> deserve and why. Once each player has pleaded their case, the clock restarts and the money continues to drain. If no agreement is reached, all three contestants leave the show with no money. If all questions are answered correctly, the top prize is worth up to $51,000 (60% of the maximum total bank of $85,000).|$|E
500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> have to do things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E

Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't think anybody now, even in Cuba, is going to sit {{with a straight face}} and defend the events. La Cabana was really turned into a Roman circus, where I think even the people in power look back on that as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This is what people do when <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re {{going to have a very}} polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films". Soderbergh said, [...] "I'm sure some people will say, 'That's convenient because that's when he was at his worst.' Yeah, maybe—it just wasn't interesting to me. I was interested in making a procedural about guerrilla warfare".|$|E

500|$|Webb {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "a story about a kid who grows up looking for his father and finds himself." [...] Both Webb and star Garfield described Parker as an outsider by choice, someone hard to get close to. As in the early comic books, the character [...] "is a science whiz. If you look {{back to the early}} Stan Lee and Steve Ditko comics, he's a nerd with big glasses," [...] said Webb. He explained [...] "the idea of what a nerd is has changed in 40 or 50 years. Nerds are running the world. Andrew Garfield made a movie [...] about it. ... What was important in those early comics was this notion that Peter Parker is an outsider and how we define that in a contemporary context." [...] Garfield compared his Spider-Man façade as a metaphor for internet anonymity, saying, [...] "You feel the power of it, the power of not being seen, the power of the mask. Peter becomes witty when he's got that protective layer. It's like he's on a message board. He's got the anonymity of the Internet within that suit, and he can say whatever the [...] @#!*% [...] he likes, and he can get away with anything." [...] Garfield tried to explore Parker as an orphan, whom he feels [...] "are the strongest human beings on the planet." [...] He said Parker is [...] "a human hero [...] goes through all of the same struggles that we all have gone through, especially the skinny ones [...] want more power than <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> have." [...] He believes Parker represents [...] "a very inspiring, aspirational character that symbolizes goodness—and {{how difficult it is to}} be good—but how worth it it is." [...] Rhys Ifans compared this film to William Shakespeare's Hamlet on the grounds that Spider-Man can be redone over and over in different ways. He felt that they are similar in that they both represent meaningful archetypal young men grappling with the loss of their father. Critics like Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that Garfield's character as the superhero [...] "embodies the nerdy Parker, the anguished fatherless teen and the cocky super-hero in equal doses". Boyd Hoij of Variety noted that Garfield's character as Spider-Man makes an interesting hero in the film because of how it establishes early on that Peter's growing pains along with his search for an identity are common to any teenager and that [...] "his struggles involve real people—and real lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer {{provides}} {{all of her}} character's vocals {{for both}} the film and its soundtrack. Because she does not consider herself a professional singer, Pfeiffer's inhibitions about singing on camera initially contributed to her early reservations about accepting the role, having not done so since her performance in Grease 2; The Fabulous Baker Boys would mark Pfeiffer's first professional singing role in seven years. Despite Kloves' insistence that Pfeiffer's singing voice not be dubbed, composer Dave Grusin was initially skeptical about Pfeiffer's musical abilities until she ultimately convinced him with her rendition of [...] "My Funny Valentine". For four months (although sources differ, citing any period of time between two months to an entire year), the actress took extensive singing lessons {{under the tutelage of}} voice coach Sally Stevens in preparation for the role, at the suggestion of Grusin. In addition to performing vocal exercises to strengthen her vocal chords, Pfeiffer would often work 10-hour days in the recording studio before finally returning home to listen to and study her own recordings. Already impressed with Pfeiffer's rhythm and phrasing, Stevens trained the actress to avoid pronouncing words in ways that would make the film's jazz standards sound too much like rock songs; Stevens jokenly linkened Pfeiffer's original pronunciation to musician Bob Dylan, and recording the songs for Pfieffer to use as reference for enunciation, teaching the actress about using her teeth and mouth to pronounce words and smiling to [...] "lift" [...] her pitch. Admitting that the film's songs were much more difficult than the ones she had performed in Grease 2, Pfeiffer worked especially hard on improving her phrasing because the material for The Fabulous Baker Boys were different than the pop music she had grown more accustomed to singing, explaining, [...] "Those older songs were written for singers; they weren't written for synthesizers and drums... It was an entirely new way of listening to songs." [...] Additionally, the actress drew inspiration from real-life lounge singers performing at The Hollyood Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles, while listening to jazz singers Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Rickie Lee Jones, Billie Holiday and Helen Merrill for inspiration, maintaining, [...] "I didn't copy anybody, but I heard a lot. For me, it helps to act the song out." [...] Pfeiffer incorporated the [...] "undercurrent of anger" [...] in the lounge singer's performances, drawn from the fact that [...] "a lot of club singers... haven't had the recognition <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> deserve or that they had hoped for" [...] into her own interpretation of Susie. Stevens encouraged Pfeiffer to envision herself as Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa Lund in the film Casablanca (1942) while recording [...] "More Than You Know" [...] for the film's soundtrack, which the actress identified as one of her favorite songs. Stevens also suggested that Pfeiffer research jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald because Fitzgerald possesses [...] "a quality artists of that period had that we felt the character Susie might have listened to", describing the end result as [...] "an airy alto, a nice breathy quality, and intelligence in delivery". Despite her extensive training, the vocal coach felt it was important that Susie's voice sound [...] "pleasant" [...] but still untrained. Kloves maintains that he did not hire Pfeiffer based on her singing abilities, but rather because {{of the way in which}} she uses her acting abilities to interpret lyrics.|$|E
