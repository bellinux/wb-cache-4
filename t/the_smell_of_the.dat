5|$|The {{overwhelming}} sensation {{about the}} neighborhood was <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community caused not just by the packing plants located immediately to the east, {{but also by the}} 345-acre Chicago Union Stock Yards containing 2,300 pens of livestock, located further east from the packing plants.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{describes}} his close {{relationships with the}} local men; indulges in memories of previous relationships with writers such as George Orwell, and D.H. Lawrence; and satirizes the role of organized religion. Subjects as diverse as <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pine woods in Michigan, the nature of Parisian cafés , {{and the quality of}} Simenon's writing are treated with stream of consciousness digressions.|$|E
5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} {{due to the}} noise and mess made and <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's Big Ben that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common starling roosts in central London.|$|E
50|$|Frankincense {{is used in}} {{perfumery}} and aromatherapy. It is also {{an ingredient}} that is sometimes used in skincare. The essential oil is obtained by steam distillation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dry resin. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frankincense smoke are products of pyrolysis.|$|R

50|$|Diorissimo, {{based on}} lily <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley, was a notable {{achievement}} in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> perfumery. Unlike rose or jasmine, <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> lily <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley cannot be extracted from essential oil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flower. Roudnitska circumvented {{the problem by}} using aroma chemicals like hydroxycitronellal.|$|R

25|$|By the 1950s, {{the city}} {{began to use}} {{the hole in the}} esker for {{purposes}} other than storing gravel. The residents of Herttoniemi, closer to the city centre, and especially those living in single-family detached homes on Kitusentie, began to complain about <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Herttoniemi dumping ground located at the intersection of Siilitie and Sopulitie at the time.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{preservation}} of perfumes involves keeping {{them away from}} sources of heat and storing them where {{they will not be}} exposed to light. An opened bottle will keep its aroma intact for several years, {{as long as it is}} well stored. However the presence of oxygen in the head space of the bottle and environmental factors will in the long run alter <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fragrance.|$|E

25|$|Agaricus subrufescens is {{a choice}} edible, with a {{somewhat}} sweet taste and fragrance <b>of</b> almonds. <b>The</b> almond <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mushroom is mostly due to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, benzonitrile, and methyl benzoate.|$|R
25|$|An {{essential}} oil extracted from eucalyptus leaves contains compounds that are powerful natural disinfectants {{and can be}} toxic in large quantities. Several marsupial herbivores, notably koalas and some possums, are relatively tolerant of it. The close correlation of these oils with other more potent toxins called formylated phloroglucinol compounds (euglobals, macrocarpals and sideroxylonals) allows koalas and other marsupial species to make food choices based on <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves. For koalas, these compounds {{are the most important}} factor in leaf choice.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{pit latrine}} can be {{improved}} {{in a number of}} ways. One includes adding a ventilation pipe from the pit to above the structure. This improves airflow and decreases <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toilet. It also can reduce flies when the top of the pipe is covered with mesh (usually made out of fiberglass). In these types of toilets a lid need not be used to cover the hole in the floor. Other possible improvements include a floor constructed so fluid drains into the hole and a reinforcement of {{the upper part of the}} pit with bricks, blocks, or cement rings to improve stability.|$|E
25|$|Anhydrous ammonia is {{classified}} as toxic (T) and dangerous for the environment (N). The gas is flammable (autoignition temperature: 651nbsp&°C) and can form explosive mixtures with air (16–25%). The permissible exposure limit (PEL) in the United States is 50nbsp&ppm (35nbsp&mg/m3), while the IDLH concentration is estimated at 300nbsp&ppm. Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas: normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 50nbsp&ppm, but desensitised individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100nbsp&ppm. Anhydrous ammonia corrodes copper- and zinc-containing alloys, and so brass fittings {{should not be used}} for handling the gas. Liquid ammonia can also attack rubber and certain plastics.|$|E

25|$|The Imperial Family {{were not}} the only {{residents}} of the palace; below the metal framework in the attics lived an army of servants. So vast were the servants' quarters that a former servant and his family, unbeknownst to the palace authorities, moved into the roof of the palace. They were only discovered by <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manure from the cow that they had also smuggled into the building with them to provide fresh milk. It seems this cow was not the only bovine in the attics; other cows were kept next to the room occupied by the Maids of Honour, in order to provide fresh milk for the kitchens. This practice was discontinued after the 1837 fire.|$|E
500|$|Olfactory {{camouflage}} {{is said to}} be rare; {{examples include}} ghillie suits, special garments for military snipers made from strips of hessian cloth, which are sometimes treated with mud and even manure to give them an [...] "earthy" [...] smell to cover <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sniper.|$|E

500|$|Often {{bright green}} in bud stage, they are terminal, {{occurring}} {{at the ends}} of one- to three-year-old branches, and displayed prominently above the foliage. <b>The</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> open flowers has been likened to a peppery Shiraz wine. Over time, the spikes fade to brown and then grey, and the individual flowers shrivel and lie against the spikes. This coincides with the development of dark furry oval follicles, which measure [...] long, [...] high, and [...] wide. However, only a very small percentage (0.1%) of flowers develop into follicles; the field study at Mount Adams yielded a count of 3.6 ± 1.2 per cone. The follicles develop and mature over seven to eight months, from February to December, while seed development occurs over four months from September to December.|$|E
500|$|Reportedly in 1897 <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fumaroles was {{so strong}} as to be {{unbearable}} when one {{was close to the}} vents.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} has been advanced for <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unusual <b>smells.</b> They {{could possibly have}} resulted from the burning or smouldering (but not detonation) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bombs' explosives, or {{they could have been}} <b>the</b> natural <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosive. The homemade explosive thought to have been used in the 7 July bombings, TATP, is notoriously unstable and emits a distinctive smell as it sublimates.|$|R
50|$|Coprosma areolata, {{commonly}} called thin-leaved coprosma, is a shrub that {{is native to}} New Zealand. C. areolata grows in wet, lowland forest and can also grow in exposed places. Coprosma is from the Greek kopros 'dung' and osme 'smell', referring to <b>the</b> foul <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species, literally 'dung smell'. And areolata is netted, with a network pattern between the veins.|$|R
500|$|Petrels can be {{attracted}} to boats with [...] "chum", a malodorous mixture typically containing fish heads, bones and offal, with added fish oil and popcorn to aid flotation. An apparently empty ocean will soon fill with hundreds <b>of</b> birds attracted by <b>the</b> <b>smell.</b> <b>The</b> attraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fishy odour is sometimes enhanced by <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> dimethylsulphide (DMS) a chemical also naturally produced by some planktonic organisms, although there are doubts about <b>the</b> safety <b>of</b> this possible carcinogen.|$|R
500|$|Lisa does {{scientific}} research on nerds and discovers that {{the odor of}} the chemical nerd pheromone [...] "" [...] attracts bullies like Francine, proving that both nerds and bullies are predisposed to be what they are. Lisa then tests the poindextrose extracted from the nerds on famous boxer Drederick Tatum by putting it on his clothes when he visits the school. This causes Nelson to start punching Tatum uncontrollably {{and give him a}} wedgie. Lisa demonstrates her experiment at Professor Frink's science conference, the [...] "12th Annual Big Science Thing", using an antidote on herself and making Francine peaceful and friendly towards her, the antidote being just salad dressing which covers up <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poindextrose. The audience is impressed and Lisa is awarded a gift certificate from J. C. Penney for her research. However, the salad dressing soon runs out and Francine goes on a rampage beating up all the scientists in the room, and ends threatening to beat the viewer of the episode.|$|E
500|$|Horodecki {{bought the}} first lot of land on February 1, 1901, with {{construction}} work commencing on March 18 of that year. Construction of the exterior walls was finished by August 21, and the roof installed and all masonry work was completed on September 13. Due {{to the economic}} hardships within the Russian Empire, {{the completion of the}} building was delayed. In May 1903, only one apartment on the lowest level and Horodecki's own apartment were occupied. The total cost of the land and construction amounted to 133,000 rubles. In total, [...] of land were used for construction of the building and cost a total of 15,640 rubles. The projected annual profit from the rentals was 7,200 rubles. A cowshed was located on the premises due to Horodecki's insistence on fresh in-house milk, though it was specifically placed in a way that <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cows would not disturb the tenants. On a lot adjacent to the building, a miniature alpine garden (approx. [...] ) and a fountain were built.|$|E
500|$|There {{were some}} improvised scenes. These {{included}} {{a scene in}} the beginning of the episode where Alan and Joanna are in a middle of a field and the scene begins with a low-angle shot. Later, when Alan is [...] "humping" [...] Joanna, the scene suddenly becomes a crane shot. This is because the crew at the time had a crane camera after they had finished filming the final scenes in series 2 where Alan, Joanna and Martin are teetering over the edge of a cliff in the stolen camper van. The camper van scenes were the hardest to shoot, especially the scene where the van explodes, as this had to be done in one take. Another problem was <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> van, which Pippa Haywood said, [...] "smelt of old dogs." [...] The van also suffered other problems such as bits of the steering wheel and gear stick coming off. Julian Rhind-Tutt commented that the scene where Alan and Boyce talk together for the last time was one of the most moving scenes in the whole of Green Wing. The wedding was shot at Hall of Bayham Abbey in Kent, where the crew had difficulty filming due to bad weather. The show also features a guest appearance from Jeremy Sheffield near the end of the episode as Sue's new boyfriend.|$|E
