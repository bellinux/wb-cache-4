5|$|Pneumonia {{is usually}} caused by {{infection}} with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and {{conditions such as}} autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, {{and culture of the}} sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia.|$|E

5|$|The game {{opens with}} a prologue {{during the summer of}} 2049 in a snowstorm. In a modern, broken-down grocery store, Nier fends off attacks from {{ethereal}} monsters to protect his sick young daughter, Yonah. After defeating the monsters, he checks on Yonah, who has begun <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> badly. The game then cuts to 1,312 years later, where Nier and Yonah are now living in a village built upon the ruins of an old town. The low-technology village is one of several, and is surrounded by more modern ruins such as the remnants of train tracks and industrial machinery. The areas between towns are filled with monsters known as Shades that attack travelers.|$|E

25|$|The ICHD-2 {{classification}} defines migraines, tension-types headaches, {{cluster headache}} and other trigeminal autonomic headache {{as the main}} types of primary headaches. Also, according to the same classification, stabbing headaches and headaches due <b>to</b> <b>cough,</b> exertion and sexual activity (sexual headache) are classified as primary headaches. The daily-persistent headaches along with the hypnic headache and thunderclap headaches are considered primary headaches as well.|$|E
25|$|There may be {{a number}} of side effects {{following}} the surgery. Because certain nerve connections to the lungs are cut during the procedure, transplant recipients cannot feel the urge <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> or feel when their new lungs are becoming congested. They must therefore make conscious efforts to take deep breaths and cough in order to clear secretions from the lungs. Their heart rate responds less quickly to exertion due to the cutting of the vagus nerve that would normally help regulate it. They may also notice a change in their voice due to potential damage to the nerves that coordinate the vocal cords.|$|E
25|$|If {{swallowing}} problems (dysphagia) occur, {{they typically}} present {{during the second}} decade of life. Dysphagia is common because of the neurological changes that interfere with coordination of mouth and pharynx (throat) movements that are needed for safe and efficient swallowing. Coordination problems involving the mouth may make chewing difficult and increase the duration of meals. Problems involving the pharynx may cause liquid, food, and saliva to be inhaled into the airway (aspiration). People with dysphagia may not cough when they aspirate (silent aspiration). Swallowing problems and especially swallowing problems with silent aspiration may cause lung problems due to inability <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> and clear food and liquids from the airway.|$|E

25|$|Living in filthy {{conditions}} in China apparently worsened his TB. Shiki continued <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> blood throughout his return voyage to Japan and was hospitalized in Kobe. After being discharged, {{he returned to}} his home town of Matsuyama city and convalesced in the home of the famed novelist Natsume Sōseki. During this time he took on disciples and promulgated a style of haiku that emphasized gaining inspiration from personal experiences of nature. Still in Matsuyama in 1897, a member of this group, Yanigihara Kyokudō, established a haiku magazine, Hototogisu, an allusion to Shiki's pen name. Operation of this magazine was quickly moved to Tokyo. Takahama Kyoshi, another disciple, assumed control and the magazine's scope was extended to include prose work.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{situation}} has been noticed, {{in order for}} a bystander to intervene they must interpret the incident as an emergency. According to the principle of social influence, bystanders monitor the reactions of other people in an emergency situation to see if others think {{that it is necessary to}} intervene. If it is determined that others are not reacting to the situation, bystanders will interpret the situation as not an emergency and will not intervene. This is an example of pluralistic ignorance or social proof. Referring to the smoke experiment, even though students in the groups had clearly noticed the smoke which had become so thick that it was obscuring their vision, irritating their eyes or causing them <b>to</b> <b>cough,</b> they were still unlikely to report it. Only one participant in the group condition reported the smoke within the first four minutes, and by the end of the experiment, no-one from five of eight groups had reported the smoke at all. In the groups that did not report the smoke, the interpretations of its cause, and the likelihood that it was genuinely threatening was also less serious, with no-one suggesting fire as a possible cause, but some preferring less serious explanations, such as the air-conditioner was leaking.|$|E
25|$|Following this defeat, Aerts regained some of {{the weight}} {{that he had lost}} for his match against dreadlocked karate man Ewerton Teixeira at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 in Seoul Final 16 on October 2, 2010. A close match, it was decided by an extra round {{unanimous}} decision (10-9, 10-9, 10-9) in favour of Aerts who then qualified for the K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 Final on December 11. In his 17th appearance at the K-1 WGP, he defeated Mighty Mo by first-round KO in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals, he {{came face to face with}} his archrival Semmy Schilt, in a fight where he was a huge underdog due to his age and Schilt's success in the 2009 Grand Prix. After being cut above the eye and finishing the fight with a swollen face, Aerts won a brilliantly fought decision. However, he had taken a lot of damage in the fight with Schilt and started <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> up blood in his changing room after the fight. He was overwhelmed by a less damaged and much fitter and bigger Alistair Overeem and lost by first-round TKO. Though he was defeated, he broke three world records in K-1: He became the oldest man (at 40 years old) to ever make it to the K-1 World Grand Prix Final, he marked the most amount of appearances (6) that any fighter had ever made it to the Final, and also became the first person to ever beat Semmy Schilt in a tournament.|$|E

500|$|Roche {{was also}} capable of humour which was both subtle and unquestionably intentional.

[...] On another occasion, when the Opposition tried <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> him down in a debate, Sir Boyle met the interruption by producing some bullets, with the observation [...] "I have here some excellent pills to cure a cough."

500|$|For {{people whose}} {{injuries}} are {{high enough to}} interfere with breathing, there is great emphasis on airway clearance during this stage of recovery. Weakness of respiratory muscles impairs the ability <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> effectively, allowing secretions to accumulate within the lungs. [...] As SCI patients suffer from reduced total lung capacity and tidal volume, physical therapists teach them accessory breathing techniques (e.g. apical breathing, glossopharyngeal breathing) that typically are not taught to healthy individuals. [...] Physical therapy treatment for airway clearance may include manual percussions and vibrations, postural drainage, respiratory muscle training, and assisted cough techniques. Patients are taught to increase their intra-abdominal pressure by leaning forward to induce cough and clear mild secretions. The quad cough technique is done lying on the back with the therapist applying pressure on the abdomen in {{the rhythm of the}} cough to maximize expiratory flow and mobilize secretions. Manual abdominal compression is another technique used to increase expiratory flow which later improves coughing. Other techniques used to manage respiratory dysfunction [...] include respiratory muscle pacing, use of a constricting abdominal binder, ventilator-assisted speech, and mechanical ventilation.|$|E

This causes him <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> and vomit. Peter hands Meg the long scarf from his tongue, but Meg refuses to hold it. Peter then urges Meg to hold them, and then asks if his long johns are tied to the end of them. When Meg says they are not, Peter then says [...] "Oh, god" [...] and regurgitates them as well, and then crouches in pain following the ordeal. Meg asks Lois if she can open her gifts, and Meg notices Stewie opening most of them. Peter gets drunk, and attempts to ride a unicycle down the steps, but falls off and crushes his father, Francis, who later dies in the hospital from the accident. Just before Francis dies, he calls Peter [...] "a fat stinking drunk".|$|E

[...] A week later, however, on 5 January 1888, his hoarseness and the swelling under his left vocal cord returned, with the previously unaffected {{right side of his}} throat becoming inflamed. He ran high fevers and began coughing violently, with his breathing becoming more laboured. The doctors diagnosed perichondritis, an infection of the throat membrane. Frederick again became unable to speak, and suffered violent headaches and insomnia. On 29 January, Mackenzie returned to San Remo from a trip to Spain, and after examining his patient recommended an immediate tracheotomy. [...] The operation was conducted at 4 p.m. on 8 February, by which time Frederick was continually suffering from insomnia and [...] "embarrassing bouts of suffocation." [...] A cannula was fitted to allow Frederick to breathe; for the remainder of his life he was unable to speak and often communicated through writing. During the operation, Dr. Bergmann almost killed him by missing the incision in the trachea and forcing the cannula into the wrong place. [...] Frederick started <b>to</b> <b>cough</b> and bleed, and Bergmann placed his forefinger into the wound to enlarge it. The bleeding subsided after two hours, but Bergmann's actions resulted in an abscess in Frederick's neck, producing pus which would give Frederick discomfort for the remaining months of his life. Later, Frederick would ask [...] "Why did Bergmann put his finger in my throat?" [...] and complain that [...] "Bergmann ill-treated [...] ".|$|E

Clips interspaced throughout the video feature her in a long silver shirt and jeans singing and dancing in front of the Mercedes. Eventually, Cyrus is cornered by the paparazzi. She is scared, but then surprised and perplexed when the mob unexpectedly begins to dance in a synchronized manner. Her boyfriend, appearing normal, then arrives in the Mercedes to rescue her.
