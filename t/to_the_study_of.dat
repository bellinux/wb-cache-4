5|$|Dental anatomy is a {{field of}} anatomy {{dedicated}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though dental occlusion, or contact between teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a taxonomic science as it {{is concerned with the}} naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{systems are}} studied at several {{different}} levels, from {{the scale of}} the ecology of individual organisms, to those of populations, to the ecosystems and finally the biosphere. The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology, although population biology is more frequently used in the case of diseases, viruses, and microbes, while the term population ecology is more commonly applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.|$|E

He purchased Spencer's equipment and used it for his electricity experiments after these demonstrations were completed. He referred to Spencer as Dr. Spence from Scotland. In 1746, at the age of forty years, Franklin began turning over the affairs of his printing company to his business partner David Hall, and went into semi-retirement so he could carry out research on electricity; initially using Spencer's equipment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, working in Hanford and Savannah River Sites, Reines and Cowan {{developed}} {{the equipment and}} procedures with which they first detected the supposedly undetectable neutrinos in June 1956.

This included the detection of neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays, and the 1987 detection of neutrinos emitted from Supernova SN1987A, which inaugurated the field of neutrino astronomy.|$|E
