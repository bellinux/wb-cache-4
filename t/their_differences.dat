5|$|As {{part of his}} {{diplomatic}} duties, Peckham {{wrote to}} Llywelyn, and in those letters the archbishop continued his criticisms of the Welsh people, this time condemning their laws as contrary to both the Old and New Testament. Peckham was particularly offended that Welsh laws sought to get parties to homicides or other crimes to settle <b>their</b> <b>differences</b> rather than the process of English law which condemned the criminal.|$|E

Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.|$|E

The permanent transfer went through in May 2006 for a fee of £1.2million, with Horsfield commenting that he and Warnock had resolved <b>their</b> <b>differences.</b>|$|E
5|$|IRIS {{featured}} {{an ensemble}} cast split between characters of North Korean and South Korean descent. Because the series explores {{the tension and}} mentality behind {{the two sides of}} the conflict, both the North and South perspectives are shown at length. The plot focuses on the cast overcoming the manipulation they face at an international level and occasionally attempting to reconcile <b>their</b> <b>differences</b> to fight an evil greater than either side ever acknowledged, making way for scenarios in which their allegiances are stressed and put to the test.|$|E
5|$|John Sigismund, {{originally}} Roman Catholic, {{converted to}} Lutheranism {{before the end}} of 1562. However, debates between Lutheran and Calvinist theologians continued. John Sigismund appointed his court physician, Giorgio Biandrata (who as an Anti-Trinitarian did not share either the Lutheran or the Calvinist view) to head a synod to reconcile the Lutheran and the Calvinist clergymen, but <b>their</b> <b>differences</b> proved insuperable in April 1564. The Diet acknowledged the existence of a separate Calvinist denomination in June. John Sigismund also adopted Calvinism and made Ferenc Dávid his court preacher.|$|E

In 1975, which was the 2,500th anniversary of the Nirvana (or Moksha) of Mahavira, monks of the various sects of Jainism assembled to resolve <b>their</b> <b>differences</b> and arrive at some commons points of agreement about the history and philosophy of Jainism.|$|E

5|$|Across the German Empire nagelfiguren, war {{memorials}} {{made from}} iron nails embedded in wood, became popular, particularly in Austria. These took various forms, including knights, shields, eagles and crosses, {{as well as}} submarines. This practice had medieval origins, and the memorials were reinforced by the promotion of burgfrieden during the war, a medieval pact in which disparate German communities would put aside <b>their</b> <b>differences</b> during a conflict. In some cases, relatives of the deceased were encouraged to hammer memorial nails in {{as part of the}} ceremonies, while children might be encouraged to read out poems in a medieval style. At some nagelfiguren a charge was made for each nail used, with the revenues donated to charities supporting soldiers, orphans and others affected by the conflict.|$|E

5|$|As the League developed, {{its role}} expanded, {{and by the}} middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of {{international}} activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle <b>their</b> <b>differences.</b>|$|E

As the two of them grow closer through their studies, and after Keitarō accidentally reads a small section of Naru's diary, he becomes increasingly convinced that Naru may be the girl with whom he made the promise. On {{the second day of the}} Tokyo University exam, Keitarō asks Naru about the promise and is stunned when she tells him he is mistaken. Despite their studying, and Naru's mock exam results, they both fail the exams. The pair then have an argument and independently run off to Kyoto to clear their heads. While on their trip they settle <b>their</b> <b>differences</b> and meet Mutsumi Otohime, who lives in Okinawa and is also studying for the Tokyo University exams.|$|E
