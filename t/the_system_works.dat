25|$|Differential {{braking systems}} are {{essentially}} an epicyclic transmission {{with a single}} fixed gear ratio transmitted through idler pinions. The controlled differential adds an extension to the rack holding the idlers, and puts a conventional brake on that extension. With the brake applied, the idlers are locked and <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>works</b> like a conventional epicyclic. When the brake is released, the idlers spin, reducing the speed of rotation on that side. This causes the output on that side to slow down by a fixed amount.|$|E

Ahmadov claims that the Baku Metro remains the worlds cheapest, however, despite the hike. Until 2006, metro users accessed the stations with metal (later plastic) tokens placed into turnstiles.

25|$|The Automatic Train Supervision {{sub-system}} {{provides for}} headway management and proper interleaving of trains at junctions by speeding up or slowing down trains. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>works</b> via {{a series of}} track mounted balises, which function as information beacons transmitting a speed code to the train as it passes overhead. Its designers intended its function to be non-vital, and for this reason, the design is not fail-safe. At no point can the ATC system override the maximum speed limit enforced by the cab signal system.|$|E

The video from the six cameras is then triangulated and combined to create a three-dimensional representation of the ball's trajectory. Hawk-Eye is not infallible and accurate to within 5 millimetres (0.19 inch) but generally trusted as an impartial second opinion in sports.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{developed}} in 1997, the EZpay system was born {{as a pilot}} project aimed at inductees going into basic training, to alleviate some of the stress and cost of managing money while away from home. Many U.S. military bases are structured like small towns, where goods and services are available for sale. However, transferring wages into cash, in order to purchase desired products has traditionally been a struggle. [...] <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>works</b> through soldiers receiving an advance on their wages {{in the form of}} the EZPay card, which they can then use to purchase goods and services, such as haircuts, snacks, and recreational activities at on-base shops and stores. [...] At the end of basic training, the balance on the card would be reconverted into cash, and paid back to the soldiers. [...] The project was a great success, since it eliminated the need for bases to keep money on hand, and saved soldiers approximately $125,000 a year in banking fees.|$|E

2500|$|Separating the {{expensive}} machinery section from the cargo space offers several advantages {{in comparison to}} conventional vessels, {{one of the most}} important being the ability to operate on the [...] "drop and swap" [...] principle which minimizes the turnaround time in port for the pusher and its crew. When a pusher-barge combination arrives at a port, the fully laden barge is left for unloading while the pusher picks up an empty one and leaves again. In theory <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>works</b> on optimum efficiency when there are as many barges as there are pushers and ports of call – the barges are always either being loaded or unloaded, or underway with a pusher. In addition to reducing unprofitable waiting time such operation principle allows more time for the unloading of the barge, removing the need for expensive cargo handling equipment in the unloading port.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, the {{nomination}} was decided by delegates under the Democratic Party's rules, so the candidates campaigned {{to maximize their}} delegate advantage. If {{the nomination}} were decided by popular vote, they likely would have campaigned differently, in order to run up the vote in populous states like New York and Illinois. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{has said that the}} popular vote should have no effect under the current rules: [...] "It’s a delegate race. The way <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>works</b> is that the delegates choose the nominee." [...] Obama's chief strategist suggested that the Clinton campaign's focus on the popular vote was a distraction tactic: [...] "When they started off, it was all about delegates.... Now that we have more delegates, it’s all about the popular vote. And if that does not work out, they will probably challenge us to a game of cribbage to choose the nominee." [...] Nevertheless, polls have shown that a plurality of Democrats think superdelegates should consider the popular vote when deciding which candidate to support.|$|E

It {{is capable of}} linking with various higher level command posts (HLCPs). As an option, {{with the use of}} HLCP, the Buk missile system may be controlled by an upper level command post system 9S52 Polyana-D4, integrating it with S-300V/S-300VM into an air defence brigade. Also, it may be controlled by an upper-level command-post system 73N6ME «Baikal-1ME» together with 1-4 units of PPRU-M1 (PPRU-M1-2), integrating it with SA-19 [...] "Grison" [...] (9K22 Tunguska) (6-24 units total) into an air defence brigade, as well as SA-10/20 and SA-5 Gammon and SA-2 Guideline and SA-3 Goa and Air Force.
