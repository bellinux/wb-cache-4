30|$|Given the {{importance}} of formative assessment {{in the context of}} the European Higher Education Area, it is necessary to explore new tools to implement innovative strategies for the formative assessment of students. Moodle’s quiz module represents an alternative to traditional tools, such as paper-and-pencil tests. In 2008, we carried out a project subsidised by the Institute of Education Sciences at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya — BarcelonaTech (UPC), the main aim of which was to elaborate a number of Moodle question pools and to design, implement and assess a series of quizzes from these pools. The project covered the compulsory undergraduate subjects in applied mathematics included in the first- and second-year syllabuses for all branches of Engineering. From the students’ results, it was then necessary to examine and revise the reliability of the quizzes as an assessment tool of the teaching and learning process. The analysis of the psychometric coefficients provided by Moodle proved to be a useful tool for assessing whether the questions had an appropriate level of difficulty and were suitable for discriminating between good and bad performers. Taking into account the psychometric analysis of this first project, in 2009 we initiated a new project, in which we planned <b>to</b> <b>revise</b> <b>thoroughly</b> the quizzes created in the former project, to improve their suitability as an assessment tool. This paper shows: i) the students’ results in the quizzes performed in the two academic years in the courses Mathematics 1 and Mathematics 2 — both taught in the first year of the four bachelor’s degree programmes in Biological Systems Engineering organised by the School of Agricultural Engineering of Barcelona at the UPC, as well as the students’ attitudes towards activities of this kind; and ii) the revision and fine-tuning of the quizzes from the psychometric analysis to improve their reliability. Finally, the analysis of the results reported leads to a discussion on the advisability of using this tool for the formative assessment of students.|$|E

Given the same area of cultivable land, productivity has to improve substantially. For this to happen, use of fertilizers, pesticides, intense irrigation and modern agricultural equipments would be required. The entire system has to upgrade significantly.|$|R
40|$|Towards {{the goal}} of {{correctness}} and reliability of hybrid systems, we continue our nonstandard static analysis program (with Suenaga and Sekine) where hybrid dynamics is turned into purely discrete one with explicit use of infinitesimals. While our previous results have focused on deductive verification by program logics, the current work aims at automation and enhanced scalability by extending abstract interpretation—a technique known for its ample scalability and widespread use in various verification tools—with infinitesimals. Our theoretical results include soundness and termination via uniform widening operators; and our prototype implementation successfully verifies some benchmark examples. 1 Introduction, or rather: Examples, Implementation and Exper-iments The current abstract reports our work-in-progress, summarizing our preprint [13] (that is planned <b>to</b> be <b>revised</b> <b>thoroughly).</b> Our contributions include a prototype tool that overapproximates reachable regions of hybrid sys...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the regulatory}} framework for renewable electricity in Palestine. The State of Palestine has inherited accumulative problems in its electricity sector, {{as in many other}} sectors, mainly due to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories since June 1967. These territories include the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip. The Occupied Palestinian Territories were declared by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2012 to hold non-member state status, and have since been known as the ‘State of Palestine’. Multifaceted limitations and restrictions resulting from the occupation have impeded development in the electricity sector as a pivotal public service. However, the Palestinian Government has recently attempted to take control over electricity and to restructure the sector using legal instruments. The government has adopted regulations and embraced a target to promote the use of renewable energy sources for the generation of electricity. This paper argues that despite the Palestinian Government’s attempt to achieve the renewable target, the law needs <b>to</b> be <b>revised</b> <b>thoroughly</b> <b>to</b> ensure increased promotion of alternative energy generation sources...|$|R

In addition to it, communications are published there from Lieutenant Raper, Admiral FitzRoy, Admiral Smyth, Admiral Beechey, and Colonel Sykes; the whole of which was collected under the title of 'Hints to Travellers;' they were printed in a separate form and widely circulated. When the edition was exhausted, a fresh Committee was appointed by the Council of the Royal Geographical society, consisting of Admiral sir George Back, Admiral R. Collinson, and myself, <b>to</b> <b>revise</b> the pamphlet <b>thoroughly.</b> This process was again gone through in 1871, and now the pamphlet is so much amended and enlarged that I should do no good by making extracts.

40|$|On 16 April the {{citizens}} of Turkey voted in a national referendum to amend the constitution. This {{will lead to a}} radical strengthening of the president’s power. 51. 4 % of the voters backed the amendments. They will come into force after the next presidential and parliamentary election (scheduled for 2019). The amendments are an important step in the thorough reconstruction of the Republic of Turkey which began in 2002. They will strengthen the position of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in legal terms, and – with all the controversies that entails – will adjust the legal status to the situation on the ground. The outcome of the referendum helps to temporarily stabilise the internal situation in Turkey and allows the country to be more active on the international arena; this includes making another attempt <b>to</b> <b>thoroughly</b> <b>revise</b> its relations with the EU.

Lessons drawn from {{the experiences of the}} introduction of scientific and graphics calculators are reported along with current moves in some other countries. Options for the role to be played by technology in assessment are canvassed. It is proposed that technology should be permitted in all components of assessment, but that explicit attention will need to be given to including questions that test algebraic insight. A plan for minimising inequity is proposed. For thirty years, new information technology has been a major force driving change in mathematics curriculum and assessment. In the 1960 s the introduction of electric calculators changed the way that arithmetic was done in business. As a consequence, the goals of the mathematics curriculum needed <b>to</b> be <b>thoroughly</b> <b>revised.</b> Later, when hand-held electronic calculators became affordable for students at school, curriculum and assessment began to change at all levels — a change involving such a fundamental re-assessment of goals and teaching methods that it continues today.

40|$|Introduction Increased {{attention}} {{has recently been}} focused on health record systems {{as a result of}} accreditation programs, a growing emphasis on patient safety, and the increase in lawsuits involving allegations of malpractice. Health-care professionals frequently express dissatisfaction with the health record systems and complain that the data included are neither informative nor useful for clinical decision making. This article reviews the main objectives of a hospital health record system, with emphasis on its roles in communication and exchange among clinicians, patient safety, and continuity of care, and asks whether current systems have responded to the recent changes in the Italian health-care system. Discussion If health records are to meet the expectations of all health professionals, the overall information need must be carefully analyzed, a common data set must be created, and essential specialist contributions must be defined. Working with health-care professionals, the hospital management should define how clinical information is to be displayed and organized, identify a functionally optimal layout, define the characteristics of ongoing patient assessment in terms of who will be responsible for these activities and how often they will be performed. Internet technology can facilitate data retrieval and meet the general requirements of a paper-based health record system, but it must also ensure focus on clinical information, business continuity, integrity, security, and privacy. Conclusions The current health records system needs <b>to</b> be <b>thoroughly</b> <b>revised</b> <b>to</b> increase its accessibility, streamline the work of health-care professionals who consult it, and render it more useful for clinical decision making—a challenging task that will require the active involvement of the many professional classes involved. </p...|$|R
60|$|There is but {{one other}} head on which I wish to offer a remark; and that has {{reference}} to the public health. In so vast a country, where {{there are thousands of}} millions of acres of land yet unsettled and uncleared, and on every rood of which, vegetable decomposition is annually taking place; where there are so many great rivers, and such opposite varieties of climate; there cannot fail to be a great amount of sickness at certain seasons. But I may venture to say, after conversing with many members of the medical profession in America, that I am not singular in the opinion that much of the disease which does prevail, might be avoided, if a few common precautions were observed. Greater means of personal cleanliness, are indispensable to this end; the custom of hastily swallowing large quantities of animal food, three times a-day, and rushing back to sedentary pursuits after each meal, must be changed; the gentler sex must go more wisely clad, and take more healthful exercise; and in the latter clause, the males must be included also. Above all, in public institutions, and throughout the whole of every town and city, the system of ventilation, and drainage, and removal of impurities requires <b>to</b> be <b>thoroughly</b> <b>revised.</b> There is no local Legislature in America which may not study Mr. Chadwick's excellent Report upon the Sanitary Condition of our Labouring Classes, with immense advantage.|$|R

40|$|The changes {{which have}} been taking place {{over the past few}} years in Azerbaijan’s {{international}} environment and the growing concern about internal stability have led to President Ilham Aliyev’s regime <b>to</b> <b>thoroughly</b> <b>revise</b> the country’s security policy by establishing closer relations with Russia and opening up to co-operation with Iran. One consequence of this move was Azerbaijan’s victory in the so-called Four-Day War in Nagorno-Karabakh in April this year – a symbolic success in military terms which nevertheless brought about a real political breakthrough. Baku has chosen the political rapprochement with Russia because it has no other alternative. Over the past three years, Azerbaijan has revised its risk assessment and has reached the conclusion that the West cannot guarantee its security, Turkey’s policy is unpredictable, and the strengthening position of its traditional enemy, Iran, generates threats to Azerbaijan. The rapprochement with Russia is a tactical solution intended at helping maintain internal stability and to weather the unfavourable geopolitical, economic and social conditions. The co-operation with the Kremlin has brought tangible benefits: a new dynamic in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh (beneficial to Azerbaijan); and a strengthening of the regime’s stability, which is necessary during a continuing economic slump. In strategic terms, closer relations with Russia in fact mean a withdrawal from the previous vision of Azerbaijan’s foreign policy based on co-operation with the West and Turkey. The consequences of this turn towards Russia will include a further bolstering of the authoritarian regime, restricting Azerbaijan’s political subjectivity and making it part of the geopolitical bloc being built by Russia in the post-Soviet area, for example, as part of the Eurasian Economic Union. The situation in Azerbaijan will also depend on the emerging anti-Western Russian-Iranian-Turkish concert of powers which Baku may also join...|$|R
