They assault the Irish man, pulling his hat over his eyes and then dumping the beer over his head. The group then begin wrecking the bar, smashing the fixtures, mirrors, and breaking <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register.</b> The bartender then sprays seltzer water in Nation's face before a group of policemen appear and order everybody to leave.|$|E
5|$|Milk's {{continuing}} campaign, {{run from}} the storefront of Castro Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned {{with the man who}} was no longer the laid-back hippie he had fallen in love with.|$|E

50|$|By 1894, the John Leighton Machine Company was {{producing}} <b>cash</b> <b>registers</b> at 512 and 514 East Water Street. <b>The</b> National <b>Cash</b> <b>Register</b> Company (Smith & Gardiner) was in operation at 114 West Washington and <b>the</b> Peck <b>Cash</b> <b>Register</b> Company had a shop at 227 and 229 Walton Street.|$|R
25|$|According {{to court}} transcripts, at {{approximately}} 5:00a.m. on March 11, 1979, Stanley Williams entered the Brookhaven Motel lobby and then broke {{down the door}} {{that led to the}} private office. Inside the office, Williams shot and killed Yen-Yi, Tsai-Shai, and Yu-Chin, after which he emptied <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> and fled the scene.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} patent, Ritty became {{overwhelmed}} with {{the responsibilities of}} running two businesses, so he sold all of his interests in <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> business to Jacob H. Eckert of Cincinnati, a china and glassware salesman, who formed the National Manufacturing Company. In 1884 Eckert sold the company to John H. Patterson, who renamed the company the National Cash Register Company and improved <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> by adding a paper roll to record sales transactions, thereby creating the journal for internal bookkeeping purposes, and the receipt for external bookkeeping purposes. The original purpose of the receipt was enhanced fraud protection. The business owner could read the receipts to ensure that cashiers charged customers the correct amount for each transaction and did not embezzle the cash drawer. It also prevents a customer from defrauding the business by falsely claiming receipt of a lesser amount of change or a transaction that never happened in the first place. The first evidence of an actual cash register was used in Coalton, Ohio, at the old mining company.|$|E
25|$|Others have {{suggested}} that fractional pricing was first adopted as a control on employee theft. For cash transactions with a round price, {{there is a chance}} that a dishonest cashier will pocket the bill rather than record the sale. For cash transactions with an odd price, the cashier must make change for the customer. This generally means opening <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> which creates a record of the sale in the register and reduces the risk of the cashier stealing from the store owner.|$|E

25|$|A cash drawer {{is usually}} a {{compartment}} underneath a cash register in which the cash from transactions is kept. The drawer typically contains a removable till. The till {{is usually a}} plastic or wooden tray divided into compartments used to store each denomination of bank notes and coins separately {{in order to make}} counting easier. The removable till allows money to be removed from the sales floor to a more secure location for counting and creating bank deposits. Some modern cash drawers are individual units separate from the rest of <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register.</b>|$|E
25|$|A cash register's drawer {{can only}} be opened by an {{instruction}} from <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> except when using special keys, generally held by the owner and some employees (e.g. manager). This reduces the amount of contact most employees have with cash and other valuables. It also reduces risks of an employee taking money from the drawer without a record and the owner's consent, such as when a customer does not expressly ask for a receipt but {{still has to be}} given change (cash is more easily checked against recorded sales than inventory).|$|E
25|$|Emma (Monica Potter), John Collingwood (Tony Goldwyn), {{and their}} daughter, {{competitive}} swimmer Mari (Sara Paxton), head out on vacation to their lake house. Shortly thereafter, Mari borrows {{the family car}} and drives into town {{to spend some time}} with her friend Paige (Martha MacIsaac). While Paige works <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> at a local store, she and Mari meet Justin (Spencer Treat Clark), a teenager passing through town who invites them both back to his roadside motel room to smoke marijuana. While the three are hanging out in the motel room, Justin's family members return: Krug (Garret Dillahunt), Justin's father; Francis (Aaron Paul), Justin's uncle; and Sadie (Riki Lindhome), Krug's girlfriend.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{issue of}} <b>cash</b> <b>registers</b> has {{recently}} been updated in the Czech Republic. Their introduction assumes {{the elimination of the}} shadow economy through an increase in reported sales for business entites, who are forced to use it. Regression analysis has not demonstrated a direct effect of <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>registers</b> on <b>the</b> level of reported revenues. <b>Cash</b> <b>registers</b> represent an additional burden on businesses and make conditions for doing a business more difficult. In the year of introduction of <b>cash</b> <b>registers</b> <b>the</b> number of business entities has decreased, while the number of civil servants has increased. The direct effect of <b>cash</b> <b>registers</b> on <b>the</b> development of tax revenue of the state budget could not be demonstrated due to lack of relevant data...|$|R
5|$|Innovation led to {{business}} {{growth in the}} region. In 1884, John Henry Patterson acquired James Ritty's National Manufacturing Company along with his <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> patents and formed <b>the</b> National <b>Cash</b> <b>Register</b> Company (NCR). <b>The</b> company manufactured <b>the</b> first mechanical <b>cash</b> <b>registers</b> and {{played a crucial role}} in the shaping of Dayton's reputation as an epicenter for manufacturing in the early 1900s. In 1906, Charles F. Kettering, a leading engineer at the company, helped develop <b>the</b> first electric <b>cash</b> <b>register,</b> which propelled NCR into the national spotlight. NCR also helped develop the US Navy Bombe, a code-breaking machine that helped crack the Enigma machine cipher during World War II.|$|R
25|$|If {{a filling}} station allows {{customers}} to pay at the register, {{the data from}} the dispensers may be transmitted via RS232, RS485 or Ethernet to the point of sale, usually inside the filling station's building, and fed into the station's cash register operating system. <b>The</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> system gives a limited control over the fuel dispenser, and is usually limited to allowing the clerks to turn the pumps on and off. A separate system is used to monitor the fuel tank's status and quantities of fuel. With sensors directly in the fuel tank, the data is fed to a terminal in the back room, where it can be downloaded or printed out. Sometimes this method is bypassed, with the fuel tank data transmitted directly into an external database.|$|E
25|$|Price Chopper was {{an early}} {{innovator}} in the conversion of conventional stores to superstores and combination (food and drug) units, as well as operating stores that are open 24 hours a day. The first Price Chopper opened in the late 1970s in Oneonta, NY followed by another in the early 1980s in Latham, New York, and then an even larger unit constructed in Queensbury, in 1986. The Super Centers, which were {{state of the art}} by 1980s standards, often featured full-service meat, seafood, and bakery departments, as well as pharmacies and banks (features new to supermarkets at the time). These units were also known for their unconventional layouts with aisles facing horizontally, or away from the cash registers, rather than the traditional vertical arrangement with the aisles facing <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register</b> area. Very few Price Chopper stores still retain this layout today. In the late 1980s Price Chopper changed its corporate logo. The aforementioned logo featured a morgan silver dollar like coin with an axe chopping into the coin. Women's advocates complained the logo promoted violence against women. Price chopper now features an axe cutting into a generic looking coin with no obverse image.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in 1961, Leura Collins was {{employed}} as a sales person at Store No. 2, which was a store with a lunch counter. [...] Then in 1970, she was transferred to Store No. 98, which was a lobby food operation, where she again worked as a sales person. As a Weingarten sales person, Collins was represented under a collective bargaining agreement by Local Union No 455 of the Retail Clerks Union, which later became part of United Food and Commercial Workers. After a report that Collins was taking money from <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> <b>register,</b> an internal Weingarten investigator spent two days in June 1972 observing the store without the knowledge of Store No. 98's manager. After completing the surveillance, the investigator informed the store manager of his presence and reported that he could find nothing wrong. The store manager then told the investigator that one coworker had reported that Collins failed to pay full price for a box of chicken she had purchased.|$|E
