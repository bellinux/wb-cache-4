5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> righting itself and exiting <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction of <b>the</b> <b>turn.</b> At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>turn.</b> At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E
5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> the force on the tire is towards the center of <b>the</b> <b>turn.</b> Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the side-slip, away from the direction of <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> and therefore tends to increase the radius of <b>the</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> but may remain opposite to the direction of <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> to increase lean and decrease radius, then into <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E

The results of trial are stated below. 　 1) The size of steady turning diameter depended on the rudder angle and was little affected by <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> speed. 　 2) <b>The</b> ratio of <b>the</b> steady <b>turning</b> diameter to <b>the</b> ship length between perpendiculars (D/L) was inversely proportional to the rudder angle, and its regression formula was expressed as y= 20. 361 x-^l.

5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee to the inside of <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding <b>the</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E

5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards the outside of <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> is actually moving rearward, {{with respect to the}} wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>turn,</b> and therefore tends to decrease <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> radius.|$|E
