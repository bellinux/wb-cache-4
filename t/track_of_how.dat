5|$|Throughout gameplay, {{the player}} {{encounters}} various minigames, {{which range from}} simple to more complex. The first type of minigame encountered is a battle sequence that resembles a fighting game, but no interaction from the player is required to fight. These recurring battle sequences represent when {{the members of the}} Little Busters get into physical fights with either each other or with others. Each member of the fight has a set of statistics attributed to them (which includes strength, stamina, agility, reflex, concentration, judgment, and luck) along with a life bar to keep <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> many hit points a fighter has left. The maximum number of hit points is determined by the given fighter's stamina rating. Weapons may be used along with any accessories the fighter has in their possession, and these items may be exchanged with other characters. Another recurring minigame involves the player being able to play baseball batting practice with members of the Little Busters. The player, as Riki, controls his position and when to swing the bat.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} was {{a continuation}} of the narrative of Path of Radiance, even though that game was not given an intentional cliffhanger ending. So the story would be comprehensible for people who had not played Path of Radiance, the story was split up into four segments divided between the game's various factions. The team initially thought of a three-part structure, then settled on the current format. Their aim from the beginning was to create a large-scale, intricate world for players to enjoy. It {{was the first time the}} developers had incorporated such a structure into a Fire Emblem game. The dialogue for characters was made slightly rougher based on feedback from Path of Radiance, where character dialogue remained calm and cultured even in battle situations. The total number of characters increased by approximately 1.5 times compared to Path of Radiance. So players could keep <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> characters interacted with each other, the team introduced a character relationship flow chart. The game's Japanese subtitle made reference to both a key character and the way Telleus came to be. They also wanted to continue to portray the themes of conflict explored in Path of Radiance. The game's thematic color, expressed in its artwork and presentation, was red, as opposed to the use of blue in Path of Radiance. Senri Kita, the character designer for Path of Radiance, returned in that capacity for Radiant Dawn.|$|E

At this time, {{the crew and}} Inuit {{families}} had been rescued from the ice floe, however the fate of Budington, Bessels, and {{the remainder of the}} crew was still unknown. The board consisted of Admiral Louis M. Goldsborough, Secretary of the Navy Robeson, Commodore Reynolds, Captain Henry W. Howgate of the Army, and Spencer F. Baird of the Academy of Sciences. Tyson was the first to appear for questioning, and related the friction between Hall, Budington, and Bessels, and Hall's deathbed accusations of poisoning. The board also inquired about the whereabouts of Hall's journals and records. Tyson responded that while Hall was delirious, he instructed Budington to burn some of the papers, and the rest had disappeared. Later, journals of other crew members were discovered {{at the site of the}} Polaris wreck, but these had the sections regarding Hall's death cut out. Meyer testified to Budington's drinking, saying that the sailing master was [...] "drunk most always while we were going southward". Steward John Herron testified that he had not made the coffee that Hall had suspected of being laced with poison; he explained that the cook made the coffee, and that he had not kept <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> many people had touched the cup before it was brought to Hall.|$|E

50|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 2000s, there were serious {{concerns}} the 325 metres (1,066 ft) wide asteroid 99942 Apophis posed a risk of impacting Earth in 2036.

In July 2005, B612 formally asked NASA to investigate the possibility that the asteroid's post-2029 orbit could be in orbital resonance with Earth, which would increase the likelihood of a future impact.

The most responses came in Hinglish, a mix of Hindi and English. They were in either text, audio or video format. The analytics were beyond just Praise and Criticism. Persistent Systems had more than 50 tags available for every episode for message analysis.

As the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is currently developing future manned missions to Mars in the 2030 s, work has begun now to identify key factors to ensure space flight crew is happy and healthy during a prolonged space flight mission. The research conducted on these missions includes studies of food, crew behavior, roles and performance that directly impact space flight and primary mission success.
