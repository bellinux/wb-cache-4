5|$|Attalus was at {{that time}} {{corresponding}} with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may have considered him <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> leave alive. Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} levels of {{radioactive}} contamination, her papers from the 1890s are considered <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> handle. Even her cookbook is highly radioactive. Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes, and {{those who wish to}} consult them must wear protective clothing. In her last year, she worked on a book, Radioactivity, which was published posthumously in 1935.|$|E
5|$|If Progress M1-5 had {{launched}} on 16 January, the Soyuz launch {{would have occurred}} on 10 February {{if it had been}} required. It was stood down around 22 February, after the decaying altitude of Mir made it <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> send a crew to it.|$|E

When the evolved children mentally alter the Moon's rotation and make other planetary manipulations, it becomes <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> remain. The departing Overlords offer to take Rodricks with them, but he chooses to stay to witness Earth's end, and transmit a report of what he sees.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal {{returned}} to base in Loch Ewe, {{where she and}} her crew were inspected by Winston Churchill. The sinking of U-39 was hailed as important to morale. However, the failed attack on Ark Royal, and the successful attack on Courageous on 17 September, convinced the Admiralty it was <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> risk aircraft carriers in this way, and carrier-centred hunter-killer groups were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|At about 8:30pm, {{the men of}} the 5th and 6th regiments met at Camden Station {{along with}} some 200 police. As {{reported}} by The Sun, Governor Carroll and Mayor Latrobe were present at the station, along with B vice president King, General Herbert and his staff, and a number of police commissioners. Here they decided that conditions were <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> send any troops away to Cumberland.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{it should}} be noted in some races, NASCAR has {{permitted}} the cars to run to the finish in case of more [...] "minor" [...] spins on the last lap.

5|$|Initial plans {{called for}} the United States Air Force to {{dispatch}} two transport aircraft to Mogadishu International Airport, but diplomats were unable to contact anyone in the Somali government to obtain clearance for the aircraft to land {{at the airport and}} it also became clear that it was <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> travel from the embassy to the airport. Meanwhile, the USS Guam and USS Trenton began transit from the coast of Oman towards Mogadishu with forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Following the attack, Sakonju judged {{that it was}} <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} the raid as Behars distress message may have alerted the Allies to his force's presence. Accordingly, the Japanese turned back for the NEI that day. The heavy cruisers were again escorted through the Sunda Strait by Kinu, Ōi and five destroyers, and arrived back at the NEI on 15March. During this time, the Behar survivors were held in a small and extremely hot store room on board Tone, and were given little access to food and water, sanitary facilities and exercise.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, four {{female athletes}} – Anette Sagen, Helena Olsson Smeby, Line Jahr, and Lindsey Van – {{were invited to}} perform test jumps prior to the men's 2004 Continental Cup event in Vikersund. However, this was {{initially}} blocked by Torbjørn Yggeseth, founder of the Ski Jumping World Cup {{and a member of}} the FIS technical committee at the time, on the grounds that it was <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> allow women on ski flying hills. Sagen challenged this and eventually won the right to jump from the hill, along with her fellow athletes. Both Sagen and Smeby jumped , which remains the third longest distance for women.|$|E

Mumm, with alpine guides Alexis and Henri Brocherel, make a {{preliminary}} reconnaissance {{of the eastern}} and western sides of Kamet. The highest point reached is 6,100 m (20,000 ft) above the East Kamet Glacier. Longstaff deems the East Kamet route as <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> due <b>to</b> avalanche risk.|$|R
5|$|John Palliser {{crossed the}} Rockies through a pass in 1858 {{that led to}} the {{headwaters}} of the Palliser River, a tributary of the Kootenay River now named in his honor. (However, at first, his party referred to it as Palliser's River.) His expedition made it downstream to Columbia Lake, but had some trouble making their way back to Alberta; the return route that they had chosen proved <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> negotiate. After trading for some horses and new supplies from a band of Ktunaxa, they made it back over the Rockies later that year through North Kootenay Pass near Lower and Upper Kananaskis Lakes, after traveling up the Elk River.|$|E
5|$|MIND MGMT is a {{government}} agency of spies, formed during or after World War I, who have psychic abilities. Henry Lyme is recruited as a child, and becomes their greatest agent. The work exhausts him, and Lyme is retired to Zanzibar. While there, he has a breakdown and loses control of his abilities, causing the city's inhabitants to murder one another. Lyme decides MIND MGMT is <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> exist, and flees. In an effort to cover his escape, he accidentally causes everyone aboard a plane with him to develop amnesia.|$|E
5|$|On the boat, Mulder and Smith {{debate whether}} they should save Mulder’s mother Teena, despite the risk of Men in Black {{awaiting}} them. Mulder ultimately agrees {{that it would be}} <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> visit her. Instead, they head towards Canada, where Smith says Mulder will find his sister, Samantha. Meanwhile, the First Elder (Don S. Williams) meets with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) in Teena's hospital room, confronting him with photos of his prior meeting with her, taken by X (Steven Williams). They realize that there is a leak, and plan to smoke out its source by releasing false information about Teena being in danger.|$|E

5|$|After the {{war with}} Japan began, Wau became an {{evacuation}} centre, receiving refugees from Lae and Salamaua. Non-native {{women and children were}} evacuated while men of military age were called up for service in the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles, the local militia unit. Initially, civilians were evacuated by civilian aircraft but as the Japanese drew closer—bombing Wau on 23 January 1942—it became <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> fly without fighter escort, which was unavailable. This left some 250 European and Asian men stranded. These refugees made a hazardous journey over the Owen Stanley Range on foot by way of Kudjeru and Tekadu to Bulldog, a disused mining settlement where there was an aerodrome, and thence down the Lakekamu River to the sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1791 and 1792, Fray José Francisco Garza befriended {{some of the}} Karankawa {{and other}} native peoples. Their {{friendship}} allowed Garza to explore much of the coastal areas that had been <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> visit. The Indians requested that Garza build a mission at the junction of the San Antonio and Guadalupe Rivers, and in February 1793 Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio opened near Mission Lake {{at the head of}} San Antonio Bay. Over 230Indians lived at the mission initially, but within two years they were forced to move to a less flood-prone site, which became known as Refugio. By {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, only a small number of the hunting and gathering tribes within Texas had not been Christianized. In 1793, mission San Antonio de Valero was secularized, and the following year the four remaining missions at San Antonio were partially secularized.|$|E
5|$|Two days late, the {{parachute}} infantry battalions of Stanisław Sosabowski's 1st (Polish) Parachute Brigade {{were able to}} take off in England. 114 C-47s took off but 41 aircraft turned back after Troop Carrier Command decided it would be <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> land if the aircraft were up too long. The remainder pressed on; they did not have the correct transmission codes and did not understand the messages. One of the few messages to get out of Arnhem warned the Poles that DZ 'K' was not secure and to land instead on the polder east of Driel where they should secure the Heveadorp ferry on the south bank of the Rhine. The Poles dropped under fire at 17:00 and sustained casualties but assembled in good order. Advancing to the river bank, they discovered that the ferry was gone; the ferryman had sunk it to deny its use to the Germans.|$|E
50|$|The {{ruins of}} the castle are {{in the care of}} Historic Scotland, but were for many years in <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> a {{condition}} <b>to</b> be open to the public. On the completion of consolidation works, Auchindoun was re-opened for public viewing in November 2007.|$|R

5|$|Bavi and its {{precursor}} {{tropical disturbance}} impacted eastern Micronesia, with strong to gale force winds of between , reported on various atolls in the Marshall Islands. Considerable damage was {{reported on the}} islet of Ebeye, on the main atoll of Kwajalein, {{a small amount of}} tree damage was reported, while several old steel structures were made <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> use. Overall damages in the Marshall Islands were estimated at US$2.1 million, while a fishing vessel and its crew of nine were reported missing during March 12. After impacting Eastern Micronesia, Bavi approached the Mariana Islands, with its circulation passing over Guam during March 15, where it caused the highest waves to be recorded on the island in a decade. Bavi also impacted the Northern Mariana Islands of Rota, Tinian and Saipan, where power outages were reported and five houses were destroyed. Total property damages within the Mariana Islands were estimated at around US$150 thousand.|$|E
5|$|The CIA hands Jodie over to Nathan, now {{executive}} director of the DPA, overseeing the DPA's newest condenser, code-named the Black Sun. He reveals that the CIA is willing to let Jodie go if she agrees to a final mission. Jodie and a CIA team led by Ryan destroy a facility housing a Chinese-developed condenser before it is used to attack the United States. Jodie then learns that Nathan built a miniature condenser to speak exclusively to his family, but without success. After showing Nathan that his refusal to let them go is only making them suffer, Jodie tries to leave, only to be held in captivity by the CIA—the organisation has deemed her <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> be freed. Jodie is subjected to the same fate as her mother. Nathan appears and informs Jodie that he's decided to shut down the containment field to the Black Sun, merging the two worlds together and making death meaningless. Too weak to free Jodie, Aiden contacts Ryan and Cole, leading them to her. After Nathan shuts down the containment field, the three chase after him {{into the heart of the}} Black Sun, with the intent of destroying it.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{joined the}} Dunkirk {{evacuation}} on 29 May and returned 272 men to Dover during the day. However, {{the situation at}} Dunkirk soon became <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>to</b> risk the larger and more modern destroyers, so Harvester {{made no attempt to}} evacuate any troops during daylight hours on 30 May. This decision was rescinded during the day on 30 May and the ship sailed for Dunkirk on the night of 30/31 May. En route she was narrowly missed by two torpedoes, but she rescued 1341 men in two trips on 31 May and an additional 576 on 1 June. Harvester was lightly damaged by strafing German aircraft that same day and required repairs that were made at Chatham. On 9 June the ship was ordered to Le Havre, France, to evacuate British troops, but none were to be found. She loaded 78 men at Saint-Valery-en-Caux on 11 June. Later in the month she escorted ships evacuating refugees and troops from Saint-Nazaire and St. Jean de Luz (Operation Ariel).|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, {{budgetary}} {{pressures and}} difficulty achieving sufficient range, plus {{the fact that}} an LH2-powered aircraft was considered <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> and expensive <b>to</b> maintain led to the project's cancellation. In addition, the unusual fuel would have meant that existing airbases would have needed extensive facilities to handle the aircraft.|$|R
