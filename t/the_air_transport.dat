5|$|After the 1942 season, Ruffing took a {{job with}} Vultee Aircraft, a defense contractor. Despite his age (37) and missing toes, a United States Army doctor {{certified}} Ruffing as Class 1-B in the Selective Service System, overruled Ruffing's personal physician, who had ruled Ruffing unfit for service. The Army decided that Ruffing could serve in a non-combat role. Ruffing missed the 1943 and 1944 seasons due to his service during World War II. He served in the Sixth Ferrying Group of <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Command of the United States Army Air Forces at the rank of private. However, he did pitch for <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Command's baseball team, throwing a perfect game against Joe DiMaggio's team, and leading his team to the championship against Ted Lyons' team. In 1944, he played with an All-Star team for troops stationed in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, George led <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Command, {{taking it}} from 130 {{obsolescent}} aircraft to 3,000 modern transports, operated by 300,000 airmen. Following the war, he helped Hughes Aircraft {{become a very}} profitable company, and was twice elected mayor of Beverly Hills, California.|$|E
5|$|Lodge Hill Garage, Abingdon, Oxfordshire has a {{full-size}} replica Spitfire {{as its own}} rooftop monument. Owner Peter Jewson bought the replica in a campaign to build the first ever national memorial to honour the 166 women from <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Auxiliary (ATA) who flew Spitfires and other aircraft from factories to their operational airbases; 14 died during these ferry flights.|$|E
50|$|On 15 February 1954, the 39th, and <b>the</b> 45th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadrons, were reconstituted and {{assigned}} to <b>the</b> 1607th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Group. <b>The</b> 39th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron was subsequently designated “Medium” and <b>the</b> 45th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron was {{designated as a}} “Heavy” squadron, indicating the type of aircraft that was and would be assigned to these units. The initial transport mission of <b>the</b> newly activated <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Group was accomplished when a C-54 operated by <b>the</b> 1st <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron (Medium) delivered a 9,000 pound radio mast to Harmon Field, Newfoundland. On 8 March 1954, <b>the</b> 40th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron (Heavy) was reconstituted {{and assigned}} to the Wing. On 1 May 1954, the first Douglas C-124 Globemaster II arrived at Dover and on 12 June <b>the</b> 45th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron flew <b>the</b> first C-124 “heavy” transport mission, airlifting five engines to Harmon Field, Newfoundland and a 12,000 pound spool of cable to Torbay Air Base, Newfoundland.|$|R
50|$|The {{group was}} formed from the {{personnel}} and equipment of <b>the</b> 1st <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Group (Provisional), a C-54 Skymaster unit of <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Command (ATC) at Westover when Military <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Service (MATS) replaced ATC in 1948. The 1st had been organized as the operational element of <b>the</b> 2d <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing (Provisional) Under the experimental wing base (Hobson Plan) organization system. When the 1600th was organized {{it became the}} operational element of <b>the</b> 520th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing (later <b>the</b> 1600th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing).|$|R
50|$|On 8 September 1954, the 1st and 21st <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadrons were re-designated from “Medium” to “Heavy” {{transport}} units, respectively as the C-54s {{assigned to}} these units were {{replaced with the}} C-124. On 20 September 1954, <b>the</b> 1607th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing and its headquarters were re-designated <b>the</b> 1607th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing (Heavy). <b>The</b> same order added “Heavy” to the designation of <b>the</b> 1607th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Group.Throughout <b>the</b> years there were many changes to the organizations under <b>the</b> 1607th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing. In 1955, C-124 units such as the 15th, the 20th and <b>the</b> 31st <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadrons were relocated from Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts when MATS closed its facilities there. Along with the relocation of these units both the 21st and 45th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadrons were inactivated. The 40th was inactivated in December 1960 and its personnel were absorbed into the other units. With {{the arrival of the}} Douglas C-133 Cargomaster in 1957, <b>the</b> 39th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron was re-designated a C-133 unit with <b>the</b> 1st <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron to follow in 1960.|$|R
5|$|There was a {{call for}} {{automated}} transponders after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks; no changes were made, as aviation experts preferred flexible control, in case of malfunctions or electrical emergencies. In the wake of Flight 370, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> industry was still resistant to the installation of automated transponders, which would likely entail significant costs. Pilots also criticised changes of this kind, insisting {{on the need to}} cut power to equipment {{in the event of a}} fire. Nonetheless, new types of tamper-proof circuit breakers were being considered.|$|E
5|$|Attempts to {{quantify}} {{the economic impact of}} growth in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> sector generate results which depend on assumptions made, and therefore the viewpoint of the organisation making the analysis. The OEF study has produced a figure of £2.5billion per annum of additional GDP by 2015 for Heathrow, or £7billion per annum by 2030 if a third runway is built there. Full implementation of the White Paper runway proposals resulted in a forecast yield of an additional £13billion per annum in GDP by 2030. Calculations done for the AEF, based on a new runway at Stansted, and which assume increased taxation of the industry, result in a negative economic benefit.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, Pemco World Air Services and Precision Conversions {{launched}} aftermarket conversion {{programs to}} modify 757-200s into 757 Combi aircraft. Vision Technologies Systems launched {{a similar program}} in December 2011. All three aftermarket conversions modify the forward portion of the aircraft to provide room for up to ten cargo pallets, while leaving the remaining space to fit around 45 to 58 passenger seats. This configuration is targeted at commercial charter flights which transport heavy equipment and personnel simultaneously. Customers for converted 757 Combi aircraft include <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Services Group, National Airlines, and North American Airlines.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> 1501st <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing was a {{heavy cargo}} {{transport}} wing of <b>the</b> Military <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Service (MATS), formed on 1 June 1948.

50|$|Later, <b>the</b> 517th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing was redesginated <b>the</b> 1701st <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing on 1 June 1948 when <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Command was redesignated <b>the</b> Military <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Service (MATS). Great Falls was {{assigned}} to the MATS Pacific Division. Transport units assigned to Great Falls were the 5th, 6th and 7th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadrons (later redesignated 1270th, 1271st and 1272d ATS) which flew C-54 Skymasters.|$|R
50|$|Reestablished as <b>the</b> 48th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron in 1952 {{to replace}} <b>the</b> 1264th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron, {{which had been}} {{organized}} in 1948 as <b>the</b> 2d <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron, a Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport squadron.

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the Indonesian Republic, Garuda Indonesia {{dominated}} <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> service in the country, connecting major cities in the archipelago. In 1956, the Garuda Indonesia operated its first hajj flight to Mecca with Convair aircraft, carrying 40 Indonesian pilgrims. In 1963, the airline launched flights to Hong Kong. By the mid 1960s, the airline took delivery of its first Douglas DC-8 and grew beyond the Asian market, beginning scheduled flights to Amsterdam and Frankfurt via Colombo, Bombay, and Prague. Rome and Paris became the airline's third and fourth European destinations, with flights stopping in Bombay and Cairo to refuel. Flights to the People's Republic of China began that same year, with service to Canton via Phnom Penh.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force {{operates}} combat, maritime patrol, {{transport and}} training aircraft. As at July 2015 the combat aircraft force comprised 71 F/A-18A and B Hornets and 24 F/A-18F Super Hornets. The Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance force {{was equipped with}} 15 AP-3C Orions and 6 Boeing E-7A Wedgetail AEW aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> force operated 12 C-130J-30 Super Hercules, 6 C-17 Globemaster IIIs with 2 on order, 2 C-27 Spartans with 8 on order and 9 Super King Air 200/300 utility transport aircraft. The RAAF also operates 3 Bombardier Challenger and 2 Boeing Business Jet 737 aircraft as VIP transports. 5 Airbus KC-30B Multi-Role Tanker Transports were in service. The RAAF also operates 67 Pilatus PC-9, 8 Beechcraft B300 King Air and 33 Hawk 127 training aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Seven of the {{participants}} became general officers. Hull was recalled to active duty to be an intelligence officer in World War II, then remained in the Air Force as a career. He retired as a brigadier general in 1964. Meloy served as a brigadier general in <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Command and retired in 1946. Goddard was recognized as the principal aerial photography expert of the USAF and retired in 1953 as a brigadier general. Caleb V. Haynes and his crew won the MacKay Trophy in 1939 flying an earthquake relief mission to Chile in the XB-15, and delivered the first B-24 Liberator overseas in early 1942. Assigned initially to the Tenth Air Force, {{he was the first}} commander of the Assam-Burma-China Ferry Command, the airlift operation flying supplies over the Hump to China. Haynes went on to command the bombers of the China Air Task Force under Maj. Gen. Claire Chennault, became a brigadier general, commanded the India Air Task Force, and retired from the USAF as a major general in 1953.|$|E
50|$|On 18 November 1953, {{the first}} two <b>transport</b> squadrons, <b>the</b> 1st <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron (ATS) and <b>the</b> 21st <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron (ATS), “Medium”, which flew the Douglas C-54G, were reconstituted, re-designated and {{assigned}} to <b>the</b> 1607th <b>Air</b> Base Group. This would be the nucleus of <b>the</b> 1607th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing (ATW). On 22 December 1953, the Secretary of <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force designated Dover Air Force Base as a permanent military installation.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> 49th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron is an {{inactive}} United States Air Force unit. Its last {{assignment was}} {{as part of}} <b>the</b> 1502d <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing, Military <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Service, stationed at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii.|$|R
50|$|Later, <b>the</b> 517th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing was redesignated <b>the</b> 1701st <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing. This wing's primarymission was the routing and {{scheduling}} of flights throughout the Pacific Ocean region and {{in support of}} allied forces in the Korean War. <b>The</b> Military <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Service (MATS) reopened the C-54 Flight Training School as the 1272d Medium Transition Training Unit in May 1950, one month before the Korean War began.|$|R
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on making {{the best use of}} existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered to be necessary, three of them at the London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy is designed to be a balanced and measured approach to the future of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> industry; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the environmental consequences.|$|E
5|$|The law {{governing}} aviation in the UK {{is defined}} by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which is updated periodically with amendments, the latest being the Civil Aviation Act 2006. The government department responsible for legislating changes in national policy and long term strategy relating to aviation is the Department for Transport (DfT). At the operational level the independently run Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulates economic, safety, and consumer protection aspects, as well as airspace policy, although these responsibilities are being increasingly ceded to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). International aspects of air transport are regulated by agreements made within the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as established by the Chicago Convention, whilst most new legislation is now made at the European level through the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). As a consequence, other than in airport development, there are few aspects of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> industry in which the government can act in isolation.|$|E
5|$|Support for airport {{expansion}} {{is based on}} an economic case that regards <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> industry not only as an important industry in its own right, but also as a facilitator of growth for the economy as a whole. One study predicts that the government's strategy will realise an additional £13billion per annum in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030. Another study which is critical of the government approach, and which favours addressing environmental impacts through increased taxation of air transport, indicates a negative economic benefit resulting from airport expansion. In 2006 the industry was responsible for over 6 per cent of all UK carbon emissions, a figure that is set to rise as demand increases. Under current strategies of emissions reduction and growth in air transport, air travel in the UK could account for up to 50 per cent of the UK carbon budget by 2050. Industry attempts to address this issue are longer term efforts based on technological and operational improvements, whilst government policy is based on the inclusion of air transport within emissions trading schemes. Critics advocate a shift in government policy to address environmental impacts by constraining the growth in demand for air travel, primarily through the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively. Local environmental issues include noise and air quality, and the impact of these, particularly {{in the case of the}} former, is subject to debate. Government policy generally is that these are local issues best addressed locally, and has introduced legislation designed to facilitate this.|$|E
50|$|The {{request was}} {{eventually}} approved by then Secretary of Defense Robert A. Lovett and on 23 August 1952, the alert {{orders for the}} operation were sent to two airlift wings, <b>the</b> 1602nd <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing at Wiesbaden Air Base, West Germany and <b>the</b> 1603rd <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing at Wheelus <b>Air</b> Base, Libya. <b>The</b> 1602nd tasked <b>the</b> 86th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron and 1629th Support Squadron at Rhein-Main Air Base, West Germany, {{to take part in}} the operation, while the 1603rd tasked <b>the</b> 41st <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron. Brigadier General Wentworth Goss, commanding general of the 1602nd, was appointed as commanding officer for this task force.|$|R
50|$|With air {{transportation}} {{recognized as a}} critical need, the 109th was redesignated <b>the</b> 109th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Group (Heavy) on 2 January 1960 and was transferred from TAC to <b>the</b> Military <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Service (MATS). <b>The</b> 139th <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Squadron was equipped with C-97 Stratofreighter intercontinental transports, with an Aeromedical Flight as a secondary mission.

The wing reported directly to MATS Headquarters after 1952. It was discontinued on 8 January 1966.|$|R
5|$|The first air {{transport}} unit in SWPA was called <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Command, which was formed at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland on 28 January 1942. It {{was equipped with}} five C-53s originally bound for the Philippines, and two B-18s and a C-39 that had escaped from there. Only two of the original 14 pilots were fully qualified on transports; the remaining 12 had to be retrained. Of the 19 airmen, 12 were trained as aircrew members. It was redesignated the 21st Transport Squadron on 3 April. On the same date, the 22nd Transport Squadron was formed at Essendon Airport in Victoria with former KNILM and RNEIAAF aircraft that had arrived in Australia from Java. The two squadrons were redesignated the 21st and 22nd Troop Carrier Squadrons on 26 July. The RAAF formed four transport squadrons in February and March 1942, and No. 33 Squadron RAAF began flying a regular passenger and freight service from Townsville to Port Moresby on 5 March. It received Avro Ansons in September and a detachment was sent to Port Moresby the following month. Aircraft of No. 36 Squadron RAAF also made occasional trips to New Guinea in 1942, and twenty RAAF pilots were seconded to US troop carrier squadrons.|$|E
25|$|The Air Element {{consists}} of one unit <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing which was formed on 12 August 1975 and is commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Matagarakikai. <b>The</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing (ATW) has four squadrons: operation, maintenance, training and support; with each squadron made up flights {{with a total}} strength of 125 personnel.|$|E
