40|$|As {{state of}} the art flash memory {{technologies}} scale down to sub 30 nm node, conventional floating gate flash memory approaches its physical scaling limit mainly because of the high gate coupling ratio (GCR) requirement to secure proper memory window. Here, we report a novel flash memory device called Cr metal <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>memory</b> (MTFM) that can circumvent the GCR issue and extend flash memory scalability by employing Cr thin film as a storage layer. Cr metal <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>memory</b> devices with simple and low temperature processes produced a wide memory window of 10 V at the ± 18 V voltage sweep with GCR of only 0. 3. Such a large window can be adopted for multi-level cell operations, which can further increase the memory density. Also, retention measurement shows more than 10 years retention time due to higher energy barrier between Cr metal and tunnel oxide than conventional poly silicon and tunnel oxide. Cross section transmission electron microscope (TEM) images showed the structure and accurate dimensions of the Cr MTFM device with continuous Cr film and sharp interfaces. As for material characterizations, an amorphous like Cr phase was observed through TEM and x-ray diffraction (XRD). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the Cr-Cr bond and Cr-O bond near the Cr surface after evaporation and rapid thermal annealing.

In particular, cerium oxide (CeO 2) is a multi-functional material with unique oxygen storage/release capacity, originating from the intrinsic redox property. Especially, the oxygen defects {{have been found to}} {{play a critical role in}} diverse applications. In this thesis, CeO 2 based nanocrystals with controlled morphology were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and their applications in resistive switching memory and diverse catalysts were explored. The theme of this research covered the following aspects: (i) Systematic synthesis of CeO 2 nanocrystals with various morphologies including octahedrons, nanowires, nanorods and nanocubes. Among these nanocrystals, the octahedrons were selected to fabricate <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>memory</b> device via self-assembly. With the presence of surface/subsurface oxygen vacancies, non-volatile bipolar resistive switching was achieved through the formation of oxygen vacancy filament under external electric field; (ii) Design of CeO 2 nanowire based core-shell structure with enhanced carbon monoxide (CO) catalytic activity. With a strong synergistic interaction near the heterogeneous interface, the CO catalytic performance was significantly improved and further optimized by modifying the composition of core-shell structure; (iii) Engineering of the oxygen defects in CeO 2 nanostructures through doping was investigated in detail. On the one hand, the increased oxygen vacancy concentration of CeO 2 nanorods by tin (Sn) dopant made a contribution to the improved catalytic efficiency and tuneable resistance switching characteristics. On the other hand, a morphology-dependent doping effect was found in zinc (Zn) doped CeO 2 nanostructures where more homogenous Zn doping was achieved in nanocubic isotropic 3 -D structure compared with the anisotropic nanorod structure, resulting in better catalytic performances. This work provides a systematic study on engineering cerium oxide based nanocrystals with enhanced physical and chemical properties which enable an alternative way to tune the morphology and defects in oxide nanocrystals with multi-functionalities...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{approach has been}} used to optimise the fabrication process of pentacene-based nonvolatile organic <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> <b>memory</b> transistors (OTFMTs) operating at low programming voltages. In {{the first part of this}} work, reliable, reproducible and hysteresis free organic metal-insulator-semiconductor (OMIS) devices and organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) were fabricated and characterised. All devices were based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(vinyl phenol) (PVP) as the organic insulators. The second part of this work focused on optimising the evaporation parameters to fabricate high-performance pentacene-based devices. About 50 nm thickness of pentacene film with a deposition rate of 0. 03 nm s- 1 on 300 nm of PMMA was found to produce large, uniform and condense grains leading to high quality devices. OTFTs with high mobility of 1. 32 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1, on/off current ratio of 106, and negligible hysteresis and leakage current were demonstrated. The effect of the environment on the OTFTs obehaviour was also investigated. The bias stress effect was also investigated in terms of threshold voltage shift ΔVT at various conditions and times. The results show ΔVT increases with the increase of stress voltage. A negligible hysteresis is evident between the forward and reverse direction of the transfer characteristics and the shape of the transfer characteristics does not change with the bias stress. Floating gate memory structures with thin layer of gold, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were fabricated and characterised during this investigation. Hysteresis in memory structures was a clear indication of the memory effect and charge storage in these devices. Also, the hysteresis was centred close to 0 V for SWCNTs-based structures, which indicate that a low operation voltage is needed to charge the devices. A memory window of about 40 V was observed for AuNPs-based memory devices based on PVP; while the memory windows for devices based on PMMA with thin layer of Au and AuNPs floating gates were 22 V and 32 V, respectively. The electrical properties of the OTFMTs were improved by the use of the Au nanoparticles as the floating gate compared with that of an Au thin film. Using appropriate negative or positive voltages, the floating gate was charged and discharged, resulting in a clear shift in the threshold voltage of the memory transistors. Negative and positive pulses of 1 V resulted in clear write and erase states, respectively. Additionally, these organic memory transistors exhibited rather high carrier mobility of about μ = 0. 319 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1. Furthermore the data retention and endurance measurements confirmed the non-volatile memory properties of the memory devices fabricated in this study...|$|E

Each rotation is restricted only to 90 °, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. The influence of space charge is also included. For large thickness, the simulation result agrees with the trend observed in most experiments that the coercive field decreases with thickness.
