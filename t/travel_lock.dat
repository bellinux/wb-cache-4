500|$|The {{pilot model}} was {{built at the}} Aberdeen Proving Ground in May 1942. The 57mm Gun M1 was mounted in the M12 recoil {{mechanism}} and installed on a tubular pedestal. The tubular pedestal was soon replaced with a conical structure that was designated the [...] "57mm gun mount T5". The gun on the pilot model had a traverse of 27.5 degrees {{either side of the}} centerline (total of 55 degrees), while having an elevation of +15 to -5 degrees. The short-barrelled (43 caliber) British Mark III 6-pounder gun was installed in the pilot, but the longer-barrelled (50 caliber) 57mm Gun M1 was specified for the production models. The original <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> – to hold the gun in a fixed position when the vehicle was moving – proved to be unsatisfactory, and was replaced by a <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> on the front hood.|$|E

50|$|The {{ordnance}} is {{fitted with}} a fume extractor and a double-baffle muzzle brake. When travelling, the ordnance is held in position by a <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> that is mounted on the forward part of the glacis plate and this is remotely operated from the crew compartment.|$|E
50|$|As the forend {{reaches the}} rear and begins to move forward, the {{elevator}} lifts up the shell, lining {{it up with the}} barrel. As the bolt moves forward, the round slides into the chamber, and the final portion of the forend's <b>travel</b> <b>locks</b> the bolt into position. A pull of the trigger will fire the next round, where the cycle begins again.|$|R

50|$|Early IS-2s can be {{identified}} by the 'stepped' front hull casting with its small, opening driver's visor. The early tanks lacked gun tube <b>travel</b> <b>locks</b> or anti-aircraft machine guns and had narrow mantlets. According to Steven Zaloga, the IS-2 and Tiger I could knock each other out in normal combat distances below 1000 m. At any range, the performance of each tank against each other was dependent on the crew and combat situation.|$|R
50|$|The Sholef's 155mm/52 gun is an {{original}} design created by Soltam, though it bears a resemblance to South Africa's G5 Howitzer. It has a fume extractor and muzzle brake, and is kept stationary by a <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> while {{the vehicle is}} on the move. This gun has a maximum rate of fire of 9 rounds/min, and a range in excess of 40,000 m when firing an ERFB-BB round. Though loaded automatically, the gun may be cycled and fire manually if the need arises. While the gun is normally carried by a <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> as with most other self-propelled howitzers while the Sholef is on the move, the weapon is stabilized and can actually be used for direct-fire while the vehicle is moving, giving it much greater self-defense capability than most other vehicles of its type.|$|E

5000|$|After July 1943, the appliqué armor bosses on {{the hull}} {{side of the}} M10A1 were deleted as the armor kits were never manufactured. This meant that some M36s had the {{redundant}} bosses, while others did not. The M36 initially retained the M10A1's [...] "stirrup" [...] gun rest on the rear hull; crews were unhappy {{about the lack of}} a proper <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> for the 90 mm gun, and many improvised their own from travel locks taken from tanks. As the massive muzzle blast of the 90 mm gun obscured the crew's vision and reduced the rate of fire, a double-baffle muzzle brake was fitted to all vehicles after the first 600, beginning in early November 1944. A proper folding <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> better-suited to the 90 mm gun was added to the rear hull at about this time. The gun itself was also modified with a better equilibrator and more powerful elevating mechanism.|$|E

50|$|Travel Sentry {{was founded}} in 2003. The first locks {{manufactured}} to the Travel Sentry Approved standards went on sale on November 12, 2003.

50|$|In late 1944, the stepped hull {{front was}} {{replaced}} with an improved single casting of 120 mm thickness angled at 60 degrees. This new nose lacked the opening driver's visor. It is sometimes incorrectly {{referred to as the}} IS-2M, but that designation actually refers to a much later modernization program from the 1950s. Other minor upgrades included the addition of a <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> on the hull rear, wider mantlet and, on very late models, an anti-aircraft machine gun.|$|E
5000|$|Incorporated 27 Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) mid-life improvements. Most notably, {{the long}} barreled 155 mm M185 cannon {{in the new}} M178 gun mount, {{ballistic}} protection for the panoramic telescope, counterbalanced <b>travel</b> <b>lock,</b> {{and the ability to}} mount the M140 alignment device. Stowage increased from 28 rounds of 155 mm, to 36 rounds; [...]50cal ammunition remained at 500 rounds. During M109A2 production, a slightly simplified version was also produced for export. This had minor internal changes and deleted the hull flotation feature. These were designated M109A1B.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the main}} gun was {{intended}} to engage enemy armoured fighting vehicles it could only traverse 8° {{to the left and}} right, depress 15° and elevate 10°. A muzzle brake was fitted to reduce recoil forces and a <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> was fitted on the front deck to secure the gun during movement. For self-defense the crew carried three 9 mm machine pistols with 576 rounds of ammunition. A Selbstfahrlafetten-Zielfernrohr (Sfl.Z.F.) 1 sight was used by the gunner, a binocular Turmspähfernrohr (T.S.F.) periscope was fitted for use by the commander,and each loader was provided with a binocular Scherenfernrohr on a pivoting arm.|$|E

50|$|The 155 mm/52 calibre Panter {{howitzer}} {{is mounted}} on a conventional split-trail carriage. When in the travelling position the 155 mm/52 calibre ordnance is traversed through 180° and locked in position over the closed trails. The <b>travel</b> <b>lock</b> {{is mounted on}} the right trail. Mounted on the forward part of the carriage is an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) that enables the 155 mm/52 calibre Panter to propel itself at a maximum speed of 18 km/h. When deployed in the firing position the weapon is supported on a circular baseplate mounted under the carriage and the two trails {{each of which is}} provided with a spade. When deployed in the firing position, the four main roadwheels are raised clear of the ground. Each trail leg has a small wheel to assist in bringing the weapon into the firing position. These are also used in conjunction with the four main wheels when the weapon is being used in its self-propelled mode. The sighting system, as well as the laying equipment, is mounted on the left side, where the seat for the layer is provided. The 155 mm/52 calibre Panter is used in conjunction with the locally developed Aselsan BAIKS-2000 Field Artillery Battery Fire Direction system.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} first order and second order wave {{generation}} techniques are utilized {{to study the}} correct generation of mono and bichromatic waves in the OEB. For a flat bottom wave basin when the interaction between two frequencies are considered bounded sub harmonics or bounded low frequency waves are generated at the difference frequency and bounded super harmonics or bounded high frequency waves are generated at the sum frequency and they <b>travel</b> <b>locked</b> with their generating / fundamental wave components along with some unwanted free waves. These free waves are, free waves due to first order motion of the wave boards, free wave due to displacement of the wave board from its zero position and free wave due to local disturbances. These unwanted free waves are inevitable due to the linear motion of the wave maker. The second order wave generation technique includes second order board motion and correction components of the above-mentioned unwanted free waves. In this study only sub-harmonics or low frequency wave components are considered. Total 14 wave probes are used to capture the data in the wave tank. A NRC-IOT code (LWAVE) is used to isolate the primary waves, the bounded waves and the unwanted free waves from the measured data at each wave probe. The measured data are analyzed in this paper to illustrate {{the differences in the}} waves generated by two different generation techniques. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

5000|$|The short recoil action {{dominates the}} world of {{centerfire}} semi-automatic pistols, being found in nearly all such weapons chambered for 9×19mm Parabellum or higher-powered cartridges (weaker cartridges, [...]380 ACP and below, generally use the blow-back method of operation). Short recoil operation differs from long recoil operation in that the barrel and bolt recoil together only a short distance before they unlock and separate. The barrel stops quickly, and the bolt continues rearward, compressing the recoil spring and performing the automated extraction and feeding process. During the last portion of its forward <b>travel,</b> the bolt <b>locks</b> into the barrel and pushes the barrel back into battery.|$|R
