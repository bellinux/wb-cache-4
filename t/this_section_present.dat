40|$|The current {{decade has}} been a period of reduced resources, tight {{competition}} for students, uneven demand for faculty from various specialties, and a more stable and mature professoriate. Colleges and universities are searching for models and programs {{to enable them to}} turn threatening conditions into opportunities for change and progress. The resistance to change is sometimes strong, and new perspectives and ideas can be helpful in breaking the log jam of resistance. The four papers in <b>this</b> <b>section</b> <b>present</b> perspectives that can be valuable in promoting individual and organizational vigor. Each perspective has roots in human development or organizational development disciplines; each proposes attitudes and knowledge common to many faculty development efforts; and each offers the possibility of making a difference to individuals and groups...|$|E

40|$|The {{findings}} {{presented in}} <b>this</b> <b>section</b> <b>present</b> the partisan voting intentions of voters {{for the year}} 2000 congressional races. Not surprisingly, the findings presented here {{are similar to the}} partisan identification findings presented in the previous section. Figure 12. 1 shows that among American voters, homeowners {{are much more likely to}} vote for Republicans than renters (34 % to 18 %), while renters are more likely to vote for Democrats than homeowners (44 % to 35 %). Breaking down housing into more specific groupings, Figure 12. 2 reveals that homeowners with mortgages and without mortgages are similar in terms of their partisan voting intentions, while renters with rent control are more likely to vote for Democrats than any of the other housing groups. Interestingly, a surprisingly hig...|$|E
30|$|Several initiatives, both in {{scientific}} and in application environments, {{have been developed}} {{in the last few}} years with the aim of exploiting information available on social media during emergencies. Works proposed in the literature either describe working systems employing solutions for some of the fundamental challenges of emergency management, or focus on a single specific challenge and thoroughly study it. The systems surveyed in <b>this</b> <b>section</b> <b>present</b> different degrees of maturity. Some have been deployed and tested in real-life scenarios, while others remain under development (Imran et al. 2015). The vast majority of these systems share goals or functionalities with the framework we are proposing and can be mapped, totally or in part, on the architecture subsequently defined. Among the proposed systems some approaches are tailored to suit requirements of a specific kind of emergency and are therefore domain-specific. Overall, many of the surveyed works present shortcomings regarding their reusability.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{vulnerability}} often occurs in climate change research and literature. It is understood that vulnerable groups are particularly affected by {{climate change and}} thus, mitigation and adaptation measures regarding climate change need to address these vulnerable groups. The policy briefs in <b>this</b> <b>section</b> <b>present</b> different approaches and measures to deal with climate change from vulnerability and adaptation perspectives. Linda Johansson points out that adaptation measures are often not tackling the issues deeply enough and that transformational change is {{needed in order to}} address the roots of climate change issues. Digging somewhat deeper into vulnerability, Sara Litzell points out the importance of including most vulnerable groups in climate change adaptation measures. Her brief focuses on gender as women, especially in developing countries, are particularly vulnerable to climate change, {{but at the same time}} women present a great potential to contribute to community-based adaptation as they are very knowledgeable with regard to processes and changes in their local regions. The importance of local knowledge also plays a major roles in Sophie Lindstrand's brief, which focuses on UN-REDD. She points out that REDD projects can be most successful if local stakeholders are effectively included and projects follow and bottom-up approach. Sigrid Nilsson's brief focuses on the importance of biodiversity conservation with regard to climate change. She points out that ecosystems do not follow national borders and that biodiversity conservation measures accordingly require global solutions.  Climate Science and Policy masterkur...|$|E
