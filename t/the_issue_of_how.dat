5|$|Modern {{commentators}} of Thucydides, {{with other}} modern historians and writers, take varying stances on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> {{much of the}} speeches of Pericles, as given by this historian, do actually represent Pericles' own words {{and how much of}} them is free literary creation or paraphrase by Thucydides. Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations, no historians are able to answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.|$|E
5|$|In the {{anthropomorphic}} form, Varaha {{often has}} a stylized boar face, like the zoomorphic models. The snout may be shorter. The position {{and size of}} the tusks may also be altered. The ears, cheeks and eyes are generally based on human ones. Early sculptors in Udayagiri and Eran faced <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to attach the boar head to the human body and did not show a human neck. However, in Badami, the problem was resolved by including a human neck. While some sculptures show a mane, it is dropped and replaced by a high conical crown - typical of Vishnu iconography - in others. Varaha sculptures generally look up to the right; there are very rare instances of left-facing Varaha depictions.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Charles's reign, <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> far the English Reformation should {{progress}} was constantly {{brought to the}} forefront of political debate. Arminian theology emphasised clerical authority and the individual's ability to reject or accept salvation, and was consequently viewed as heretical and a potential vehicle for the reintroduction of Roman Catholicism by its Calvinist opponents. Charles's sympathy to the teachings of Arminianism, and specifically his wish to move the Church of England away from Calvinism in a more traditional and sacramental direction, were perceived by Puritans as irreligious tendencies. In addition, Charles's Protestant subjects followed news of the European war closely and grew increasingly dismayed by Charles's diplomacy with Spain and his failure to support the Protestant cause abroad effectively.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the many}} {{contentious}} {{issues facing the}} First Congress during its inaugural session was <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to raise revenue for the federal government. There were both domestic and foreign Revolutionary War-related debts, {{as well as a}} trade imbalance with Great Britain that was crippling American industries and draining the nation of its currency. The first effort to begin addressing these issues resulted in the Tariff of 1789, authorizing the collection of duties on imported goods. Signed into law by the president on July 4, 1789, the act established the United States Customs Service and its ports of entry. One year later, the Revenue-Marine was established when Washington signed legislation authorizing construction of ten cutters to enforce federal tariff and trade laws and to prevent smuggling. Until Congress established the Navy Department in 1798, it served as the nation's only armed force afloat. Renamed a century later as the Revenue Cutter Service, it and the U.S. Life-Saving Service were merged in 1915 to form the United States Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|Like all metal type revivals, {{reviving}} Gill Sans {{in digital}} form raises several decisions of interpretation, such as <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> {{to compensate for the}} ink spread that would have been seen in print at small sizes more than larger. As a result, printed Gill Sans and its digital facsimile may not always match. The digital release of Gill Sans, like many Monotype digitisations, has been criticised, in particular for excessively tight letter-spacing and lack of optical sizes: with only one design released that has to be used at any text size, it cannot replicate the subtlety of design and spacing of the metal type, for which every size was drawn differently. In the hot metal era the structure of the font varied by size as is normal for metal type, with wider spacing and other detail changes at smaller text sizes. In the phototype period Monotype continued to offer two or three sizes of master, but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital. To replicate this, it is necessary to make manual adjustment to spacing to compensate for size changes, such as expanding the spacing and increasing the weight used at smaller sizes.|$|E

Lois is furious about everyone's lust for perverted TV, as she is concerned over <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> children will be influenced by his programming (in the episode's DVD release, Peter and Cleveland, in a parody of Jackass, defecate on top of Lois' car). Brian then tells Lois that parents and legal guardians {{are the ones who}} should take full responsibility for what kids watch on TV and also points out that there are much worse influences besides TV. Regardless of that, Lois calls the FCC to have PTV shut down. This prompts Peter, Brian, and Stewie to perform an elaborate musical number about how insane the FCC's regulations are. Despite being impressed with the song, the arriving FCC representatives shut down PTV. When Peter tells the FCC representatives that while they can censor television they can't stop people from being who they are or how they live their lives, they decide to take on the challenge.|$|E

40|$|The next {{generation}} wireless network will provide not only voice but also data services. With {{the success of}} the Internet, it is widely believed that IP will become the foundation of {{next generation}} wireless networks. With the help of IETF standardization, IP-based wireless networks can benefit from existing and emerging IP related technologies and services. One key issue is how to provide uninterrupted, reliable and efficient data services to a mobile node (MN) in wireless networks. This dissertation concerns two major system-support mechanisms in future all-IP based wireless networks, namely, mobility management and service management. Mobility management addresses <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to track and locate a mobile node efficiently. Service management addresses <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to efficiently deliver services to mobile nodes. This dissertation aims to design and analyze integrated mobility and service management schemes for future all-IP based wireless systems. We propose and analyze peruser regional registration schemes for integrated mobility and service management with the goal to minimize the network signaling and packet delivery cost in future all-IP based wireless networks. We show that, when given a set of parameters characterizing the operational an...|$|R

However, some astronomers postulate that close binary central stars might be responsible for the more complex and extreme planetary nebulae. Several have been shown to exhibit strong magnetic fields, and their interactions with ionized gas could explain some planetary nebulae shapes.|$|E
