5000|$|There is {{some debate}} among the WHO, CDC, and {{infectious}} disease experts over which diseases {{are classified as}} neglected tropical diseases. Feasey, a researcher in neglected tropical diseases, notes 13 neglected tropical diseases: ascariasis, Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, dracunculiasis, hookworm infection, human African trypanosomiasis, Leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, trachoma, and <b>trichuriasis.</b> [...] Fenwick recognizes 12 [...] "core" [...] neglected tropical diseases: ascariasis, Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, dracunculiasis, human African trypanosomiasis, Leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, trachoma, and <b>trichuriasis.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Trichuriasis</b> (whipworm infection), {{sometimes}} {{considered as}} an alternative to mebendazole and sometimes considered to be the drug of choice. Only a single dose of albendazole is needed. It can also be given with ivermectin.|$|E
50|$|Albendazole, {{also known}} as albendazolum, is a {{medication}} used {{for the treatment of}} a variety of parasitic worm infestations. It is useful for giardiasis, <b>trichuriasis,</b> filariasis, neurocysticercosis, hydatid disease, pinworm disease, and ascariasis, among others. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
5000|$|Research shows that, if widely practiced, {{hand washing}} with soap could reduce {{diarrhea}} by almost fifty percent and respiratory infections by nearly twenty-five percent [...] Hand washing with soap also reduces {{the incidence of}} skin diseases, eye infections like trachoma and intestinal worms, especially ascariasis and <b>trichuriasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum {{antiparasitic}} agent, traditionally against parasitic {{worms and}} other multicellular parasites. It is mainly used in humans {{in the treatment}} of onchocerciasis (river blindness), but is also effective against other worm infestations (such as strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, <b>trichuriasis,</b> filariasis and enterobiasis), and some epidermal parasitic skin diseases, including scabies.|$|E
50|$|Whipworm {{infection}} affected about 464 {{million in}} 2015. It is {{most common in}} tropical countries. In the developing world, those infected with whipworm often also have hookworms and ascariasis infections. They have a large effect on the economy of many countries. Work is ongoing to develop a vaccine against the disease. <b>Trichuriasis</b> is classified as a neglected tropical disease.|$|E
50|$|Limited {{access to}} {{essential}} medicine poses {{a challenge to}} the eradication of <b>trichuriasis</b> worldwide. Also, it is a public health concern that rates of post-treatment re-infection need to be determined and addressed to diminish the incidence of untreated re-infection. Lastly, with mass drug administration strategies and improved diagnosis and prompt treatment, detection of an emergence of antihelminthic drug resistance should be examined.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trichuriasis</b> can be {{diagnosed}} when T. trichiura eggs are detected in stool examination. Eggs will appear barrel-shaped and unembryonated, having bipolar plugs and a smooth shell. Rectal prolapse can {{be diagnosed}} easily using defecating proctogram {{and is one}} of many methods for imaging the parasitic infection. Sigmoidoscopy show characteristic white bodies of adult hanging from inflamed mucosa (coconut cake rectum).|$|E
50|$|<b>Trichuriasis</b> {{is caused}} by a {{parasitic}} worm also known as a helminth called Trichuris trichiura. It belongs to the genus Trichuris, formerly known as Trichocephalus, meaning hair head, which would be a more accurate name; however the generic name is now Trichuris, which means hair tail (implying that the posterior end of the worm is the attenuated section). Infections by parasitic worms are known as helminthiasis.|$|E
5000|$|The human whipworm (Trichuris trichiura or Trichocephalus trichiuris) is a round worm (a type of helminth) {{that causes}} <b>trichuriasis</b> (a type of {{helminthiasis}} {{which is one}} of the neglected tropical diseases) when it infects a human large intestine. It is commonly known as the whipworm which refers to the shape of the worm; it looks like a whip with wider [...] "handles" [...] at the posterior end.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trichuriasis,</b> {{also known}} as whipworm {{infection}}, is an infection by the parasitic worm Trichuris trichiura (whipworm). If infection is only with a few worms, there are often no symptoms. In those who are infected with many worms, there may be abdominal pain, tiredness and diarrhea. The diarrhea sometimes contains blood. Infections in children may cause poor intellectual and physical development. Low red blood cell levels may occur due to loss of blood.|$|E
50|$|Although {{colonoscopy}} is {{not typically}} used for diagnosis, as the adult worms can be overlooked, especially with imperfect colon, {{there have been}} reported cases in which colonoscopy has revealed adult worms. Colonoscopy can directly diagnose <b>trichuriasis</b> by identification of the threadlike form of worms with an attenuated, whip-like end. Colonoscopy {{has been shown to}} be a useful diagnostic tool, especially in patients infected with only a few male worms and with no eggs presenting in the stool sample.|$|E
5000|$|The {{diseases}} considered neglected tropical diseases vary. Malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis {{have received}} {{an amount of}} public attention and increased funding to no longer be considered neglected by some researchers. Outside [...] "The Big Three", the seven most prevalent neglected tropical diseases in order of their global prevalence are ascariasis, <b>trichuriasis,</b> hookworm infection, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and trachoma. [...] These seven are among a larger list of thirteen major NTDs: onchocerciasis, leishmaniasis, Chagas' disease, leprosy, Human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), Dracunculiasis, and Buruli ulcer.|$|E

50|$|In Europe, {{a similar}} trend is seen. Neglected {{tropical}} diseases {{are concentrated in}} eastern and southern Europe, where poverty levels are the highest. The most prevalent diseases in this region are ascariasis, <b>trichuriasis,</b> zoonotic helminth infections, and visceral leishmaniasis. Migration paths to Europe, most notably to Spain, have brought diseases to Europe as well. As many as 6,000 cases of Chagas disease have been introduced via this method. In response to a growing awareness to the burden on these populations, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has laid out ten public health guidelines. They cover a variety of topics, from health education and promotion to community partnerships {{and the development of}} a minority healthcare workforce.|$|E
50|$|The {{disease is}} usually spread when people eat food or drink water that {{contains}} the eggs of these worms. This may occur when contaminated vegetables are not fully cleaned or cooked. Often these eggs are in the soil in areas where people defecate outside and where untreated human feces is used as fertilizer. These eggs originate from the feces of infected people. Young children playing in such soil and putting their hands in their mouths also become infected easily. The worms live in the large bowel and are about four centimetres in length. Whipworm is diagnosed by seeing the eggs when examining the stool with a microscope. Eggs are barrel-shaped. <b>Trichuriasis</b> belongs {{to the group of}} soil-transmitted helminthiasis.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{worldwide}} distribution of Trichuris trichiura, {{with an estimated}} 1 billion human infections. However, it is chiefly tropical, especially in Asia and, to a lesser degree, in Africa and South America. Within the United States, infection is rare overall but may be common in the rural Southeast, where 2.2 million people {{are thought to be}} infected. Poor hygiene is associated with <b>trichuriasis</b> as well as the consumption of shaded moist soil, or food that may have been fecally contaminated. Children are especially vulnerable to infection due to their high exposure risk. Eggs are infective about 2-3 weeks after they are deposited in the soil under proper conditions of warmth and moisture, hence its tropical distribution.|$|E
50|$|Coinfection of T. trichiura {{with other}} parasites is common and with larger worm burdens can cause both {{exacerbation}} of dangerous <b>trichuriasis</b> {{symptoms such as}} massive gastrointestinal bleeding (shown to be especially dramatic with coinfection with Salmonella typhi) and exacerbation of symptoms and pathogenesis of the other parasitic infection (as is typical with coinfection with Schistosoma mansoni, in which higher worm burden and liver egg burden is common). Parasitic coinfection with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria is also common, especially in Sub-saharan Africa, and helminth coinfection adversely affects the natural history and progression of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria and can increase clinical malaria severity. In a study performed in Senegal, infections of soil-transmitted helminths like T. trichiura (as well as schistosome infections independently) showed enhanced risk and increased the incidence of malaria.|$|E
50|$|In pigs T. suis egg {{production}} is sporadic, complicating diagnosis by fecal flotation. Necropsy of clinical cases of <b>trichuriasis</b> {{may be necessary}} to validate a diagnosis, since clinical signs may develop prior to patency, thus inhibiting diagnosis by fecal examination alone. On gross necropsy, the intestine may be filled with semisolid to watery to bloody mucoid feces, depending on acuteness of the infection and simultaneous bacterial infections. The anterior portion of adult worms may be observable breaching the cecal and colonic mucosa. Inflammatory nodules may be seen adjacent to the adults where they penetrate the mucosa. In earlier infections, the nodules may suggest pre-erupted larvae beneath the mucosa. Depending on the acuteness of infection, there is generalized moderate to severe typhlitis and colitis. In severe infections, the walls of the intestine may be thickened and a necrotic membrane may be located {{on the surface of the}} mucosa.|$|E
40|$|SummaryTrichuriasis is soil-source {{parasitic}} disease, usually endemic in warm, humid, tropical and subtropical countries. We {{report a}} case of <b>trichuriasis</b> diagnosed by colonoscopy performed in a non-endemic area and review {{the literature on the}} colonoscopic diagnosis of Trichuris trichiura spanning 22 years (1989 – 2011) in mainland China. A total of 4382 <b>trichuriasis</b> cases were diagnosed by colonoscopy out of 41   337 patients who underwent colonoscopy. Most of the patients were cured by unloading the whipworms using colonoscopy pincers. We strongly suggest colonoscopy as a useful diagnostic and treatment tool, especially when the patient is lightly infected or is infected by only a few male worms with no eggs in the stool. The geographical distribution, parasite burden, and the parasitizing locations of T. trichiura in the intestine of the human body were analyzed, and the clinical signs and symptoms, as well as the utility of colonoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of <b>trichuriasis</b> are discussed...|$|E

40|$|<b>Trichuriasis</b> {{is caused}} by various species of Trichuris, {{nematode}} parasites in the family Trichuridae. These parasites are also known as whipworms. Both larval and adult whipworms are normally found only in the intestines. They do not undergo tissue migration. Most human cases are caused by Trichuris trichiura, a parasite of humans and some non-human primates. Zoonotic <b>trichuriasis</b> {{is caused by}} the animal parasites Trichuris vulpis and Trichuris suis. Adult T. vulpis and T. suis are found occasionally in the intestinal tract of humans. Very rare cases of T. vulpis visceral larva migrans have been reported. Other species of Trichuris are also found in animals, but have not, to date, been reported in humans...|$|E
40|$|<b>Trichuriasis,</b> or whipworm, {{is among}} the most {{prevalent}} of all the helminthic parasites of man-kind; a conservative estimate is that more than half a billion individuals are infected [1]. A recent survey of the literature suggested that there are 2. 2 million individuals with <b>trichuriasis</b> in the con-tinental United States, mainly in the rural south-east. A large-scale study in Puerto Rico revealed a 75 % infection rate in six-year-old children. Trichuris trichiura has an exceedingly simple life cycle, in which ingested eggs hatch in the small bowel and the larvae pass directly down into their final habitat in the colon. The head of the worm is embedded in the mucosa, from which it appears to take up minute amounts of blood. Most indi-viduals with <b>trichuriasis</b> have relatively light in-fections of no clinical significance. Heavy infec-tions, which occur mainly in young children, may result in some disease manifestations. Whereas treatment in the past has been inadequate, an effective nontoxic drug has recently been de-veloped. Life Cycle Adult T. trichiura (males, 38 mm in length; fe-males, 43 mm) have a relatively long, attenuated, whip-like anterior portion and a shorter, thicker, handle-like posterior end [1]. The normal habitat of the worms is the cecum and ascending colon, but in heavy infections they may be found throughout the entire large bowel. The anterior tip of the parasite is inserted into the intestinal tissues, This article on <b>trichuriasis</b> is the ninth of several in-stallments that are being published in The Journal dur-ing 1975 and 1976.
