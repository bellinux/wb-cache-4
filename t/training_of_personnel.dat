In this regard, the article describes dual education system in Germany where educators have accumulated valuable experience in specialized <b>training</b> <b>of</b> nursing <b>personnel.</b> It must be noted that dual education system is divided into theoretical and practical components, whereas theoretical component assumes out-service training and priority practical component - in-service training.

The peculiarities <b>of</b> specialized <b>training</b> <b>of</b> geriatric nursing <b>personnel,</b> health and nursing professionals, health and pediatric nursing personnel have been considered. Special attention has been paid to the fact that new names for nursing professions linguistically highlight a more extensive approach to nursing.
