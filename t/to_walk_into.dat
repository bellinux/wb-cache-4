5|$|Eddie {{returns to}} {{challenge}} Fats again, putting up his entire $3,000 stake {{on a single}} game. He wins game after game, beating Fats so badly that Fats is forced to quit. Bert demands a share of Eddie's winnings and threatens that Eddie will be injured unless he pays. But Eddie says that {{if he is not}} killed he will kill Bert when he recovers; invoking the memory of Sarah, he shames Bert into giving up his claim. Instead, Bert orders Eddie never <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> a big-time pool hall again. Eddie and Fats compliment each other as players, and Eddie walks out.|$|E
5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as {{it is widely believed}} to be the first painting, since the fall of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. If you were <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> the painting, you could walk around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} match, Jeff Jarrett (accompanied by the Roadie) defended his Intercontinental Championship against Shawn Michaels. The match first {{went back and}} forth, with both Michaels and Jarrett taking control for certain periods. The first highspot occurred when Jarrett backdropped Michaels over the top rope to the arena floor. Throughout the match, the Roadie distracted the referee, allowing Jarrett to perform illegal tactics to gain an advantage. Michaels managed to escape a sleeper hold minutes later, gaining {{the upper hand in}} the process. After several highspot moves by Michaels, The Roadie shook the ring-ropes while Michaels was on the top rope, grounding Michaels in the process. Jarrett attempted to regain the advantage by performing the Figure four leglock, but Michaels reversed the hold into a near-fall. Jarrett went for the submission hold again, but Michaels shoved him into the referee, sending the official to the ground. Michaels tried to seize the advantage with a Superkick, but the Roadie grabbed Michaels. Jarrett performed a Crossbody, getting a near-fall in the process. The finish to the match came when the Roadie accidentally tripped Jarrett. Jarrett got back up only <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> Michaels's Superkick. Michaels pinned him and became Intercontinental Champion. It was revealed later in the show that Jarrett and The Roadie were involved in a backstage confrontation with each other, signaling an end to their on-screen friendship.|$|E

500|$|Although the 16th century works {{improved}} Gibraltar's defences significantly, {{they still}} had major shortcomings. Fernandez del Portillo noted in 1610 that while Gibraltar was [...] "girt by quite a good wall with bastions at corners", there still remained {{work to be done}} to complete the fortification plans that had been drawn up in the previous century. He felt that [...] "perhaps what does exist is enough to withstand an assault and more." [...] The biggest weakness was the lack of an effective sea wall to resist naval bombardments, and in 1618 Philip III of Spain authorised works to create a new mole for a deep-water harbour, protected by a newly constructed gun platform and the Torre del Tuerto fort. Philip IV subsequently ordered a major modernisation of Gibraltar's fortifications due to hostile activity in the Strait by the Protestant powers of northern Europe – particularly England and the Dutch Republic. On visiting Gibraltar in 1624, the king found that his carriage could not fit through the Landport Gate.

500|$|Thompson has {{heavily criticized}} {{a number of}} video games and campaigned against their {{producers}} and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as [...] "murder simulators" [...] to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games {{and a number of}} school massacres. According to Thompson, [...] "In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers." [...] Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, [...] "If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing , one has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, {{but when it comes to}} kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain." [...] Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as [...] "Pearl Harbor 2".

[...] Hoskins listed the songs [...] "Falling Down," [...] "Power Trip," [...] "Lord Have Mercy," [...] and [...] "I Know" [...] as some of the best tunes, and called [...] "Lucky Ones" [...] a [...] "perfect song." [...] New Release Tuesday called Gravity one of the most anticipated releases of the year. In its review, the site gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, stating that the recording in many ways lives up to the anticipation, but had three or four too many songs that detract from the album's whole. Rapzilla was very favorable to the album, rating it four-point-five out of five and calling it the most important album in the history of Christian hip hop. The reviewer, Armond Goss, listed the tracks [...] "Lord Have Mercy", [...] "Fakin'", and [...] "Buttons" [...] the low points on the album, but said that those were the only problems that they found. [...] "Confe$$ions", [...] "Power Trip", and [...] "Gravity" [...] were all listed by as extremely strong, but Goss considered the track [...] "Mayday" [...] as the best [...] track [...] "sonically, lyrically and conceptually" [...] on the album, stating that DJ Khalil's production work [...] "provides the perfect backdrop for K.R.I.T. <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> your church in the middle of service and express his frustrations with hypocrisies and for Crae to walk in behind him and calm the mob down while still co-signing K.R.I.T.’s verse." [...] The Houston Press summarized the album by stating that [...] "by and large, Gravity acts and dresses like a stand along rap album built from the same organ drenched and string heavy foundation that Houston's style of G-funk did in the '90s.
