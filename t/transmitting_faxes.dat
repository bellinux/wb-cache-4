5000|$|A {{redirector}} {{may include}} a modem emulator {{that allows the}} application to use [...] "AT" [...] modem commands even though no physical modem is present. The [...] "number" [...] dialed is an IP address, and the connection is a TCP network connection instead of a modem telephone call. This type of redirector is generally used by applications in originating client software needs to use a modem but the destination for the connection is a network endpoint. Back-to-back operation {{of this type of}} redirector can, in some cases, function as a replacement for modems on two computers for some applications. Network effects on timing of the data stream generally preclude the use of this method for <b>transmitting</b> <b>faxes.</b> Additionally, this method is also not reliable if used for PPP connections (such as dial-up networking) due to architectural limitations of TCP, a topic discussed in technical literature related to TCP-over-TCP.|$|E

50|$|That evening, Telstar 1 also relayed {{the first}} {{telephone}} call transmitted through space, and it successfully <b>transmitted</b> <b>faxes,</b> data, and both live and taped television, {{including the first}} live transmission of television across an ocean from Andover, Maine, US to Goonhilly Downs, England and Pleumeur-Bodou, France. (An experimental passive satellite, Echo 1, {{had been used to}} reflect and redirect communications signals two years earlier, in 1960.) In August 1962, Telstar 1 became the first satellite used to synchronize time between two continents, bringing the United Kingdom and the United States to within 1 microsecond of each other (previous efforts were only accurate to 2,000 microseconds).|$|R
50|$|The T.38 fax relay {{standard}} was devised in 1998 {{as a way}} to permit faxes to be transported across IP networks between existing Group 3 (G3) fax terminals. T.4 and related fax standards were published by the ITU in 1980, before the rise of the Internet. In the late 1990s, VoIP, or Voice over IP, began to gain ground {{as an alternative to the}} conventional Public Switched Telephone Network. However, because most VoIP systems are optimized (through their use of aggressive lossy bandwidth-saving compression) for voice rather than data calls, conventional fax machines worked poorly or not at all on them due to the network impairments such as delay, jitter, packet loss, and so on. Thus, some way of <b>transmitting</b> <b>fax</b> over IP was needed.|$|R

50|$|Error {{correction}} mode (ECM) is {{an optional}} transmission mode built into Class 1/2/2.0 fax machines or fax modems. ECM automatically detects and corrects {{errors in the}} fax transmission process that are sometimes caused by telephone line noise. The page data is divided into {{what is known as}} Octets (small blocks of data). Once the receiver has received all the Octets it examines them (using check-sums) and then advises the <b>transmitting</b> <b>fax</b> of any Octets that are in error. The transmitter then need only resend the blocks in error rather than the whole page. This generally means an ECM coded fax {{will be more likely to}} succeed on a noisy line. ECM is the norm rather than the exception. Some fax machines have the capability to enable or disable this function.|$|R
5000|$|The Toronto-based gateway {{was created}} by Dr. Robert Riley through Internet service {{provider}} Planet Communications. When email was sent {{to one of the}} designated addresses, the text was <b>transmitted</b> as <b>fax</b> to a designated party such as a Canadian government agency. For example, an email sent to ontatg@chicken.planet.org was converted to a fax transmission to the Attorney General of Ontario. The service initially lacked a formal domain name, therefore email routing of the form [...] "utgpu!plan9!chyk!" [...] was required until late 1993.|$|R
5000|$|As well as {{specifying the}} {{resolution}} (and allowable physical {{size of the}} image being faxed), the ITU-T T.4 recommendation specifies two compression methods for decreasing the amount of data {{that needs to be}} <b>transmitted</b> between the <b>fax</b> machines to transfer the image.

5000|$|There are {{two primary}} ways that fax {{transactions}} are conveyed across packet networks. The T.37 standard specifies how a fax image is encapsulated in e-mail and transported, ultimately, to the recipient using a store-and-forward process through intermediary entities. T.38, however, defines a protocol {{that supports the}} use of the T.30 protocol in both the sender and recipient terminals. (See diagram above.) T.38 lets one <b>transmit</b> a <b>fax</b> across an IP network in real time, just as the original G3 fax standards did for the traditional (time-division multiplexed (TDM)) network, also called the public switched telephone network or PSTN.|$|R
50|$|IP fax is {{frequently}} confused with Internet fax, though IP <b>fax</b> <b>transmits</b> data over an office intranet from a networked multi-functional device to the IP address of another.Taking {{advantage of an}} established LAN/WAN infrastructure, IP fax reduces or eliminates costly connection and transmission fees. T.38 is a commonly used and recommended transmission standard used for IP fax.|$|R

50|$|It is also {{possible}} for the recipient of a junk fax to bring a private suit against the violator in an appropriate court of their state. Through a private suit, the recipient can either recover the actual monetary loss that resulted from the TCPA violation, or receive $500 in damages for each violation, whichever is greater. The court may triple the damages for each violation if it finds that the defendant acted willingly or knowingly. The FCC and/or the FTC can impose additional civil penalties of up to $11,000.00 per <b>fax</b> <b>transmitted.</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: General {{practitioners}} {{working in}} remote {{and rural areas}} sometimes need consultation with cardiologists. One practical and cost-effective way is transmission of patients’ electrocardiographic images via ordinary fax machine to the cardiologists, {{but there is an}} important question that how much agreement exists between the diagnoses made by reading an original electrocardiogram and its copy <b>transmitted</b> via <b>fax.</b> Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 60 original electrocardiographic images were given to cardiologists for diagnosis. In the next step those electrocardiographic images were faxed to the hospital through a simple cheap fax machine, one month later the same cardiologist was asked to put his diagnosis on the copied versions of electrocardiographs, and the results were compared. Results: In 59 studied cases, the two method of diagnoses were exactly the same and only in one case the diagnoses were different. Therefore, Kappa agreement coefficient was calculated as 96 %. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, general practitioners working in deprived areas can be certainly recommended to send patients’ electrocardiographic images to the cardiologists via fax in the case of needing consultation...|$|R

50|$|The French Legislature and Council of State {{authorized}} {{a permanent}} line between Paris and Marseille. In England they authorized an experimental line between London and Liverpool for a four-month period. Napoleon bought Caselli's pantelegraph {{as a public}} service and put into place for the transmission of images from Paris to Lyon. It was in place until the defeat of Sedan in 1870. Russian Tsar Nicolas I put in an experimental service in place between his palaces in Saint Petersburg and Moscow between 1851 and 1855. In {{the first year of}} operation of the pantelegraph the system <b>transmitted</b> almost 5,000 <b>faxes,</b> with a peak of faxes being sent at the rate of 110 per hour. In spite of all this, the technology developed so slowly to make it fully reliable that it fell into oblivion. Caselli ultimately gave up on his invention and returned to Florence where he died. It was another 100 years before Caselli's technology became popular.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background While it is {{recommended}} that records are kept between primary care providers (PCPs) and specialists during patient transitions from hospital to community care, this communication is not currently standardized. We aimed to assess the transmission of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program intake transition records to PCPs and to explore PCPs' needs in communication with CR programs and for intake transition record content. Method 144 PCPs of consenting enrollees from 8 regional and urban Ontario CR programs participated in this cross-sectional study. Intake transition records were tracked from the CR program to the PCP's office. Sixty-six PCPs participated in structured telephone interviews. Results Sixty-eight (47. 6 %) PCPs received a CR intake transition record. Fifty-eight (87. 9 %) PCPs desired intake transition records, with most wanting it <b>transmitted</b> via <b>fax</b> (n = 52, 78. 8 %). On a 5 -point Likert scale, PCPs strongly agreed that the CR transition record met their needs for providing patient care (4. 32 ± 0. 61), with 48 (76. 2 %) reporting that it improved their management of patients' cardiac risk. PCPs rated the following elements as most important to include in an intake transition record: clinical status (4. 67 ± 0. 64), exercise test results (4. 61 ± 0. 52), and the proposed patient care plan (4. 59 ± 0. 71). Conclusions Less than half of intake transition records are reaching PCPs, revealing a large gap in continuity of patient care. PCP responses should be used to develop an evidence-based intake transition record, and procedures should be implemented to ensure high-quality transitional care. </p...|$|R
