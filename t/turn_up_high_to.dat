50|$|The {{turbulence}} {{of classical}} fluids is an everyday phenomenon, {{which can be}} readily observed {{in the flow of}} a stream or river. When turning on a water tap, one notices that at first the water flows out in a regular fashion (called laminar flow), but if the tap is <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> flow rates, the flow becomes decorated with irregular bulges, unpredictably splitting into multiple strands as it spatters out in an ever-changing torrent, known as turbulent flow. Turbulent flow comprises randomly sized regions of circulating fluid called eddies and vortices, which can be ordered, giving rise to large-scale motions such as tornados or whirlpools, but in general are completely irregular.|$|R
50|$|Ramon Sender co-produced the Trips Festival with Ken Kesey and Stewart Brand. It was {{a three-day}} event that, in {{conjunction}} with The Merry Pranksters, brought together the nascent hippie movement for the first time. The Trips Festival {{was held at the}} Longshoreman's Hall in San Francisco in January 1966. Counterculture sound engineer Ken Babbs is mostly credited for the sound systems he created for the Trips Festival. Prior to Babbs’ creation, it was discovered that particular music usually sounded distorted when cranked <b>to</b> <b>high</b> levels because of the cement floor on the San Francisco Longshoreman’s Union Hall (where the Trips Festival was taking place). Babbs being a sound engineer resolved the problem. He made sound amplifiers that would not create distorted sounds when <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>high</b> sound levels.|$|R
5000|$|The SVT amps with 6146B tubes tend {{to put out}} a {{bit more}} watts of power as well as have a more {{pronounced}} grind in low mids that makes these amps desirable for some bass players. The 6550A version of SVT amps tends to have a more rounder deeper bass sound.. Mainly due to the output transformer primary inductance with respect to plate resistance..The 6146 is much lower in transconductance and is less sensitive to drive signal, thus needs a bigger voltage swing to drive than a 6550... another reason the 6146 amps have more growl than its 6550 counterpart is because the pre-amp is <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> a bit <b>higher</b> <b>to</b> achieve the equivalent power output swing, thus more [...] "grind" [...] (fuzz bass) can be obtained from the preamp.|$|R

40|$|The slow {{development}} of {{active safety systems}} of the automobile all-wheel drive vehicles {{is the cause of}} lack of researches in the field of power distribution under the specific conditions of movement. The purpose of work is to develop methods to control a curvilinear motion of 4 x 4 cars with a link to the rear axle that provides the increase in directional and trajectory stability of the car. The paper analyses the known methods to increase wheeled vehicles movement stability. It also offers a method for power flow redistribution in the transmission of the car 4 x 4 with a link to the rear axle, providing the increase in directional and trajectory stability of the car. To study the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method a mathematical model of the moving car 4 x 4 with a link to the rear axle is developed. Simulation methods allowed us to establish the following: 1. for car 4 x 4 with redistribution of torque between the driving axles in the range of 100 : 0 - 50 : 50 and with redistribution of torque between the wheels of the rear axle in the range of 0 : 100 the most effective are the stabilization algorithms used in combination “Lowing power consumption of the engine +Creation of stabilizing the moment due to the redistribution of torque on different wheels", providing the increase in directional and trajectory stability by 12 [...] . 93 %; 2. for car 4 x 4 with redistribution of torque between the driving axles in the range 100 : 0 - 0 : 100 and with redistribution of torque between the wheels of the rear axle in the range of 0 : 100 the best option is a combination of algorithms "Lowing power consumption of the engine + Creation of stabilizing moment due to redistribution of torques on different wheels", providing the increase in directional and trajectory stability by 27 [...] . 93 %. A comparative analysis of algorithms efficiency of dynamic stabilization system operation for two-axle wheeled vehicles depending on the torque redistribution between the driving axles in the range 100 : 0 - 0 : 100 and 100 : 0 - 50 : 50 shows that the efficiency of 100 : 0 - 0 : 100 control options in a <b>turn</b> is <b>higher</b> (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 12 %), than in case of 100 : 0 - 50 : 50 because of the great range of torque regulation on driving axles. </p...|$|R
