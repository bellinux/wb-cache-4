To date, improved strength and ductility for <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> can be achieved in amorphous structure and nano/ultrafine/fine-grained size regime obtained by several kinds of materials forming methods. In this chapter, a material forming method by coupling spark plasma sintering with crystallization of amorphous phase, fabricating <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> with excellent mechanical properties, was reviewed systematically. By appropriate annealing of sintered amorphous alloy in bulk form prepared from spark plasma sintering at the supercooled liquid region of a mechanically alloyed amorphous alloy powder, crystallized phase with controllable grain size, phase morphology and distribution can be precipitated from the amorphous phase (or sintered amorphous <b>alloy),</b> and therefore, <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> with matrix of amorphous phase or crystallized phase as well as improved strength and ductility were obtained. Meanwhile, sintering parameters affect significantly microstructure and mechanical property of fabricated bulk <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys.</b> Facture mechanism of fabricated <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys</b> under stress was explained based on a proposed 2 ̆ 2 Developed Hard-soft Model 2 ̆ 2.

40|$|AbstractNot {{too long}} ago, {{the authors found}} that {{twinning}} {{can be a very}} slow process (i. e. many orders of magnitude lower than the speed of sound) and contribute to low-temperature (< 0. 25 Tm) creep deformation behavior in single-phase HCP <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys.</b> Since then, {{it has been shown that}} this time-dependent twinning behavior can also be found in BCC <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys.</b> Furthermore, the time-dependent twinning was also found to play a significant role in the two-phase α + β <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys.</b> The extent of twinning and its contribution to creep behavior was found to depend on the grain size in the single-phase <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys.</b> In regard to single-phase beta alloys, the stability of the beta-phase was also found to play a significant role in twinning behavior. With respect to the two-phase α + β <b>titanium</b> <b>alloys,</b> twinning was found to depend on the morphology and volume fraction of the phases and stability of the beta phase.

25|$|Titanium is a {{metal that}} has a better strength-to-weight ratio, is more wear resistant, and more {{flexible}} than steel. Although less hard and unable to take as sharp an edge, carbides in the <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> {{allow them to be}} heat-treated to a sufficient hardness. Ceramic blades are hard, brittle, and lightweight: they may maintain a sharp edge for years with no maintenance at all, but are as fragile as glass and will break if dropped on a hard surface. They are immune to common corrosion, and can only be sharpened on silicon carbide sandpaper and some grinding wheels. Plastic blades are not especially sharp and typically serrated. They are often disposable.|$|E
25|$|Linerlock {{mechanisms}} are most commonly composed of <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> or steel. The linerlock's locking side liner is split {{from the top}} toward the bottom, similar to an automotive leaf spring (also called a lock bar) that butts up against the tang of the blade to prevent the blade from closing. In an interview with Blade in 1988, Walker stated, “This long leaf-spring effect cuts down on stress on the locking mechanism". As the lock on the original electrician's knife was mostly to hold a screwdriver blade open (the knife blade, itself was secured by a slip joint method), Walker's refinements prevented the knife blade from closing on the user's hand and converted it into a true lock.|$|E

25|$|Burying engines {{deep inside}} the {{fuselage}} also minimizes the thermal visibility or infrared signature of the exhaust. At the engine intake, cold air from the boundary layer below the main inlet enters the fuselage (boundary layer suction, first tested on the Northrop X-21) and is mixed with hot exhaust air just before the nozzles (similar to the Ryan AQM-91 Firefly). According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, this results in less energy (thermal radiation in the infrared spectrum) being released and thus a reduced heat signature. The resulting cooler air is conducted over a surface composed of heat resistant carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer and <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> elements, which disperse the air laterally, in order to accelerate its cooling. The B-2 lacks afterburners as the hot exhaust would increase the infrared footprint; breaking the sound barrier would produce an obvious sonic boom as well as aerodynamic heating of the aircraft skin which would also increase the infrared footprint.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation found}} Flight 55 caused {{the crash of}} Air France Concorde Flight 4590 in Paris.

The tires then exploded and tire rubber fragments penetrated Concorde's wing fuel tanks, starting fires in engines 1 and 2, leading to the crash which killed all aboard and four people on the ground. According to the official report on the accident, the strip of metal installed on the Continental jet was made from a different alloy than had {{been approved by the}} US Federal Aviation Administration or the engine manufacturer.

When tolerances and clearances are the tightest, these designs are completed as hot operational geometry and deflected back into the cold geometry as required for manufacturing.

25|$|The launch {{from the}} {{submarine}} occurs below the sea surface. The missiles are ejected from their tubes by igniting an explosive charge {{in a separate}} container which is separated by seventeen <b>titanium</b> <b>alloy</b> pinnacles activated by a double alloy steam system. The energy from the blast is directed to a water tank, where the water is flash-vaporized to steam. The subsequent pressure spike {{is strong enough to}} eject the missile out of the tube and give it enough momentum to reach and clear the surface of the water. The missile is pressurized with nitrogen to prevent the intrusion of water into any internal spaces, which could damage the missile or add weight, destabilizing the missile. Should the missile fail to breach the surface of the water, there are several safety mechanisms that can either deactivate the missile before launch or guide the missile through an additional phase of launch. Inertial motion sensors are activated upon launch, and when the sensors detect downward acceleration after being blown out of the water, the first-stage motor ignites. The aerospike, a telescoping outward extension that halves aerodynamic drag, is then deployed, and the boost phase begins. When the third-stage motor fires, within two minutes of launch, the missile is traveling faster than 20,000ft/s (6,000m/s), or 13,600mph (21,600km/h).|$|E
