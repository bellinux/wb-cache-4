50|$|Abrasive saw: A {{saw that}} cuts with an {{abrasive}} disc or band, {{rather than a}} <b>toothed</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{serrated}} blade {{is a type}} of blade used on saws and on some knives or scissors. It is {{also known}} as a dentated, sawtooth, or <b>toothed</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Abrasive saw: a {{circular}} or reciprocating saw-like tool with an abrasive disc {{rather than a}} <b>toothed</b> <b>blade,</b> commonly used for cutting very hard materials. As {{it does not have}} regularly shaped edges the abrasive saw is not a saw in technical terms.|$|E
5000|$|The leaves have lobed or <b>toothed</b> <b>blades</b> a few centimeters long, {{the lower}} on short {{petioles}} and those {{higher on the}} plant with wide bases that clasp the stem.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} a colonial {{perennial}} herb producing stems up to 2.5 feet tall. The oppositely arranged leaves have elongated, <b>toothed</b> <b>blades.</b> The flower is 1 or 2 inches wide. It is pink, purple, or white with yellow or orange anthers. The fruit {{is a red}} urn-shaped capsule containing brownish seeds.|$|R
50|$|This {{plant is}} a shrub which can reach 4 meters in height. The leaves have green, <b>toothed</b> <b>blades</b> up to 3.8 centimeters long. The flowers are red or magenta. The upper petals are erect, but the lower two are curved under. The {{shape of the}} flower {{indicates}} it is pollinated by birds, which is unique among the geraniums.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sabre saw}} (also saber saw) is a {{hand-held}} powered reciprocating saw. It is similar to, but larger than, a jigsaw. The sabre saw uses a <b>toothed</b> <b>blade,</b> chiefly {{to cut through}} wood and other soft materials. The term 'sabre saw' is occasionally also {{used to refer to}} Sawzall style hand-held reciprocating saws.|$|E
5000|$|A {{cold saw}} is a {{circular}} saw designed to cut metal {{which uses a}} <b>toothed</b> <b>blade</b> to transfer the heat generated by cutting to the chips created by the saw blade, allowing both the blade and material being cut to remain cool. This is contrast to an abrasive saw, which abrades the metal and generates {{a great deal of}} heat absorbed by the material being cut and saw blade.|$|E
50|$|Micranthes nidifica is {{a species}} of saxifrage known by the common name peak saxifrage. It is native to the northwestern United States, where it grows in moist habitat, often in mountainous areas. It is a {{perennial}} herb growing from a caudex and system of rhizomes and producing a basal rosette of leaves. Each leaf is up to 10 centimeters long with a smooth-edged or minutely <b>toothed</b> <b>blade</b> on a thin petiole. The inflorescence arises on a peduncle up to half a meter tall and bears clusters of flowers with white petals.|$|E
5000|$|It {{grows in}} {{many types of}} habitat, {{including}} disturbed areas, and often in moist spots. It is an annual herb producing a branching stem up to about 60 centimeters in maximum height. The stem is squared in cross-section and it is covered in rough hairs. The oppositely arranged leaves have hairy, serrated or <b>toothed</b> <b>blades</b> up to 2 or 3 centimeters long which are borne on short petioles.|$|R
2500|$|The mandibles and the maxillae {{are used}} for {{piercing}} the skin. The mandibles are pointed, while the maxillae end in flat, toothed [...] "blades". To force these into the skin, the mosquito moves its head backwards and forwards. On one movement, the maxillae are moved as far forward as possible. On the opposite movement, the mandibles are pushed deeper into the skin by levering against the maxillae. The maxillae do not slip back because the <b>toothed</b> <b>blades</b> grip the skin.|$|R
50|$|This annual or {{biennial}} herb has a branching stem up to 1.2 meters tall. It is hairless {{and generally}} waxy in texture. The basal leaves have lobed or <b>toothed</b> <b>blades</b> on long petioles, {{and the leaves}} higher on the stem have smooth or toothed edges. The inflorescence is a raceme of flowers and bracts. Each flower has a bell-shaped calyx of sepals and four purple petals which may be nearly 2 centimeters long. The fruit is a long, flattened silique up to 14.5 centimeters in length.|$|R
50|$|The Allen Scythe {{does not}} {{resemble}} a hand scythe but serves the same purpose. The engine drives a 2 ft or 3 ft or 4ft wide <b>toothed</b> <b>blade</b> sliding {{back and forth}} horizontally across stationary teeth to produce a scissor action, and also drives two large wheels for forward travel. There are handles to allow the machine {{to be controlled by}} an operator walking behind it, controls comprise throttle and clutch. Separate ratchets allow either one or both wheels to be driven. In normal use only one is engaged so that turning is easier. The machines are extremely robust and many from the 1950s are still in regular use. They can be dangerous, as the clutch system only disengages the wheel drive from the engine: the blades cut all the time the engine runs.|$|E
50|$|Hubbell Incorporated {{was founded}} as a {{proprietorship}} in 1888 by Harvey Hubbell II. Born in connecticut in 1859, {{he was a}} U.S. inventor, entrepreneur and industrialist. His best-known inventions are the U.S. electrical plug and the pull-chain light socket. He is {{graduated from high school}} and began working for companies that manufactured marine engines and printing machinery. During this time, he accumulated several ideas for new inventions, and in 1888 he set out on his own, opening a small manufacturing facility in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Hubbell's first product was taken from his own patent for a paper roll holder with a <b>toothed</b> <b>blade</b> for use in stores that sold wrapping paper. This cutter stand became a tremendous success; it was a common feature of retail stores that used wrapping paper in the early 1900s and remained in wide use into the late 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Machine shears, {{known as}} handpieces, {{operate in a}} similar manner to human hair {{clippers}} in that a power-driven <b>toothed</b> <b>blade,</b> known as a cutter, is driven {{back and forth over the}} surface of a comb and the wool is cut from the animal. The original machine shears were powered by a fixed hand-crank linked to the handpiece by a shaft with only two universal joints, which afforded a very limited range of motion. Later models have more joints to allow easier positioning of the handpiece on the animal. Electric motors on each stand have generally replaced overhead gear for driving the handpieces. The jointed arm is replaced in many instances with a flexible shaft. Smaller motors allowed the production of shears in which the motor is in the handpiece; these are generally not used by professional shearers as the weight of the motor and the heat generated by it becomes bothersome with long use.|$|E
2500|$|The Maglemosian {{people lived}} in forest and wetland environments using fishing and hunting tools made from wood, bone and flint microliths. A {{characteristic}} of the culture are the sharply edged microliths of flintstone which were used for spear heads and arrowheads. Microliths finds are more sparse from c. 6000 BC and the period is said to transit into the Kongemose culture (c. 6000 BC [...] c. 5200 BC). The finds from this period are characterised by long flintstone flakes which were used for making the characteristic rhombic arrowheads, scrapers, drills, awls and <b>toothed</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is a {{perennial}} herb producing {{one or more}} erect stems up to half a meter tall from a thick caudex and fibrous root system. The basal leaves have thick, <b>toothed</b> <b>blades</b> up to 4 centimeters long, and those higher on the stem have smaller, more dissected leaves. The inflorescence bears a single flower head or an umbel-shaped array of up to 6 heads. Each head has green to reddish or purplish phyllaries, many disc florets, and often several ray florets. The florets may be most any shade of red, orange, or yellow.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} a {{perennial}} herb which grows as a branching vine. The leaves are oppositely arranged at swollen nodes on the stem. They have triangular or heart-shaped, sometimes <b>toothed</b> <b>blades</b> up to 15 centimeters long by 11 wide. The flower heads are clustered in panicles. The flower head {{is about half}} a centimeter long and is enclosed in narrow, sometimes purple-tinged phyllaries. The flowers are pinkish, purplish, or white. The fruit is a dark-colored, resinous achene about half a centimeter long, including its pappus of white or purplish bristles.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, a bow saw is a {{woodworking}} tool used for straight or curved cuts. A bow saw {{is a type}} of frame saw. Its thin blade is held in tension by a frame. In English and American vocabulary it denotes a <b>toothed</b> <b>blade</b> suspended between two long narrow handles called [...] "cheeks" [...] that are supported and separated by a thin stretcher {{in the center of the}} handles, making a wide H shape (the cheeks form the uprights of the H, the stretcher the crossbar of the H). The blade is kept in tension with a turnbuckle or a twisted cord that runs parallel to the blade between the two cheeks but on the opposite side of the stretcher. If a cord is used, the cord is twisted with a toggle attached to one loop of the cord, adding tension. The toggle hits the stretcher, which keeps the cord from untwisting. A finer version of the saw uses a narrow blade (1/4" [...] or less) with handles that allow the user to hold the saw and turn the blade. In this context it is also known as a turning saw which is larger than a coping saw.|$|E
40|$|Mexico is {{the largest}} cactus {{exporter}} {{of the world and}} 40 % of the production cost is provide d from the harvest operation. Many workers are required to operate daily and suffer wrist pain after two weeks of collecting pears with mechanical pruners. A motor driven tool supplied from a photovoltaic system was employed for harvesting; different blades were tested at different cutting speeds. It was found that <b>toothed</b> <b>blades</b> sliced the pears with efficiencies over 90 %. Abrasive blades were finally selected as the current required per cut was minimum, permitting a longer battery lifetime before requiring recharging. </p...|$|R
