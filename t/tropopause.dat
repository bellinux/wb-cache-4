5|$|Cirrus Spissatus {{clouds are}} the highest clouds of the main cloud genera. They may form in the higher <b>tropopause</b> or even at the lower stratosphere. They are dense and opaque, not {{allowing}} {{the light of the}} sun or moon to pass through. They are more common on the anvils of cumulonimbus clouds.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} basically {{describes the}} existence of the jet stream, a westerly current of air with maximum wind speeds close to the <b>tropopause</b> which is (even though other factors are also important) the result of the temperature contrast between equator and pole.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{winds are}} strongest {{immediately}} under the <b>tropopause</b> (except locally, during tornadoes, tropical cyclones or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference {{caused by the}} density difference (which ultimately causes wind) is highest within the transition zone. The wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area, but is deflected by the Coriolis effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.|$|E
5|$|Jet streams {{are fast}} flowing, narrow, {{meandering}} air currents in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth. On Earth, the main jet streams are {{located near the}} altitude of the <b>tropopause</b> and are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a meandering shape. Jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to {{the direction of the}} remainder of the jet.|$|E
5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{before the storm}} struck. This was later determined to be because of missing atmospheric sounding data, {{as well as an}} incorrect assessment of the height of the <b>tropopause,</b> which led to an underestimation of the strength of the thunderstorm which produced the tornado. Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.|$|E
5|$|Weather fronts. Significant shear is {{observed}} {{when the temperature}} difference across the front is 5°C (9°F) or more, and the front moves at 30 knots or faster. Because fronts are three-dimensional phenomena, frontal shear can be observed at any altitude between surface and <b>tropopause,</b> and therefore be seen both horizontally and vertically. Vertical wind shear above warm fronts {{is more of an}} aviation concern than near and behind cold fronts due to their greater duration.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} dust and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the <b>tropopause,</b> as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is perpetually {{covered with}} clouds {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds {{are located in}} the <b>tropopause</b> and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100m/s (360km/h) are common in zonal jets. The zones have been observed to vary in width, color and intensity from year to year, but they have remained sufficiently stable for scientists to give them identifying designations.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's {{dark spots}} {{are thought to}} occur in the {{troposphere}} at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features, so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures. Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the <b>tropopause</b> layer. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} dense cirrus at their tops. As the {{cumulonimbus}} cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze {{when the air}} temperature reaches the freezing point. The anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the <b>tropopause</b> prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the flat top. In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind as much as several kilometers.|$|E
5|$|Under a cold cyclone, 500hPa {{temperatures}} {{can fall}} {{as low as}} −30°C, which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the <b>tropopause,</b> the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was −77°C (−105°F).|$|E
5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the <b>tropopause,</b> and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5|$|In {{the mature}} {{stage of a}} thunderstorm, the warmed air {{continues}} to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this 'cap' is the <b>tropopause.</b> The air is instead forced to spread out, giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape. The resulting cloud is called cumulonimbus incus. The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become rain. If the updraft is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large {{that they do not}} melt completely but fall as hail. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating downdrafts as well. The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds. During this stage, considerable internal turbulence can occur within, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Inside a cold cyclone, 500hPa {{temperatures}} {{can fall}} {{as low as}} , which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the <b>tropopause,</b> the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was −77°C (−132°F). A recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was Epsilon of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{structural}} changes {{took place on}} January12: frontal boundaries separated from {{the core of the}} cyclone; convection developed atop the circulation; and it acquired a weak warm-core. All these factors, alongside the system being co-located with an upper-level low, indicated its transition into a subtropical cyclone by 18:00UTC. Upon doing so, the system received the name Alex. Though relatively shallow, owing to the seasonally low level of the <b>tropopause,</b> convection was deemed deep enough for classification. At this time, the subtropical storm was situated 1,150mi (1,850km) west-southwest of the Canary Islands. The trough that previously enabled the sharp southward turn later steered Alex to the east-northeast and later north-northeast. Operationally, Alex was not classified as a subtropical storm until late on January13.|$|E
5|$|Whether it be a {{depression}} in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) or monsoon trough, a broad surface front, or an outflow boundary, a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis. About 85 to 90percent of Pacific typhoons form within the monsoon trough. Even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability, {{the lack of a}} surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low. Vertical wind shear of less than 10m/s (20kn, 33ft/s) between the ocean surface and the <b>tropopause</b> is required for tropical cyclone development. Typically with Pacific typhoons, there are two outflow jets: one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the Westerlies, and a second towards the equator.|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} in Venus's troposphere follows the so-called cyclostrophic approximation. Its windspeeds are roughly {{determined by the}} balance of the pressure gradient and centrifugal forces in almost purely zonal flow. In contrast, the {{circulation in}} the Earth's atmosphere is governed by the geostrophic balance. Venus's windspeeds can be directly measured only in the upper troposphere (<b>tropopause),</b> between 60–70km, altitude, which corresponds to the upper cloud deck. The cloud motion is usually observed in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, where the contrast between clouds is the highest. The linear wind speeds at this level are about 100±10m/s at lower than 50° latitude. They are retrograde {{in the sense that they}} blow in the direction of the retrograde rotation of the planet. The winds quickly decrease towards the higher latitudes, eventually reaching zero at the poles. Such strong cloud-top winds cause a phenomenon known as the super-rotation of the atmosphere. In other words, these high-speed winds circle the whole planet faster than the planet itself rotates. The super-rotation on Venus is differential, which means that the equatorial troposphere super-rotates more slowly than the troposphere at the midlatitudes. The winds also have a strong vertical gradient. They decline deep in the troposphere with the rate of 3m/sperkm. The winds near the surface of Venus are much slower than that on Earth. They actually move at only a few kilometres per hour (generally less than 2m/s and with an average of 0.3 to 1.0m/s), but due to the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, this is still enough to transport dust and small stones across the surface, much like a slow-moving current of water.|$|E
25|$|The {{stratosphere}} is {{the middle}} layer of the Uranian atmosphere, in which temperature generally increases with altitude from 53K in the <b>tropopause</b> to between 800 and 850K at the base thermosphere. The heating of the stratosphere {{is caused by the}} downward heat conduction from the hot thermosphere as well as by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and the complex hydrocarbons formed as a result of methane photolysis. The methane enters the stratosphere through the cold <b>tropopause,</b> where its mixing ratio relative to molecular hydrogen is about 3, three times below saturation. It decreases further to about 10−7 at the altitude corresponding to pressure of 0.1mbar.|$|E
25|$|Incus is {{the most}} type-specific {{supplementary}} feature, seen only with cumulonimbus of the species capillatus. A cumulonimbus incus cloud top {{is one that has}} spread out into a clear anvil shape as a result of rising air currents hitting the stability layer at the <b>tropopause</b> where the air no longer continues to get colder with increasing altitude.|$|E
25|$|The jet streams are {{systems of}} upper-air westerlies. They {{give rise to}} slowly moving upper-air waves, with 250-knot winds in some air streams. First {{observed}} by World War II pilots, they develop just below the <b>tropopause</b> over areas of steep pressure gradient on the surface. The main types are the polar jets, the subtropical westerly jets, and the less common tropical easterly jets. They follow the principle of geostrophic winds.|$|E
25|$|Mesoscale {{meteorology}} is {{the study}} of atmospheric phenomena that has horizontal scales ranging from 1km to 1000km and a vertical scale that starts at the Earth's surface and includes the atmospheric boundary layer, troposphere, <b>tropopause,</b> and the lower section of the stratosphere. Mesoscale timescales last from less than a day to weeks. The events typically of interest are thunderstorms, squall lines, fronts, precipitation bands in tropical and extratropical cyclones, and topographically generated weather systems such as mountain waves and sea and land breezes.|$|E
25|$|A {{horizontal}} {{temperature gradient}} exists while moving North-South along a meridian because {{curvature of the}} Earth allows for more solar heating at the equator than at the poles. This creates a westerly geostrophic wind pattern to form in the mid-latitudes. Because thermal wind causes an increase in wind velocity with height, the westerly pattern increases in intensity up until the <b>tropopause,</b> creating a strong wind current known as the jet stream. The Northern and Southern Hemispheres exhibit similar jet stream patterns in the mid-latitudes.|$|E
25|$|The {{eruption}} had {{a significant}} effect on ozone levels in the atmosphere, causing a large increase in the destruction rate of ozone. Ozone levels at middle latitudes reached their lowest recorded levels, while in the southern hemisphere winter of 1992, the ozone hole over Antarctica reached its largest ever size until then, with the fastest recorded ozone depletion rates. The eruption of Mount Hudson in Chile in August 1991 also contributed to southern hemisphere ozone destruction, with measurements showing a sharp decrease in ozone levels at the <b>tropopause</b> when the aerosol clouds from Pinatubo and Hudson arrived.|$|E
25|$|Another {{fingerprint}} {{of human}} effects on climate {{has been identified}} by looking at a slice through the layers of the atmosphere, and studying the pattern of temperature changes from the surface up through the stratosphere (see the section on solar activity). The earliest fingerprint work focused on changes in surface and atmospheric temperature. Scientists then applied fingerprint methods to {{a whole range of}} climate variables, identifying human-caused climate signals in the heat content of the oceans, the height of the <b>tropopause</b> (the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, which has shifted upward by hundreds of feet in recent decades), the geographical patterns of precipitation, drought, surface pressure, and the runoff from major river basins.|$|E
25|$|Jupiter {{is covered}} with a cloud layer about 50km deep. The clouds are {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds are located in the <b>tropopause</b> and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. The best-known feature of the cloud layer is the Great Red Spot, a persistent anticyclonic storm located 22° south of the equator that is larger than Earth. In 2000, an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot, but smaller in size. The feature was named Oval BA, and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior.|$|E
25|$|The {{third most}} {{abundant}} constituent of the Uranian atmosphere is methane , {{the presence of}} which has been known for some time {{as a result of the}} ground-based spectroscopic observations. Methane possesses prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared, making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour. Below the methane cloud deck at 1.3bar methane molecules account for about 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction; about 10 to 30 times that found in the Sun. The mixing ratio is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to the extremely low temperature at the <b>tropopause,</b> which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out. Methane appears to be undersaturated in the upper troposphere above the clouds having a partial pressure of only 30% of the saturated vapor pressure there. The concentration of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere is poorly known. However, as with methane, their abundances are probably greater than solar values by a factor of at least 20 to 30, and possibly by a factor of a few hundred.|$|E
25|$|The {{atmospheric}} composition {{in the stratosphere}} is 98.4% nitrogen—the only dense, nitrogen-rich atmosphere in the Solar System aside from Earth's—with the remaining 1.6% composed of mostly of methane (1.4%) and hydrogen (0.1–0.2%). Because methane condenses out of Titan's atmosphere at high altitudes, its abundance increases as one descends below the <b>tropopause</b> {{at an altitude of}} 32km, leveling off at a value of 4.9% between 8km and the surface. There are trace amounts of other hydrocarbons, such as ethane, diacetylene, methylacetylene, acetylene and propane, and of other gases, such as cyanoacetylene, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, cyanogen, argon and helium. The orange color as seen from space must be produced by other more complex chemicals in small quantities, possibly tholins, tar-like organic precipitates. The hydrocarbons are thought to form in Titan's upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the breakup of methane by the Sun's ultraviolet light, producing a thick orange smog. Titan has no magnetic field, although studies in 2008 showed that Titan retains remnants of Saturn's magnetic field on the brief occasions when it passes outside Saturn's magnetosphere and is directly exposed to the solar wind. This may ionize and carry away some molecules {{from the top of the}} atmosphere.|$|E

500|$|Cumulonimbus {{clouds are}} the final form of growing cumulus clouds. They form when cumulus {{congestus}} clouds develop a strong updraft that propels their tops {{higher and higher}} into the atmosphere until they reach the <b>tropopause</b> at [...] in altitude. Cumulonimbus clouds, commonly called thunderheads, can produce high winds, torrential rain, lightning, gust fronts, waterspouts, funnel clouds, and tornadoes. They commonly have anvil clouds.|$|E
500|$|Neptune's {{atmosphere}} is subdivided into two main regions: the lower troposphere, where temperature decreases with altitude, and the stratosphere, where temperature increases with altitude. The {{boundary between the}} two, the <b>tropopause,</b> lies at a pressure of [...] The stratosphere then {{gives way to the}} thermosphere at a pressure lower than 10−5 to 10−4 bars (1 to 10Pa). The thermosphere gradually transitions to the exosphere.|$|E
500|$|As {{air flows}} {{radially}} inward at low levels, {{it begins to}} rotate cyclonically in order to conserve angular momentum. Similarly, as rapidly rotating air flows radially outward near the <b>tropopause,</b> its cyclonic rotation decreases and ultimately changes sign at large enough radius, resulting in an upper-level anti-cyclone. [...] The result is a vertical structure characterized by a strong cyclone at low levels and a strong anti-cyclone near the tropopause; from thermal wind balance, this corresponds to {{a system that is}} warmer at its center than in the surrounding environment at all altitudes (i.e. “warm-core”). From hydrostatic balance, the warm core translates to lower pressure at the center at all altitudes, with the maximum pressure drop located at the surface.|$|E
500|$|Polar jet streams are {{typically}} {{located near the}} 250 hPa (about 1/4 atmosphere) pressure level, or [...] above sea level, while the weaker subtropical jet streams are much higher, between [...] Jet streams wander laterally dramatically, and have large changes in their altitude. The jet streams form near breaks in the <b>tropopause,</b> at the transitions between the Polar, Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells, and whose circulation, with the Coriolis force acting on those masses, drives the jet streams. The Polar jets, at lower altitude, and often intruding into mid-latitudes, strongly affects weather and aviation. The polar jet stream is most commonly found between latitudes 30° and 60° (closer to 60°), while the subtropical jet streams are located close to latitude 30°. The northern Polar jet stream is said to [...] "follow the sun" [...] as it slowly migrates northward as that hemisphere warms, and southward again as it cools.|$|E
500|$|As human analysts {{using the}} {{technique}} lead to subjective biases, {{efforts have been}} made to make more objective estimates using computer programs, which have been aided by higher-resolution satellite imagery and more powerful computers. [...] Since tropical cyclone satellite patterns can fluctuate over time, automated techniques use a six-hour averaging period to lead to more reliable intensity estimates. [...] Development of the objective Dvorak technique began in 1998, which performed best with tropical cyclones that had eyes (of hurricane or typhoon strength). [...] It still required a manual center placement, keeping some subjectivity within the process. [...] By 2004, an advanced objective Dvorak technique was developed which utilized banding features for systems below hurricane intensity and to objectively determine the tropical cyclone's center. [...] A central pressure bias was uncovered in 2004 relating to the slope of the <b>tropopause</b> and cloud top temperatures which change with latitude that helped improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique.|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone's {{primary energy}} source is heat from the evaporation {{of water from the}} ocean surface, which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when the warm moist air rises and cools to saturation. The energetics of the system may be idealized as an atmospheric Carnot heat engine. First, inflowing air near the surface acquires heat primarily via evaporation of water (i.e. latent heat) at the temperature of the warm ocean surface (during evaporation, the ocean cools and the air warms). Second, the warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat content (latent heat is simply converted to sensible heat during condensation). Third, air outflows and loses heat via infrared radiation to space at the temperature of the cold <b>tropopause.</b> Finally, air subsides and warms at {{the outer edge of the}} storm while conserving total heat content. [...] The first and third legs are nearly isothermal, while the second and fourth legs are nearly isentropic. This in-up-out-down overturning flow is known as the secondary circulation. [...] The Carnot perspective provides an upper bound on the maximum wind speed that a storm can attain.|$|E
500|$|At the 500 hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages -7 °C (18 °F) within the tropics, but {{air in the}} tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500 hPa in a tropical atmosphere of [...] is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is , and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1 °C in the sea surface temperature for each 1 °C change at 500 hpa. Under a cold cyclone, 500 hPa temperatures can fall as low as , which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500 hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500 hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the <b>tropopause,</b> the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was -77 °C (-132 °F).|$|E
