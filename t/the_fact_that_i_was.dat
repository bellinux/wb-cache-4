500|$|Emmeline Pankhurst {{was born}} on 15 July 1858 in the Manchester suburb of Moss Side. Although her birth {{certificate}} states otherwise, she believed that her birthday was a day earlier, on Bastille Day – 14 July. Most biographies, including those written by her daughters, repeat this claim. Feeling a kinship with the female revolutionaries who stormed the Bastille, she said in 1908: [...] "I have always thought that <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born on that day {{had some kind of}} influence over my life." [...] The reason for the discrepancy remains unclear.|$|E

[...] The following year, Congress passed the Former Presidents Act, offering a $25,000 yearly pension to each {{former president}}, and it is likely that Truman's financial status {{played a role in the}} law's enactment. The one other living former president at the time, Herbert Hoover, also took the pension, even though he did not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing Truman.|$|E

[...] "I don't have any really good reason why it took so long other than <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> waiting for Michael Jackson's new album to come out," [...] Yankovic explained. Unfortunately for Yankovic, the new album hit several snags. On November 26, 1991, Michael Jackson's new album, Dangerous was released. After hearing the hit single [...] "Black or White," [...] Yankovic {{approached}} Jackson about a potential parody entitled [...] "Snack All Night."

[...] Becky Bain of Idolator thought that the performance was Clarkson's most memorable live performances while Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times thought Clarkson's performance was very solid despite the feeling that she sounded better dry than drenched. Clarkson performed the song on Saturday Night Live in 2005, along with the 2006 BRIT Awards which took place in Earls Court, London.|$|E

[...] He also added that this process of [...] "doing Audioslave business" [...] led him to go solo.

500|$|Madonna's initial work on {{the album}} had started with Shep Pettibone, who {{produced}} her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992). However, she found {{out that they were}} doing the same vein of music from the previous album, which did not please her. At the time, Madonna was a fan of Babyface's song [...] "When Can I See You" [...] (1994), and became interested in working with him, as she wanted [...] "lush ballads" [...] for her record. They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills, with [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] ending up on the album. Recalling the latter's development, the producer commented, [...] "I wasn't so much thinking about the charts. I think I was more in awe of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> working with Madonna. It was initially surreal, but then you get to know the person a little bit, and you calm down and then it's just work. And work is fun".

Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger's future as reasons for leaving, and maintained that [...] "I always said that if I ever left Arsenal {{it would be to}} play for Barcelona." [...] Despite their captain's departure, Arsenal got off to an impressive start for the 2007–08 campaign, and Henry admitted that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help. He stated, [...] "Because of my seniority, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> captain and my habit of screaming for the ball, they would sometimes give it to me even when I was not in the best position. So in that sense it was good for the team that I moved on." [...] Henry left Arsenal as the club's leading all-time league goalscorer with 174 goals and leading all-time goalscorer in European competitions with 42 goals; in July 2008, Arsenal fans voted him as Arsenal's greatest player ever in Arsenal.com's Gunners' Greatest 50 Players poll.|$|E
