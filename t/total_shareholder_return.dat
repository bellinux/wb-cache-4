40|$|Regardless of {{the strong}} {{theoretical}} justification {{for the use of}} relative performance evaluation in setting executive compensation, previous empirical results supporting relative performance evaluation are mixed. This study contributes to the existing literature by analyzing implicit relative performance evaluation in a specific form of compensation, performance share plans. Implicit relative performance evaluation is studied with the single-year relative performance evaluation model used also in the previous research, in addition to which an adjusted long-term relative performance evaluation model is developed to account for longer term (3 -year) performance and to extend the analysis also to other executives besides the chief executive officer (CEO). The proprietary and unique data cover all the performance share plans ever used (per August 2012) in Finnish companies listed on the Nasdaq OMX Helsinki stock exchange. A total of 87 companies and 543 share plan lots are included in the initial sample. The sample for the adjusted long-term relative performance evaluation analysis consists of 53 companies and 179 performance share plan lots. The sample for the single-year relative performance evaluation analysis includes a total of 167 performance share plan lots in 42 companies which correspond to 125 single-year changes. The data include observations from year 2000 to August 2012. Although the Finnish companies do not usually use explicit relative performance evaluation in their performance share plans, the empirical evidence presented in this study indicates that companies use short-term as well as long-term implicit relative performance evaluation with respect to <b>total</b> <b>shareholder</b> <b>returns</b> in their performance share plans. Furthermore, CEO performance {{is more likely to be}} evaluated relative to industry performance than market performance. Relative performance evaluation is used either by implicitly setting the stock market based performance targets to a level which takes industry performance into account or by adjusting the number of granted shares from year to year. Although I find that relative performance evaluation with respect to <b>total</b> <b>shareholder</b> <b>returns</b> is used in performance share plans, no evidence of the use of relative performance evaluation with respect to ROA is found either in the single-year analysis or the adjusted long-term analysis. The results also show that performance share plan payout ratios are positively and statistically significantly associated with company performance even when the performance is measured during three years instead of one year which is the most common earning period length...|$|R

40|$|Audit Committees (ACs) {{have become}} more {{important}} and prevalent since the initial corporate governance reforms of the mid- 2000 s. In their expanded roles, ACs have become {{a key player in}} their entity’s suite of corporate governance mechanisms which are intended to protect the interest of the shareholders and reduce the shareholder-manager agency conflicts. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the role effectiveness of ACs’ governance characteristics in achieving desired levels of quality and independence for the internal and external auditing functions of listed companies in Australia. However, achieving this role effectiveness of ACs will require agency costs. So this study also investigates whether higher audit-related agency monitoring costs result in higher <b>returns</b> to <b>shareholders.</b> This study uses cross-sectional data and mainly applies multiple regressions to test the five hypotheses. The sampling frame for this study is top 300 companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) for the financial year ending in 2010. A total of 255 companies are drawn from the sampling frame on an elimination basis. There are two stages of data collection employed. Questionnaires are administered to the Chief Internal Auditors (CIA) of the sampled companies while financial, accounting and market data are obtained from online databases. There are several findings from this study. First, in terms of AC’s governance characteristics and the role of AC overseeing the quality of the internal audit function, only AC size is significantly positively associated with financial resources devoted to the internal audit function while both AC expertise and AC size are significantly related to internal audit function labour hours. Second, in terms of AC’s governance characteristics and the AC’s role of ensuring the independence of the internal audit function, no attributes of AC’s governance characteristics have a significant impact on internal audit function independence. Third, in terms of AC’s governance characteristics and the role of AC facilitating the quality of the external audit, AC size and AC frequency of meetings are significantly related to external audit fees. Fourth, in terms of AC’s governance characteristics and the role of AC ensuring the independence of external auditors, both AC size and frequency of meetings are significantly negatively related to non-audit fees. Finally, in terms of audit-related agency monitoring costs and <b>total</b> <b>shareholders</b> <b>return,</b> AC fees are significantly related to <b>total</b> <b>shareholders</b> <b>return.</b> To provide a more in-depth analysis of the key AC’s governance characteristics that are found in the regression analysis to be significant, a comparative case study between two different companies is performed. The results are generally supportive. In conclusion, the various findings of this study have important implications for regulators of corporate governance, professional accounting/auditing bodies, shareholders, board of directors and scholarly researchers. This study highlights the significant relationship between an AC’s governance characteristics and its effectiveness in fulfilling its roles in the internal audit function and also external auditing. Finally, this study contributes to current auditing-related governance literature by introducing a comprehensive empirical model along with statistical measure for AC’s governance characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Agency theory {{proposes that}} the role of the board of {{directors}} is to control management (Fama & Jensen 1983). A structurally independent board, one with a high percentage of non-executive directors and a chairperson who is not the CEO, has been used as a proxy for the control role. Therefore, agency theory predicts a positive relationship between independent board structure and firm performance. These predictions have not been confirmed by meta-analytic reviews (Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand, & Johnson 1998; Rhoades, Rechner, & Sundaramurthy 2000). This thesis applies structural contingency theory to provide an alternative explanation for the relationship between board structure and firm performance. Structural contingency theory (Donaldson 2001) proposes that the relationship between an organizations structure and its performance is moderated by contingencies. In this study the contingency is the salience of the boards control role. I argue that structural independence of the board has a beneficial effect on performance only if it is in fit with control salience. For example, a firm with an independently structured board that gives high prominence to the control role will perform well. On the other hand, another firm with a less independently structured board that does not see its main role as controlling management will also prosper. Survey data were analyzed to measure the control salience for 98 Australian listed companies. Archival data provided measures of board structure and firm performance. Consistent with the meta-analytic reviews, there was no association between independent board structure and firm performance. There was some evidence that high control salience resulted in high performance, but this effect was evident chiefly when performance was measured by <b>total</b> <b>shareholder</b> <b>returns.</b> This may indicate that the share market was responding to the symbolism of high control salience. In contrast to the symbolic main effect of control salience, the fit between the control salience and the independent structure of the board caused increased return on equity. This reflects the boards objective effect on profit when its structure is in fit with control salience...|$|R

To do this, a listed company’s <b>total</b> <b>shareholder</b> <b>return</b> (TSR) is compared with the TSR of a customised, relevant peer group.
