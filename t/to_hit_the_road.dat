25|$|With a {{successful}} album and single behind them, Mississippi decided <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> To fill out their live sound, {{the band was}} enhanced {{by the addition of}} top musicians including Beeb Birtles (an ex-member of the band Zoot, he had emigrated as a child from The Netherlands to Goble's home town of Adelaide) and drummer Derek Pellicci. The first appearance of the expanded Mississippi took place on 28 October 1972 at Corbould Hall, Ballarat. With various personnel changes, but always including Goble, Birtles and Pellicci, Mississippi would go on to notch up over 400 live performances in 1972–74.|$|E
500|$|Bryan's announcement, after {{gaining the}} Democratic nomination, {{that he would}} {{undertake}} a nationwide tour by rail, something then unusual for presidential candidates, put pressure on McKinley to match him. Hanna especially urged his candidate <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> McKinley decided against this, feeling {{that he could not}} outdo Bryan, who was a brilliant stump speaker, and that he would be foolish to try. [...] "I might as well put up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete against some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to think when I speak." [...] Furthermore, no matter how McKinley traveled, Bryan would upstage him by choosing a less comfortable manner. McKinley was unwilling to compete with Bryan on the Democrat's terms, and sought to find his own way to reach the people.|$|E
2500|$|Vagrant {{organized}} a national tour with every band on its label, sponsored by corporations including Microsoft and Coca-Cola, {{during the summer}} of 2001. Its populist approach and use of the internet as a marketing tool made it one of the country's most-successful independent labels and helped popularize the word [...] "emo". According to Greenwald, [...] "More than any other event, it was Vagrant America that defined emo to masses—mainly because it had the gumption <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and bring it to them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Plans for a joint tour were {{conceived}} by Hole's management company, Q Prime, during the band's stint at the 1999 Big Day Out music festival in Australia [...] {{in order to}} support their third studio album Celebrity Skin. Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson admitted that the band itself had [...] "anxiously been awaiting" [...] their first full-scale U.S. tour for some time, but their previous attempts [...] "kept falling apart because we couldn't find someone to tour with". Erlandson said he was [...] "just psyched <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> with anybody". Hole frontwoman Courtney Love {{toyed with the idea of}} touring with Canadian pop rock singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette in the press. During an interview on Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM, Love claimed her opinions on Morissette had changed. She had previously maligned Morissette's pop work as being [...] "too commercial [...] to ever be considered a genuine feminist symbol". Nevertheless, Love, who was one of the most prominent and prolific figures of feminist music in the 1990s, began to see Morissette as a positive influence on female empowerment.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his search}} for new work, Stern found an advertised {{position}} in Radio & Records for a morning host at WWWW, a struggling rock station in Detroit, Michigan. His aircheck was well received by management who made an offer, but Douglas advised Stern against the move and suggested to wait for an offer from a better station. Stern went ahead regardless and accepted a deal, starting on April 21, 1980. He thought of new ways to improve his show and to be more open on the air, [...] "to cut down the barriers ... strip down all the ego ... and be totally honest". His efforts paid off with his first industry recognition, winning a Billboard Award for Album-Oriented Rock Personality of the Year For a Major Market and the debut Top Five Talent Search contest in the album-oriented rock category from radio syndication firm Drake-Chenault, which then distributed the winning radio segments to stations across the country. Despite the success, WWWW continued to decline in the ratings and failed to overtake the three more popular rock stations in the area. The quarterly Arbitron ratings released in January 1981 {{showed no signs of}} a strong audience, causing the station to change formats overnight from rock to country music, to Stern's surprise and annoyance. He lasted a further two weeks before [...] "it was time <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> again. Somehow, I couldn't see myself as Hopalong Howie". He declined offers to work at WXRT in Chicago and CHUM in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.|$|E

Facels could either be ordered with the Pont-à-Mousson built four-speed manual, or the Chrysler built Torqueflite three-speed automatic. Contemporary road tests showed, that they performed equally well with either gearbox.

2500|$|In late October 2001 Superheist {{embarked}} {{on their first}} US tour. With US management duties taken up by Gary Avila or Bigtime Management Paparoach the band based themselves in West Hollywood. Their first live show was a showcase at SIR Studios in Hollywood {{in front of a}} packed room full of record company executives and journalists. Superheist had come to America with a huge hype, and the industry was out in force to see what the buzz was all about. The band played a tight and energetic set. The onlookers suitably impressed. Over the next few weeks a bidding war began for the signature of the band and a US record deal. With commitments back in Australia, the band left America a flew home on 5 September 2001. On 11 September 2001 a devastating terrorist attack on New York’s twin towers effectively all negotiations and communication with perspective record labels was lost until February 2002. By then all the interest in signing Superheist was gone. This was a defining moment for Supeheist. The band felt they had missed their calling. Unrest set in amongst some members. Even still, song writing continued. Norton moving the sound away from [...] "rap rock" [...] to a more straight rock metal sound. This did not sit well with vocalist Berger. Further strain on the relationship occurred as Berger distanced himself from the band. In a board meeting set up by management Berger stated he would [...] "only play the big shows and the band would be dropped by the record company should he decide to leave". In mid-November Superheist was set <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> with the launch of the Channel V Music Bus. The night before the tour was to begin, the band was played a warm-up show at an all ages event at Berwick youth centre. Mcleod claimed to be unwell on the night and refused to go on stage, the event was sold out and Superheist refused set to cancel the show at the last minute. The band desperately looked for a fill in vocalist. They first approached Wes from Another Race and then finally Joey Biro from one of the earlier supports, From the Inside, not only did Joey know all the Superheist songs, delivered an amazing performance that shocked the crowd and the band. Berger refuse to go on the Channel V Music Bus tour so Superheist invited Joey Biro to be his replacement for the shows. The next few days Biro stayed on with the band and launched the channel V music bus through regional Victoria and NSW. With live national TV broadcasts revealing a fill in singer and shocking fans across the country. During the chaotic week, played out on national television, it became clear {{to the rest of the}} band that McLeod no longer shared the commitment and enthusiasm and the band no longer trusted him as their lead singer. He was given a final ultimatum and after consultation with management and record label was fired from the band and replaced by Biro that same week. In 2002 Superheist was to play every major festival in Australia including a main stage slot on the coveted BIG DAY OUT. The shows were a huge success with Biro winning over the fans with his heartfelt performances and powerful voice.|$|E

5000|$|An art car {{community}} {{began to}} cohere in the 1990s, inspired by movies and books {{with a wide}} underground following, {{and the development of}} innovative art display venues such as Burning Man. One of the main forces behind this is filmmaker and art car artist Harrod Blank, who created the art car documentaries Wild Wheels (1992), Driving The Dream (1998) and Automorphosis (2009). He also published two books Wild Wheels(1993, 2001) and Art Cars: the cars, the artists, the obsession, the craft (2002, 2007, 2012) Blank also co-founded with Philo Northrup the U.S.'s second largest art car festival in the San Francisco Bay Area: ArtCar Fest.

5000|$|The {{independently}} produced self-titled album, MOXY, {{also known}} as the Black Album,photo was recorded over two weeks in early 1975. Mark Smith of Bachman-Turner Overdrive fame acted as co-producer for the album. While in Van Nuys, California at Sound City Studios recording this album, session guitarist Tommy Bolin was in the studio next door. Bolin was so impressed with the no-nonsense, to-the-bones sound of Moxy that when asked by the band's manager Roland Paquin to fill in, he said yes. Earl Johnson was actually supposed to have done all the guitar parts, but got into a disagreement with the producer and was consequently tossed out of the studio. Roland Paquin knew Bolin from when he was a <b>road</b> manager for <b>The</b> James Gang. After the Moxy sessions, Bolin continued to work on his first solo album Teaser, and later that year got the call from David Coverdale to join Deep Purple. Having heard the impact of the twin guitars, Moxy then headed back to Toronto in search of a rhythm guitarist who would free up Earl Johnson to play the material on tour that had been added to the songs in the studio by Tommy Bolin. Buddy Caine, a friend of Earl Johnson's, became the needed second guitarist, allowing <b>the</b> group <b>to</b> then <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> with a Canadian tour that included Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes, where the group mostly played small venues.The first album found its way to hard rock stations in the southern USA. [...] The winter of 1975 [...] "Can' t You See I'm A Star" [...] and [...] "Moon Rider" [...] were receiving heavy radio support from KMAC/KISS in San Antonio, Texas. Tommy Bolin's contribution would get some much needed attention for the album in the U.S media, even though Bolin always downplayed his involvement. Moxy renegotiated a new contract with Polydor of Canada for distribution in affiliation with Mercury Records. Both labels were owned by PolyGram Records at the time, who reissued the self-titled debut album in North America and worldwide in 1976. The spring of 1976 [...] "Fantasy" [...] and [...] "Sail On Sail Away" [...] <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> top 20 charts on KISS-FM radio in San Antonio, Texas. KISS-FM disc jockey Joe Anthony had the freedom to play the album in its entirety on many occasions through the late 1970s.|$|R
