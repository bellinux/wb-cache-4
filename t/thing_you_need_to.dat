A few close {{studies will}} soon teach you this: the only <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be told is to watch {{carefully}} {{the lines of}} disturbance on the surface, as when a bird swims across it, or a fish rises, or the current plays round a stone, reed, or other obstacle. Take the greatest pains to get the curves of these lines true; the whole value of your careful drawing of the reflections may be lost by your admitting a single false curve of ripple from a wild duck's breast. And (as in other subjects) if you are dissatisfied with your result, always try for more unity and delicacy: if your reflections are only soft and gradated enough, they are nearly sure {{to give you a}} pleasant effect.[35] When you are taking pains, work the softer reflections, where they are drawn out by motion in the water, with touches as nearly horizontal as may be; but when you are in a hurry, indicate the place and play of the images with vertical lines. The actual construction of a calm elongated reflection is with horizontal lines: but it is often impossible to draw the descending shades delicately enough with a horizontal touch; and it is best always when you are in a hurry, and sometimes when you are not, to use the vertical touch. When the ripples are large, the reflections become shaken, and must be drawn with bold undulatory descending lines.|$|E

5000|$|Henry B. Eyring, then {{a member}} of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, gave the {{following}} counsel to those called to serve. This counsel illustrates many key LDS beliefs concerning those [...] "called of God, by prophecy", [...] "And so, to everyone, man or woman, girl or boy, who has been called or who will yet be, I give you my counsel.First, you are called of God. The Lord knows you. He knows whom He would have serve in every position in His Church. He chose you. He has prepared a way so that He could issue your call. He restored the keys of the priesthood to Joseph Smith. Those keys have been passed down in an unbroken line to President Hinckley. Through those keys, other priesthood servants were given keys to preside in stakes and wards, in districts and branches. It was through those keys that the Lord called you.Your call {{is an example of a}} source of power unique to the Lord’s Church. Men and women are called of God by prophecy and by the laying on of hands by those God has authorized.You are called to represent the Savior. Your voice to testify becomes the same as His voice, your hands to lift the same as His hands.You see, there are no small callings to represent the Lord. Your call carries grave responsibility. But you need not fear, because with your call come great promises.One of those promises is the second <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know. It is that the Lord will guide you by revelation just as He called you. You must ask in faith for revelation to know what you are to do. With your call comes the promise that answers will come.There is a third <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know: Just as God called you and will guide you, He will magnify you. You will need that magnification. Your calling will surely bring opposition. The Apostle Paul described it this way: “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world.”One of the ways you will be attacked is with the feeling that you are inadequate. Well, you are inadequate to answer a call to represent God with only your own powers. But you have access to more than your natural capacities, and you do not work alone.The Lord will magnify what you say and what you do in the eyes of the people you serve. He will send the Holy Ghost to manifest to them that what you spoke was true. What you say and do will carry hope and give direction to people far beyond your natural abilities and your own understanding. That miracle has been a mark of the Lord’s Church in every dispensation." ...|$|E

Claudette asks to speak with Vic in the interrogation room (before Vic can inform Ronnie he's to be arrested) and makes him sit on the suspect's side of the table. She tells Vic about the note Shane wrote and reads it to him: [...] "I guess enough painkillers can make even the worst kind of hurt go away. The <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know is that Mara was innocent and Jackson was innocent; they didn't know what they were drinking and their last moments together were happy ones. They left the way I first found them, perfect and innocent. They were innocent and they are in heaven now and we'll always be a family. The guilty ones are me and Vic. Vic led but I kept following. I don't think one's worse than the other, but we made each other into something worse than our individual selves. I wish I'd never met him. I see it all now. There are no apologies I can make, no explanations I can give. I was who I was and I can't be that person any more. I can't let myself...". The note is incomplete because he shot himself before he could finish it. Claudette tells Vic that she hopes he's proud of himself and shows him pictures of Shane and his family. Vic's face twitches and there is a long silence. He realizes that Claudette is watching him from the monitoring room so he rips out the surveillance camera and tells her to bill him for it on his way out. Claudette signals to Dutch and he proceeds to arrest Ronnie, with Vic present. Ronnie becomes furious when he learns of Vic's betrayal, and as he is being processed yells at Vic about the two of them running together and [...] "protecting the team".|$|E
