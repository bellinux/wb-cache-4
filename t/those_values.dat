These T-2 and T-4 (Blue Devil) designs had much higher altitude, airspeed and wind-speed settings, suitable for high-altitude bombing in the jet stream. These were normally part of the Navigation and Bombing System, which combined inputs from aircraft instruments, H2S and Green Satin radars, star fixes and radio navigation systems, in a mechanical computer that directly output the latitude and longitude of the aircraft, based on automatic dead reckoning. The same outputs were also sent to the sighting head of the T-4, eliminating the need to manually set the windage and providing <b>those</b> <b>values</b> with much higher accuracy (about ±0.1mph and ±0.1 degrees).|$|E

The Cathars presented a problem to feudal government by their attitude towards oaths, which they declared under no circumstances allowable.

25|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement. The psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to <b>those</b> <b>values,</b> and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in Celsius or Fahrenheit), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.|$|E
25|$|In QM, {{predictions}} are {{formulated in}} terms of probabilities — for example, the probability that an electron will be detected in a particular place, or the probability that its spin is up or down.

The possibility existed that some unknown theory, such as a hidden variables theory, {{might be able to}} predict those quantities exactly, {{while at the same time}} also being in complete agreement with the probabilities predicted by QM. If such a hidden variables theory exists, then because the hidden variables are not described by QM the latter would be an incomplete theory.|$|E

That study confirmed the then-surprising fact found in the NMR work that even well-packed aromatic sidechains in the interior of a stable protein can flip over rather rapidly (microsecond to millisecond time scale). Rate constants were determined by NMR for the hydrogen exchange of individual peptide NH groups along the chain, ranging from too fast to measure on the most exposed surface to many months for the most buried hydrogen-bonded groups {{in the center of the}} β sheet, and <b>those</b> <b>values</b> also correlate fairly well with degree of motion seen in the dynamics simulations.|$|E
25|$|Although most fusion {{research}} {{to date has}} focused on the nature and consequences of fusion, recent research has revealed some starting points for understanding the causes of fusion. Perceptions of shared essence, the belief that one shares essential core qualities with the group, appears to be a key building block of identity fusion. Perceptions of shared essence arise in different ways in local and extended fusion. In local fusion, individuals have direct experiences with other group members that foster the conclusion that they share essential qualities with those individuals. In extended fusion, the perception of psychological kinship is fostered by the presence of certain characteristics that are perceived as fundamental to who the person is. For example, {{people are more likely to}} fuse with large extended groups when they become convinced that members of the group share with them genes or core values, especially if they hold <b>those</b> <b>values</b> sacred.|$|E

However, when they march, the state responds with less violent measures than they do with other protesters (although at times, Takembeng women are also placed under house arrest, beaten, and killed by the government). As {{a result of this}} greater tolerance, Takembeng women provide some key support to the opposition party, the Social Democratic Front (SDF). In 1998, Takembeng women provided a protective caravan for John Fru Ndi, SDF Chairman, to leave the country and make a political trip to France and the United States. Although they are related closely with the SDF, the members of the Takembeng are clear in interviews that they are not a branch or tool of the party; instead, they support the ideals of the party {{and as long as the}} SDF holds to <b>those</b> <b>values,</b> their protests will overlap.
