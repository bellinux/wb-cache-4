Sheppard ran round and round a skier from Carmody and did not touch it and, from having the home men 50 for three, the Englishmen allowed them to get on top completely. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> fielding I had seen from an M.C.C team. Bailey emulated Sheppard by running round and round a catch, and not touching it, and Brown seemed to despair of victory...Brown left Perth stating, in a most determined manner, that his fieldsmen would know that they had had fielding practice before very long.|$|E

Don calls Lane into his office, shows him the check and serves him a drink. Lane pretends to be ignorant at first, but then apologizes while arguing that he was only taking his own money that he had previously invested and for which he had not been compensated. Don demands his resignation and gives him the weekend to think of an [...] "elegant exit", assuring him that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> part of starting over.

2500|$|Raja Petra {{was held}} without trial under the ISA at the Kamunting Detention Centre in {{northern}} Perak state, which had 60 ISA detainees, mostly suspected Islamic extremists. The ISA permits an initial detention of two months for investigation, {{followed by a}} two-year jail sentence which can be renewed indefinitely. The 1948 ISA is a holdover from British colonial rule, intended for use against communist insurgents.

2500|$|The album has {{received}} mixed reviews from the Turkish media. Some journalists defended Tarkan saying that critics should {{be engaged in}} discussing his music rather than his dressing style, which characterized most of the publicism that appeared {{in connection with the}} release. Columnist Tuna Serim pointed out in one of her articles that there was a definite hunt for Tarkan news in the Turkish media, channels were ready to change their original schedules to feature Tarkan-related news, which are considered to be of primary importance. She also pointed out that the release of a music video is not given primary coverage in television news programmes in any country, while the release of [...] "Vay Anam vay" [...] was featured and discussed in the news programmes in Turkey.

2500|$|President Richard Nixon made an unannounced {{visit to}} Xenia {{a few days}} later. It {{would be the first}} (and only) city {{affected}} by the 1974 Super Outbreak that he would visit. Upon inspecting the damage, he said: [...] "As I look back over the disasters, I saw the earthquake in Anchorage in 1964; I saw the hurricanes... Hurricane Camille in 1969 down in Mississippi, and I saw Hurricane Agnes in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. And it is hard to tell the difference among them all, but I would say in terms of destruction, just total devastation, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> I have seen." [...] President Nixon immediately declared Xenia a disaster area. Although the Federal Disaster Relief Act was already introduced in 1973, it still had not passed Congress. The 1974 Super Outbreak disaster was a catalyst for accelerated passage of the act through Congress in 1974, according to Nixon. It took several months for the city to recover from the tornado, {{with the help of the}} Red Cross and the Ohio National Guard assisting the recovery efforts. Most of the town was quickly re-built afterward. In recognition of their coverage of the tornado under difficult circumstances, the staff of the Xenia Daily Gazette won the Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Reporting in 1975. The Xenia tornado was one of two rated F5 that affected Ohio during the outbreak, the other striking the Cincinnati area (see Cincinnati/Sayler Park area tornado, below). [...] Xenia was later struck by two other tornadoes—both a smaller one in April 1989 and a larger one in September 2000, which was an F4 twister that killed one and injured about 100 in an area parallel to and just north of the 1974 path. Before the 1974 storm, the city had no tornado sirens. After the F5 tornado hit on April 3, 1974, ten sirens were installed across the area.|$|E
