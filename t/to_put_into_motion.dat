40|$|The {{possibility}} of movement {{is a fundamental}} property in nature. Movement means adaptability and flexibility which protects creatures better from their own ruin and destruction, but also ensures preeminence over other species. Adaptability and flexibility allow responding to different requirement in an equal way. This should be desirable for artificial structures, but still only few existing buildings are able to react to changing environmental influences, like the few stadiums with a flexible roof or the few movable bridges. Usually our buildings and structures are passive. They are built to satisfy more or less only one function. But due to massive chances in society, this does not meet today’s multifunctional requirements {{and it is not}} economical any more. Resulting out of this, new tasks for engineering evoke. But it makes only sense, if the structures are light, not only concerning appearance but also in weight. Heavy structures do not only need more energy <b>to</b> be <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>motion,</b> but also the possible movement will be justified less accurate. Vice versa the use of high-capacity materials leads to new possibilities in design, construction and movement. Pneumatic constructions fulfill this claim of light weight and if ETFE-Films are used they allow transparency as well as ultraviolet rays passes them. This makes them quite desirable for indoor swimming pools – the marketing likes to advertise that guest get a tan even in winter. But certainly in summer, outdoor swimming has to be available; therefore a multifunctional roof is needed. 1...|$|R

What I could directly clutch at was that if the exception did prove the rule in the one case it might equally prove it in the other. If on a rare occasion one of these couples might be divided, so, by as uncommon a chance, the other might be joined; the only difference being in the gravity of the violated law.

5|$|Peking opera follows other {{traditional}} Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning, rather than accuracy. The highest aim of performers is <b>to</b> <b>put</b> beauty <b>into</b> every <b>motion.</b> Indeed, performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training. Additionally, performers {{are taught to}} create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera. The four skills of Peking opera are not separate, but rather should be combined in a single performance. One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play, {{but this does not}} mean that other actions should cease. Much attention is paid to tradition in the art form, and gestures, settings, music, and character types are determined by long held convention. This includes conventions of movement, which are used to signal particular actions to the audience. For example, walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance, and a character straightening his or her costume and headdress symbolizes that an important character is about to speak. Some conventions, such as the pantomimic opening and closing of doors and mounting and descending of stairs, are more readily apparent.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 This {{dissertation}} investigates women’s strategizing {{around the}} senses in South Korea, tracing {{the ways that}} women move between sensory experience as an ideal and as an object <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>motion.</b> I argue that {{the language of the}} sensory is invoked to stand up to state or societal pressures regarding family-making, child-rearing, and maternal subjectivity. The senses, affect, and emotions are employed to carve out space for individual and family well-being within neoliberal logics of productivity, but these new areas of sensory possibility are too often colonized by the same neoliberal logics. Utilizing multi-sited ethnography, media analysis, and an interdisciplinary feminist perspective, I followed the language of sensory development and sensory experience in practice through participant-observation at community spaces, and through ethnographic interviews. The main issues of this dissertation include: first, the ways that the extended family in South Korea is structured through visual culture and watching/being seen, resulting in ambivalence, particularly in the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship. Second, how touch and other senses are conceived of as avenues for emotional and psychological fortification for young children, and how this cultivation of sensory education is extended not just to the mother-child bond, but also to national healing. Third, how sensory fields of sound (in the form of “K-pop” music) and taste (as part of global Korean cuisine) have become spaces of opportunity but also anxiety for teenagers, youth, and their parents. Finally, how “odor” operates metaphorically in constructing the South Korean nation and regions in general, and regionalism and “regional sentiment” in the Chŏlla (southwest) in particular, with implications for restricted access to resources on the one hand but greater yŏyu (space, leisure) for cultivating the senses on the other. While recognizing that the senses are easily appropriated by the state to promote efficient care of the self according to neoliberal logics, this dissertation investigates small spaces in which the various senses might open up possibilities for more egalitarian, communitarian living in contemporary South Korea...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Travelling {{inside the}} human body is an {{on-going}} scientific challenge. In this paper, we propose a new way of propelling robots inside {{the human body}} for gastro-intestinal applications actuated with the gradient field of an unmodified Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) system. The robot is composed of a soft ferromagnetic head and a plastic tail attached together. This assembly is then placed in a bath of water inside an MRI system. The main field of the MRI is used to magnetize the head of the device while a gradient field is used <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the robot <b>into</b> <b>motion.</b> The oscillating magnetic gradient creates a force perpendicular to the direction of swimming and as the device drifts in this direction, the lift produced on its tail moves it in the forward direction. A study varying the length of the tail of the robot from 20 mm to 80 mm, the frequency applied and the amplitude of the gradient has been conducted and is developed in the following. I...|$|R
