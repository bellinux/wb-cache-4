40|$|The aim of {{the field}} study was to {{determine}} if the season, when blue fox females are selected for breeding and body conditioning {{have an effect on the}} breeding result and to clarify connection of body weight of artificially inseminated blue fox female with breeding result and the litter size. A field study with 231 blue fox females at the beginning of the trial was carried out in a private blue fox farm 2005 - 2006. Young blue fox females were selected for breeding in September (Early group) or late in November (Late group). The females in Early group were fed on a restricted breeder's diet during growing-furring season and before artificial insemination. The females in group Late were fed as ad libitum during growing-furring season and the feeding was strongly restricted after selection for breeding. Commercial fox feed was used and the feed consumption was not registered due to the practical field conditions. The females of the Early group were weighed when selected for breeding, in January and at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> artificial <b>insemination.</b> The females in group Late were weighed in January, in February and also at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> artificial <b>insemination.</b> Breeding result (litter size/inseminated female) was calculated when litters were 25 days old. The season for selecting the first year blue fox breeders was important. There was statistically significant difference in the average weight of females between groups in January and at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> artificial <b>insemination</b> (p< 0. 0001). At insemination time the average weights were 8848 ± 83 g and 11052 ± 158 g in groups Early and Late, respectively. The breeding result was 5. 21 cubs per inseminated female in group Early and 2. 37 cubs per inseminated female in group Late (p< 0. 0001). The selection in early autumn improved the breeding result. The weight of blue fox female at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> artificial <b>insemination</b> had an effect to the litter size.

We monitored the reproduction parameters of 209 dairy cows (1 st to 8 th lactation). Ultrasonography was used to diagnose gravidity, and/or embryonic mortality, in each cow 6 times, at regular 4 -day intervals between days 22 and 42 after insemination. We analysed the effect of 3 factors on embryonic mortality: age, body condition score and season of the year at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>insemination.</b> Embryonic mortality relative to the age of the female was significantly the lowest (20. 69 [*]%) in cows aged 42 to 47 months (3. 5 – 3. 9 years); high embryonic mortality (45. 46 [*]%) was recorded in the youngest females of 24 to 29 months of age (2. 0 – 2. 4 years).

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 To {{observe the}} effects of {{oviposition}} as related to <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> on fertility, four trials were conducted in which individually caged White Leghorn hens were artificially inseminated with 0. 05 cc of undiluted mixed semen obtained from 4 to 5 cockerels. These inseminations were made at 9 : 45 a. m., 10 : 00 a. m. and 12 : 00 noon. Beginning three hours prior to insemination and continuing to 29 hours after insemination, the time of oviposition of each hen was recorded. Eggs were saved and incubated for two periods, 2 to 9 days and 10 to 17 days following insemination. When the hens were inseminated within three hours before oviposition or two hours after oviposition fertility decreased; and {{the magnitude of this}} decrease was inversely related to the time interval between insemination and oviposition. Hens laying 25 to 27 hours after insemination also showed a tendency toward low fertility; and the fact that a high percentage of these hens also laid within two hours prior to insemination may have contributed to this low fertility. A hard-shelled egg in the oviduct at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> did not affect the resulting fertility unless that egg was laid within three hours after insemination. Ovulation or an egg in the anterior oviduct {{as far back as the}} magnum at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> apparently had little or no influence on the resulting fertility. There was a high correlation between duration of fertility and percentage of fertility. To observe {{the effects of}} oxytocin on fertility, hens with hard-shelled eggs in the uteri were either given an intravenous injection of 5 I. U. of oxytocin and inseminated after they laid, or inseminated and then forced to lay by an intravenous injection of 5 I. U. of oxytocin. Hens without a hard-shelled egg in the uterus were either given an intravenous injection of oxytocin and then inseminated, or inseminated with semen diluted with 0. 1 cc (2 I.

Thirty-three animals were inseminated after ultrasonic evaluation while 29 animals were inseminated after manual evaluation through rectal palpation. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed using ultrasound 30  days post insemination. The most frequently observed estrus signs by the dairy owners were mucus discharge (83.9 %) and mounting (67.7 %) while the most frequently confirmed physical signs of estrus by rectal examination were cervical opening (88.7 %), and uterine turgidity (82.3 %). The overall mean (±SD) diameter of the largest follicle was 12.9 [*]±[*] 3.4  mm with an average number of 3.5 follicles per ovary. The overall pregnancy rate was 29 %. Evaluation of post-insemination records showed a significant difference (P[*]<[*] 0.05) in the diameter of largest follicle between the pregnant (14.7  mm) and non-pregnant (12.1  mm) animals. The mean (±SD) time interval between the first observed estrus sign to service were 10.5 [*]±[*] 7.0  hrs and 14.5 [*]±[*] 10.0  hrs for pregnant and non-pregnant, respectively.

40|$|Introduction: Fertilization initiates {{a series}} of rapid changes that remodels the oocyte into the zygote and {{triggers}} embryonic development. These early changes involve cytoplasmic signalling pathways activated by the sperm-induced Ca 2 rise, a signal essential for both cortical granule exocytosis and meiosis resumption. Numerous studies have proposed a role for protein kinase C (PKC) {{as one of the}} Ca 2 effectors implicated in the control of mammalian oocyte activation. However in mouse oocytes, in addition to Ca 2 -dependent isotypes, the presence of PKC isotypes that do not have a requirement for Ca 2 has been reported. Therefore, at fertilization PKC could be activated not only in response to the Ca 2 signal but also as a result of activation of Ca 2 -independent signalling pathways. To test this hypothesis, in the present work we have monitored PKC activity in fertilized mouse oocytes where the sperminduced Ca 2 increase was prevented by a specific intracellular Ca 2 chelator. In addition, we investigated whether changes in PKC activity were accompanied by intracellular redistribution of a Ca 2 -independent PKC isoform detected in mouse oocytes. Materials and methods: Ovulated oocytes from CD 1 mice were deprived of zona pellucida and then incubated in the presence of 200 000 sperm/ml (control) or exposed to the Ca 2 chelator 1, 2 -bis-(o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N,N-tetra-acetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM; 10 μmol/l) for 30 min prior to insemination. Experiments where, at 10 min <b>of</b> <b>insemination,</b> sperm–oocyte fusion rate monitored by the Hoechsttransfer technique was 90 % were discarded. In a first trial, at different <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>insemination,</b> oocytes were processed for biochemical analysis of PKC activity by using MARKS as a specific PKC substrate. In a second trial oocytes were immunostained by using a primary antibody against δ-PKC and a secondary antibody conjugated with the fluorochrome Cy- 3 and analysed by a laser scanning confocal microscope. Negative control samples were evaluated in which the primary antibody was omitted. Results: Data from the biochemical assay revealed a significant increase in PKC activity as early as 10 min <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> in fertilized oocytes where the level of Ca 2 was clamped low with the Ca 2 chelator. However, this level of activity was lower than that observed in the control group that was {{in the presence of the}} Ca 2 signal. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that at fertilization, at the same time PKC activity increased, the δ-PKC gradually changed its cytoplasmic distribution and enriched at the site of the meiotic spindle during the metaphase–anaphase transition. In fertilized oocytes where the Ca 2 signal was prevented, δ-PKC staining on the meiotic spindle was similar to that observed in control fertilized oocytes after a few minutes <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> when they were still at the metaphase stage. Conclusions: Here we show that sperm–oocyte interaction can result in the activation of Ca 2 -independent pathways leading to PKC stimulation and that δ-PKC, during the metaphase–anaphase transition, gradually associates with the meiotic spindle, a major site for localization of elements that control meiosis resumption. Since PKC isotypes are known to translocate to new intracellular sites on activation, δ-PKC may be one of the Ca 2 -independent PKC isotypes physiologically recruited at fertilization. Taken together, present findings suggest that PKC activity at fertilization can result from the activation of both Ca 2 -dependent and Ca 2 -independent isotypes. Therefore, even though the fertilization Ca 2 signal is the trigger for oocyte activation, the regulation of this event may also involve the participation of sperm-induced Ca 2 -independent signalling pathways...|$|R

The animals lost 20 % of their body weight during energy restriction (97 days) and gained 29 % during the high energy feeding (44 days). Estrous cycles were irregular, delayed, or ceased completely. The conception rate was only 25 % during energy reduction. Cycles were reestablished and conception rate improved (67 %) during the high energy feeding. Heifers were designated as fertile or infertile according to their success or failure to conceive during the energy reduction period. Serum thyroxine (T₄) levels were slightly decreased (P >. 05) while triiodothyronine (T₃) levels were significantly depressed (P. 05) in the fertile heifers, but significantly increased (P. 05). Blood glucose levels were significantly reduced during energy reduction and significantly increased during high energy feeding in both groups of heifers (P <. 01 for infertile heifers).

Our results indicate that the intensity of CBHR is lowest in cows inseminated once or twice and in younger animals, while, there were no differences between the groups when they were formed according to the number <b>of</b> <b>inseminations</b> per calving.

40|$|The {{significance}} of vaginal stimulation and progesterone at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> was studied {{in relation to}} the initiation of pregnancy and parturition in the golden hamster. While both are capable of supporting the initiation of pregnancy, vaginal stimuli at the time of estrus is seen crucial for the maintenance of normal pregnancy and for parturition to occur. Vaginal copulatory stimuli are seen involved in initiating mechanisms inhibiting gestational ovulation and recurrent estrus as well. Progesterone may support an apparently normal pregnancy but without vaginal stimulation normal parturition is rare. Vaginal stimulation given simultaneously with progesterone at estrus may compensate for some adverse effects of the exogenous hormone. In 1968, Yanagimachi and I reported that pseudopregnancy in the hamster was capable of being induced by mechanical vaginal stimulation comparable to that of normal copulation. That study was followed by various investigations into those processe...|$|E
40|$|These are {{somewhat}} exciting times for dairy producers {{because of the}} new arsenal of hormones available for controlling estrous cycles and improving fertility. Using Bovilene® seems to assist cows in releasing a retained placenta. Most studies have demonstrated that using GnRH as a followup treatment (day 10 to 18 postpartum) for dairy cows with periparturient problems such as retained placenta improves their subsequent reproductive performance. Prophylactic treatment of early postpartum cows with GnRH (days 10 to 18) or prostaglandin F 2 alpha (days 20 to 40) improved their reproductive performance in most studies as well. Injections of GnRH at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> during late estrus in repeatservice cows effectively improves pregnancy rates. As with all new technologies and hormonal therapies, it is critical that attention be paid to consistent heat detection and good A. I. technique. Use of hormones will not replace, only supplement, good management procedures and common sense...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive {{failure in}} dairy cows results in fewer calves born, lower milk sales, slower genetic {{progress}} and consequently, significant financial {{loss to the}} industry. Dairy cattle breed improvement programmes have, at least until very recently, focused primarily on increasing the yields of milk or milk solids. The resulting genetic improvement has led to significant increases in milk yield per cow but this increase is now associated with a significant decline in cow reproductive wastage. An {{important part of the}} Teagasc research programme in this area is to determine the time at which embryo loss occurs and also to determine whether the extent of the embryo loss is affected by the energy nutrition of the cow and to devise strategies to reduce its extent. This project has focused on the relationship between changes in dietary energy intake near the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> and the extent and pattern of embryo survival. The main results are summarised in this report and detailed results of the several experiments involved have been published in the papers listed {{at the end of this}} report. • • 4 The objectives of this project were to determine the effect of changes in energy intake near the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> on embryo loss rate, on the timing of embryo loss and on the possible biological mechanisms involved. Cross bred heifers were provided with either high or low energy intakes that were based on pasture allowances calculated to provide either 0. 8 or 2. 0 times their maintenance requirements. These energy intakes were allocated for two weeks before and about five weeks after insemination. The effect of the changes in energy intake on embryo loss and on the time at which embryo loss occurred, relative to the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>insemination,</b> was established. Possible associations between embryo loss and blood concentrations of progesterone, NEFAs, insulin and glucose were examined. A sudden reduction from a high to a low energy intake imposed for two weeks from the day of insemination reduced the subsequent embryo survival rate by 30 percentage points to a survival rate of 38 %. When energy intake over this same period was either maintained or increased, embryo survival rate remained high (overall mean, 69 %), within a range of 65 - 71 %. The time at which embryo loss occurred was established. Embryo survival or pregnancy rates measured on days 14 and 30 after insemination and at full term were 68 %, 76 % and 72 %, respectively. These results provide new information indicating that most embryo loss, at least in heifers, had occurred on or before day 14 after insemination. There was no evidence of any association between the shortterm changes in energy intake either before or after AI and blood progesterone concentration. Neither was there any evidence that the detrimental effect of the sudden reduction in energy intake on embryo survival was mediated through changes in the systemic concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) or insulin. There was a suggestion, however, that the detrimental effect of the reduced energy intake may operate through a reduction in systemic glucose concentrations.

40|$|In this study, we have {{investigated}} the incidence of transplacental transmission of Anaplasma marginale in chronically infected cows with no history of acute anaplasmosis during gestation. In addition, we evaluated various techniques for detection of transplacental transmission ofA. marginale. Blood samples were collected from 30 cows at three different periods: at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> artificial <b>insemination,</b> at gestational diagnosis, and after calving. Also, blood was collected from the newborn calves, including one sample before colostrum intake, and another three days after birth. A. marginale-specific antibodies were detected in 100 % of the cows with an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), and in 97 % of them, using an {{indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). Also, we observed that all of the three-day-old newborn calves were seropositive by IFAT. According to polymerase chain reaction, 63. 3 % of the cows were carriers of A. marginale, as well as 6. 7 % of the newborn calves. This represented a transplacental transmission rate of 10. 5 %. Furthermore, a correlation of 93. 3 % was observed between the two serodiagnostic techniques, demonstrating that both ELISA and IFAT can be used in epidemiological surveys of A. marginale. These results confirm the occurrence of transplacental transmission of A. marginale in chronically infected cows and suggest the importance of this transmission route in areas of enzootic instability...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConsidering the {{efficiency}} of steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (SAIDs) in the immunomodulation of breeding-induced endometritis {{and the possibility of}} using these drugs by intrauterine route instead of the parenteral application, the present study aimed at evaluating the effect of SAIDs added to the semen extender on equine sperm viability and fertility. In experiment 1, 15 SAIDs were individually added to a skim milk-based extender and, {{based on the results of}} sperm motility, dexamethasone was the drug of choice for the subsequent trials. The effect of dexamethasone on the viability of fresh and 24 -hour cooled semen was investigated in experiment 2. In experiment 3, fertility rate was measured in both post-breeding endometritis-resistant and susceptible mares. Although dexamethasone supplementation caused a premature decrease in sperm total and progressive motility and in sperm velocities (P. 05). Based on these results, we can conclude that dexamethasone can be added to equine semen at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> or before cooling, although its use was not able to increase fertility...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the contribution of cow factors to the probability <b>of</b> successful <b>insemination</b> accounting for the serial number <b>of</b> <b>inseminations</b> in analysis. The investigation was performed with 101 297 insemination records in 51 525 lactations of different cows from 1368 herds obtained from the Dutch milk production recording database. Cows that had a first insemination (AI) between 40 and 150 days post-partum with one or more inseminations (= 6 inseminations) were selected. An insemination was defined successful when not followed by another insemination and when the cow calved between 267 and 295 days after insemination, or when the cow was culled between 135 and 295 days after the last insemination. Breed, parity, days in milk, lactation curve characteristics, milk production traits, moment of AI related to peak milk yield time (before or after peak milk yield), the last calf (female, male, twin or stillbirth) and season <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> were selected as independent parameters for a model with successful rate <b>of</b> <b>insemination</b> as dependent parameter. A multivariable logistic regression model was used within cow and farm as a random effect. The probability <b>of</b> successful <b>insemination</b> was the highest in the first insemination and decreased in the following inseminations. However, the success rate <b>of</b> all <b>inseminations</b> increased in a later stage of lactation. The improvement in the successful inseminations in a later stage of lactation was better in multiparous cows than in first parity cows. Insemination in summer and before peak milk yield time reduced the success <b>of</b> <b>insemination.</b> The success rate was the lowest in 100 % Holstein Friesian cows compared with other breeds and was the highest when the last calf was a female calf compared to a male calf, twin or stillbirth. In conclusion, the success of first and following inseminations depended on parity, breed, season <b>of</b> <b>insemination,</b> last calf status, daily milk yield at insemination date, serial insemination number and days in milk at insemination dat...|$|R
