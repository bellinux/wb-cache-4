5|$|Between 1983 and 1989 <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> {{underwent}} {{technical examination}} and were extensively restored and cleaned. Technical {{analysis of the}} Philadelphia painting established that the wood panel comes from the same tree as that of two paintings definitively attributed to van Eyck, and that the Italian panel has underdrawings of a quality that it is thought could only have come from him. After nearly 500 years, <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> were reunited in 1998 in an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Today {{the consensus is that}} both were painted by the same hand.|$|E

5|$|The museum {{stresses}} that <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> {{be kept in}} good condition by whoever has them. Museum director, Anne Hawley has stated that the works {{should be kept in}} a stable environment of 50% humidity and 70°F. Additionally, they should be kept away from light and stored in acid-free paper. Hawley also noted to avoid rolling <b>the</b> <b>paintings,</b> which will crack the paint. If these guidelines are not followed, <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> could be damaged and drop in value. More repainting would need to be done too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E
50|$|As most of <b>the</b> <b>painting’s</b> {{inscriptions}} {{were not}} {{transported to the}} ROM from China and the Xinghua si monastery fell to ruins in 1938, {{it is impossible to}} get a full record of <b>the</b> <b>painting’s</b> background information. Both White and Bachlofer made assumptions in their findings and as such, neither has been able to make a full claim on <b>the</b> <b>painting’s</b> date. As such, The Paradise of Maitreya remains the most controversial painting from the Yuan dynasty.|$|R

5|$|The “Copper-Coloured Mountain Paradise of Padmasambahva” (Zangdopari) is vividly {{displayed}} in a heart shape on every thangkha and also painted {{on the walls of}} the monastery as a constant reminder of the legend. <b>The</b> <b>paintings</b> are set on a pedestal that represents the realm of the King of Nagas amidst Dakinis (mKha-hgro-ma), and the pinnacle in the painting denotes the domain of Brahma. <b>The</b> <b>paintings</b> also depict Klu (Naga) demigods with a human head and the body of a serpent, which are said to reside in lakes (said to denote that they are guarding the hidden treasures). Allegorically, they mean to represent the spiritual holy writings. <b>The</b> <b>paintings</b> also show what is termed as “Walkers in the Sky” (mKha-hgro-ma).|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Gaudí's {{increasing}} fame, in 1902 the painter Joan Llimona chose Gaudí's features to represent Saint Philip Neri in <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> for the aisle of the Sant Felip Neri church in Barcelona.

5|$|Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps {{coined the}} name Raphus solitarius for these birds in 1848, as he {{believed}} the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that the discrepancy between <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> and the old descriptions was that <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.|$|E

5|$|Boydell's {{crowning}} achievement was his Shakespeare project, {{which was to}} occupy {{much of the last}} two decades of his life.

5|$|The {{engravings}} are mirror {{images of}} <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> (since the engraved plates are copied from <b>the</b> <b>paintings</b> {{the image is}} reversed when printed), which leads to problems ascertaining the times shown on the clocks {{in some of the}} scenes. The images are sometimes seen as parodies of middle class life in London at the time, but the moral judgements are not as harsh as in some of Hogarth's other works and the lower classes do not escape ridicule either. Often the theme is one of over-orderliness versus chaos. The four plates depict four times of day, but they also move through the seasons: Morning is set in winter, Noon in spring, and Evening in summer. However, Night—sometimes misidentified as being in September—takes place on Oak Apple Day in May rather than in the autumn.|$|E
5|$|The folio, which {{collected}} {{together the}} engravings from <b>the</b> <b>paintings,</b> {{has been the}} most lasting legacy of the Boydell enterprise: it was reissued throughout the 19th century and scholars have described it as a precursor to the modern coffee table book.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>paintings</b> of {{the first}} {{generation}} of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references. Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a heightened sense of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals. Morally the works express a fearful outlook, combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism. <b>The</b> <b>paintings</b> above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly. Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time, iconographic elements related to the Life of Mary vastly predominate.|$|E
