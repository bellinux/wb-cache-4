The ratio of currency in circulation to GDP has increased in most countries, independently of the continuing spread of cashless <b>transactions.</b> <b>Currency</b> is part of the monetary base. Its increase thus leads to an automatic increase in central banks’ balance sheets. This becomes relevant when the size of a central bank’s balance sheet becomes a policy instrument. Taking account of the increase in cash holdings can lead to a different view of the monetary policy stance over longer periods of time. Holding the size of the overall balance sheet constant is equivalent to a gradual exit when currency holdings continue to increase...|$|E
40|$|U. S. {{monetary}} policy has a purely domestic mandate. The Federal Reserve’s {{task is to}} promote “maximum employment, price stability and moderate, long-term interest rates ” within the United States. 1 Or, as Arthur Burns put it in 1973, “American {{monetary policy}} is not made in Paris; it is made in Washington. ” 2 That said, this paper will argue that global developments have {{played a significant role}} in setting the focus and practice of U. S. monetary policy in the years since Frank Morris became President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. When Frank Morris joined the Fed in 1968, the Bretton Woods system – based as it was on the dollar’s unsustainable link to gold – was on the verge of collapse. Even so, the U. S. dollar remained the only viable international <b>transactions</b> <b>currency</b> at that time, and the financial “world ” encompassed a mere handful of nations edging the North Atlantic, plus, grudgingly, Japan. Today, of course, the major currencies are floating, the euro is increasingly used as a <b>transactions</b> <b>currency,</b> and investor horizons have widened to include emerging markets on every continent. Within this changed setting, the U. S. economy has itself become considerably more open to international trade and investment flows. Thus, promoting U. S. price stability and maximum sustainable growth has increasingly required taking global developments into account. Usually, these developments have been taken as “givens,” * Maurits C.

40|$|Concern about {{unsustainable}} payments imbalances in {{the global}} economy has prompted renewed interest in international monetary reform. This paper describes and evaluates six reform proposals that focus on strengthening the institutional framework for the current system. Some of these proposals advocate increased surveillance; others would create new instruments or facilities; still others propose an evolutionary path toward a new, nonnational reserve or <b>transactions</b> <b>currency.</b> But none of the proposals confront the problems posed by the changes that resulted from the privatization of the international monetary system {{after the collapse of the}} gold/dollar exchange standard.

40|$|Abstract — To {{calculate}} the profit and {{risk associated with}} international <b>transactions,</b> <b>currency</b> exchange forecasting is highly desirable. If the forecasting is done accurately then the transaction can give maximum profit. To perform the above task several statistical and machine learning methods have already been proposed by the researchers in the literature. However this paper presents a comparative study between two predominantly used bio-inspired optimization techniques namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) to forecast the currency exchange rates for one day and one week ahead. For both the algorithms the functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) model is taken into consideration. In the proposed model DE and PSO are used as the evolutionary algorithms for supplementing the optimized value of unknown parameters of the FLANN model. Root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are considered for performance evaluation of the proposed model. Here JAPANESE YEN(JPY), INDIAN RUPEE(INR), FRENCH FRANC(FRF) to US DOLLAR(USD) datasets are considered as the training and testing datasets. The results of FLANN-DE and FLANN-PSO are analyzed. The simulation results show that FLANN-DE outperforms the FLANN-PSO model regarding the accuracy, convergence speed over different time spans...|$|E

25|$|A <b>currency</b> <b>transaction</b> tax {{is a tax}} {{placed on}} a {{specific}} type of <b>currency</b> <b>transaction</b> for a specific purpose. This term has been most commonly associated with the financial sector, as opposed to consumption taxes paid by consumers. The most frequently discussed versions of a <b>currency</b> <b>transaction</b> tax are the Tobin tax, Edgar L. Feige's Automated Payment Transaction tax and Spahn tax. The Automated Payment Transaction tax requires that all transactions be taxed regardless of the means of payment. As such, it proposes a unique tax on <b>currency</b> <b>transactions</b> collected at the time currency leaves or enters the banking system. Since each <b>transaction</b> mediated by <b>currency</b> can not be directly taxed, the APT tax proposes a brokerage fee on currency deposits and withdrawals that is some multiple of the flat transaction tax rate applied to all payments made via electronic payments mechanisms.|$|R

It focuses on cases in which the authorities’ intention is to gain greater control of monetary policy and draws on the experiences of countries that have successfully dedollarized.

This study is also the first attempt to make extensive use of the foreign exchange regulation data reported in the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions.

Yet today these markets are not much larger, relative to GDP, {{than they were a}} decade before. How can we explain this? And does this mean that domestic markets have not, in fact, developed? The paper argues that bond market growth has been held back by a sharp fall in investment rates, which has left firms with little need for bond borrowing. Even so, markets have developed in other ways, {{to such an extent that}} substantial amounts of foreign portfolio investment have begun to flow into ASEAN 5 bonds. These developments have important ramifications. With the investor base growing and infrastructure investment likely to rise, ASEAN 5 bond markets could expand rapidly over the next decade, holding out the prospect that the region could finally achieve "twin engine" financial systems.

Financial sector reforms need to be supported by active monetary policy, and the adoption of new monetary control procedures early in the reform program; reforms should be sequenced consistently with the broader program of macroeconomic adjustment. The pace of liberalization of interest rates and credit should also take account of the solvency of financial and nonfinancial firms.
