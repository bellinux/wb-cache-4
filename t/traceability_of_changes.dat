Change propagation in requirements engineering and life-cycle-management is a key competency to increase the efficiency of product planning.

40|$|A {{software}} {{needs to}} be maintained whenever new requirements arise. A maintainer is responsible to change the code to ensure the software is more operational based on the changes. It {{is a fact that}} the change {{in some parts of the}} code will affect other parts within the same code that need to be changed and this requires the maintainer’s experience to understand the behavior of code implementation. However, it is difficult for new maintainers to understand the component dependencies within the code and it is worse when the current documentation is not updated and becomes obsolete. Hence, the only trustworthy source is the most recent version of the code that new maintainers need to master which requires familiarity of the software itself prior to any changes. This is unfortunately tedious and time consuming. Therefore, to reduce the burden, this research extended and enhanced Configuration Artifact Traceability Tool for Impact Analysis (CATIA) to improve understanding in visualization. A Change Impact Analysis (CIA) approach using visualization method is a proposed model to assist maintainers to understand and visualize the <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> potential <b>change</b> impact. The visualization method was developed based on inheritance, friend, composition, calls and aggregation of program structure to support software change request and program understanding.

The model was then tested in controlled experiment using selected case study to prove <b>traceability</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> potential <b>change</b> impact via visualization method...|$|R
40|$|Graphs {{provide good}} {{representations}} for many domains. In-teractive graph-based interfaces are desireable to browse and edit data for these domains. However, as graphs increase in size, interactive interfaces risk information overload and low responsiveness. Focus+context approaches overcome these problems by presenting abridged {{views of the}} graph. Users can then navigate among views with a level-of-detail mecha-nism. If jumps from each view to the next are easy to follow, users will gain a good mental map of the whole graph; oth-erwise, they may become disoriented. In this work, we identify three factors that affect men-tal map preservation during navigation of interactive fo-cus+context graphs: the predictability of navigational ac-tions, the degree of change from one view to the next, and the <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> once they occur. Strategies for preserving user orientation are classified according to these factors, and new strategies developed for the CLOVER vi-sualization environment are presented...|$|E

40|$|Part 2 : WorkshopInternational audienceRisk {{management}} is coordinated activities to direct and control an organization {{with regard to}} risk, and includes the identification, analysis and mitigation of unacceptable risks. For critical infrastructures consisting of interdependent systems, risk analysis and mitigation is challenging because the overall risk picture can be strongly affected by changes {{in only a few}} of the systems. In order to continuously manage risks and maintain an adequate level of protection, there is a need to continuously maintain the validity of risk models while systems change and evolve. This paper presents a risk analysis tool that supports the modeling and analysis of changing and evolving risks. The tool supports the <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> system <b>changes</b> to risk models, as well as the explicit modeling of the impact on the risk picture. The tool, as well as the underlying risk analysis method, is exemplified and validated in the domain of air traffic management...|$|R
40|$|In agile {{software}} development practices, the system evolves iteratively but {{does so in}} a manner consistent with its design rationale. Evolution often begins with last known design representation because it provides a high level view of the system that is easy to understand.

In fact, design evolution presents three important issues: consistency amongst design representations, <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> a design <b>change</b> in code in order to maintain consistency and versioning of design entities along with versioning of code.

The {{advances}} in technology for manufacturing ASICs allow more features to be added. As result, and depending on {{the architecture of the}} ASIC, more functional blocks do exist to support such additional features. This imply requiring more resources to synthesize each functional block into a logical netlist. As the physical design process is completed by a third party, reducing the time to deliver the complete set of synthesis files is critical for the project, so that the engineers can start the quality checks of each netlist earlier than the schedule, and the final product can be both completed and released on schedule. This work describes a methodology that automatically executes the synthesis flow of RTL code to logical netlist on each block that forms an ASIC. It helps keeping a better <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> through the milestones in a project.

40|$|Software {{configuration}} management is a software engineering process that facilitates {{the governance of}} software development activities and provides <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>changes.</b> Traceability and governance are important quality attributes {{for all types of}} software development environments. At present no comprehensive traceability model exists that can facilitate organisations by tracing both product and process knowledge during their software development operations. This study examines the software {{configuration management}} process in large, medium and small organisations, where agile and traditional software development methods coexist under the guidelines for software process improvement standards with different types of computing environments. For this research, I examine the impact of the Tetrad of Contextual (ToC) constraints drawn from the traceability framework for the implementation of a software configuration management process. The ToC constraints (which includes the impact of software development methodologies, computing environments, software process improvement standards, and organisation size). The aim of this research is to extend the existing traceability meta-model developed by Ramesh et al. (2001) to include a management systems&rsquo; view. This extended traceability meta-model provides a comprehensive traceability view covering both product and process knowledge perspectives. In addition, I also propose and test a reference traceability model called SALAM (Software configuration Agile Lean Adaptable Management; in Arabic it also means &lsquo;peace&lsquo;) which can facilitate the practitioner in implementing a software configuration management process under this ToC constraints. Due to the exploratory nature of the research in investigating the software configuration management process under the ToC constraints, an exploratory iterative sequential mixed design approach is chosen and divided into three research phases. I identify a case study, extend the traceability meta-model to add the management system view, develop a reference traceability model, and then perform quantitative validation of the reference traceability model. Both the extended holistic traceability meta-model and the associated reference traceability model SALAM are validated. It is identified that all sizes of organisations consider management systems very important for establishing traceability. Although their traceability solutions varied in terms of the granularity of the software configuration management process and the sophistication of the tools used, they all show evidence for taking a value-based approach using lean thinking principles and practices...|$|E
40|$|Using {{configuration}} management (CM) within the method engineering discipline {{is a relatively}} new field of research (Greiffenberg, 2003; Saeki, 2006; Saeki & Oda, 2005). CM administrates revisions and variants of methods and provides a change process to control method modifications. Thus, method CM realizes the <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> method <b>changes,</b> enables distributed method engineering and ensure a constantly high quality of engineered methods. In the past years, research focused on the development of appropriate method CM systems. The consequences of method modifications in such systems, however, have attained only little attention or were discussed only in a superficial way. As method modifications can lead to several problems (Weller & Esswein, 2006), {{it is important to know}} the consequences of such modifications to forecast the costs <b>of</b> a method <b>change.</b> Furthermore, this knowledge is useful to create or enhance appropriate CAME tools supporting (situational) method engineering.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{a model for}} implementing and continuously improving the automated change management process for construction megaprojects. Changes are inevitable in megaprojects. Their negative impact along with the necessity of the circulation <b>of</b> numerous <b>change</b> documents, such as; Request For Information (RFIs), Change Request (CRs), and Project Change Notice (PCNs) in real time {{and to the right}} person have required the stakeholders of mega-projects, especially project owners, to implement innovative change management systems. As well, in the industrial sector, the dominance of the “fast track” approach necessitates advanced change management that is based on formal process-based approaches using advanced Information Technology (IT). Thus, an automated workflow-based process with continuous improvement is required to effectively manage changes in construction megaprojects. Most current change management methods still rely on human discipline to follow blurred processes with repetitive tasks, which often break down due to human nature. However, automated change management is in its infancy. Thus, behaviour of and design principles for automated workflow-based change management processes are construction knowledge gaps based on which two main objectives are defined in this research. The first objective seeks to identify the levels <b>of</b> <b>change</b> management processes in the construction industry and then to evaluate and quantify the performance difference between these levels. This thesis, thus, introduces a model of three levels, or “generations”, <b>of</b> <b>change</b> management as an effective approach to understanding how change management can be continuously improved. The second objective seeks to develop and validate a model for continuous improvement of the third level “Generation Three” workflow-based process <b>of</b> <b>change</b> management as measured by improved compliance, reduction of workflow duration, better <b>traceability,</b> and achievement <b>of</b> desirable durations of workflow steady state. This “Generation Three” approach is assumed to be part of an Electronic Product and Process Management System (EPPMS), a tool supporting execution of megaprojects. To meet the aforesaid objectives, the research methodology uses a Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) model developed based on a change management process implemented in a Canadian oil and gas megaproject. Mechanistic arguments and the results of the validated simulation model <b>of</b> <b>change</b> management, which was executed for the three identified generations led to the conclusions that the “Generation Three” approach should result in: a. 	better <b>traceability</b> <b>of</b> <b>change</b> documents throughout the automated workflow-based process due to the recordibility of date, time, and current status <b>of</b> the <b>change</b> documents in each task, b. 	better process compliance due to the elimination of rework in repetitive tasks prompted by the automated workflow engine, c. 	reduction of the duration <b>of</b> the <b>change</b> management workflow considering the limitations of IT for reducing the duration of professional work. This research has thus led {{to a better understanding of}} the potential of automated management systems for improving processes such as change management in terms <b>of</b> <b>traceability,</b> compliance, and duration, but also of the limitations of such systems such as their ineffectiveness in substantially expediting professional practices that require off-line analysis, communication, negotiation and judgement...|$|R
