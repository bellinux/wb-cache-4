25|$|The Royal Society of New Zealand {{advocates and}} {{provides}} funds for science research including research into global warming. The Royal Society considered {{it important to}} be seen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> about climate change, so it became carbon neutral in 2008 when it received carboNZero certification from Landcare Research. Similar to other national science organisations, the Royal Society of New Zealand has released a position statement on global warming.|$|E
500|$|The {{material}} on Bleed American was more accessible and aggressive than its predecessor, {{which had a}} more [...] "layered, sprawling sound." [...] In regard to the stylistic approach of the album, frontman Jim Adkins said, “Things still got pretty gnarly in the studio as far as experimentation, {{but it was always}} to an end that was complimentary to the song. We wanted to really make sure that we weren’t doing things, like, just to put a wacky keyboard sound in. It had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> constructive for the song.” Critics have described the genres of the album as alternative rock, emo, emo pop, pop punk, and power pop.|$|E
500|$|Yorke {{has said}} that the album's lyrics are based on [...] "that {{anonymous}} fear thing, sitting in traffic, thinking, 'I'm sure I'm supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> else' ... it's similar to OK Computer in a way. It's much more terrifying." [...] At the same time, Yorke felt [...] "there's very little anger in In Rainbows. It's in no way political, or, at least, doesn't feel that way to me. It very much explores the ideas of transience. It starts in one place and ends somewhere completely different." [...] In another interview, Yorke said the album was [...] "about the fucking panic of realising you're going to die! And that any time soon [...] possibly [...] a heart attack when I next go for a run." ...|$|E
60|$|In his desperation {{he would}} have gone to the theatre, {{but the fact that the}} ass who {{rightfully}} called himself Verrian was playing at one of them blocked his way, through his indignation, to all of them. By Saturday afternoon the tedious time had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> with, and he decided to go and see what the ass was like.|$|R
60|$|The man led {{him into}} an open shed, and went fumbling for a lantern. Hoopdriver moved the lady's machine {{out of his way}} to the door, and then laid hands on the man's machine and wheeled it out of the shed into the yard. The gate stood open and beyond was the pale road and a clump of trees black in the twilight. He stooped and {{examined}} the chain with trembling fingers. How <b>was</b> it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done?</b> <b>Something</b> behind the gate seemed to flutter. The man must be got rid of anyhow.|$|R
60|$|I have {{reserved}} for the last place a large class of questions respecting the limits of government interference, which, though closely connected with {{the subject of this}} Essay, do not, in strictness, belong <b>to</b> it. These <b>are</b> cases in which the reasons against interference do not turn upon the principle of liberty: the question is not about restraining the actions of individuals, but about helping them: it is asked whether the government should <b>do,</b> or cause <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> <b>something</b> for their benefit, instead of leaving it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by themselves, individually, or in voluntary combination.|$|R
500|$|On the red suit, Maslansky said, [...] "We wanted {{something}} that looked militaristic and functional, but also dramatic and sexy" [...] adding that it was [...] "tricky" [...] making it practical. To {{begin the process of}} creating the suit, Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on Daredevil comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which led to the use of rivets and [...] "architectural" [...] shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with [...] "deeper portions" [...] in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, [...] "because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor’s face is going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> else". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by Andy Park, discussions were had about having them holstered on the right leg, given that both Cox and his stunt double Chris Brewster are right handed, but it was ultimately decided to have the holster on the left hand side {{as it is in the}} [...] "classic profile" [...] of the comics. DeKnight explained that Murdock's Daredevil suit does not have the [...] "DD" [...] emblem on the chest as seen in the comics, because Murdock receives his moniker only after the suit is introduced. He also felt that the emblem was [...] "one of the more problematic emblems in superhero-dom", and that Daredevil's suit in the comics was [...] "very difficult to translate to screen, especially in this world that is grounded and gritty".|$|E
2500|$|As a result, in 2003 PepsiCo {{launched}} a country-wide program {{to achieve a}} [...] "positive water balance" [...] in India by 2009. In 2007, PepsiCo's CEO Indra Nooyi made a trip to India to address water usage practices in the country, prompting prior critic Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science & Environment (CSE), to note that PepsiCo [...] "seem(s) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> serious about water now." [...] According to the company's 2009 corporate citizenship report, as well as media reports at the time, the company (in 2009) replenished nearly six billion liters of water within India, exceeding the aggregate water intake of approximately five billion liters by PepsiCo's India manufacturing facilities.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2004 Europe went on a festival tour through the European continent. The concert setlists {{included}} the old hits, but also introduced the title track from Start from the Dark. The album was released on 22 September 2004, {{the same day that}} John Norum became a father. Start from the Dark featured a more modern sound compared to Europe's previous albums. [...] "We wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> at least that was a little bit relevant now; bit of a dry mix, detuned a bit," [...] Tempest said, [...] "So we felt like we didn't want to do an 1980s album per se, we just wanted to start like a fresh band really." [...] Eventually, the album sold in excess of 600,000 copies worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The {{video for}} the track was filmed in Vancouver, Canada. Barlow stated in his {{autobiography}} that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constantly <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> in the video so Director Dani Jacobs changed the original concept of the video.|$|R
50|$|The {{necessity}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> completely remove impurity (najasa). This <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> when <b>something</b> impure <b>is</b> emitted, i.e. stools or urine; but {{if nothing}} {{has come out}} apart from passing wind, then it <b>is</b> not obligatory <b>to</b> <b>do</b> instinja.|$|R
2500|$|The President told Haig, [...] "We’ve got <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> on this ah, this Lavelle." ...|$|R
2500|$|... “At first I had {{no desire}} to write screenplays. I kind of wished I had because I was {{reaching}} the end of my time producing music videos. I was struggling so hard {{to figure out what it}} was that I was supposed to be doing. I kept thinking I’m supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> creative. I can’t believe I have such a knack for the vernacular and I don’t have anywhere to apply it." [...] “I felt I had not found my true path. And then a series of events occurred that led me to the point where I didn’t have anything to lose if I wrote a screenplay." [...] She began writing sitcoms with a comedian friend but was plagued by second thoughts about her work. Khouri was frustrated and kept [...] "contemplating and meditating" [...] until she got this idea of [...] "two women going on a crime spree." [...] She felt as if a light bulb had gone on over her head, making her more interested in the idea.|$|E
2500|$|For Daredevil's red suit, {{introduced}} {{at the end}} of the first season, Marvel Comics' Chief Creative Officer Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked.

For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by Andy Park, [...] "There was a discussion early in the process, because Charlie Cox [...] Chris Brewster are both right handed, of having the billy clubs holster on the right leg. But Daredevil wears those billy clubs on the left hand side. So while it would have been easier to place the holster on the right we all felt that we had to keep to the classic profile and keep them on the left." ...|$|E

60|$|Who made Mr. Smith {{the head}} and chief of the Mariposa fire brigade that night, I cannot say. I do not know even where he got the huge red helmet that he wore, nor had I ever heard till the night the church burnt down that Mr. Smith {{was a member of}} the fire brigade at all. But it's always that way. Your little narrow-chested men may plan and organize, but when there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> <b>something</b> real, then it's the man of size and weight that steps to the front every time. Look at Bismarck and Mr. Gladstone and President Taft and Mr. Smith,--the same thing in each case.|$|R

50|$|Jah Hut {{varies from}} other Mon-Khmer {{languages}} {{in that it}} contains little-to-no phonetic vowel length. It also uses Causative prefixes that are composed by p- or -r-. By using this, the speaker <b>is</b> able <b>to</b> indicate that a specific something or someone causes something or someone <b>to</b> <b>be</b> or <b>do</b> <b>something</b> else.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed, but {{he wants}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> at once. What should you think of--of--there are two things; one is--going out as a missionary--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, to the inn," [...] {{repeated}} Captain Wentworth, comparatively collected, {{and eager}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something.</b> [...] "I will carry her myself. Musgrove, {{take care of}} the others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't hang {{about here}} much longer," [...] his nephew grumbled. [...] "I get the fever {{in my blood}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something.</b> I had a try this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{thing of}} it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> prove he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> wrong," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "It <b>is</b> one thing <b>to</b> {{know the truth}} and quite another to prove it in court." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you sure?" [...] said Bax, smiling. [...] "Suppose, now, that I <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>{{something}}</b> {{very bad}} to you, something unkind, or that looked unkind-- what then?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{granted the}} request impatiently. Elfie's restless desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> always <b>doing</b> <b>something,</b> instead of amusing me, as usual, irritated me now. The {{interest}} that I had once {{felt in the}} charming little creature was all gone. An innocent love was a feeling that was stifled in the poisoned atmosphere of my mind that night.|$|R
6000|$|Trembling, she grasped Walter's arm, {{and began}} hastening home, {{impatient}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something.</b> 'I {{knew something was}} wrong,' she exclaimed; 'I ought to have gone home yesterday, {{when there was no}} letter.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nothing; {{there was}} a row, so I came. I'm {{supposed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> down at the painting-slips among the boats, or else I'm {{in charge of the}} condenser on one of the water-ships. I've forgotten which.' ...|$|E
60|$|Runyon {{nodded and}} left the room, {{followed}} gladly by Uncle John, who longed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> that would count. The others soon heard {{the roar of the}} motor car as it started away on its quest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no!" [...] said Billie. [...] "I'm {{only too}} glad <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> for you, father dear. This noise {{is a terrible}} nuisance, isn't it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did think}} that for once my {{guardian}} angel had gone back <b>to</b> work and <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> for me. 'Stage Star and Midnight Marauder,'" [...] murmured Miss Silverton, wistfully. [...] "'Footlight Favourite Foils Felon.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|No! it <b>was</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> <b>Something</b> in Blanche's trivial question--or something, perhaps, in {{the sight}} of Blanche's face--roused the warning {{instinct}} in Anne, which silenced her on the very brink of the disclosure. At the last moment the iron chain of circumstances made itself felt, binding her without mercy to the hateful, the degrading deceit. Could she own the truth, about Geoffrey and herself, to Blanche? and, without owning it, could she explain and justify Arnold's conduct in joining her privately at Craig Fernie? A shameful confession made to an innocent girl; a risk of fatally shaking Arnold's place in Blanche's estimation; a scandal at the inn, in the disgrace of which the others would be involved with herself--this was the price at which she must speak, if she followed her first impulse, and said, in so many words, [...] "Arnold is here." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am sick of this inaction," [...] she said, [...] "and want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> towards {{getting to}} the bottom of the affair. I do hope that we shall find some way in which I can be useful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Recommending? Not at all, miss. Ted--that's my son--Ted said a fellow-draughtsman of his had {{a sister}} who wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> in the world, and I {{mentioned}} it to the housekeeper, that's all. Ay, I miss my son very much.' ...|$|E
