500|$|In December 1962, the Beatles {{concluded}} {{their fifth}} and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, {{they had agreed}} that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, {{in an effort to}} maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, [...] "Look, {{if you really want to}} get in these bigger places, you're going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ..." [...] Lennon said: [...] "We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage. He'd tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers, but he didn't want us suddenly looking square. He'd let us have our own sense of individuality." ...|$|E
500|$|Another spoof was of {{a musical}} {{detailing}} the life of Bessie Bunter, entitled Bessie! The musical starts as an Andrew Lloyd Webber parody with the setting of a girl's private school but they've [...] included {{issues such as the}} Spanish Civil War and the McCarthy era. On being asked about Bessie's fatness, the producer (Sir Dave) replies [...] "it is a sort of mental fatness". The lead actress, Carla, belts out in rehearsals one of the songs, [...] "One Day", despite insisting she has [...] "pneumonia". She says to prepare for the role she starts with the bra and then everything falls into place. Later, Bessie! is rewritten completely and the previous cast are sacked: it is, after all, a musical about [...] "a big fat girl". Meanwhile, Carla is crying and being comforted by her colleagues, but further upset by Sir Dave telling her to [...] "get the **** out of here will you Carla, we don't really want snot all over the plush love" [...] In this rewritten part of Bessie, she is played by Victoria Wood who sings an impossibly glamorous and upbeat number. However, she complains at the end that [...] "you're going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> this floor".|$|E

500|$|South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for [...] "Blame Canada". When {{the time came to}} perform the track live at the ceremony, as is customary for the Academy Awards, it ran into trouble with ABC's standards and practices department: censors demanded they write TV-friendly lyrics. [...] "It would be ironic <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the words in a movie about censorship," [...] remarked Shaiman. Censors were particularly unhappy {{with the use of the}} word [...] "fuck" [...] and allusions to the Ku Klux Klan. When Parker and Shaiman declined these requests, Robin Williams, a friend of Shaiman's, sang the song with black tape over his mouth and turning his back when curse words were to be sung. Parker and Stone attended the ceremony in drag, wearing replicas of dresses previously worn at the Oscars by Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez. The two claimed years later that they took acid before the ceremony and were high while wearing the outfits. The song ended up losing to [...] "You'll Be in My Heart", a Tarzan song by Phil Collins (that film came from ABC parent Disney). In response, Parker and Stone ridiculed him in two consecutive episodes of the series' fourth season ("Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000" [...] and [...] "Timmy 2000"). In DVD commentary, Parker states [...] "we were fully expecting to lose, just not to Phil Collins".|$|E
500|$|Music critics met {{the record}} with mixed reviews. German radio station [...] praised the [...] "harmonious and compatible" [...] way Inna's songs fit {{together}} on the record. They also commended the [...] "incredibly danceable and upbeat disco sound" [...] and found that she remained true to her style. Especial praise was reserved for [...] "Endless", as the station found the song distinguished itself from the other material on I Am the Club Rocker. However, Kai Butterweck, a writer for online German magazine Laut, gave I Am the Club Rocker a negative review, commenting that [...] "the scheme is the same in nearly all the songs: galloping offbeat-keyboards first meet with innovation loose beats, ere Inna's thin vocal organ moves the next three or four minutes on almost the same pitch". He further described the songs' rhymes as being [...] "cobbled together from a sixth graders' dictionary". Anna Julia Höhr, writing for the news agency Teleschau, similarly criticized the album, saying that the singer's tunes sound [...] "all the same" [...] and evaluating the record as [...] "disappointing". AllMusic's Jon O'Brien rated I Am the Club Rocker with two-and-a-half out of five stars, describing its songs as [...] "sun-soaked Europop tracks that appear destined to blare out of various Club 18-30 hotspots until the inevitable 6-a.m. stagger back to the hotel". He also criticized the use of Auto-Tune throughout the record and noticed major similarities between the album track [...] "Moon Girl" [...] and Katy Perry's [...] "California Gurls" [...] (2010). O'Brien went on say that Inna [...] "is going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the record quickly {{if she wants to}} avoid the novelty-act fate of her homeland's formerly most famous pop export", asserting that I Am the Club Rocker was the first Romanian major contribution to the international pop music industry after the work of girl band The Cheeky Girls.|$|E
2500|$|Howard's {{abilities}} and powerful physique have drawn attention from fellow NBA All-Stars. Tim Duncan once remarked in 2007: [...] " [...] is so developed... He {{has so much}} promise and I am glad that I {{will be out of}} the league when he is peaking." [...] Kevin Garnett echoed those sentiments: [...] " [...] is a freak of nature, man... I was nowhere near that physically talented. I wasn't that gifted, as far as body and physical presence." [...] Subsequent to a game in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala said: [...] "It's like he can guard two guys at once. He can guard his guy and the guy coming off the pick-and-roll, which is almost impossible to do... If he gets any more athletic or jumps any higher, they're going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the rules." [...] As early as December 2007, ESPN writer David Thorpe declared Howard to be the most dominant center in the NBA.|$|E

60|$|I cannot but blame Cicero for this, but yet I can excuse it. It is hard <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> your leader after middle life, and Cicero {{could only}} have changed his by {{becoming}} a leader himself. We can see how hopeless it was. Would it not have been mean had he allowed those men to go and fight in Macedonia without him? Who would have believed in him had {{he seemed to be}} so false? Not Cato, not Brutus, not Bibulus, not Scipio, not Marcellus. Such men were the leaders of the party of which he had been one. Would they not say that he had remained away because he was Cæsar's man? He must follow either Cæsar or Pompey. He knew that Pompey was beaten. There are things which a man knows, but he cannot bring himself to say so even to himself. He went out to fight on the side already conquered; and when the thing was done he came home with his heart sad, and lived at Brundisium, mourning his lot.|$|E
6000|$|Next; we {{may learn}} not {{to be ashamed of}} {{changing}} our minds: but if we find ourselves in the wrong, to confess it boldly and honestly, as St. Paul did. What a fearful wrench to his mind and his heart; what a humiliation to his self-conceit, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his mind once for all on all matters in heaven and earth. What must it not have cost him to throw up at once all his friends and relations; to part himself from all whom he loved and respected on earth, to feel that henceforth they must look upon him as a madman, an infidel, an enemy. To an affectionate man, and St. Paul was an extremely affectionate man, what a bitter struggle that must have cost him. But he faced that struggle, and conquered in it, like a brave and honest man. And the consequence was, that he had, in time, and after many lonely years, many Christian friends for each Jewish friend that he had lost; and to him was fulfilled (as it will be to all men) our Lord's great saying, 'There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my sake, and the gospel's, but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, [...] . and in the world to come eternal life.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Bertie Tremaine's {{manner in}} {{receiving}} his guests was courtly and ceremonious; {{a contrast to}} the free and easy style of the time. But it was adopted after due reflection. [...] "No man {{can tell you what}} will be the position he may be called upon to fill. But he has a right to assume he will always be ascending. I, for example, may be destined to be the president of a republic, the regent of a monarchy, or a sovereign myself. It would be painful and disagreeable <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> one's manner at a perhaps advanced period of life, and become liable to the unpopular imputation that you had grown arrogant and overbearing. On the contrary, in my case, whatever my elevation, there will be no change. My brother, Mr. Tremaine Bertie, acts on a different principle. He is a Sybarite, and has a general contempt for mankind, certainly for the mob and the middle class, but he is 'Hail fellow, well met!' with them all. He says it answers at elections; I doubt it. I myself represent a popular constituency, but I believe I owe my success in no slight measure to the manner in which I gave my hand when I permitted it to be touched. As I say sometimes to Mr. Tremaine Bertie, 'You will find this habit of social familiarity embarrassing when I send you to St. Petersburg or Vienna.'" ...|$|E
