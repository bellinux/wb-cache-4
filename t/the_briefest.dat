The details focus mostly on the penury of the residents of the Maison Vauquer. Much less intricate are the descriptions of wealthier homes; Madame de Beauséant's rooms are given scant attention, and the Nucingen family lives in a house sketched in <b>the</b> <b>briefest</b> detail.|$|E
5|$|Model {{chose to}} make his initial attacks using {{infantry}} divisions reinforced with assault guns and heavy tanks, and supported by artillery and the Luftwaffe. In doing so he sought to maintain the armoured strength of his panzer divisions {{to be used for}} exploitation once the Red Army defences were breached. Once a breakthrough had been achieved the panzer forces would move through and advance towards Kursk. Jan Möschen, a major in Model's staff, later commented that Model expected a breakthrough on the second day. If a breakthrough did occur <b>the</b> <b>briefest</b> delay in bringing up the panzer divisions would give the Red Army time to react. His corps commanders thought a breakthrough extremely unlikely.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Initial briefs (programs) were {{examined}} {{in order to obtain}} an overview of current practice in documenting <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> process for new health care buildings in Sweden. Methodology: An audit instrument was developed and used to examine <b>briefs</b> for <b>the</b> content and quality of information and to determine whether and to what extent the information was comprehensive and patient oriented. Findings: The results indicate that few strategic briefs make use of evidence to support their statements. Moreover, few briefs had an explicitly patient-focused goal for the project or measurable outcomes. Implication for practice: This new audit approach can be applied in various organisations and over time to improve <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> process and create clearer goals and guidelines. Originality/value: The present study contributes with an audit of written <b>briefs.</b> <b>The</b> question of whether <b>the</b> use of <b>briefing</b> and a systematic brief make a significant contribution to the high quality of design solutions remains unanswered, as is also the case of whether <b>the</b> <b>brief,</b> in general, reflects <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> process. Despite <b>the</b> recent focus on improving the quality of <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> process, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge concerning the documentation resulting from <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> process. Studies are needed that employ different approaches in order to accept or reject the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>briefs</b> are an accurate reflection of <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> process...|$|R
5|$|Germany invaded both Norway and Denmark on 9 April 1940. Norway {{was very}} {{important}} to Germany for two reasons: firstly as a base for naval units to harass Allied shipping in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, and secondly to secure shipments of iron ore coming in from Sweden through the port of Narvik. During Operation Weserübung, Denmark fell in less than a day, becoming <b>the</b> <b>briefest</b> invasion in recorded military history. The Norwegians put up a stiffer resistance to the invading German forces. Nonetheless, by May the southern half of Norway was under German control. Following the German invasion of France and the Low Countries, the Allies were forced to evacuate Narvik, leaving the country to the Germans who would occupy it {{until the end of the}} war. After the invasion, Vidkun Quisling led the collaborationist government of Norway, based around the fascist Nasjonal Samling ("National Gathering") party.|$|E

40|$|Cognition in Schizophrenia by {{examining}} its temporal stability, internal consistency, and discriminant and convergent validity. METHODS: <b>The</b> <b>Brief</b> Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia {{was administered to}} 116 stable patients with schizophrenia and 58 matched control subjects. To assess concurrent validity, a subset of patients underwent a traditional neuropsychological assessment. RESULTS: The patients with schizophrenia performed significantly worse than the controls (po 0. 001) on all subtests of <b>the</b> <b>Brief</b> Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia and on the total score, which attests to the discriminant validity of the test. The global score of <b>the</b> <b>Brief</b> Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia was significantly correlated {{with all of the}} subtests and with the global score for the standard battery. <b>The</b> <b>Brief</b> Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia also had good test-retest reliability (rho 40. 8).

40|$|<b>Briefing</b> is <b>the</b> {{first and}} the most {{important}} step in the design process, where the requirements of clients are defined and the objectives of the projects are identified. <b>The</b> <b>briefing</b> stage of construction projects has become the focus of design management research in the last two decades. It is because <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> process is both critical to the successful delivery of construction projects and problematic in its effective. One of the problem areas is the inadequate involvement of relevant stakeholders. However, little attention is given to the management of multiple stakeholders in <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> process. This paper introduces stakeholder management in <b>the</b> <b>briefing</b> process. It describes the importance of managing stakeholders in the early phase of the project and presents the methodology of analysing stakeholders to identify stakeholders, assess their needs, wants, commitment, interest and power as well as how to manage them.

The figures are accompanied by text that is often identical to that of the Ms. Ludwig XV 13 (excepting differences in spelling), but at times includes additional explanation. The Ms. M.383 is almost certainly longer when it was first written; its text makes reference to sections on poleaxe, dagger, and grappling which are not present in the book's current state. It also refers to a certain play of the sword in one hand which is likewise missing from that section.
