40|$|International audienceIn {{the single}} {{objective}} Unit Commitment Problem (UCP) {{the problem is}} usually separated in two sub-problems : the commitment problem which aims to fix the on/off scheduling of each unit and the dispatching problem which goal is to schedule the production of each <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>unit.</b> The dispatching problem is a continuous convex prob-lem that can easily be solved exactly. For the first sub-problem genetic algorithms (GA) are often applied and usually handle binary vectors rep-resenting the solutions of the commitment problem. Then the solutions are decoded in solving the dispatching problem with an exact method to obtain the precise production of each unit. In this paper a multi-objective version of the UCP taking the emission of gas into account is presented. In this multi objective UCP the dispatching problem re-mains easy to solve whereas considering it separatly remains interesting. A multi-objective GA handling binary vectors is applied. However for a binary representation there {{is a set of}} solutions of the dispatching prob-lem that are pareto equivalent. Three decoding strategies are proposed and compared. The main contribution of this paper is the third decoding strategy which attaches an approximation of the Pareto front from the associated dispatching problem to each genotypic solution. It is shown that this decoding strategy leads to better results in comparison to the other ones...|$|R

On observing the path through which we travel daily {{we can see that}} a lot of {{electricity}} is wasted by glowing sodium wafer lamps and even the traditional tube lights on the electric posts at unnecessary intervals. The self regulating solar system enters into action and exits from functioning depending upon the output from the Day/Night sensing unit. Once the unit indicates arrival of night then the system <b>turns</b> <b>ON,</b> the controlling <b>unit</b> thereafter controls the illumination level of the lamp depending upon the outputs of interruption detector, temperature sensor & real time clock. The system also contains an embedded temperature sensing unit that senses the temperature of the lamp module, thereafter preventing the operation of the lamp at undesirable temperature condition and hence increasing the life span of the LEDs a used in the lamp...|$|R
40|$|Liberalised {{electricity}} markets often include a capacity remuneration mechanism to allow generation firms recover their fixed costs. Various de-rating factors and/or penalties have {{been incorporated into}} such mechanisms in order to award the <b>unit</b> based <b>on</b> the contribution they make to system security, which in <b>turn</b> depends <b>on</b> the <b>unit's</b> reliability. However, this reliability is known to the firm {{but not to the}} regulator. We propose an adaptation of menu regulation to design capacity payments based on a declaration by the firm of their reliability. We scale payments and penalties according to this declared reliability such that the firm's profit-maximising strategy is to truthfully reveal their reliability. We apply the methodology to an illustrative test system. Truth-telling is induced, increasing the efficiency of capacity payments while eliminating the requirement for the regulator to allocate resources to discovering reliability...|$|R
40|$|Air {{conditioner}} {{operation was}} studied {{in order to}} understand how energy consumption and peak power are determined by user behavior, equipment operation and building characteristics. In a multi-family building, thirteen room air conditioners were instrumented in eight apartments, and interviews were conducted with the residents about their operation of the units. The predominant mode of operation was to switch the <b>unit</b> <b>on</b> and off manually; only one resident consistently let it operate thermostatically, and many residents were not aware that the unit had a thermostat. Ambient temperature and time of day were observed to have major effects on the occupant's decision to <b>turn</b> the <b>unit</b> <b>on</b> or off. Even though residents did not pay for electricity, numerous noneconomic factors were found to limit their use of air conditioning.

50|$|The Talon is {{primarily}} used for bomb disposal, and was incorporated {{with the ability}} to be waterproof at 100 ft so that it can search the seas for explosives as well. The Talon was first used in 2000, and over 3,000 units have been distributed worldwide. By 2004, The Talon had been used in over 20,000 separate missions. These missions largely consisted of situations deemed to be too dangerous for humans (Carafano & Gudgel, 2007). These can include entering booby-trapped caves, searching for IEDs, or simply scouting a red combat zone. The Talon is one of the fastest Unmanned Ground Vehicles on the market, easily keeping pace with a running soldier. It can operate for 7 days off of one charge, and is even capable of climbing stairs. This robot was used at Ground Zero during the recovery mission. Like its peers, the Talon was designed to be incredibly durable. According to reports, one unit fell off of a bridge into a river and the soldiers simply <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> the control <b>unit</b> and drove it out of the river.|$|R

The game also features cross platform play across all installed platforms.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{studies the}} optimal control of an N-policy M/Ek/ 1 {{queueing}} system with server breakdowns and multiple vacations. The server is <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> when N <b>units</b> are accumulated in the system. The server {{is turned off}} and takes a vacation with exponential random length whenever the system is empty. If the number of units waiting in the system at any vacation completion is less than N, the server will take another vacation. If the server returns from a vacation and find atleast N units in the system, it immediately starts to serve the waiting units. It is assumed that the server breakdown according to poisson process and the repair time has an exponential distribution. We derive {{the distribution of the}} system size and employ the probability generating function to obtain the mean queue length. It is proved that the service station is busy in the steady state is equal to the traffic intensity. The total expected cost function per unit time is developed to determine the optimal operating policy at minimum cost. This paper provides the minimum expected cost and the optimal operating policy based on numerical values of the system parameters. Sensitivity analysis is also provided...|$|R
50|$|When Sheila, Emmett and Jimmy {{arrive at}} the mine the next morning, they are {{informed}} by the military that they weren't able to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> the coolant <b>unit,</b> so the plan now is to bomb and gas the mine starting in one hour. Emmett calls the military and tells them {{that they will be}} able to activate the unit but they are unable to get the air strike called off. Sheila decides that one hour is enough time for them to get the coolant unit started, so she and Emmett suit up and enter the mine. Jimmy stays outside to monitor their progress and to blow up the mine entrance should it become necessary. Although they find themselves up to their waists in bat guano, they are successful at starting the coolant. As they make for the exit, the bats pursue them. The moment they exit, Jimmy detonates the explosives, collapsing the mine entrance and trapping the bats inside, freezing them. One final bat survives the freezing temperatures and burrows out of the ground, only to be crushed by the car as the group drives away.|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} to a variable stiffness actuator with tunable resonant frequencies is presented in this paper. Variable stiffness actuators have become increasingly important to meet safety requirements and achieve adaptive manipulation or locomotion. For cyclic motion, exploiting dynamic resonance can lead to high power transmission, high energy efficiency, and large motion amplitude. Resonance and variable stiffness characteristics {{have yet to be}} incorporated into a single actuator design. In this paper, a cellular artificial muscle actuator that achieves both variable stiffness and variable resonance capabilities is presented. The design is based on piezoelectric stack actuators. First, the principle of variable stiffness and variable resonant frequencies is described. The static and dynamic performance are then quantified with theoretical models. Theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed actuator can be tuned over a broad range of resonant frequencies by selectively <b>turning</b> specific <b>units</b> <b>on</b> or off. Initial prototypes are tested experimentally and exhibit 15 % static strain, over 300 % static stiffness tunability, and over 100 % dynamic resonance tunability...|$|R
