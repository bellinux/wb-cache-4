5|$|Native Hawaiians {{before the}} arrival of Captain Cook in 1770 used no coins; trade in their {{agricultural}} economy was based on barter. Early relations between Hawaiians and explorers were also based on barter, with nails, beads, and small pieces of iron sometimes being used as money, but as more systematic foreign trade began {{at the turn of the}} 19th century, coins of many lands came to the islands as payment for exports. The arrival of the missionaries, and the plantations and other commercial activity that soon followed, led to the first currencies generated by the islands: tokens and scrip used to pay workers because of the chronic shortage of small change. The trade ties and cultural connections with the United States led the early Hawaii business community <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> terms of the US dollar, and it became the basis for trade, with the Hawaiian royal government periodically publishing tables of the value of non-US coins in terms of the dollar. This was necessary because such coins, brought to the islands by foreign trade, circulated as a means of exchange alongside American silver and gold pieces.|$|E

25|$|These {{classes are}} {{generally}} organized {{so that students}} {{have the opportunity to}} choose several courses they wish to participate in. Courses offered often vary between subjects, but are not typically strictly academically related to that subject. For example, a TAG course that could be offered in history could be the students learning about a certain event and then acting it out in a performance to be presented to parents on the last night of the program. These courses are designed to challenge the students <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> new ways and not merely to be lectured as they are in school.|$|E
25|$|Several {{important}} caveats exist. Since {{the human}} mind struggles <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> greater than three dimensions, 3D topologies can mislead when discussing highly multi-dimensional fitness landscapes. In particular {{it is not clear}} whether peaks in natural biological fitness landscapes are ever truly separated by fitness valleys in such multidimensional landscapes, or whether they are connected by vastly long neutral ridges. Additionally, the fitness landscape is not static in time but dependent on the changing environment and evolution of other genes. It is hence more of a seascape, further affecting how separated adaptive peaks can actually be. Finally, since it is common to use function as a proxy for fitness when discussing enzymes, any promiscuous activities exist as overlapping landscapes that together will determine the ultimate fitness of the organism.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} action to alter village society was the land {{reform of the}} late 1940s and early 1950s, in which the party sent work teams to every village {{to carry out its}} land reform policy. This in itself was an {{unprecedented}} display of administrative and political power. The land reform had several related goals. The work teams were to redistribute some (though not all) land from the wealthier families or land-owning trusts to the poorest segments of the population and so to effect a more equitable distribution of the basic means of production; to overthrow the village elites, who might be expected to oppose the party and its programs; to recruit new village leaders from among those who demonstrated the most commitment to the party's goals; and to teach everyone <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> terms of class status rather than kinship group or patron-client ties.|$|E

25|$|The {{estimates}} of likelihood {{associated with the}} optimistic bias are based on how closely an event matches a person's overall idea of the specific event. Some researchers suggest that the representativeness heuristic is {{a reason for the}} optimistic bias: individuals tend <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> stereotypical categories rather than about their actual targets when making comparisons. For example, when drivers are asked to think about a car accident, {{they are more likely to}} associate a bad driver, rather than just the average driver. Individuals compare themselves with the negative elements that come to mind, rather than an overall accurate comparison between them and another driver. Additionally, when individuals were asked to compare themselves towards friends, they chose more vulnerable friends based on the events they were looking at. Individuals generally chose a specific friend based on whether they resemble a given example, rather than just an average friend. People find examples that relate directly to what they are asked, resulting in representativeness heuristics.|$|E

Edge compared the game's challenges to Jetpack Joyride missions, and complimented the connection between Vollmer's [...] "magpie" [...] design and Wohlwend's [...] "luminously flat pastel-colored art".

500|$|Verdi said of Puccini, {{early in}} the latter's career, that [...] "the symphonic element dominates in him", and Gianni Schicchi has been {{compared}} by later analysts {{to that of the}} final presto movement of a three-movement symphony. With the fast-moving pace of the work, the set pieces are given a simpler melodic structure than those in the other two parts of the triptych. On stage, with the commedia dell'arte references, a humorous atmosphere is established from the very beginning. However, the music itself is of the 20th century; Edward Greenfield refers to its [...] "dissonant modernity", with simultaneous clashing chords suggesting that [...] "Puccini was beginning <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> bi-tonal terms". Alongside these dissonant passages are others which opera scholar Julian Budden calls [...] "bland, schoolroom diatonism".|$|E

500|$|The Fairchild Family was so {{successful}} that Sherwood wrote two sequels, one in 1842 and one in 1847. These reflected her changing values {{as well as those}} of the Victorian period. Significantly, the servants in Part I, [...] "who are almost part of the family, are pushed aside in Part III by their gossiping, flattering counterparts in the fine manor-house." [...] But the most extensive thematic change in the series was the disappearance of evangelicalism. Whereas all of the lessons in Part I highlight the children's [...] "human depravity" [...] and encourage the reader <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> terms of the afterlife, in Parts II and III, other Victorian values such as [...] "respectability" [...] and filial obedience come to the fore. Dawson describes the difference in terms of parental indulgence; in Parts II and III, the Fairchild parents employ softer disciplinary tactics than in Part I.|$|E

Just for a moment, Milo is able to float in the air beside Alec Bings and see things from the perspective he will have as an adult, allowing the young reader to contemplate what it will be like to do the same. According to Liston, Milo [...] "transforms himself from an unthinking and compliant Lethargarian to a young adult with greater consciousness, a firmer sense of self, and a newly found set of responsibilities".|$|E

[...] Children's Literature reviewer Claudia Mills gave generally positive comments, calling the novel [...] "engrossing and engaging". The website Kidsreads well-loved children's books. It's that good." [...] A reviewer of The Trades website called it [...] "an entertaining read that manages to serve several purposes in one concise novel" [...] and found the characters [...] "unusual yet likable", but felt that [...] "the disappointing bit of this novel is that the solutions always arrive through a series of disconnected events that just lead the kids <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> certain ways."

500|$|Kant's Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten (1785) expounded a moral {{system based}} on the {{categorical}} imperative, one formulation of which is: [...] "Act only according to that maxim through which you can {{at the same time}} will that it become a universal law." [...] Rational agents must act on [...] "principles of pure rational agency," [...] writes Moore; that is, principles that regulate all rational agents. But Williams distinguished between thinking and acting. To think rationally is <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> a way compatible with belief in the truth, and [...] "what is takes for one to believe the truth is the same as what it takes for anyone else to believe the truth," [...] writes Moore. But one can act rationally by satisfying one's own desires (internal reasons for action), and what it takes to do that may not be what it takes for anyone else to satisfy theirs. Kant's approach to treating thinking and acting alike is wrong, according to Williams.|$|E

500|$|On July 16, 1999, tragedy {{struck the}} Kennedy family again when [...] John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s [...] Piper Saratoga light {{aircraft}} {{crashed into the}} Atlantic Ocean {{off the coast of}} Martha's Vineyard. The accident killed Kennedy, his wife, and sister-in-law. As patriarch, Ted consoled his extended family along with President Clinton at the public memorial service. He paraphrased William Butler Yeats by saying of his nephew: [...] "We dared <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> <b>in</b> that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But like his father, he had every gift but length of years." [...] Ted now served as a role model for Maria Shriver, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Joseph Patrick Kennedy II, and other family members. The Boston Globe wrote of the changed role: [...] "It underscored the evolution that surprised so many people who knew the Kennedys: Teddy, the baby of the family, who had grown into a man who could sometimes be dissolute and reckless, had become the steady, indispensable patriarch, the one the family turned to in good times and bad." ...|$|E
500|$|Parts II and III reflect Sherwood's {{changing}} {{values as}} well as those of the Victorian period. Significantly, the servants in Part I, [...] "who are almost part of the family, are pushed aside in Part III by their gossiping, flattering counterparts in the fine manor-house." [...] The second two volumes also outline narrower roles for each sex. In Part I Lucy and Emily learn to sew and keep house while Henry tends the garden and learns Latin, but in Part II, Henry's scrapes involve letting loose a bull while the girls focus intently on how to make purchases in an economical yet fair fashion. The most extensive thematic change in the series, however, was the disappearance of its strident evangelicalism. Whereas all of the lessons in Part I highlight the children's [...] "human depravity" [...] and encourage the reader <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> terms of the afterlife, in Parts II and III, other Victorian values such as [...] "respectability" [...] and filial obedience are brought to the fore. Children's literature scholar Janis Dawson describes the difference in terms of parental indulgence; in Parts II and III, the Fairchild parents employ softer disciplinary tactics than in Part I.|$|E
500|$|Benfica ended March {{with their}} {{objectives}} intact, so April became a crucial month. After a ten-day international break, Benfica resumed {{competition with the}} Clássico at home against Porto on 1 April. The visitors scored first through Pepe in the 41st minute, but Benfica equalized in the 83rd minute with an own-goal from Lucho González. Santos attributed the draw to Porto goalkeeper Helton's performance, saying, [...] "Helton made three or four great saves. We were better {{in the second half}} and we deserved to win." [...] On the following Thursday, Benfica visited the Olímpic de Montjuïc to face Espanyol. The Spaniards pushed hard from early on and scored first through Raúl Tamudo in the 15th minute; shortly after the half-hour mark, Albert Riera made it 2–0 and in the second half, Walter Pandiani added a third goal. Benfica reacted; Nuno Gomes scored to make the score 3–1 in the 63rd minute. Two minutes later, Simão scored Benfica's second goal and the match ended in a 3–2 loss. Santos blamed the poor first half for the loss, saying, [...] "Like with Porto, we were lost in the first half, and let our opponent play." [...] On 9 April, Benfica played Beira-Mar at the Estádio Municipal de Aveiro. Beira-Mar surprised Benfica and imposed on them a 2–2 draw in a match that Santos had labelled [...] "title deciding". Santos accepted the result and commented, [...] "We have <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> Thursday match, because our game today was bad. Beira-Mar had a lot of merit. The title is now harder but we will not renounce it." [...] On 12 April, Benfica received Espanyol for the second leg of the quarter-finals. A slow first half contrasted with a high-pressure second, in which the woodwork and Gorka Iraizoz helped Espanyol defend the goalless draw, allowing Espanyol to proceed to the semi-finals.|$|E
