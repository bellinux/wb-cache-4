Two Centres per <b>team</b> <b>can</b> play in the whole court except the {{shooting}} circles; the remaining attacking and defending players are each restricted to {{one half of the}} court, including the shooting circles. The attacking and Centre players may shoot from outside the shooting circle for a two-point goal.|$|E

5|$|FBS {{teams are}} allowed to {{schedule}} FCS teams, and one win against an FCS <b>team</b> <b>can</b> be counted towards their bowl-eligible status provided the FCS team meets certain scholarship requirements. FCS teams are often paid upwards of USD $500,000 for participating in games against FBS teams. This arrangement generally results in lopsided losses for FCS teams, but the money FCS schools earn from games against FBS teams helps fund their athletic departments, as well as offering broader exposure for their athletic programs.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{has been}} {{described}} as having all the skills necessary for forward play. His height, , makes him difficult to handle in the air – and he is also a good header of the ball. This means he can be used as an effective target man and his <b>team</b> <b>can</b> hit long balls up to him. He can also score from corners and crosses. Samaras is also strong which further adds to his physical presence and makes him harder for defenders to play against.|$|E
5|$|The FC Bayern AllStars {{were founded}} in summer 2006, and {{consists}} of former Bayern players, including Klaus Augenthaler, Raimond Aumann, Andreas Brehme, Paul Breitner, Hans Pflügler, Stefan Reuter, Paulo Sérgio, and Olaf Thon. The team is coached by Wolfgang Dremmler, and plays matches with other senior teams around the world.

5|$|The {{history of}} the 45th Brigade Combat <b>Team</b> <b>can</b> {{be traced back to}} 1890 with the {{formation}} of the Militia of the Territory of Oklahoma. That militia was mobilized in 1898 during the Spanish–American War but never deployed. In 1916 the First Oklahoma Infantry Regiment deployed for border security duty during the Mexican Border Conflict. In 1917, the First Oklahoma Infantry Regiment, reassigned as part of the 142nd Infantry Regiment of the 36th Division fought in the final month of World War I.|$|E
5|$|A team {{typically}} {{consists of}} nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since {{only the top}} two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a <b>team</b> <b>can</b> compete with as few as six students without any point deduction. Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally {{it is to the}} students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay is turn-based, {{with each}} team moving in sequence, which is {{determined}} randomly, across two-dimensional terrain. During a single turn, a <b>team</b> <b>can</b> only move {{one of their}} worms (unless an item that allows the team to select their worm is used). Worms can walk and jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) swing by rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee. The objective of a traditional match is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms, although in the campaign some missions have other objectives such as collecting a specific crate.|$|E

5|$|In a {{situation}} with more time, Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and {{hoped for a}} defensive stop to give the offense {{a chance for a}} game-winning drive. With less than twominutes remaining, however, and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts, the only chance for the Hokies was to attempt a difficult onside kick. A successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball, and kicked it forwards, bouncing the ball high into the air to create a jump ball situation. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball, but because the kick had only traveled nineyards before the recovery, the ball was awarded to Florida State. NCAA rules state that an onside kick must travel at least 10yards before the kicking <b>team</b> <b>can</b> legally touch the ball, and Pace's kick had not traveled the requisite distance.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of a match, a 30-second headstart is given to the Monster so that they can have enough time to escape before the Hunters parachute from a plane to where the Monster started. Each map features an open world environment for players to explore and play within. To help the Hunters navigate the environments quickly, they are equipped with jetpacks, allowing them to jump over obstacles and cliffs. The jetpack {{can also be used to}} dodge attacks performed by the monster, though it consumes a Hunter's energy. The <b>team</b> <b>can</b> track the monster, as well as place waypoints on an interactive map. The color of these waypoints are different based on what players have marked. The waypoint mark turns yellow for environment, orange for wildlife or red for the Monster.|$|E
5|$|The fair catch kick rule states that, after {{a player}} has {{successfully}} made a fair catch or {{has been awarded}} a fair catch (as {{the result of a}} penalty such as kick catch interference), their <b>team</b> <b>can</b> attempt a kick from the spot of the catch; the NFHS also allows a kick to be made if the down following the fair catch or awarded fair catch has to be replayed. Prior to the kick, the opposing team must be lined up at least ten yards beyond the spot of the ball. The kick itself can be either a place kick or drop kick; a kicking tee cannot be used at the professional level, but use of a tee up to two inches in height is permitted at the high school level. Like other field goal attempts, the kicking team is awarded three points if the kick goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal and did not touch a player of the offensive team after the kick. If the attempt fails, the opposing team is awarded control of the ball from the spot of the kick. The opposing <b>team</b> <b>can</b> also return the kick if it does not go out of bounds.|$|E

50|$|The leagues {{below the}} 3. Liga {{are governed by}} {{regional}} federations and associations and rules and regulations governing reserve <b>teams</b> <b>can</b> vary. In the Bavarian Football Association, the largest regional one in Germany, reserve <b>teams</b> <b>can</b> only play one tier below the league of the senior team from the Regionalliga Bayern, the fourth tier, to the Kreisliga, the eighth tier. Below the Kreisliga reserve <b>teams</b> <b>can</b> play {{at the same level}} as the senior team but not in the same league. If this is the case a club has to designate a first and second team {{before the start of the}} season.|$|R
5|$|There {{are four}} {{official}} levels of competition: local/scrimmage, regional, state, and national (Rounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively). With {{the exception of}} Round 1, only the top finishers in each round advance to the next level. California, the state with the largest Academic Decathlon, holds local scrimmages using the Round 1 tests, which are largely for practice and do not determine whether a <b>team</b> <b>can</b> compete at the regional level, which uses Round 2 tests. In the 2008–09 season, 43 states participated in statewide Academic Decathlons, though only 35 and an international school participated in the national competition.|$|E
5|$|When {{a player}} under {{contract}} with a Nippon Professional Baseball team wishes to play in Major League Baseball, he must notify his current team's management and request that they make him available for posting during the next posting period (November 1 – March 1 through the 2013 season, and November 1 – February 1 in the current agreement). The NPB <b>team</b> <b>can</b> reject this request, and the player will not be posted. However, if the team consents, the player is presented to the MLB Commissioner, who then notifies all MLB teams of the posted player.|$|E
5|$|MLS teams {{also play}} in other competitions. Every year, {{up to five}} MLS teams play in the CONCACAF Champions League against other clubs from the CONCACAF region (Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean). Two U.S.-based MLS teams qualify based on MLS regular-season results: {{the winner of the}} Western conference and the winner of the Eastern conference. The third U.S. team to qualify is the winner of the MLS Cup. A fourth U.S.-based MLS <b>team</b> <b>can</b> qualify via the U.S. Open Cup, where U.S. based teams compete against lower {{division}} U.S. clubs. If a team qualifies through multiple berths, or if any of the MLS berths are taken by a Canada-based MLS team, the berth is reallocated to the best U.S.-based team in the Supporters' Shield table which has failed to otherwise qualify. Canadian MLS clubs play against lower division Canadian clubs in the Canadian Championship for the one Champions League spot allocated to Canada. No MLS club has won the Champions League since it began its current format in 2008, with Mexican clubs dominating the competition, but MLS teams have twice reached the final: Real Salt Lake in 2011 and the Montreal Impact in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Monroe {{finishes}} {{viewing the}} footage, and expresses his disgust {{to the station}} executives regarding their decision to air the documentary. To convince them otherwise, he shows them the remaining, unedited footage, which only he has seen. The final two reels begin with the team locating a Ya̧nomamö girl, whom the men film and gang-rape. Faye only tries to intervene when Alan participates. Afterwards, they encounter the same girl impaled on a wooden pole by a riverbank, where they claim that the natives killed her for loss of virginity. Shortly afterwards, they are attacked by the Ya̧nomamö in revenge for the girl's rape and death. Jack is hit by a spear, and Alan shoots him so the <b>team</b> <b>can</b> film how the natives mutilate his corpse. As the three surviving team members try to escape, Faye is captured. Alan initially insists that they try to rescue her, but ultimately decides not to. Mark continues to film as she is raped, beaten to death, and beheaded. The Ya̧nomamö then pursues and kills the last two team members as the camera drops {{to the floor and}} ends showing Alan's bloody face. Disturbed by what they have seen, the executives order the footage to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|When {{all four}} cards of the trick {{are on the}} table, the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand. The trump suit beats the other three suits, with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows: Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. The next strongest suit is the one the first player played, again with the card rankings being Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. Cards {{of the other two}} suits always lose to trumps and the first player's suit. The winning team places the four cards from the trick into their baza. The rules for the {{declarations}} are similar to Two-player Tute, but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza. Only the scoring <b>team</b> <b>can</b> declare. To declare their cards, the opposing team has to begin a baza. Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed. After the hand is over, the counting starts (see Scoring below). When the counting ends, and after the score is calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt {{at the start of the}} next round. The deal of cards rotates counter-clockwise during the subsequent hands.|$|E
