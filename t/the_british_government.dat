5|$|Allied forces {{remained}} in occupation of San Marino {{for a short}} period following the German surrender. In October 1945, {{after the end of the}} war, the Sammarinese government submitted a claim for 732 million lira to <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>government</b> for wartime compensation, of which 500 million lira were given as the related costs of the fighting in September and 20 million lira as the costs of the occupation. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>government</b> rejected this claim, arguing that as Germany had breached the Sammarinese neutrality before Allied troops had entered the country, it was not liable; it did, however, offer an ex gratia payment of £26,000 in regard to the June bombing, later increased to £80,000 (about 33.6 million lira).|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1944, Ron Jeffery, an agent of British and Polish intelligence in occupied Poland, eluded the Abwehr and travelled to London with a report from Poland to <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>government.</b> His efforts were at first highly regarded, but subsequently ignored by the British, which a disillusioned Jeffery attributed to the treachery of Kim Philby and other high-ranking communist agents entrenched in the British system. Jeffery tried to inform <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>government</b> about the Katyn massacre, but was as a result released from the Army.|$|E

5|$|Despite its later {{importance}} to Britain, Gibraltar was initially seen by <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Government</b> {{as more of}} a bargaining counter than a strategic asset. Its defences continued to be neglected, its garrisoning was an unwelcome expense, and Spanish pressure threatened Britain's vital overseas trade. On seven separate occasions between 1713 and 1728 <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>Government</b> proposed to exchange Gibraltar for concessions from Spain, but on each occasion the proposals were vetoed by the British Parliament following public protests.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, in February 1947, Prime Minister Clement Attlee {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>government</b> would grant full self-governance to British India by June 1948 at the latest. On 3 June 1947, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>government</b> {{announced that}} the principle of division of British India into two independent states was accepted. The successor governments would be given dominion status and would have an implicit right to secede from the British Commonwealth. Viceroy Mountbatten chose 15 August, {{the second anniversary of}} Japan's surrender in the World War II, as the date of power transfer. He chose 14 August as the date of the ceremony of power transfer to Pakistan because he wanted to attend the ceremonies in both India and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Markham was {{selected}} to accompany Sir Robert Napier's military expeditionary force to Abyssinia, as the expedition's geographer. This force was despatched by <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>government</b> {{as a response to}} actions taken by the Abyssinian King Theodore. In 1862 the king had written to <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>government</b> requesting protection against Egyptian invaders, and proposing the appointment of an ambassador. Unwilling to risk giving offence to Egypt, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>government</b> did not reply. The king reacted to this slight by seizing and imprisoning the British consul and his staff, and ordered the arrest and whipping of a missionary who had allegedly insulted the king's mother. A belated reply to the king's letter resulted in the capture and incarceration of the deputation that brought it. After efforts at conciliation failed, the British decided to settle the matter by sending a military expedition. Because the geography of the country was so little known, it was decided that an experienced traveller with map-making skills should accompany the force, hence Markham's appointment.|$|E

Mountbatten set a date for the transfer of power from <b>the</b> <b>British</b> to <b>the</b> Indians, arguing that a fixed timeline would convince Indians of his and <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>government's</b> sincerity in working towards a swift and efficient independence, excluding all possibilities of stalling the process.|$|R
