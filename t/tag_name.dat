The name {{was intended to}} lampoon the censorship of TNT. The gimmick ended when Lane and Lodi stripped off their suits on an edition of Nitro. In the following weeks, they competed under the <b>tag</b> <b>name</b> 2XS (an abbreviation of [...] "too excess" [...] that was later shortened to XS) as two hard rock partygoers, during which Lodi's ring name was changed to Idol and then to Rave. This was also short-lived as they failed to get over, and both were released from WCW in 2000.

5000|$|The {{traditional}} and most common way is using CFML.

CFML pages are accessible in the same directory as the calling page, via a special directory in the ColdFusion web application, or via a CFIMPORT tag in the calling page. The latter method does not necessarily require the [...] "cf_" [...] prefix for the <b>tag</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E

Potential use of the model for heterogeneous {{as well as for}} the unstructured collection is also shown. We compared our model with the standard vector space model and obtained a gain for unstructured and structured queries.

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{effective}} ways to manage large collections of digital photos is to <b>tag</b> <b>names</b> of people appearing in those photos. However, {{the number of people}} appearing in photo collections may range in the hundreds and the <b>names</b> of <b>tagged</b> people are usually presented in alphabetical order or on a first-tag first-place basis. As a result, it is difficult to quickly search for <b>name</b> <b>tags</b> that a user wishes to find. In order to solve this problem, we developed a digital photo management system that automatically groups the <b>name</b> <b>tags</b> based on their social relationships. This system was tested on users' own photos against three other comparison interfaces. The average searching time for <b>name</b> <b>tags</b> was significantly faster with our system. Also, the user satisfaction was higher than the others...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. XML {{is now an}} {{established}} standard for data communication and representation. There has been considerable work on XML querying, modeling, and type definition. However, {{one of the most}} important aspects of XML, standardized <b>tag</b> <b>naming</b> for conveying semantics, has been almost ignored by the research community. This paper argues that the naming aspects of XML are important to consider and presents a naming methodology for XML tags that captures increased context information. Using semantic <b>tag</b> <b>names</b> opens up the possibility of semantic querying of XML documents, which simplifies query formulation by reducing the reliance on path expressions. A semantic query facility allows XML documents with similar semantics, but organized using different DTDs, to be queried without modifying the originalquery formulation. Finally, we demonstrate an algorithm for converting semantic queries to structuralqueries by disambiguating incomplete path expressions. ...|$|R
