2500|$|On October 2, 2016 at a {{press conference}} at Fenway Park, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said that the {{anonymous}} drug test in 2003 were inconclusive because [...] "it was hard to distinguish between certain substances that were legal, available over the counter, and not banned under our program." [...] Manfred argued that [...] "it was important to make people understand that even if your name was on that list, that it was entirely possible <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> a positive". Furthermore, Manfred sustained that the 2003 test was supposed to be confidential and it would be unfair to judge players based on [...] "leaks, rumors, innuendo, [...] not confirmed positive test results". Manfred finished by stating that Hall of Fame voters should use their best judgment and only consider confirmed testing by the MLB as there were many [...] "legitimate scientific questions about whether or not those were truly positives." ...|$|E

5000|$|This epistemic closure {{principle}} {{is central to}} many versions of skeptical arguments. A skeptical argument of this type will involve knowledge of some piece of widely accepted information to be knowledge, which will then be pointed out to entail knowledge of some skeptical scenario, such as the brain in a vat scenario or the cartesian evil demon scenario. A skeptic might say, for example, <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have hands, then <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> a handless brain in a vat (because knowledge <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have hands implies <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> handless, and if <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> handless, then <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> a handless brain in a vat). [...] The skeptic will then utilize this conditional to form a modus tollens argument. For example, the skeptic might make an argument like the following: ...|$|R
