40|$|Adaptation {{to climate}} change is an {{imperative}} and an institutional challenge. This paper argues that the operationalisation of climate adaptation is a crucial element of a comprehensive response to the impacts of climate change on human settlements, including major cities and metropolitan areas. In this instance, the operationalisation of climate adaptation refers to climate adaptation becoming institutionally codified and implemented through planning policies and objectives, making it a central <b>tenet</b> of <b>planning</b> governance. This paper has three key purposes. First, it develops conceptual understandings of climate adaptation as an institutional challenge. Second, it identifies the intersection of this problem with planning and examines how planning regimes, as institutions, can better manage stress created by climate change impacts in human settlements. Third, it reports empirical findings focused on how the metro-regional planning regime in Southeast Queensland (SEQ), Australia, has institutionally responded {{to the challenge of}} operationalising climate adaptation. Drawing on key social scientific theories of institutionalism, it is argued that {{the success or failure of}} the SEQ planning regime's response to the imperative of climate adaptation is contingent on its ability to undergo institutional change. It is further argued that a capacity for institutional change is heavily conditioned by the influence of internal and external pathways and barriers to change, which facilitate or hinder change processes. The paper concludes that the SEQ metro-regional planning regime has undergone some institutional change but has not yet undergone change sufficient to fully operationalise climate adaptation as a central <b>tenet</b> of <b>planning</b> governance in the region.

40|$|This paper characterises {{climate change}} as a "transformative stressor". It argues that {{institutional}} change will become increasingly necessary as institutions seek to reorientate governance frameworks to better manage the transformative stresses created by climate change in urban environments. Urban and metropolitan planning regimes are identified as central institutions in addressing this challenge. The operationalisation of climate adaptation is identified as a central tenet of a comprehensive urban response to the transformative stresses that climate change is predicted to create. Operationalisation refers to climate adaptation becoming incorporated, codified and implemented as a central <b>tenet</b> of urban <b>planning</b> governance. This paper has three purposes. First, it examines conceptual perspectives {{on the role of}} transformative stressors in compelling institutional change.

40|$|Planning {{practice}} requires ongoing {{interaction between}} regulatory "facts" and deliberative "norms". Played out in local and strategic developments, "norms" are the agreed values and positions developed by advancing deliberative engagement of residents; while "facts" {{are the more}} rigid statutory procedures through which planning decisions are typically made. However, conflict arises between residents&# 039; groups and local government decision-makers when deliberative norms, now a key <b>tenet</b> of strategic <b>planning</b> processes, struggle to gain traction in the factual spaces provided by statutory planning regulations. A contentious planning process in St Kilda, Melbourne, Australia (concerning the redevelopment of a car park into a commercial and public space) highlights the challenges to deliberative engagement in highly-regulatory planning systems. Drawing on this contested case, this paper examines how the broader formal and relatively fixed framework of regulatory-based decision-making fails to support participatory principles, undermining both the desired communicative ethos and enduring collaborative outcomes and norm development. Specifically, the paper problematises tensions between residents&# 039; growing expectations for greater transparency and participation in planning, arising from a growing regard for deliberation in strategic planning, and the hegemonic nature of statutory planning that preserves planning control within the formal domain of government and the private sector...|$|R

The authors were involved in proposing and piloting a computerized HMIS, based on a complete overhaul of the current data collection tools. This proposal advocated supporting local decision making by employing a flexible, decentralized system to collect, process, and analyze essential primary health care data. The institutional logics underlying the current HMIS in Tajikistan were heavily influenced by the <b>tenets</b> of central <b>planning,</b> quite alien to the ideas proposed. This paper explores the different institutional logics, and the interplay between them {{over the course of}} the project. It is clear that a complete deinstituionalization, amounting to a paradigm shift, is necessary to overcome the differences in institutional logics, but at the same time this account shows how achieving this can be a remarkable challenge in a context of centralized control. This study makes some interesting contributions to the field of IS.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 131 - 142) A {{comprehensive review}} of annexation literature is presented in this study. The review deals specifically with annexation uses, legislation, and effects which create a background for {{a case study of}} local annexation processes in Santa Rosa, California. Prior to this study, there was only a single group of studies which approached the topic of annexation at the local level. It has commonly been stated that more than ninety percent of the annexations to a city are proposed by developers for the purpose of immediate development-for-profit. This study refutes this statement since the findings show that approximately sixty percent of the annexations to Santa Rosa, during the period 1966 through 1975, were proposed by developers for profit. The remaining forty percent of the annexations were proposed for other reasons. Zoning, designations given to new annexations are also investigated to determine their conformance with the general plan. It is hypothesized that such newly assigned zoning will conform to the general plan. In the Santa Rosa case it is shown that, in exercising options at annexation, zoning conformed in three cases out of four. This rate of conformity was slightly increased over time through subsequent general plan amendments. Since 1974, state law has required that all zoning designations reflect general <b>plan</b> <b>tenets...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{and examines}} {{the components of}} social capital related to a grassroots initiative to address Indigenous youth suicide through art. The Native Artists for HOPE’s Thoreau Youth Art Project was organized by {{a small group of}} professional Native American artists in response to a sudden increase of youth suicide in a community on the Navajo Nation. Built on cultural core values identified by the artists themselves, the day long workshop encourages self-expression and creativity as an alternative to risky behaviors believed by community members to be related to suicide. A brief literature review of social capital including its application to population health models, Indigenous communities, and youth suicide is also included. I argue that social capital is a suitable community-level determinant of health that is consistent with Indigenous health models and the place-based Indigenous worldview. Thus, using my personal experience in organizing the Thoreau Youth Art Project as a narrative frame and selected quotes from Artist Facilitators, this study will identify related components of social capital.

She was challenging the basic <b>tenets</b> of urban <b>planning</b> of the time: that neighborhoods should be isolated from each other; that an empty street is safer than a crowded one; {{and that the}} car represents progress over the pedestrian. An editor for Architectural Forum magazine (1952-1964), she had no formal training in urban planning, but her work emerged as a founding text for {{a new way of}} seeing cities. She felt that the way cities were being designed and built meant that the general public would be unable to develop the social framework needed for effective self-policing. She pointed out that the new forms of urban design broke down many of the traditional controls on criminal behavior, for example, the ability of residents to watch the street and the presence of people using the street both night and day. She suggested that the lack of [...] "natural guardianship" [...] in the environment promoted crime. Jacobs developed the concept that crime flourishes when people do not meaningfully interact with their neighbors. In Death and Life, Jacobs listed the three attributes needed to make a city street safe: a clear demarcation of private and public space; diversity of use; and a high level of pedestrian use of the sidewalks.|$|R

This study was a rapid independent assessment of the JFPM activities conducted by Karnataka Forest department under a massive loan from the Japanese Bank for International Co-operation, focusing on the northern and southern maidan regions. The assessment used data from various sources at different scales and depth, including macro-level data gathered by the department itself, responses to a mail-in questionnaire, observations from brief field visits to a number of villages, and from in-depth case studies in a few villages. The study uncovered several lacunae in the way JFPM was being undertaken. Many of the basic <b>tenets</b> of ‘joint <b>planning</b> and management’ like consultation with villagers and setting up of Village Forest Committees (VFCs) are being violated from the outset. The selection of villages has been poor. Most VFCs exist in name only with poor participation of the village general body. Some of the lacunae in JFPM implementation are due to lacunae in the basic framework for JFPM. It is also true that the Eastern Plains region presents special challenges to JFPM implementation. But genuine JFPM is generally absent even in pockets where favourable conditions exist. On the contrary, the few ‘success’ stories are often cases of exploiting existing hierarchies to meet narrowly defined goals. Thus, the major cause of the poor quality of JFPM processes and outcomes is the refusal of the implementation agency to seriously commit itself to the concept of participatory, people-oriented forestry...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} factors influencing language planning decisions in contemporary France. It focuses upon the period 1992 - 1994, which witnessed {{the introduction of}} two major language policy measures, the first {{an amendment to the}} French Constitution, in 1992, proclaiming the language of the Republic as French, the second, in 1994, legislation to extend the ambit of the loi Bas-Lauriol, governing the use of the French language in France. The thesis posits a significant role for the pro-reform movement led by the French language association Avenir de la Langue Francaise (ALF) in the introduction and formulation of the policy measures concerned. The movement is depicted as continuing the traditional pattern of intellectual involvement in language planning, whilst also marking the beginning of a highly proactive, and increasingly political approach. Detailed examination of the movement's activities reveals that contextual factors and strategic strength combined to facilitate access to the levers of power, and enabled those involved to exert an impact on policy initiation, formulation, and ultimately implementation. However, ALF's decision to pursue the legislative route led to the expansion of the network of actors involved in language policymaking, and the development of counter-pressure from sectoral groups. It is suggested that this more interventionist approach destabilised the traditionally consensual language policy community, and called into question the quasi-monopoly of the intelligentsia in respect of language policymaking. It raised broader questions relating to freedom of expression and the permissible limits of language regulation in a democracy such as France. It also exposed ongoing ambiguities and inconsistencies in the interpretation of the <b>tenets</b> of language <b>planning...</b>|$|R
40|$|It is a <b>tenet</b> {{of urban}} <b>planning</b> that {{transportation}} networks help shape the spatial configuration of cities. In {{the case of}} heavy rail systems, a common belief is that building a subway system will promote employment and population density, thereby discouraging urban sprawl and its negative consequences. This dissertation examines {{the impact of the}} Washington Metro rail system in 1990 and 2000 on the distribution of employment and population in two counties in the Washington, DC metropolitan area [...] Montgomery County and Prince Georges County. It asks whether employment and residential construction increased more rapidly near Metro rail stations than {{in other parts of the}} metropolitan area. It also examines the impact of the Metro on the socio-demographic composition of population near Metro stations. Evaluating the impact of the Metro system on employment and population density is complicated by the fact that stations along the Metro line may be located in areas of high population and/or employment density to begin with, or in areas with significant amounts of developable land available. To deal with this issue I use a propensity score matching estimator. The technique is an improvement over the traditional methods of evaluation as it acknowledges the endogeneity of the location of Metro stations. Furthermore, matching estimators relax the functional form assumptions of OLS estimators. The research finds statistically significant impacts on employment and overall development density from proximity to a Metro station and does not find consistent impacts on population or dwelling unit densities. However, for Prince George's County a negative impact on the percentage of the population belonging to a minority is found. The results also suggest that impacts on development are greater closer to the station than farther away and that they are greater the longer the stations have been in operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to explore and understand the role of local councillors in local government. There are three dimensions that influence this role. The first is the tension between central and local government and the highly centralised party political system which constrains local autonomy. The second {{is the role of the}} political party in local government, and its dominance in policy making. The third is the evolving spatial planning system and the new emphasis on localism and collaborative planning. These themes are explored through an examination of the spatial planning system, and in particular a case study of plan making in the growth area of the Central Oxfordshire Sub- region. My reading and reflection have helped me formulate three research questions : a) Has the lack of local government autonomy inhibited the adoption of innovative forms of collaborative planning; b) Have councillors understood the central <b>tenets</b> of collaborative <b>planning</b> and acted upon them and c) Can local politicians who are not members of the council`s executive play a more effective community leadership role by becoming more involved in the scrutiny of policies for space and place - making. The study has contributed to knowledge in a number of ways. It provides confirmatory evidence for other research exploring the role of the councillor in local government. This study has shown how the politicisation that has affected local government has also had an influence on the role of spatial planning in local government and that the dominant role of the political party in local government also involves spatial planning. Finally it demonstrates the importance of effective scrutiny within local government so as to create political space for other stakeholders who otherwise are inhibited by this politicisation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals Report, 2015, {{documents}} that, since 1990, {{the number}} of stunted children in sub-Saharan Africa has increased by 33 % {{even though it has}} fallen in all other world regions. Recognizing this, in 2011 the Government of Uganda implemented a 5 -year Nutrition Action <b>Plan.</b> One important <b>tenet</b> of the <b>Plan</b> is to lessen malnutrition in young children by discouraging over-consumption of nutritionally deficient, but plentiful, staple foods, which it defines as a type of food insecurity. Methods We use a sample of 6101 observations on 3427 children age five or less compiled from three annual waves of the Uganda National Panel Survey to measure undernourishment. We also use the World Health Organization’s Child Growth Standards to create a binary variable indicating stunting and another indicating wasting for each child in each year. We then use random effects to estimate binary logistic regressions that show that greater staple food concentrations affect the probability of stunting and wasting. Results The estimated coefficients are used to compute adjusted odds ratios (OR) that estimate the effect of greater staple food concentration on the likelihood of stunting and the likelihood of wasting. Controlling for other relevant covariates, these odds ratios show that a greater proportion of staple foods in a child’s diet increases the likelihood of stunting (OR =  1. 007, p =  0. 005) as well as wasting (OR =  1. 011, p =  0. 034). Stunting is confirmed with subsamples of males only (OR =  1. 006, p =  0. 05) and females only (OR =  1. 008, p =  0. 027), suggesting that the finding is not gender specific. Another subsample of children aged 12  months or less, most of whom do not yet consume solid food, shows no statistically significant relationship, thus supporting the validity of the other findings. Conclusion Diets containing larger proportions of staple foods are associated with greater likelihoods of both stunting and wasting in Ugandan children. Other causes of stunting and wasting identified in past research are also confirmed with the Uganda data. Finally, the analysis provides clues to other possible causes of undernourishment in young children...|$|R

The aim with this thesis is to examine how the common outdoor environment in tenement yards is affected when the tenets themselves are responsible for the maintenance. But also to see what social affects self-management brings. The purpose is to increase the understanding of how self-management works in practice and how we as landscape architects need to adjust ourselves and our design to create a lasting design that works when the tenets are in charge of their own outdoor environment. I have been studying a number of tenement yards with selfmanagement, both municipal and private tenement houses. I have studied both their design and their self-management, how it is working and how it is organized partly trough deep interviews and also by questionnaires to the tenets of the yards in question. I found three tenement yards with some differences. Fosiedal is a yard with terrace houses, with the oldest self-management and it’s existed since 1985. Many families with children live here who use the yard for both playing and recreation. The yard is well adapted for everyone with multiple playgrounds, a soccer field, a basketball field and lots of benches. The design and maintenance of the yard is to most tenets satisfaction. Nydala is a million program area from the 1960 s. They have had self-management since 1977 with the same coordinator. Quite a few single adults live here and many do not use the yard at all. But the once that do they do so to see ones neighbour, to relax or to work in the garden. Ystadsgatan 13 is a bit different as the tenement yard lies completely private inside the house, behind a locked gate, a stone’s throw from Möllevångstorget. There are 14 apartments and the self-management is completely voluntary and does not give any rent reduction, rather the other way round. The yard which is completely covered with asphalt is since 2002 a green paradise thanks to interested tenets. The result from the poll and from the deep interviews where the importance of a good and consistent coordinator who is engaged in the yard and its <b>tenets,</b> who successfully <b>plan</b> and organizes the work together with the tenets. The number one reason {{to get involved in the}} self-management is to socialize with the neighbours, other reasons is that it is a pleasant occupation or so that the yard would be properly maintained. Some of the tenets also think that it is very important to be able to influence the design of the yard. Landscape architects needs to see the benefits and possibilities with self-management and how to proceed to get the best result when designing a tenement yard with self-management. To create a green durable frame that allows changes in perennials and annuals and tempt and encourage to creativity is preferable. Areas that can easily be altered to fit the number of tenets engaged are also preferable as it can vary substantially...|$|R
