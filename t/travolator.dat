5000|$|Handerly {{also built}} the <b>Travolator</b> bridge in 1959 {{to connect the}} El Cortez with his new motel across the street. [...] Designed by {{architect}} Clarence J. Paderewski for the Otis Elevator Company, the <b>Travolator</b> was essentially a flat escalator. The same design was later used at airports in London, Atlanta and Los Angeles. [...] Some objected to the Travolator's garish orange exterior, but in its early years, San Diego's elite used the moving walkway to attend events at the El Cortez. The <b>Travolator</b> ceased operating in 1981 and San Diego's homeless started sleeping on the bridge. In 1986, the owners sold the motel for $4.5 million, {{and there was no}} longer a need for a connecting bridge between the two properties. Accordingly, the <b>Travolator</b> bridge was demolished in June 1986.|$|E

Otis did not, at this stage, get a contract.|$|R

Handlery made numerous changes both to the interior and exterior in his effort to make it [...] "the finest hotel on the Pacific Coast," [...] promising that [...] "the hammers will never be still as long as I own the Cortez." [...] To attract visitors, Handlery added a swimming pool in 1952, the Caribbean wing (an eight-story addition with a grand ballroom) in 1954, the Starlight Room (located on the twelfth floor and known for its views and chic experience) in 1956, an exterior glass elevator, and a motel and moving sidewalk known as the <b>Travolator</b> in 1959.|$|E
