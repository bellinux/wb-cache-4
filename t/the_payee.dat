5|$|A {{negotiable}} instrument {{is a type}} of contract that allows the transfer of money, such as a cheque. With a cheque there are three parties - the person holding the bank account who gives the cheque (the drawer), the party the cheque is made out to (<b>the</b> <b>payee)</b> and the drawer's bank which promises to pay the money to <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> (the drawee).|$|E

5|$|The legal {{elements}} and {{features of the}} major federal public corruption offenses differ. The various jurisdictional elements of the offenses require that the prosecution prove, alternatively: that <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> was a federal official; that <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> organization received $10,000 in federal funds; that the corrupt communications involved {{the use of the}} mail or interstate wires; that the corruption affected interstate commerce or interstate travel. The mens rea elements differ in whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and inducement. The offenses also differ in whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. The offenses also differ in whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the public official. Finally, the offenses differ in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction.|$|E

25|$|Issue of money, in {{the form}} of {{banknotes}} and current accounts subject to cheque or payment at the customer's order. These claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand, and hence valued at par. They are effectively transferable by mere delivery, in the case of banknotes, or by drawing a cheque that <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> may bank or cash.|$|E
25|$|The first bank to {{initiate}} the permanent issue of banknotes was the Bank of England. Established in 1694 {{to raise money for}} the funding of the war against France, the bank began issuing notes in 1695 with the promise to pay the bearer the value of the note on demand. They were initially handwritten to a precise amount and issued on deposit or as a loan. There was a gradual move toward the issuance of fixed denomination notes, and by 1745, standardized printed notes ranging from £20 to £1,000 were being printed. Fully printed notes that didn't require the name of <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> and the cashier's signature first appeared in 1855.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} with the United States, online banking {{arrived in the}} United Kingdom. The UK's first home online banking services known as Homelink {{was set up by}} Bank of Scotland for customers of the Nottingham Building Society (NBS) in 1983. The system used was based on the UK's Prestel viewlink system and used a computer, such as the BBC Micro, or keyboard (Tandata Td1400) connected to the telephone system and television set. The system allowed on-line viewing of statements, bank transfers and bill payments. In order to make bank transfers and bill payments, a written instruction giving details of the intended recipient had to be sent to the NBS who set the details up on the Homelink system. Typical recipients were gas, electricity and telephone companies and accounts with other banks. Details of payments to be made were input into the NBS system by the account holder via Prestel. A cheque was then sent by NBS to <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> and an advice giving details of the payment was sent to the account holder. BACS was later used to transfer the payment directly.|$|E
50|$|A {{transaction}} {{can also}} be initiated over USSD. A USSD session will provide the user with simple prompts over a menu allowing the user to input <b>the</b> <b>payee's</b> mobile number and MMID, and the user's own MMID and PIN for authentication.|$|R
50|$|The defendant, who is averred to be {{a citizen}} of New York, became the holder of eight of these {{obligations}} with interest coupons attached, each one being endorsed in blank by Foster Brothers, <b>the</b> original <b>payees.</b> This suit was brought to recover the amount due thereon, without any averment in the pleadings as to the citizenship of <b>the</b> <b>payees.</b> <b>The</b> district made defense upon various grounds. The case was tried by the court without the intervention of a jury, {{and there was a}} general finding for the plaintiff, upon which a judgment was entered against the district. To that finding and judgment the defendant excepted (but without preserving, by bill of exceptions, the evidence upon which the court acted), and brought this writ of error.|$|R

2500|$|Applying {{the facts}} to the case, {{the court held that}} (1) the mistake of the bank in {{overlooking}} the instruction to stop the cheque caused the payment; that (2) as the bank was acting without mandate, no obligation of the Association to <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> was discharge, and it follows from this that <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> gave no consideration to the bank for payment; (3) {{there was no evidence of}} any change of position by the recipient. [...] Accordingly, the court ordered that the sums be repaid to the bank.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Goff J {{noted that}} a bank which pays a cheque drawn or purportedly drawn by a {{customer}} without a mandate is paying without mandate, and cannot debit the customer's account. [...] In such cases, the bank has paid out its own money. [...] However, the bank is entitled to recover the mistaken payment unless <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> has changed his position in good faith. [...] But if the payment had been within the customer's mandate (i.e. the mistake of fact had been related to something else entirely) {{there could be no}} recovery, as the payment would discharge the customer's debt to <b>the</b> <b>payee.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} was also subject to limited academic criticism, including a strongly worded article by Professor Roy Goode in the Law Quarterly Review. [...] Goode {{argued that the}} case was wrongly decided for three reasons: first, although the bank lacked express authority to pay on the cheque, it had implied authority; secondly, that <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> had changed their position and so {{should have had a}} good defence in law; and thirdly (although slightly speculatively) the better solution would be to treat the payment as discharging the debt of the customer and for the bank to be able to reclaim the sums from the customer under the doctrine of subrogation. [...] Goode's criticisms of the decision have not been broadly accepted, either by commentators on the law of restitution, or on banking law.|$|E

2500|$|As {{proprietor}} of the playhouse, Lyly installed Evans as {{the manager of the}} new company of Oxford's Boys, composed of the Children of the Chapel and the Children of Paul's, and turned his talents to play writing. Lyly's Campaspe was performed at Blackfriars [...] and subsequently at Court on New Year's Day 1584; likewise, his Sapho and Phao was produced first at Blackfriars on Shrove Tuesday and then at court on 3 March, with Lyly listed as <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> for both Court appearances. In November 1583, Hunnis, still Master of the Chapel Children, successfully petitioned the Queen to increase the stipend to house, feed, and clothe the company. More finally obtained a legal judgement voiding the original lease at the end of Easter Term (June) of 1584, thereby ending the First Blackfriars Playhouse after eight years and postponing the performance of Lyly's third play, Gallathea.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "servicing" [...] practice, one {{check is}} made payable to the {{factoring}} company {{instead of one}} to the factoring company and one to <b>the</b> <b>payee.</b> The factoring company receives the entire structured settlement payment, when due from the annuity issuer, takes what is owed to it and [...] "passes through" [...] the balance to <b>the</b> <b>payee.</b> This involves issuing a separate check to <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> issued off the factoring company account.|$|E
50|$|When {{making a}} direct deposit {{by means of}} {{electronic}} funds transfer, the payer would also normally enter reference information to enable <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> to easily recognise who made the deposit and which account to credit. The reference may be an account number, an invoice number, the payer's name, or some other meaningful identification. To ensure that <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> {{is aware of the}} deposit, the payer would commonly follow up by sending to <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> a remittance advice.|$|E

50|$|In general, <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> is {{at liberty}} to {{determine}} what method of payment {{he or she will}} accept; though normally laws require the payer to accept the country's legal tender up to a prescribed limit. Payment is most commonly effected in the local currency of <b>the</b> <b>payee,</b> unless if the parties agree otherwise. Payment in another currency involves an additional foreign exchange transaction. <b>The</b> <b>payee</b> may compromise on a debt, ie., accept a part payment in full settlement of a debtor's obligation, or may offer a discount, for example, for payment in cash, or for prompt payment, etc. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> may impose a surcharge, for example, as a late payment fee, or for use of a certain credit card, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Form 1099-MISC {{usually do}} not require any withholding, except in cases where <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> {{does not provide a}} correct Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> has been {{reported}} for underpayment, or there has been a payee certification failure. In contrast, Form 1042-S is accompanied by tax withholding.|$|E
50|$|The Rabbi trust {{allows the}} {{deferment}} of compensation whether employment income or {{the purchase price}} of a business acquisition, {{and the absence of}} this would result in the taxability to <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> of the compensation not yet received by <b>the</b> <b>payee.</b> This would serve as a disincentive for deferring such payments.|$|E

50|$|The {{transaction}} flow for IMPS can {{be simply}} described as 'customer-bank-bank-customer'.

After appropriate checks with the customer's bank, the transaction is forwarded to a central switch. The role of the switching agency is played by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). NPCI routes transaction to <b>the</b> <b>payee's</b> bank based on the MMID.|$|R

50|$|In Poland, {{direct debit}} is {{operated}} by KIR (Krajowa Izba Rozliczeniowa) and participating banks {{as one of}} the functionalities of the Elixir clearing system. The payer has to authorize <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> by filling, signing and submitting a standarized paper form in two copies. One copy, after filling in payee details and a customer identification number, is sent by <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> to the payer's bank, which verifies the signature.

50|$|The major {{difference}} between mobile banking and mobile payments is the total absenteeism of the bank account number.

In that event, <b>the</b> <b>payee</b> has to pay all fees for the transaction and may eventually lose his or her ability to initiate Direct Debits if this occurs too often. However, it still requires all the account holders (not merely the payer) to watch statements and request returns if necessary, unless they have instructed their bank to block all Direct Debits.|$|E
