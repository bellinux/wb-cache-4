40|$|Abstract—The {{behavior}} of <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> five <b>leg</b> transformer under voltage sag is studied in this paper. This paper proposes a simple, practical {{model of a}} three phase-five leg, saturated transformer with accurate performance. Transformer saturation is produced when the voltage sag is recovered and it causes inrush current in transformer. Effects of voltage sag depth, duration and initial point on wave have been analyzed in this paper. Initial point on wave can produce maximum inrush current in five leg transformers while comparing with three leg transformers. The magnetic circuit symmetry of five leg transformer produces the more symmetrical shape of inrush current curves versus initial point on wave and sag duration than three leg transformer. The simulations show that current peak has a periodical dependence on sag duration and linear dependence on sag depth. Inrush current that is produced in <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> five <b>leg</b> transformer is higher than <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> <b>three</b> <b>leg</b> transformer.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{applicability}} of the Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) for interfacing grid connected photovoltaic conversion plants. A detailed three-phase 9 -level simulation model is implemented in Simulink. Two control objectives are identified as distinctive for the MMC: Capacitor voltage balancing and suppression of circulating currents, both of which are included in the model. The MMC is controlled by a modified Level-Shifted Pulse Width Modulator. The model is verified by comparing its behaviour to that of the mathematical model of the MMC. The nature of photovoltaic power generation makes Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) important to maximize the power yield from a pv module. All the pv modules connected to the same MPP tracker should have the same operating conditions. For largescale pv farms this is only feasible with multiple MPP trackers. Two pv inverter configurations are identified as suitable for grid connection of large-scale pv farms using the MMC: Cascaded dc-dc converters and multi-string inverter. With the former, the <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> <b>legs</b> share the same dc link voltage. With a multi-string topology, each submodule is fed by a separate pv string. Thus, power imbalance between the submodules are inevitable. This can be remedied by power imbalance compensation. For grid side control Synchronous Reference Frame Control (SRFC) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) is considered. MPC has the advantage of handling non-linear constraints on both states and variables. In addition it is reported to perform better than SRFC during dynamic conditions, which are likely to occur with power generation from pv modules. SRFC is implemented in the MMC simulation model.

UPQC is the combination of both shunt and series active power filters connected through a common DC link capacitor. The shunt active power filter is the most corrective measure to remove the current related problems, power factor improvement by supplying reactive power and regulates DC link voltage.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new hysteresis current regulation {{strategy for the}} neutral point clamped and flying capacitor (FC) three-level inverters. The strategy uses the measured average of the switched <b>phase</b> <b>leg</b> output voltage to adjust the controller hysteresis band as the load back EMF varies to maintain a near constant <b>phase</b> <b>leg</b> switching frequency. The <b>phase</b> <b>leg</b> switchings are then fine tuned to a fixed frequency clock to further improve frequency regulation. Next, the zero-crossings of the measured <b>phase</b> <b>leg</b> average voltages are used to select between positive and negative switched output voltage levels, so that only one hysteresis current regulator {{is required for the}} full inverter switched output voltage range. For the FC inverter, a state machine is then added to select between redundant switching states to maintain balanced capacitor voltages. Finally, the controller is extended to a three-phase system by subtracting the common mode interacting current from the total <b>phase</b> <b>leg</b> current error before making any switching decision. The resulting controller achieves a line-to-line harmonic performance that is very close to open-loop phase disposition pulse width modulation, while retaining all of the dynamic benefits of hysteresis current regulation...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} an integrated approach for constant frequency closed-loop hysteresis current {{control of a}} VSI. The proposed approach uses {{the fact that the}} switching frequency of a fixed-band hysteresis-controlled inverter varies according to the average load voltage. A novel technique is used to measure this average voltage by capturing transition times of the <b>phase</b> <b>leg</b> switching events, to avoid the frequency roll-off effects of using a low pass filter. The average voltage is then used to vary the hysteresis band {{in order to keep the}} VSI switching frequency constant. Next, a refinement is applied to the variable band to synchronise the zero-crossing of the current error to a fixed reference clock. The zero-crossing time is calculated by linearly interpolating between the captured switching transition times, to avoid the need for direct measurement of the zero-crossing event. This achieves a more robust and accurate synchronization process compared to current state-of-the-art time-based and deadbeat hysteresis controllers. For a three-phase VSI, the common mode current is subtracted from the <b>phase</b> <b>leg</b> current error that is calculated from three-phase leg gate signals. Further enhancements are then presented to extend the linear modulation range by 15 %, to maintain excellent switching stability during excursions into overmodulation and to replace the third phase regulator with a fixed frequency directly modulated <b>phase</b> <b>leg.</b> The overall result is a two-level hysteresis current control approach with a harmonic performance that is similar to open-loop CSVM. The average voltage calculation of the <b>phase</b> <b>leg</b> switched voltage then allows the integrated control concept to be applied to three-level three-phase multilevel topologies. Firstly, it allows the development of a three-level variable hysteresis band with band refinement similar to a two-level inverter. Secondly, it facilitates the development of a logic decoder based on the identification of the average voltage zero-crossings, so that only one hysteresis comparator is required per <b>phase</b> <b>leg.</b> A finite state machine is then developed to utilize the redundant switching states of the VSI similar to open-loop phase-shifted PWM. The control concept is then extended to suit a three-phase system by compensating for the common mode interacting current in a similar way as was done for two-level inverters. Further developments are then presented to synchronize the three-phase current errors to a fixed reference clock. The overall result is a three-level hysteresis current control approach that achieves a performance similar to open-loop phase disposition (PD) pulse width modulated three-phase multilevel inverter...|$|R
