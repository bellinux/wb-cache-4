The PAzMs showed high solubility in N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) (15 wt. %) at {{room temperature}} and good film-formability. The film properties of the TPAL/TFMB-based PAzM copoly-mers were evaluated in the present study. In spite of their rod-like backbone structures, the PAzM films showed much higher coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) in comparison with initial expectation. The {{results suggest that the}} simple casting process from the NMP solutions can not be a trigger for inducing pronounced chain orientation toward the direction parallel to the film plane (in-plane orientation). On the other hand, the incorporation of intramolecular cyclodehydrating (thermally imidizable) sites into the rigid TPAL/TFMB-based PAzM backbone by using pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) or 4, 4 -oxydiphthalic an-hydride (ODPA) allowed the formation of low-CTE films upon imidization even for rather low reactive site contents.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of my research}} project is to synthesize multimetallic ruthenium or osmium complexes with metal centers bridged with π-conjugated hydrocarbon chains. The majority of the new complexes were prepared by insertion reaction. The organic compound 1, 3, 5 -triethynylbenzene is the starting material for the synthesis of complexes with 3 -fold rotational symmetry. Metal-hydride complexes such as RuHCl(CO) (PPh 3) 3 and OsHCl(CO) (PPh 3) 3 were used to react with 1, 3, 5 -triethynylbenzene to give metal-vinyl complexes with conjugated hydrocarbon bridges. For example, trimetallic ruthenium complex 1, 3, 5 -[RUCl(CO) (PPh 3) 2 -CH=CH-] 3 -C 6 H 3 was prepared from the reaction of RuHCl(CO) (PPh 3) 3 with 1, 3, 5 -(CH≡C) 3 -C 6 H 3. To synthesize bimetallic complexes, the diacetylenes-containing organic compounds 1, 7 -octadiyne- 4, 5 -diol and trans-hex- 3 -ene- 1, 5 -diyne were used. These two compounds reacted with RuHCl(CO) (PPh 3) 3 to give the bimetallic complexes RuCl(CO) (PPh 3) 2 -CH=CH-CH 2 -(CHOH) 2 -CH 2 -CH=CH-RuCl(CO) (PPh 3) 2 and [RuCl(CO) (PPh 3) 2] 2 (μ-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH=CH-) respectively. In the bimetallic complex RuCl(CO) (PPh 3) 2 -CH=CH-CH 2 -(CHOH) 2 -CH 2 -CH=CH-RuCl(CO) (PPh 3) 2, the bridging C 8 -hydrocarbon chain is not conjugated. Various dehydrants were used to remove the two -OH groups to convert the C 8 -chain to conjugated one, although the reactions were unsuccessful in my experiments. Beside insertion reaction, Wittig reaction was explored as an alternative approach to synthesize bimetallic complexes with CnHn hydrocarbon linkages. To this end, halide-free, Tp-ruthenium phosphonium salt TpRu(CO) (PPh 3) -CH=CH-CH 2 -PPh 3 BPh 4 was synthesized.

40|$|The {{serious threat}} of tuberculosis, {{especially}} XDR-TB, {{is a reality}} in Southern Africa particularly in individuals with HIV/AIDS. Therefore the importance of development of new or improved anti-TB treatment must now be emphasized more than ever. In this study, a model was created to target isoniazid (toxophore) specifically to a cholesterol rich environment where mycobacteria reside in macrophages, by making use of a sterol binding drug, Amphotericin B (haptophore). Isoniazid was covalently linked to Amphotericin B via a Schiff base to a linker molecule, <b>terephthalaldehyde.</b> Although this molecule showed a loss of biological activity, a discovery was made by serendipity that could have great impact in understanding how Mycobacterium tuberculosis enters and survives in the host macrophage. During the testing of the compound, {{it was discovered that}} Amphotericin B bound to mycolic acids at least as well as it binds to cholesterol, its natural ligand. This could provide proof of the structural similarity between mycolic acids and cholesterol but many more controls need to be investigated. As cholesterol was previously shown in literature to be critical for entry and survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages, the indication of a structural mimicry between the cell wall mycolic acids and cholesterol and the attraction of these two chemical entities to one another seems to be highly relevant. This characteristic can now be further explored to improve the understanding of the process of entry and survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the macrophage host.
