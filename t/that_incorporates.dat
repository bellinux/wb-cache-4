5|$|Song of Innocence is an {{instrumental}} jazz fusion record <b>that</b> <b>incorporates</b> elements of classical, rock, funk, pop, and theatre music. It {{is arranged for}} bass, drums, and string instruments, written in the rock idiom with tempos centered on rock-based patterns by Palmer.

5|$|The concerto is {{innovative}} in many respects. In {{the first}} movement alone, Mendelssohn departs from the typical {{form of a}} Classical concerto in many ways, the most immediate being the entry of the soloist almost from the outset, which also occurs in his First Piano Concerto. Although the first movement is mostly in the conventional sonata form, Mendelssohn has the first theme played by the solo violin {{and then by the}} orchestra. Classical concertos typically opened with an orchestral introduction followed by a version of essentially the same material <b>that</b> <b>incorporates</b> the soloist.|$|E
