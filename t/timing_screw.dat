In {{order to}} reduce the {{vibration}} of the high speed <b>timing</b> <b>screw</b> and optimize the manufacturing process of classic three-section high speed <b>timing</b> <b>screw.</b> Mathematical model of three-section high speed <b>timing</b> <b>screw</b> is rebuilt based on B-spline curve and a general mathematical model for the screw. Thus result a new one-section form instead of old three-section type. Then the displacement and speed is simulated in MATLAB. After that，modal analysis and harmonic response analysis have been done in ANSYS. Whose results show that new one-section high speed <b>timing</b> <b>screw</b> which can meet the request of three-section. New one-section high speed <b>timing</b> <b>screw</b> has no velocity mutation, which reduces the vibration of the high speed <b>timing</b> <b>screw.</b> According to the result of modal analysis and harmonic response analysis, the vibration is reduced about 20 %...|$|E
50|$|The {{regulator}} interferes {{slightly with}} {{the motion of}} the spring, causing inaccuracy, so precision timepieces like marine chronometers and some high end watches are free sprung, meaning they don't have a regulator. Instead, their rate is adjusted by <b>timing</b> <b>screws</b> on the balance wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Checkweighers can be {{built with}} metal detectors, x-ray machines, open-flap detection, bar-code scanners, {{holographic}} scanners, temperature sensors, vision inspectors, <b>timing</b> <b>screws</b> to set the timing and spacing between product, indexing gates and concentrator ducts to line up the product into a designated area on the conveyor. An industrial motion checkweigher can sort products from {{a fraction of a}} gram to many, many kilograms. In English units, is this from less than 100th of an ounce to as much as 500 lbs or more. Specialized checkweighers can weigh commercial aircraft, and even find their center-of-gravity.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: lateral growth arrest is {{recognised}} as {{the most}} common form of avascular necrosis (AVN) seen in the management of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). The purpose of this report is to present a new technique that is of benefit in the early identification and subsequent radiological monitoring of lateral growth arrest and which may permit appropriate timely surgical intervention. Methods: we performed a retrospective review of the medical records and serial radiographs of 11 patients (three males and eight females) with lateral growth disturbance in the proximal femoral physis. We devised a new technique (named the ‘Tilt angle’) for serial radiographic observation of lateral growth arrest. Results: this study included 11 hips in 11 patients. Ten patients had screw epiphyseodesis performed after progression of lateral growth arrest was noted. One patient did not have screw epiphyseodesis but the results for this patient are included, as they provide an interesting ‘control’ case for comparison. The average age of screw epiphyseodesis was 12 years. Seven patients demonstrated improvement in their tilt angle following screw epiphyseodesis (i. e. less valgus), one showed no change and two continued to decline. Conclusions: using a new technique to monitor the progression of lateral growth arrest, we noted that screw epiphyseodesis can be used for guided growth of the proximal femoral physis. This technique can be employed for serial radiographic observation of lateral growth arrest and can guide the clinician on the optimal <b>timing</b> of <b>screw</b> epiphyseodesis. Further studies are needed in order to clarify the optimal <b>timing</b> of <b>screw</b> epiphyseodesi...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{standard}} {{protocol for}} the management of syndesmosis injuries has yet to be established. Debate persists regarding number of screws, screw diameter, number of cortices purchased, and the need for and <b>timing</b> of <b>screw</b> removal. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify factors related to screw fixation that may lead to the ultimate failure of syndesmosis fixation defined as a loss of reduction of the syndesmosis, screw breakage, screw loosening, or widening of the medial clear space. Materials and Methods: A retrospective assessment of 137 consecutive patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the distal tibiofibular joint at a single insti-tution from 2004 to 2008 was performed. Clinical and radio-graphic data were recorded regarding problems with ques-tionable clinical significance (number of syndesmotic screws...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} make {{environmental}} test centrifuge balance automatically and accurately, reduce unbalance centrifugal force, balance adjusting system of centrifuge is designed. The new balance adjusting system comprises motor-reducer, <b>timing</b> belt, <b>screw</b> pair, slider-guideway and four rocker force sensors. According to information obtained by the four rocker force sensors, unbalanced value {{at both ends of}} the big arm is computed and heavy block is moved to achieve balance adjusting. In this paper, motor power and torque to move the heavy block is calculated. In full load running progress of centrifuge, the stress-strain of screw pair composed by adjusting nut and big arm are analyzed. A successful application of the balance adjusting system is also put forwarded. The results show that the balance adjusting system can satisfy balance require of environmental test centrifuge.

40|$|Much of the {{currently}} available {{data on the}} technical aspects of syndesmotic screw placement are based upon biomechanical studies, using cadaveric legs with different testing protocols, and on surgeon preference. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of the level of syndesmotic screw insertion on functional outcome. Further, the effects of number of cortices engaged, the diameter of the screw, use of a second syndesmotic <b>screw</b> and the <b>timing</b> of removal on functional outcome were tested. All consecutive patients treated for an ankle fracture with concomitant acute distal tibiofibular syndesmotic injury that had a metallic syndesmotic screw placed, between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2010, were included. Patient characteristics (i. e., age at injury and gender), fracture characteristics (i. e., affected side, trauma mechanism, Weber fracture type and number of fractured malleoli), and surgical characteristics (i. e., level of screw placement, screw diameter, tri- or quadricortical placement, number of syndesmotic screws used and the <b>timing</b> of <b>screw</b> removal) were recorded. Outcome was measured using validated questionnaires, which were sent by post, and consisted of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot score (AOFAS), the Olerud-Molander Ankle Score (OMAS) and a single question Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for patient satisfaction with outcome. During the 7 -year study period, 122 patients were treated for syndesmotic injury. A total of 93 patients (76 %) returned the questionnaire. The median follow-up was 51 months. The outcome scoring systems showed an overall score for the entire group of 92 points for the AOFAS, 77 for the OMAS and 8. 2 for the VAS. Outcome was statistically significantly influenced by the number of fractured malleoli, age, trauma mechanism and the level of screw insertion. Overall, the functional outcome of acute syndesmotic injuries treated with a syndesmotic screw was good and mainly influenced by patient and fracture characteristics. Most different technical aspects of placement appeared not to influence these results. Only screw placement above 41 mm negatively influenced outcom...|$|R
