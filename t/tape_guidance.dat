50|$|The Company {{also offers}} {{automated}} guided carts Automated guided carts (AGC), smaller, less complex AGVs. The Automated Guided Carts product line offers lower cost solutions for material handling using <b>tape</b> <b>guidance.</b>|$|E
40|$|The development, performance, {{and test}} {{results for the}} {{spaceborne}} magnetic tape transport are discussed. An analytical model of the tape transport was used to optimize its conceptual design. Each of the subsystems was subjected to reliability analyses which included structural integrity, maintenance of system performance within acceptable bounds, and avoidance of fatigue failure. These subsystems were also compared {{with each other in}} order to evaluate reliability characteristics. The transport uses no mechanical couplings. Four drive motors, one for each reel and one for each of two capstans, are used in a differential mode. There are two hybrid, spherical, cone tapered-crown rollers for <b>tape</b> <b>guidance.</b> Storage of the magnetic tape is provided by a reel assembly which includes the reel, a reel support structure and bearings, dust seals, and a dc drive motor. A summary of transport test results on <b>tape</b> <b>guidance,</b> flutter, and skew is provided...|$|E

Airmen who meet the DoD BMI standards receive a passing score.|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} of wildlife management activities {{for high school}} students was developed by teachers in Michigan with support by the National Park Foundation. It includes lesson plans and activities for investigating a wide range of topics, including ecosystem biodiversity, population growth, habitats, environmental sustainability, land use, estimating wildlife abundance, native wildflowers, and contamination in Michigan waters. Additional teacher resources include a basic overview of wildlife and wildlife management, a listing of educational curricula and reference material, and information about a free video <b>tape</b> that offers <b>guidance</b> in the implementation of outdoor educational activities.

50|$|AGVs (some {{known as}} {{automated}} guided carts or AGCs) use tape for the guide path. The tapes {{can be one}} of two styles: magnetic or colored. The AGC is fitted with the appropriate guide sensor to follow the path of the tape.One major advantage of <b>tape</b> over wired <b>guidance</b> is that it can be easily removed and relocated if the course needs to change. Colored tape is initially less expensive, but lacks the advantage of being embedded in high traffic areas where the tape may become damaged or dirty. A flexible magnetic bar can also be embedded in the floor like wire but works under the same provision as magnetic tape and so remains unpowered or passive. Another advantage of magnetic guide tape is the dual polarity. small pieces of magnetic tape may be placed to change states of the AGC based on polarity and sequence of the tags.|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 18 - 20, 1966 / Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe {{need for}} large bit {{capacity}} in on-board data storage for deep-space probes, spacecraft, satellites, and aircraft, {{has created a}} requirement for a tape recorder of ultra-high reliability. In an ideal recorder, the conventional capstan would be eliminated and the reels would be driven such that the linear velocity and the tension of the tape between reels would be constant {{from the beginning to}} the end of the reel. The heads would also be the only elements in contact with the tape. Reliability would be enhanced by driving the reels, rather than the tape, through a reduction in the number of moving parts. Reducing the number of elements in contact with the tape would also increase tape life. The Iso-Elastic Drive, closely approaches the ideal recorder drive system. The reels are driven by a seamless polyester belt which is in direct contact with the periphery of the tape reel. The belt is driven at constant linear velocity (resulting in low flutter) and in such a manner that it generates a constant tension in the tape connecting the two reels and passing across the heads. Constant tape tension in a high-reliability recorder is necessary in order to optimize 1) <b>tape</b> tracking and <b>guidance,</b> 2) effective bias level on the tape during direct-type recording, 3) playback level, 4) head wear, and 5) drop-outs. The Iso-Elastic Drive reduces the number of moving parts by approximately 30 % as compared with conventional recorders. The tape drive has the additional desirable characteristic of operation equally well in either direction...|$|R
