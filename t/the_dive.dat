5|$|A jonline {{can also}} be used to tether the diver's {{equipment}} to <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> boat before or after <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> This helps the diver to put on or take off the equipment while in the water without drifting away from the boat. It is similar to a buddy line, which is used to tether two divers together during a dive.|$|E
5|$|Closed circuit rebreathers {{are usually}} {{controlled}} {{to provide a}} fairly constant partial pressure of oxygen during <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> (set point), and may be reset to a richer mix for decompression. The effect {{is to keep the}} partial pressure of inert gases as low as safely practicable throughout <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> This minimizes the absorption of inert gas in the first place, and accelerates the elimination of the inert gases during ascent.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>diving</b> {{medical officer}} and <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> medical {{technician}} insignia are awarded to naval medical personnel qualified as divers or medical technicians, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>diving</b> medical insignia resembles the master diver insignia, but {{is decorated with}} a caduceus. <b>The</b> <b>diving</b> medical officer insignia is gold in color while the enlisted version - <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> medical technician insignia - is silver in color.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>diving</b> {{supervisor}} is <b>the</b> professional <b>diving</b> {{team member}} who is {{directly responsible for}} <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> operation's safety and the management of any incidents or accidents that may occur during the operation; the supervisor is required to be available at the control point of <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> operation for <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> operation's duration, and to manage <b>the</b> planned <b>dive</b> and any contingencies that may occur. Details of competence, requirements, qualifications, registration and formal appointment differ depending on jurisdiction and relevant codes of practice. Diving supervisors are used in commercial diving, military diving, public safety diving and scientific diving operations.|$|R
5|$|Decompression {{obligation}} {{for a given}} dive profile must {{be calculated}} and monitored {{to ensure that the}} risk of decompression sickness is controlled. Some equipment is specifically for these functions, both during planning before <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> and during <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> Other equipment is used to mark the underwater position of the diver, as a position reference in low visibility or currents, or to assist the diver's ascent and control the depth.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>dive</b> {{profile is}} often {{recorded}} {{in some way}} {{as part of a}} permanent record of <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> Maximum depth, bottom time and any decompression required are routinely logged by most professional divers, for whom it may be a legal requirement, and by many recreational divers, for whom it is usually a recommendation of the training agencies.|$|E
5|$|This type of {{profile is}} common for dives at sites {{where there is a}} flat sea-bed or where the diver remains at the same place {{throughout}} <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> to work. It is the most demanding profile for decompression for a given maximum depth and time because inert gas absorption continues at maximum rate for most of <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> Decompression tables are drawn up {{based on the assumption that}} the diver may follow a square profile.|$|E

40|$|Scuba {{diving in}} Europe is start to become {{increasingly}} popular and consequently <b>the</b> <b>Diving</b> Centre sees more divers each year. It’s often necessary {{to use a}} vessel to transport the divers to <b>the</b> principal <b>diving</b> site. In general, the majority of <b>the</b> <b>Diving</b> Centres {{do not have a}} vessel designed and adapted for <b>the</b> <b>diving.</b> These vessels are pilot boats, fishing boats converted into Diving boats, which often are in poor condition and have few facilities. Therefore, the safety and <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> comfort leave much to be desired. These points were the main problem areas that Divers from <b>the</b> <b>Diving</b> Centre saw. <b>The</b> necessity to contain the security and the comfort in a Diving boat is fundamental.

5|$|<b>The</b> major <b>diving</b> {{accident}} and fatality research {{studies that have}} been conducted globally including work by the Divers Alert Network, <b>the</b> <b>Diving</b> Incident Monitoring Study, and Project Stickybeak have each identified cases where the mortality was associated with <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> cylinder.|$|R
5|$|Where <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> {{site and}} {{underwater}} topography permit, divers often prefer to descend to maximum depth and slowly ascend throughout <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> A slow ascent, and therefore slow pressure reduction, {{is a good}} decompression practice. When using a dive computer this type of profile may not require additional decompression stops. Dive computers, unlike decompression tables, measure depth and time at short intervals during <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> and calculate the exact decompression indicated by the decompression model, which for a multilevel profile will be less than for the square profile with the same maximum depth and duration.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{mountain}}eers dressed in Alpine costumes used {{to climb the}} mountain in early years, and eight divers between the ages 17 and 24 would dive off the waterfall. In the second season, all eight were Canadians who had competed in major diving competitions. Their schedule was six shows a day on every other day. <b>The</b> <b>dive</b> is 58 feet, and the pool is 13 feet deep in the centre and only 7 feet deep at the edges. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>dive,</b> they were descending at 40 miles per hour.|$|E
5|$|A {{personal}} dive {{computer is}} a small computer designed to be worn by a diver during a dive, with a pressure sensor and an electronic timer mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing which has been programmed to model the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues in real time during a dive. A display allows the diver to see critical data during <b>the</b> <b>dive,</b> including the maximum and current depth, duration of <b>the</b> <b>dive,</b> and decompression data including the remaining no decompression limit calculated in real time for the diver throughout <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> <b>The</b> <b>dive</b> computer keeps track of residual gas loading for each tissue used in the algorithm. Dive computers also provide a measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. Most dive computers will provide the necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent {{in the event that}} the no-decompression limits are exceeded. The use of computers to manage recreational dive decompression is becoming the standard and their use is also common in occupational scientific diving. Their value in surface supplied commercial diving is more restricted, but they can usefully serve as a dive profile recorder.|$|E

5|$|All Stuka {{units were}} moved to Germany's eastern border in {{preparation}} for the invasion of Poland. On the morning of 15 August 1939, during a mass-formation dive-bombing demonstration for high-ranking commanders of the Luftwaffe at Neuhammer training grounds near Sagan, 13 Ju 87s and 26 crew members were lost when they crashed into the ground almost simultaneously. The planes dived through cloud, expecting to release their practice bombs and pull out of <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> once below the cloud ceiling, unaware that on that particular day the ceiling was too low and unexpected ground mist formed, leaving them no time to pull out of <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the tissues retain {{residual}} inert gas {{in excess of}} the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> is influenced by the divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for inert gas preloading of the tissues which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E

During {{his time in}} Spain, Galland analysed the engagements, evaluated techniques and devised new ground-attack tactics which were {{passed on to the}} Luftwaffe. His experiences in pin-point ground assaults were used by Ernst Udet, a proponent of <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> bomber and leading supporter of the Junkers Ju 87 to push for Stuka wings. Wolfram von Richthofen, an opponent of Udet's, used them to push for the opposite: Schlachtflieger dual combination fighter-bombers. After trials with Henschel Hs 123s, Bf 109s and Ju 87s, the Junkers was selected to undergo trials for <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> bomber role.|$|E

5|$|Single {{cylinder}} with dual regulators {{consists of}} a single large back mounted cylinder, with two first-stage regulators, each with a second-stage regulator. This system is used for diving where cold water makes the risk of regulator freezing high and functional redundancy is required. It is common in continental Europe, especially Germany. The advantage is that a regulator failure can be solved underwater to bring <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> to a controlled conclusion without buddy breathing or gas sharing. However, {{it is hard to}} reach the valves, so there may be some reliance on <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> buddy to help close the valve of the free-flowing regulator quickly.|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} dive profile have been named. An {{analysis}} of dive profiles logged by dive computers by the Divers Alert Network used categorization rules which {{were based on}} the fraction of <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> time spent in four depth zones: descent, bottom, multilevel, and decompression. The descent zone was defined as the part of <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> between the surface and first reaching 85% of the maximum depth. The bottom zone is the part of <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> deeper than 85% of maximum depth. The multilevel zone is ascent from 85% to 25% of maximum depth, and the decompression zone is less than 25% of maximum cepth. A square dive was defined as having more than 40% of the total dive time in the bottom zone and not more than 30% in the multilevel and decompression zones. A multilevel was defined as having at least 40% of the total dive time in the multilevel zone. All other dives are considered to be intermediate.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{buoyancy}} of a diving cylinder during <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> {{can be more}} problematic with side-mounted cylinders, and the actual buoyancy at any point during <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> is a consideration with any cylinder that may {{be separated from the}} diver for any reason. Cylinders which will be stage-dropped or handed off to another diver should not change the diver's buoyancy beyond what can be compensated using their buoyancy compensator. Cylinders with approximately neutral buoyancy when full generally require the least compensation when detached.|$|E
