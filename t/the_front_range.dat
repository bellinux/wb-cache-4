5|$|Amtrak, the {{national}} passenger rail system, provides service to Denver, operating its California Zephyr daily {{in both directions}} between Chicago and Emeryville, California, across the bay from San Francisco. Amtrak Thruway service operated by private bus companies links the Denver station with Rocky Mountain points.

5|$|Plutonium milling {{operations}} produced {{large quantities}} of toxic cutting fluid contaminated with particles of plutonium and uranium. Thousands of 55-gallon drums of the waste were stored outside in an unprotected earthen area called the 903 pad storage area, where they corroded and leaked radionuclides over years into the soil and water. An estimated 5,000 gallons of plutonium-contaminated oil leached into the soil between 1964 and 1967. Portions of this waste, mixed with dust that composed Pad 903, became airborne in the heavy winds of <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> <b>Range</b> and contaminated offsite areas {{to the south and}} east.|$|E
5|$|As {{the freeway}} passes from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains, I-70 enters the Denver {{metropolitan}} area, {{part of a}} larger urban area called <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> <b>Range</b> Urban Corridor. The freeway arcs around the northern edge of the LoDo district, the common name of the lower downtown area of Denver. Through the downtown area, US40 is routed along Colfax Avenue, which served as the primary east–west artery through the Denver area before the construction of I-70. Through downtown, US6 is routed along 6th Avenue before departing the I-70 corridor to join Interstate76 on a northeast course toward Nebraska. The freeway meets Interstate25 in an interchange frequently called the Mousetrap. From I-25 on to I-225, I-70 serves—together with those two Interstates—as part of an inner beltway around Denver.|$|E

5|$|Colorado held several {{meetings}} to convince reluctant Utah officials they {{would benefit from}} a freeway link between Denver and Salt Lake City. Utah officials expressed concerns that, given the terrain between these cities, this link {{would be difficult to}} build. They later expressed concerns that the construction would drain resources from completing Interstate Highways they deemed to have a higher priority. Colorado officials persisted, presenting three alternatives to route I-70 west of Denver, using the corridors of US40, US6 and a route starting at Pueblo, proceeding west along US50/US285/US24. In March 1955, Colorado officials succeeded in convincing Utah officials with the state legislature passing a resolution supporting a link with Denver. The two states jointly issued a proposal to the U.S. Congress that would extend the plans for I-70 along the US6 corridor. Under this proposal the freeway would terminate at I-15 near Spanish Fork, Utah, linking <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> <b>Range</b> and Wasatch Front metropolitan areas.|$|E
5|$|The Morrison Formation is a {{sequence}} of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to radiometric dating, dates from between 156.3mya at its base, and 146.8mya at the top, placing it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period. This formation is interpreted as originating in a locally semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin, where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan; it was formed when the precursors to <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> <b>Range</b> of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Lourinhã Formation in Portugal and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania.|$|E
