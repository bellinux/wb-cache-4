25|$|Beginning {{with his}} Syntactic Structures (1957), a {{distillation}} of his Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory (1955), Chomsky challenges structural linguistics and introduces <b>transformational</b> <b>grammar.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bandler and Grinder {{also drew}} upon the {{theories}} of Gregory Bateson, Alfred Korzybski and Noam Chomsky (particularly <b>transformational</b> <b>grammar),</b> as well as ideas and techniques from Carlos Castaneda.|$|E
25|$|Chomsky's theory {{posits that}} {{language}} consists of both deep structures and surface structures. Surface structure 'faces out' and {{is represented by}} spoken utterances, while deep structure 'faces inward' and expresses the underlying relations between words and conceptual meaning. <b>Transformational</b> <b>grammar</b> is a generative grammar (which dictates that the syntax, or word order, of surface structures adheres to certain principles and parameters) that consists of a limited series of rules, expressed in mathematical notation, which transform deep structures into well-formed surface structures. The <b>transformational</b> <b>grammar</b> thus relates meaning and sound.|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} of phrase structure grammars has yielded many results of benefit to linguists in their investigation of these grammars, such as Chomsky’s characterization {{in terms of}} self-embedding of those context-free languages which are not regular. The recent shift of focus in linguistic theory to <b>transformational</b> <b>grammars</b> has not been accompanied by a similar application of mathematical techniques to transformations. Our present purpose is to foster such studies by providing general definitions which model grammatical trans-formations as mappings on trees (equivalently, labeled bracketings) and investigating ques-tions of current linguistic interest, such as the recursiveness of languages generated by <b>transformational</b> <b>grammars.</b> The first result of our research is that, despite the linguistically motivated, complex restrictions placed on <b>transformational</b> <b>grammars,</b> every recursively enumerable set of strings is a transformational language (Theorem 5. 1). We demonstrate that this power of <b>transformational</b> <b>grammars</b> to generate non-recursive languages results from their ability to cycle their rules, applying transformations an unbounded number of times (Corollary 6. 6). Analysis of decision procedures for grammars with bounded cycling reveals {{a connection between the}} amount of cycling permitted by a gram-mar and the complexity of the recursive set it generates; if cycling is bounded by any elementary recursive function (primitive recursive function, function in &? for n> 3), then the language generated has characteristic function in the same class (Cor-ollary 6. 7). One application of these results provides empirical support for the notion that natural languages are recursively, in fact elementarily, decidable. Our results also isolate one feature which must be further restricted in a linguistically motivated way if trans-formational theory is to achieve its goal of delimiting precisely the natural languages...|$|R

25|$|Bandler and Grinder {{say that}} they used their own process of {{modeling}} to model Virginia Satir so they could produce what they termed the Meta-Model, a model for gathering information and challenging a client's language and underlying thinking. They claim that by challenging linguistic distortions, specifying generalizations, and recovering deleted information in the client's statements, the <b>transformational</b> <b>grammar</b> concepts of surface structure yield a more complete representation of the underlying deep structure and therefore have therapeutic benefit. Also derived from Satir were anchoring, future pacing and representational systems.|$|E
25|$|Linguistics is the {{scientific}} study of language. Chomskyan linguistics (an inclusive, though perhaps informal, label for the theories and methodologies of linguistic study spearheaded by Noam Chomsky, meant to encompass his extensive work and influence in the field) includes everything from Chomsky's earliest work in <b>transformational</b> <b>grammar</b> to more recent work in the Minimalist Program. More exactly, it is the study of the structure of language, or grammar. Chomskyan linguistics is defined by a particular theoretical foundation and methodological approach that sets it apart from other linguistic perspectives, such as those described by functional grammar or structuralism (per Leonard Bloomfield) for example. This particular approach to the study of language is also often referred to as Generative linguistics, which is attributed to Chomsky and his early generative grammar work.|$|E
25|$|Born to middle-class Ashkenazi Jewish {{immigrants}} in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. At {{the age of}} 16 he began studies at the University of Pennsylvania, taking courses in linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. From 1951 to 1955 he was appointed to Harvard University's Society of Fellows, where he developed the theory of <b>transformational</b> <b>grammar</b> {{for which he was}} awarded his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, in 1957 emerging as a significant figure in the field of linguistics for his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which remodeled the scientific study of language, while from 1958 to 1959 he was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He is credited as the creator or co-creator of the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of behaviorism, being particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner.|$|E
5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view of {{language}} have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements {{and then by}} presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using <b>transformational</b> <b>grammars.</b> Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature {{of the human mind}} and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way of contrast, such <b>transformational</b> <b>grammars</b> are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.|$|R

2500|$|Chomsky {{developed}} a formal theory of grammar where [...] transformations manipulated {{not just the}} surface strings, but the parse tree associated with them, making <b>transformational</b> <b>grammar</b> a system of tree automata. A transformational-generative (or simply <b>transformational)</b> <b>grammar</b> thus involved two types of productive rules: phrase structure rules, such as [...] "S → NP VP" [...] (meaning that a sentence may consist of a noun phrase followed by a verb phrase) etc., {{which could be used}} to generate grammatical sentences with associated parse trees (phrase markers, or P markers); and transformational rules, such as rules for converting statements to questions or active to passive voice, which acted on the phrase markers to produce further grammatically correct sentences. (For more details see the Transformations section below.) ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{the mid-1990s}} onwards, much {{research}} in <b>transformational</b> <b>grammar</b> has {{been inspired by}} Chomsky's Minimalist Program. The [...] "Minimalist Program" [...] aims at the further development of ideas involving economy of derivation and economy of representation, which had started to become significant in the early 1990s, but were still rather peripheral aspects of Transformational-generative grammar theory.|$|E
2500|$|Returning to {{the more}} general {{mathematical}} notion of a grammar, an important feature of all <b>transformational</b> <b>grammars</b> {{is that they are}} more powerful than context-free grammars. This idea was formalized by Chomsky in the Chomsky hierarchy. Chomsky argued {{that it is impossible to}} describe the structure of natural languages using context-free grammars. [...] His general position regarding the non-context-freeness of natural language has held up since then, although his specific examples regarding the inadequacy of CFGs in terms of their weak generative capacity were later disproven.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Transformational</b> <b>grammar</b> (TG) or transformational-{{generative}} grammar (TGG) is, in {{the study}} of linguistics, part of the theory of generative grammar, especially of naturally evolved languages, that considers grammar to be a system of rules that generate exactly those combinations of words which form grammatical sentences in a given language. TG involves the use of defined operations called transformations to produce new sentences from existing ones.|$|E
2500|$|Faulkner, himself, has not {{received}} widespread criticism for his work. However, NLP as a legitimate therapy has been criticized by the mainstream, academic and scientific community.
