50|$|Advocates {{argue that}} just as women are able <b>to</b> choose <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> have a child or not, men should also be able <b>to</b> choose <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> assume {{paternity}} or not.

5|$|Australia became {{directly}} involved when the Confederate navy visited {{in order to}} repair one of their warships.

5|$|Authorities {{disagree}} as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> Salientia is a superorder {{that includes}} the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. The Lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders, but an extinct salamander-like family, the Albanerpetontidae, is now considered part of Lissamphibia alongside the superorder Salientia. Furthermore, Salientia includes all three recent orders plus the Triassic proto-frog, Triadobatrachus.|$|E

5|$|Further, critics {{question}} the exact {{purpose of the}} scheme.

5|$|Identification of AVMs {{requires}} detailed {{medical imaging}} of the organs most commonly affected by these lesions.
