5|$|As {{a protein}} {{synthesis}} inhibitor, {{it affects the}} ability of bacteria to produce protein. This either stops growth or results in bacterial death. Although many antibiotics work <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> exact mechanism of action of linezolid appears to be unique in that it blocks the start of protein production, rather {{than one of the}} later steps. As of 2014 bacterial resistance to linezolid has remained low.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{attracted}} the attention of the United States Navy in the Cold War, since submarines in some waters can create a bright enough wake to be detected; a German submarine was sunk in the First World War, having been detected in <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> <b>The</b> navy was interested in predicting when such detection would be possible, and hence guiding their own submarines to avoid detection.|$|E

5|$|In {{parallel}} with the efforts of Pierce, Silcott's lawyers had requested access in November 1990 to his original interview notes, so that the seven pages from his crucial fifth interview – the notes he said were fabricated– could be submitted for an electrostatic detection analysis (ESDA). The test can identify a small electrostatic charge left on a page when the page above it is written on; in <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> test's developers say, the chronological integrity of interview notes can be determined.|$|E

5|$|In {{tribute to}} his {{achievements}} at Arsenal, a bronze bust of Chapman, sculpted by Jacob Epstein resided inside the marble halls of the East Stand of Arsenal Stadium, Highbury until its closure in 2006 and will be reinstated there once redevelopment work in the stadium is completed. A replica sits in the Directors' Entrance at Emirates Stadium; {{he is one of}} only two Arsenal managers to be honoured <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> other being current manager Arsène Wenger.

5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of this failure, D. Luis de Haro, invaded Portugal and besieged Elvas, the main defensive system of Portugal - where the Portuguese army that had besieged Badajoz took refuge and was suffering a second catastrophic plague. A small relief army was improvised by the Portuguese which inflicted a crushing defeat to the Spanish army at the decisive battle of the Lines of Elvas (14 January 1659). <b>This</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese independence was granted while the Spanish reached military advantage in the secondary front of war, Minho and Galicia.|$|E

The 9th Battalion was transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps in December 1941, becoming 154th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps, retaining their North Staffords cap badge on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps, as did all other infantry units converted in <b>this</b> <b>way.</b> <b>The</b> regiment was assigned to 36th Army Tank Brigade alongside RAC regiments converted from infantry battalions.

5|$|The Crusaders' mentality {{to imitate}} the customs from their Western European homelands meant that {{there were very few}} {{innovations}} developed from the culture of the crusader states. Three notable exceptions to this rule are the military orders, warfare and fortifications. The Hospitallers (Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem) were founded in Jerusalem before the First Crusade but added a martial element to its ongoing medical functions to become a much larger military order. In <b>this</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> knighthood entered the previously monastic and ecclestical sphere.|$|E

Friendly relations between the United States and France did not long survive the Jay Treaty which came into effect in 1796; by 1798 the two nations would be engaged in the Quasi War.|$|E

5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
5|$|After two years, {{the account}} went viral in 2011. While Capone {{remained}} anonymous, games journalists, such Kotaku and GameSetWatch, began {{to cover his}} tweets and journalists, such as Leigh Alexander (Gamasutra) and Alex Navarro (Giant Bomb), reposted his content. Journalists did not view the parody as a mockery but instead as representative of a growing dissatisfaction over clichéd trends in the mainstream games industry. In <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> account led to greater respect for Molyneux's temerity. Kotaku wrote that Capone's account displayed uncharacteristic creativity on his part, but Capone countered by saying that most game designers have endless game ideas and that real skill rests in applying them well.|$|E
5|$|Amanita aestivalis is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, {{meaning it}} forms a mutualistic relationship in which the vegetative hyphae of the fungus grow around and enclose the tiny roots of trees and shrubs. In <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> plant is better able to absorb phosphorus and other soil nutrients, while the fungus receives moisture, protection, and nutritive byproducts of the plant's metabolism. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow {{on the ground in}} deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests. A preference has been noted for oak woods containing Tsuga or Pinus species, as well as beech wood with Picea, Abies, and Betula. Fruit bodies typically appear from late June until autumn. In North America, it has been found in the states of New England, as well as Alabama, New York, and Virginia. The distribution extends north to the southeastern provinces of Canada and south to Florida.|$|E
