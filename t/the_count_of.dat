5|$|Andorra {{has been}} a co-principality since the signing of a paréage in 1278, when <b>the</b> <b>count</b> <b>of</b> Foix and the bishop of La Seu d'Urgell agreed to share {{sovereignty}} over the landlocked country. After the title of <b>the</b> <b>count</b> <b>of</b> Foix had been passed to the kings of Navarre, and after Henry of Navarre had become Henry IV of France, an edict was issued in 1607 which established the French head of state as the legal successor to <b>the</b> <b>count</b> <b>of</b> Foix {{in regard to the}} paréage. Andorra was annexed by the First French Empire together with Catalonia in 1812–1813. After the Empire's demise, Andorra became independent again. The current joint monarchs are Bishop Joan Enric Vives Sicília and President Emmanuel Macron of France.|$|E

5|$|Finally, the King {{arranged}} for Stephen to marry Matilda in 1125, the daughter and only heiress of <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Boulogne, who owned both the important continental port of Boulogne and vast estates in the north-west and south-east of England. In 1127, William Clito, a potential claimant to the English throne, seemed {{likely to become}} <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Flanders; Stephen was sent by the King {{on a mission to}} prevent this, and in the aftermath of his successful election, William Clito attacked Stephen's lands in neighbouring Boulogne in retaliation. Eventually a truce was declared, and William Clito died the following year.|$|E
5|$|Osbert's lands were chiefly in Norfolk and Suffolk, but he {{also had}} some lands in Essex and some from <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Perche. Other lands were held from two monastic houses in East Anglia: St Benet Holme and Bury St Edmunds.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Artois did {{not join}} the court-in-exile in Hartwell, preferring to {{continue}} his frivolous life in London. Louis's friend <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Avaray left Hartwell for Madeira in 1809, and died there in 1811. Louis replaced Avaray with the Comte de Blacas as his principal political advisor. Queen Marie Joséphine died on 13 November 1810. That same winter, Louis suffered a particularly severe case of gout, which was a recurring problem for him at Hartwell, {{and he had to}} be put in a wheelchair.|$|E

Particular importance was achieved by <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Laurenburg, who later called themselves <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Nassau. In <b>the</b> east, the Landgraves of Hesse put it about that they could beat the Archbishopric of Mainz on the battlefield. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Wied, <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Sayn-Wittgenstein and <b>the</b> Electorate of Trier were all prominent landlords.|$|R

5|$|The kings {{exempted}} {{some communities}} from {{the jurisdiction of}} the voivodes. The Diploma Andreanum, a royal charter of 1224, placed the territory of the Saxons between Broos (Szászváros, Orăștie) and Barót (Baraolt) under the authority of <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Hermannstadt (Nagyszeben, Sibiu), who was appointed by and directly subordinate to the monarchs. Likewise, a special royal official, <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> the Székelys, administered the Székely community from around 1228. In the latter case, the two offices were united by custom in 1462: from then on each voivode was also appointed Count of the Székelys.|$|E
50|$|Originally part of Comminges, {{the valleys}} of Aure, Barousse, Neste, and Magnoac were {{detached}} from Comminges in the 11th century and were divided between <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> Aure, vassals of the kings <b>of</b> Aragon, and <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> Astarac (in Gascony). <b>The</b> line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> Aure ended in 1242 without a male heir, {{and the county}} of Aure was inherited by <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> Labarthe (residing in La Barthe-de-Neste), who by then possessed the three other valleys of Neste, Barousse, and Magnoac. Thus, the four valleys were unified under <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> Labarthe, and began {{to be known as}} Quatre-Vallées. <b>The</b> <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> Labarthe were vassals of the kings of Aragon, and so Quatre-Vallées was part of the kingdom of Aragon.|$|R

50|$|Zeeland was a contested {{area between}} <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> Holland and Flanders until 1299, when <b>the</b> last <b>count</b> <b>of</b> Holland died, <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Hainaut {{gained control of}} the countship of Zeeland. Followed by <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> Bavaria, Burgundy and Habsburg.

5|$|The {{royal family}} {{was forced to}} leave the palace at Versailles on the day after The Women's March on Versailles, 5 October 1789. They were re-located to Paris. There, <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Provence and his wife lodged in the Luxembourg Palace, {{while the rest of the}} royal family stayed in the Tuileries Palace. In March 1791, the National Assembly created a law {{outlining}} the regency of Louis Charles in case his father died while he was still too young to reign. This law awarded the regency to Louis Charles' nearest male relative in France (at that time <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Provence), and after him, the Duke of Orléans (bypassing <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Artois). If Orléans were unavailable, the regency would be submitted to election.|$|E

5|$|A manor {{had existed}} at Ashby-de-la-Zouch {{from at least}} 1086, when the {{location}} was known as Ascebi. The lands were acquired by Robert de Beaumont, <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Meulan and later Earl of Leicester, in 1100. He established the Belmeis family there as his tenants and, after the Belmeis family line died out in 1160, the earls of Leicester reassigned the estate to the le Zouch family, from whom the manor took its later name.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Foix flourished {{from the}} 11th to the 15th century.

5|$|Allied troops entered Paris on 31 March 1814. Louis, however, {{was unable}} to walk, and so sent <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Artois to France in January 1814. Louis XVIII issued letters patent {{appointing}} Artois Lieutenant General of the Kingdom {{in the event of}} the Bourbons being restored. Napoleon I abdicated on 11 April, five days after his Senate had invited the Bourbons to re-assume the throne of France.|$|E
5|$|Although John was <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Poitou and {{therefore}} the rightful feudal lord over the Lusignans, they could legitimately appeal John's actions in France to his own feudal lord, Philip. Hugh did exactly this in 1201 and Philip summoned John to attend court in Paris in 1202, citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case. John was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way. He argued that he need not attend Philip's court because of his special status as the Duke of Normandy, who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court. Philip argued that he was summoning John not as the Duke of Normandy, but as <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Poitou, which carried no such special status. When John still refused to come, Philip declared John in breach of his feudal responsibilities, reassigned all of John's lands that fell under the French crown to Arthur – {{with the exception of}} Normandy, which he took back for himself – and began a fresh war against John.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the early}} history of {{habitation}} in the area is limited, the Romans called the settlement Caletum. Julius Caesar mustered 800 to 1,000 sailing boats, five legions and some 2,000 horses at Calais due to its strategic position to attack Britannia. At some time prior to the 10th century, {{it would have been a}} Flemish speaking fishing village on a sandy beach backed by pebbles and a creek, with a natural harbour located at the western edge of the early medieval estuary of the River Aa. As the pebble and sand ridge extended eastward from Calais, the haven behind it developed into fen, as the estuary progressively filled with silt and peat. Subsequently, canals were cut between Saint-Omer, the trading centre formerly at the head of the estuary, and three places to the west, centre and east on the newly formed coast: respectively Calais, Gravelines and Dunkirk. Calais was improved by <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Flanders in 997 and fortified by <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Boulogne in 1224.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the rulers of the county of Chiny begins with <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Ivois, then with <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Chiny, and finally with <b>the</b> merging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Chiny and Looz. <b>The</b> final <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Chiny, Arnold IV de Runimgy, sold the county to the Duke of Luxembourg, ending a dynasty of five hundred years. Belgian {{historian}} Léon Vanderkindere has written extensively about Chiny and Looz.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Rosselló, in {{alliance}} with their cousins <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Empuriés,tried to resist this dilution of their power. However <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Barcelona steadily gained suzerainty over theother Catalan counts, {{a process which}} was virtually complete by the twelfth century. <b>The</b> last <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Rosselló, Girard II, left his title to theCrown of Aragon on his death in 1172 to prevent the territory passing to his illegitimate half-brothers.|$|R

5|$|Dissension {{resulting}} from inadequate government attention to Army needs was restrained under {{the generation of}} officers who had begun their careers during the 1820s. These officers were loyal to the monarchy, believed the military should be under civilian control, and abhorred the caudillism (Hispanic-American dictatorships) against which they had fought. But by the early 1880s, this generation (including commanders such as the Duke of Caxias, <b>the</b> <b>Count</b> <b>of</b> Porto Alegre, and the Marquis of Erval) had died, were retired, or no longer exercised direct command.|$|E

5|$|From the 15th century, {{changes to}} the areas {{surrounding}} Santa María de Óvila initiated a slow decline. Civil wars depopulated the villages of the upper Tagus valley.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> Winterthur, a cadet branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> Bregenz, built Kyburg {{castle in}} the 10th century. With <b>the</b> {{extinction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> Winterthur in 1053, the castle passed to <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> <b>of</b> Dillingen. Winterthur {{as a city}} (presumably {{on the site of}} a pre-existing village) was founded by Hartmann III of Dillingen in 1180, shortly before his death in the same year. From 1180 to 1263, Winterthur was ruled by the cadet line of the House of Kyburg.|$|R
5000|$|Ittenhausen {{once belonged}} to <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Veringen, after their {{extinction}} to <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Rechberg and in 1447 {{for a short time}} to <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> <b>of</b> Württemberg, who sold it again in 1465. With the resolution of the monastery Zwiefalten in 1803 the place with 200 inhabitants fell to the Duchy, later Kingdom of Württemberg.|$|R
