5|$|Ivory and the Right <b>to</b> <b>Censor</b> began feuding with Chyna {{after the}} latter posed for Playboy in late 2000. On the December 7 episode of Raw, Ivory and Val Venis {{delivered}} a double-team piledriver to Chyna, which in storyline, injured her neck. Chyna challenged Ivory for the Women's Championship at the Royal Rumble on January 21, 2001. Ivory retained her title when she pinned Chyna, who had appeared to re-aggravate her neck injury. Chyna challenged Ivory {{for the title}} once more at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1 and defeated Ivory in a brief match, ending Ivory's third reign as Women's Champion. The Right <b>to</b> <b>Censor</b> stable was finally disbanded on April 26, 2001.|$|E

5|$|On the June 26, 2000 {{edition of}} Raw, the APA won a Tag-Team Battle Royal against seven other teams {{to win a}} WWF Tag Team Championship match. During {{the weeks leading up}} to Fully Loaded, Edge and Christian avoided {{defending}} the Tag Team Championship against the APA. On July 10, 2000, the APA were scheduled to face Edge and Christian for the Tag Team Championship, but Edge announced that he would face Bradshaw one-on-one in a match, which Bradshaw lost. Later that week on SmackDown!, Edge and Christian were scheduled to defend their Tag Team Championship against the APA, but they again made a one-on-one match, where Christian was defeated by Faarooq. At Fully Loaded, the APA won the Tag Team match by disqualification; due to WWF rules, Edge and Christian retained the Tag Team Championship. On the September 7, 2000 edition of SmackDown!, the Dudley Boyz and the APA formed an alliance. The following week on Raw, the APA faced Right <b>to</b> <b>Censor</b> (Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather) in a losing effort. Then, on the September 18, 2000 edition of Raw, the Dudley Boyz also lost to Buchanan and The Goodfather. After the match, all the members of the Right <b>to</b> <b>Censor</b> (Buchanan, The Goodfather, Steven Richards, and Val Venis) attacked the Dudley Boyz, which resulted in the APA coming out to help the Dudley Boyz, as a part of their alliance. The Dudley Boyz and the APA were then booked in an Eight-man Tag Team match against Right <b>to</b> <b>Censor</b> at Unforgiven, which Right <b>to</b> <b>Censor</b> won via pinfall.|$|E
5|$|The Hardyz became {{involved}} in a feud with both Edge and Christian and Right <b>to</b> <b>Censor.</b> At Survivor Series, the Hardyz along with the Dudleyz defeated Edge and Christian and Right <b>to</b> <b>Censor</b> in a Survivor Series elimination match. At Rebellion, the Hardy Boyz faced Right <b>to</b> <b>Censor</b> in a rematch for the titles but were unable to win the titles when Val Venis interfered. On the December 4 episode of Raw Is War, Dean Malenko defeated the Hardy Boyz' valet Lita to retain the Light Heavyweight Championship and earn himself a date with her three days later on SmackDown! On the December 7 episode of SmackDown!, however, when Malenko took Lita on a date, he received a beating from the Hardyz. The Hardyz began feuding with Malenko and his friends, The Radicalz (Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, Malenko, and Perry Saturn). The two teams faced each other in several tag team and singles matches on Raw Is War and SmackDown!. The two teams also squared off against each other at Armageddon with Guerrero, Malenko and Saturn taking on the Hardyz and Lita. The Radicalz won the match.|$|E
5|$|At SummerSlam, the Hardy Boyz were {{defeated}} in the first ever TLC match for the Tag Team Championship, which Edge and Christian won, and in which the Dudley Boyz also competed. At Unforgiven, however, the Hardy Boyz defeated Edge and Christian in a steel cage match to win the Tag Team Championship for a second time. They re-lost the title to Edge and Christian (who were dressed as Los Conquistadores) at No Mercy, but they won the titles back the next night on Raw for a third time. During the match, the Hardy Boyz were dressed as Los Conquistadores, but tore off their masks after the match, revealing themselves. The team lost the title {{less than a month}} later to Right <b>to</b> <b>Censor</b> (Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather) on the November 6 episode of Raw Is War, when Edge and Christian came out and assaulted the Hardyz, allowing Right <b>to</b> <b>Censor</b> to pick up the win and the title.|$|E

5|$|The English {{language}} {{version of the}} Dragon Ball manga is licensed for North America by Viz Media. Viz originally published the first 194 chapters as Dragon Ball and chapters over 195 as Dragon Ball Z to mimic {{the names of the}} anime series, feeling it would reduce the potential for confusion by its readers. They initially released both series simultaneously, chapter by chapter in a monthly comic book format starting in 1998, before stopping in 2000 to switch to a graphic novel format similar to the Japanese tankÅbon. In 2000, while releasing Dragon Ball in the monthly format, Viz began <b>to</b> <b>censor</b> the manga in response to parental complaints about sexual innuendos. Viz changed their publishing format for the series again in 2003; the first ten collected volumes of both series were re-released under their Shonen Jump imprint. They have slightly smaller dimensions. The manga was completed in English with Dragon Ball in 16 volumes between May 6, 2003, and August 3, 2004, and Dragon Ball Z in 26 volumes from May 6, 2003, to June 6, 2006. However, when publishing the last few volumes of Z, the company began <b>to</b> <b>censor</b> the series again by changing or removing gun scenes and changing the few sexual references. Dragon Ball Z, from Trunk's appearance to chapter 226, was published in Viz's monthly magazine Shonen Jump from its debut issue in January 2003 to April 2005.|$|E

In the linear regression case, the proposed approach implies the use of mean imputation of the censored regressor. The use of flexible parametric models for the distribution of the covariate is employed.

5|$|Because it {{contained}} suggestive dialogue {{and the female}} cast wore revealing clothes, the production was considered highly risquÃ© at the time.

A New York City magistrate ruled the Broadway production was obscene, and obscenity charges were brought against Woods, but a grand jury declined to indict him. The city's Commissioner of Licenses attempted to revoke the theater's license, but this effort was blocked in court. Woods promoted the controversy to increase ticket sales, and the play {{was one of the most}} successful of the season. It had no long-term literary impact and was never published, but it did stimulate arguments over censorship of theatrical performances.|$|E

Conflicts notably escalated throughout the 2009 contest: during the semi-finals, Azeri officials objected to the depiction of the Nagorno-Karabakh monument We Are Our Mountains during an introductory video for the Armenian entry. Armenia responded during the finals by displaying multiple images of the monument whilst presenting its results. Following the contest, allegations emerged that Azerbaijan's state broadcaster had tampered with its feed of the broadcast <b>to</b> <b>censor</b> the Armenian entry, and that the Azeri government was interrogating citizens who voted for Armenia, accusing them of being unpatriotic and a threat to security.

40|$|There {{are often}} reasons {{to suppose that}} there is {{dependence}} between the time to event and time <b>to</b> <b>censoring,</b> or informative censoring, for survival data, particularly when considering medical data. This is because the decision to treat or not is often made according to prognosis, usually with the most ill patients being prioritised. Due to identifiability issues, sensitivity analyses are often used to assess whether non-informative <b>censoring</b> can lead <b>to</b> misleading results. In this paper, a sensitivity analysis method for piecewise exponential survival models is presented. This method assesses {{the sensitivity of the}} results of standard survival models to small amounts of dependence between the time to failure and time <b>to</b> <b>censoring</b> variables. It uses the same assumption about the dependence between the time to failure and time <b>to</b> <b>censoring</b> as previous sensitivity analyses for both standard parametric survival models and the Cox model. However, the method presented in this paper allows the use of more flexible models for the marginal distributions whilst remaining computationally simple.

The study found that the sensitivity analysis performs well in many situations, but not when the data has a high proportion of censoring...|$|R
