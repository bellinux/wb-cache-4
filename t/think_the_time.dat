25|$|Stalin {{initially}} did not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> {{was right}} for a war in Korea. Chinese Communist forces were still embroiled in the Chinese Civil War, while U.S. forces remained stationed in South Korea. By spring 1950, {{he believed that the}} strategic situation had changed: Mao's Communist forces had secured final victory in China, U.S. forces had withdrawn from Korea, and the Soviets detonated their first nuclear bomb, breaking the U.S. atomic monopoly. As the U.S. had not directly intervened to stop the communist victory in China, Stalin calculated that they would be even less willing to fight in Korea, which had much less strategic significance. The Soviets had also cracked the codes used by the U.S. to communicate with their embassy in Moscow, and reading these dispatches convinced Stalin that Korea did not have the importance to the US that would warrant a nuclear confrontation. Stalin began a more aggressive strategy in Asia based on these developments, including promising economic and military aid to China through the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} interview, {{when asked whether}} the series had finished, both co-creators {{answered}} with a simultaneous [...] "Yes!". Morris expressed that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> is right. After the first film, I wanted to hear more from Jay, Will, Neil and Simon. But this time I feel there is enough. There {{is more than enough}} Jay in this world", and Beesley added [...] "The end of the story has always felt like the time where they go off and start living their adult life. And I think this film takes us up to that point".|$|E
500|$|Early in his presidency, Hay and Nicolay {{requested}} {{and received}} permission from Lincoln {{to write his}} biography. By 1872, Hay was [...] "convinced {{that we ought to}} be at work on our 'Lincoln.' I don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> for publication has come, but the time for preparation is slipping away." [...] Robert Lincoln in 1874 formally agreed to let Hay and Nicolay use his father's papers; by 1875, they were engaged in research. Hay and Nicolay enjoyed exclusive access to Lincoln's papers, which were not opened to other researchers until 1947. They gathered documents written by others, as well as many of the Civil War books already being published. [...] They at rare times relied on memory, such as Nicolay's recollection of the moment at the 1860 Republican convention when Lincoln was nominated, but for much of the rest relied on research.|$|E

500|$|Digital Spy writer Catriona Wightman {{found the}} episode [...] "completely absurd" [...] but [...] "brillantly entertaining." [...] Morgan Glennon of BuddyTV wrote, [...] "Despite how ridiculous it was seeing {{character}} after character after character {{try to save}} Blair from her own stupid decisions, Gossip Girl really {{knows how to do}} big events. After 100 episodes, the show understood that it needed to go big to top off the royal wedding storyline. So the wedding, and attendant quest to stop it, was as big, dramatic and heartfelt as Gossip Girl at its best." [...] Glennon also conceded about the Gossip Girl reveal, the show can still pull out those OMG moments. Glennon found Georgina [...] "amazing" [...] in the episode, [...] "you can't even take your eyes off her because she's so great in every scene." [...] However, The Atlantic Wire thought the writers [...] "should have waited until the last-ever episode to do the unveiling" [...] of Gossip Girl and questioned, [...] "isn't that indicative of the show's greater failings over these past four and a half years? That constant need of this once-promising show to tip its hand too soon?" [...] and concluded [...] "we <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> has finally come to remove Gossip Girl from our bookmarks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, in Zürich {{during a}} 2005 conference of Tibetan Buddhist Centers, His Holiness said, [...] "Now I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> has come; {{we should start}} a working group or committee" [...] to meet with monks from other Buddhist traditions. Looking at the German bhikṣuṇī Jampa Tsedroen, he instructed, [...] "I prefer that Western Buddhist nuns carry out this work… Go to {{different}} places for further research and discuss with senior monks (from various Buddhist countries). I think, first, senior bhikshunis need to correct the monks' way of thinking.|$|E
2500|$|News of {{casualties}} {{suffered by the}} British Expeditionary Force in Belgium was already turning the public mood against [...] "business as usual" [...] and on 27 August a letter written by W.G. Grace was published in The Sportsman in which he declared that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> has arrived when the county cricket season should be closed, for it is not fitting {{at a time like}} this that able-bodied men should be playing cricket by day and pleasure-seekers look on. I should like to see all first-class cricketers of suitable age set a good example and come to the help of their country without delay in its hour of need." ...|$|E

2500|$|Youzhny {{resigned}} from the Russian Davis Cup team in February 2011, stating, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> has come for me step aside and give younger players a chance". He added, [...] "Now, I want to {{devote more time to}} my family and concentrate on individual tournaments". However, he competed at the 2011 Davis Cup tie with Brazil, stating that [...] ""We're in a tough situation right now and I thought it was my duty to help the team. Therefore, I've made myself available for that tie." [...] Youzhny won both of his rubbers, the first against Ricardo Mello, while he took over five hours to defeat Thomaz Bellucci, 14–12 in the fifth set. In his last Davis Cup match so far, in 2012, Youzhny partnered with Nikolay Davydenko to beat Austria doubles team Oliver Marach and Alexander Peya.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1909, Michigan hired Philip Bartelme as the school's second {{athletic}} director following {{the resignation of}} Charles A. Baird. [...] The change in {{athletic director}}s led to speculation that Michigan might be prepared {{to return to the}} Western Conference. [...] In September 1909, Barthelme stated his intention to return Michigan to the conference, though he did not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> was yet right. [...] He told the press, [...] "I always have thought that Michigan's place is in the conference, and moreover, I have thought that when conditions were so we could return, it would be the only thing for us to do. [...] However, I am not so sure that that time has come." [...] He noted that the [...] "training table" [...] was the biggest obstacle to Michigan's rejoining the conference and contended that the training table was [...] "a great factor in getting the men into the condition necessary for hard football" [...] and avoiding serious injuries.|$|E
2500|$|When {{she came}} to the Lantern Gate, she stayed and viewed the king's ships, the Lion and the Sweepstake, decked with 100 banners of silk and gold, wherein were 200 master gunners and mariners and 31 trumpets, “and a double drum that was never seen in England before”; and so her Grace entered into Calais. At her entry, 150 pieces of {{ordnance}} let out of the said two ships made such a smoke that one of her train could not see another. “Where stood in order on both sides the streets, like a lane, with 500 soldiers in the King's livery of the retinue of Calais, and the mayor of Calais with his brethren, and the commons of Calais, and the merchants of the Staple, stood in like manner in array, and made a lane wherethrough she passed to her lodging.” There the mayor and his brethren came to her and gave her 50 sovereigns of gold, and the mayor of the Staple, 60. Next morning “she had a gun shot, justing and all other royalty that could be devised in the King's garrison;” and kept open household there for the 15 days that she remained." [...] The Admiral had been instructed by Henry VIII to [...] "cheer my lady and her train so they <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> short". Anne knew little English, so, with the assistance of an interpreter, he taught her to play [...] "Sent" [...] and other card games that the king enjoyed, with Gregory Cromwell taking part.|$|E

30|$|Prof. Sharifian: That {{is a key}} question. I {{remember}} when I was teaching English in Iran, learners could only practice communication in English with their fellow Iranian learners. But I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> have changed a bit. I think we can now explore {{the potential of the}} new technology for helping learners develop metacultural competence. Computer networks are currently being used in many contexts to engage learners in what is known as ‘telecollaboration’ or ‘online intercultural exchange’. In general, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) can offer fruitful opportunities for learners to communicate with speakers from other cultural backgrounds. That is an opportunity that did not exist when I was an English language teacher.|$|R
