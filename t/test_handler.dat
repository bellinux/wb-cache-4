Turret based <b>test</b> <b>handler</b> is a general kind of IC <b>Test</b> <b>Handler</b> for final testing. This paper discusses how to develop a general control system for a <b>test</b> <b>handler</b> of turret style in which every workstation moves up and down separately based on an industrial control computer. The combination of object-oriented programming and the cycling scanning working mode is the key of the whole system. To achieve ideal performance, special control flags are designed as an efficient way for making all the workstations work as setting orders stably. The method to develop the control system in this paper can be also applied to similar systems, which would greatly reduce development cycles. A turret based <b>test</b> <b>handler</b> with this control system has passed the test of a semiconductor factory and operates well in actual production...|$|E
40|$|Engineers at the Energy Systems Laboratory at Texas A&M University have {{completed}} short term energy metering studies at {{a complex of}} offices in northern Texas and several buildings on the Texas A&M University campus during the past 18 months. These studies typically consisted of installing electrical metering at the, whole building level and included sub-metering of selected circuits when possible. Personnel would go through the entire facility ensuring that all lighting, fan, and mechanical systems were active and on. After a period of approximately 10 minutes, a selected areas of the building would be "turned off. " This sequence was repeated for all areas {{of interest in the}} facility. At the end of the lighting <b>test,</b> air <b>handlers,</b> then chilling and pumping equipment was turned off (if applicable) and a final ten minutes of electrical use data taken. In each of these facilities, lighting system load verification was the primary goal and the data provided a very good accounting for all buildings studied. The northern Texas office buildings in particular, were interested in these data for comparison with a recently hired performance contractor. The A&M study was a follow-up to an earlier lighting study that had been conducted by the campus energy office. Base electrical load data was also determined from these tests.

40|$|The authors {{investigated}} {{the prevalence of}} haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies to four strains of influenza viruses among handlers of live pigs in Ibadan, Nigeria. Venous blood specimens were collected from thirty pig handlers (out {{of a total of}} forty-eight) at three locations in Ibadan in April and May 2008. The overall prevalence of antibodies to influenza viruses was 100 %, while those of influenza A and B viruses were 68. 3 % and 58. 3 %, respectively. The prevalence of influenza A/Brisbane/ 59 / 2007 (H 1 N 1), A/Brisbane/ 10 / 2007 (H 3 N 2), B/Shanghai/ 361 / 2002 -like and B/Malaysia/ 2506 / 2004 -like was 46. 7 %, 90. 0 %, 76. 7 % and 40. 0 %, respectively. A total of 96. 7 % (n = 30) of pig <b>handlers</b> <b>tested</b> had polytypic influenza antibody reactions.

40|$|Event-driven user {{interface}} applications typically have a sin-gle thread of execution that processes event handlers in re-sponse to input events {{triggered by the}} user, the network, or other applications. Programmers must ensure that event handlers terminate after {{a short amount of}} time because oth-erwise, the application may become unresponsive. This pa-per presents EventBreak, a performance-guided test genera-tion technique to identify and analyze event handlers whose execution time may gradually increase while using the ap-plication. The key idea is to systematically search for pairs of events where triggering one event increases the execution time of the other event. For example, this situation may hap-pen because one event accumulates data that is processed by the other event. We implement the approach for JavaScript-based web applications and apply it to three real-world appli-cations. EventBreak discovers events with an execution time that gradually increases in an unbounded way, which makes the application unresponsive, and events that, if triggered re-peatedly, reveal a severe scalability problem, which makes the application unusable. The approach reveals two known bugs and four previously unknown responsiveness problems. Furthermore, we show that EventBreak helps in <b>testing</b> that event <b>handlers</b> avoid such problems by bounding a handler’s execution time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Electrical-performance test (hereafter {{referred}} to as E-test) {{has always been one}} of the difficulties in final testing procedures for semiconductor. The accuracy, rapidity and generality are difficult to achieve in the E-test. This paper proposes a test method based on the characteristics of the E-test workstation of <b>test</b> <b>handler</b> for semiconductor, in which the whole test procedure is divided into two terminals: the control and the test terminal. The control terminal is integrated into the control system of <b>test</b> <b>handler,</b> while the test terminal is independently designed with generality for different semiconductor products. To achieve an ideal performance, the parallel work trait of E-test in this method is discussed. Finally, the method has been successfully implemented on the <b>test</b> <b>handler</b> for semiconductor in actual production...|$|E
40|$|This work {{reports the}} design of a {{fundamentally}} new semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) <b>test</b> <b>handler</b> thermal system, and its implementation {{in the development of a}} new commercially-sold product. The <b>test</b> <b>handler</b> is a manufacturing machine that automates the mechanical handling of IC devices for testing at any temperature in the range of- 600 C to 1600 C to a tolerance down to ± 10 C. A complete formulation and documentation for {{the design of}} the handler thermal system has been developed based on specific functional requirements and design objectives. The inability to deterministically design handler thermal systems and resolve thermal-related issues hinders the development of future semiconductor products, such as the upcoming RAMBUS or Synclink chips (high speed memory). To commercialize such new products, IC manufacturers must always wait for the development and production of higher performing test equipment which must meet ever-more stringent and higher performance requirements...|$|E
40|$|Traditional Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) adopts the Risk Priority Number (RPN) {{ranking model}} to {{evaluate}} failure risks, to rank failures, {{as well as}} to prioritize actions. Although this approach is simple, it suffers from several shortcomings. In this paper, we investigate a number of fuzzy inference techniques for determining the RPN scores, in an attempt to overcome the weaknesses associated with the traditional RPN model. The main objective is to examine the possibility of using fuzzy rule interpolation and reduction techniques to design new fuzzy RPN models. The performance of the fuzzy RPN models is evaluated using a real-world case study pertaining to the <b>test</b> <b>handler</b> process in a semiconductor manufacturing plant. The FMEA procedure for the <b>test</b> <b>handler</b> is performed, and a fuzzy RPN model is developed. In addition, improvement to the fuzzy RPN model is proposed by refining the weights of the fuzzy production rules, hence a new weighted fuzzy RPN model. The ability of the weighted fuzzy RPN model in failure risk evaluation with a reduced rule base is also demonstrated. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} animal-human {{interactions}} is important, as negative interactions {{may result in}} an animal being difficult to handle. Halter breaking {{is used as a}} means to make the process of moving and securing a calf easier, and theoretically should minimize stress for both the animal and handler. There are numerous ways that people can halter break a calf, for example tying up the cattle in barns for a defined period of time, touching the cattle for the first time using combs or using a “Talk and Touch” method. Anecdotal evidence shows with halter breaking that cattle have a side preference and it has been hypothesized that this side preference {{may be related to the}} side that vaccinations were given. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine if a calf indicates a side approachability preference during halter breaking that is dependent on vaccination side. A total of 20 crossbred Angus/Simmental steers from Iowa State University’s (ISU) breeding herd were used. Steers were between 7 and 9 mo of age, averaging 272 kg BW. Steer was the experimental unit. A 2 (left or right neck side for vaccination) x 2 (left or right approach side) factorial arrangement of treatments was compared. One month after weaning, each steer had a nylon halter affixed to his head 2 d prior to the steer side preference <b>test.</b> Each <b>handler</b> was blind to vaccination side. Approach side for each steer had been randomly assigned prior to the beginning of the trial. Halter breaking methodology was conducted over five defined steps. Students were asked at the end of the 1 -h period to conclude if the calf had a left, right, or no side preference. Data was analyzed using PROC GLIMMIX for the effects of vaccination side on subsequent halter breaking side preference. There was no difference observed between halter breaking side preference in relation to vaccination side (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). In conclusion, with this data set there was no halter breaking preference side related to vaccines given, indicating that the calves did not negatively associate humans with restraint and injections. This is helpful in understanding animal/human interactions as well as ability to approach an animal after vaccinations. This also implies that strategies such as the “Talk and Touch” method are useful in keeping calves calm and comfortable during halter breakin...|$|R
40|$|The scoring {{rules for}} the tables are {{described}} below. A few general comments are in order. Part way through the review, some of the vendors decided to withdraw. Items that are in curly braces {} are categories that we deemed important, but {{that none of the}} remaining vendors happen to cover. Two examples of times in curly braces are given here. First, none of the remaining vendors had unit test drivers for each function, a small program that tests each m-file function. We had scoring rules for how well the unit test drivers worked (“U ” and “U-WD”). We still feel that vendors should supply a sub-directory of unit test drivers because users might alter the supplied functions. A well done unit test driver not only tests a few cases, but it would also <b>test</b> the error <b>handlers</b> by putting in all possible combinations of wrong inputs and showing how the supplied function handles them. A second example of an empty category that is now marked in {} is constants in Table 4. 1. Ideally, the various constants should be implemented as global variables that you can centrally change, but all of the remaining vendors in the Oct 1998 review had hard-wired constants scattered about. So, the additional sub-categories within constants is now marked in In the first table, Toolbox overview, platforms, price, and the number of functions each product delivers are pretty much self explanatory. (Note that the tabulated disk space depends on the allocation block size being 32 Kbytes. An optimized file-system with better block sizes will use substantially less space. ...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{are part}} of the {{environment}} of domestic animals and interact with them daily, providing a good basis for the study of interspecific relationships. Abilities to discriminate and recognise individuals form the basis of these relationships, and they are crucial skills for domestic animals, since individual humans can differ in their behaviour towards them. At the same time, with experience, animals may develop a general memory of humans and generalise their behaviour towards strangers. This study aimed {{to determine the extent to}} which weaned piglets can discriminate familiar humans and generalise their past experience when faced with unfamiliar humans. Forty-eight groups of three piglets were submitted to two consecutive 5 -day conditioning periods of the same or opposite valence (positive and/or negative) given by one (A) or two (A then B) handlers. The reactivity of piglets to a motionless human and to an approaching human was measured before and after conditioning periods with unfamiliar and familiar handlers. Thereafter, piglets which received treatments with the two handlers A and B were subjected to a choice <b>test</b> between both <b>handlers.</b> The reactivity to an approaching human appeared to better reflect the past experience with familiar handlers since piglets clearly recognised them and adapted their behaviour accordingly. In contrast, reaction of piglets to a motionless human reflected their natural propensity to seek interaction, even after a negative experience. Although piglets were able to extend their memory of humans to an unfamiliar human through generalisation, many factors seemed to interact in this process, especially the complexity of the previous experience (inconsistent vs consistent) and the context in which piglets met the unfamiliar human (motionless vs approaching). We conclude that discrimination and generalisation processes of reactivity to humans do not simply rely on past interactions, but also depend on the context according to the degree of similitude with their past experience...|$|R

40|$|The {{breeding}} {{goal for}} The Swedish Warmblood horse is a performance-oriented temperament with good riding ability, {{which makes the}} horse competitive internationally in the different contests. It could be assumed that horses with high competitive temperament are more sensitive, and have higher reactivity towards the environment, human handling and new objects. Thus, making them harder to break and educate. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if a handling test could be used as a prognostic tool to predict how a horse would react during the break in. While the secondary aim of the study was to investigate if by judging the horse’s reactivity, cooperation and relaxation compile how the individual horse would react during break in. In this study five two-year old horses, two mares and three geldings, was used during a period of eight weeks, in which they were handled and broken in. Three handling test was performed; one test before the breaking in process, the second during the breaking process, and the third after the horses were broken in. During the first two tests, the horses where led through the course with unknown handlers with experience of horse handling, and at the third test the horses were led by a person with no earlier experience with horses where used. There were no differences between horses in results from the handling <b>tests,</b> but the <b>handler</b> with no earlier experience of horses affected the horses during the last test, and the horses scored lower points.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the test-retest reliability of some variables used to assess the quality of human–animal relationship. These variables were: time needed to isolate a subject from the group in a corner of the pen (TI), isolation time (IT) and number of flight attempts (FA). They were recorded in 1 farm on 30 Italian Freisian males aged 10 months.
