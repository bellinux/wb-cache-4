5|$|As {{commander}} of the Foederati, Thomas was based at Amorion, {{the capital of the}} Anatolic <b>Theme.</b> Although junior to the theme's strategos (military governor), his proclamation received widespread support throughout Asia Minor. Within a short time, all the Asian themes supported Thomas, except for the Opsician <b>Theme</b> under the patrician Katakylas, a nephew of Michael II, and the Armeniac <b>Theme,</b> under its strategos, Olbianos. The Thracesian <b>Theme</b> wavered between the two rivals, but finally threw its support behind Thomas. More than two-thirds of the empire's Asian army eventually aligned with Thomas, while the defection of the provincial tax officials provided him with much-needed revenue.|$|E

5|$|Development {{took about}} a year and a half, with the team aiming for as much realism as possible. Certain features, {{including}} multiplayer, were dropped. Over 15 million copies were sold, and ports for various games consoles were released, most in 1995. <b>Theme</b> Park received generally positive reviews. Reviewers praised the gameplay and humour, but criticised console ports for reasons such as lack of save or mouse support. The game received a Japanese localisation (in addition to normal Japanese releases), Shin <b>Theme</b> Park, released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, and remakes for the Nintendo DS and iOS, released in 2007 and 2011 respectively. <b>Theme</b> Hospital is Bullfrog's thematic successor to the game, and two direct sequels followed: <b>Theme</b> Park World (known as Sim <b>Theme</b> Park in some territories) and <b>Theme</b> Park Inc (also known as SimCoaster).|$|E
5|$|Each {{year the}} event has a <b>theme,</b> and {{includes}} a cocktail hour and a formal dinner. During the cocktail hour, guests arrive {{to walk on the}} red carpet, tour the year's special themed exhibition, and be seated before the dinner party that includes entertainment from the preeminent entertainers of the day. The <b>theme</b> not only sets the tone for the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold the <b>theme</b> of the year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, the <b>theme</b> is a bit befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 the <b>theme</b> may be far more challenging to one gender than the other.|$|E
5|$|Finale in {{moderate}} or fast tempo, and in sonata or rondo-sonata form. The {{themes of}} the finales are characterized by long passages of melody accompanied by relentless flowing rhythms. The exposition has no repeat written in. The development section is more ordinary in style {{than that of the}} first movement, with frequent modulations, sequences, and fragmentation of the exposition's first <b>theme</b> (or the main <b>theme</b> of the rondo). The recapitulation closely resembles the exposition, with the minimal harmonic changes needed to end the section in the tonic: the first <b>theme</b> returns in a shortened version; the second <b>theme</b> returns unaltered, only transposed a fourth up. The coda is based on the exposition's first <b>theme.</b> It is composed of two parts, the first quiet and attenuated, creating a sense of expectation, the second animated, dissipating the final tension in decisive, agitated motion and ending with fortissimo tonic chords and octaves.|$|E
50|$|After {{assembling}} codes {{it is time}} {{to organize}} them into broader <b>themes</b> and categories. The process generally involves identifying <b>themes</b> from the existing codes, reducing the <b>themes</b> to a manageable number, creating hierarchies within the <b>themes</b> and then linking <b>themes</b> together through theoretical modeling.|$|R
50|$|Searching for <b>themes</b> and {{considering}} {{what works and}} what does not work within <b>themes</b> enables the researcher to begin the analysis of potential codes. In this phase, it is important to begin by examining how codes combine to form over-reaching <b>themes</b> in the data. At this point, researchers have a list of <b>themes</b> and begin to focus on broader patterns in the data, combining coded data with proposed <b>themes.</b> Researchers also begin considering how relationships are formed between codes and <b>themes</b> and between different levels of existing <b>themes.</b> It may be helpful to use visual models to sort codes into the potential <b>themes.</b>|$|R

5|$|For the music, the {{development}} team felt that symphony orchestra would {{work best for}} Knights of the Old Republic II. The musical score was composed by Mark Griskey, who developed music and themes for characters and places, including the Jedi's <b>theme,</b> Darth Sion's <b>theme</b> and Darth Nihilus's <b>theme</b> (which both have many similarities with the Emperor's <b>theme</b> from The Return of the Jedi). He also created a <b>theme</b> for the main character, which is heard occasionally {{when he or she}} experiences internal conflict. The 70-minute score was recorded by the Sinfonia Orchestra in Seattle. The opening crawl utilizes the version of John Williams' main Star Wars <b>theme</b> that was re-recorded for the prequel trilogy.|$|E
5|$|I. Molto moderato. This {{movement}} {{employs a}} three-key exposition. The first <b>theme</b> introduces a G-flat trill that anticipates the following harmonic events – {{a shift to}} G-flat major in the central section of the main <b>theme,</b> and, after {{a return to the}} tonic, an enharmonic shift to F-sharp minor {{at the start of the}} second <b>theme.</b> After a colorful harmonic excursion, the third tonal area arrives in the traditional dominant key (F major). In contrast to the previous sonatas, here the development section elaborates on several different themes from the exposition. It reaches a dramatic climax in D minor, in which the first <b>theme</b> is presented, fluctuating between D minor and the home key, in a manner similar to the parallel passage from the previous sonata (see above). In the recapitulation, the bass line in the first <b>theme</b> rises to B-flat instead of descending to F (as in the exposition), and the second <b>theme</b> enters in B minor, instead of F-sharp minor. The rest of the exposition is repeated without alterations, transposed a fourth up, meaning that it returns to the home key, B-flat, for the third tonal area. The coda once again recalls the first <b>theme,</b> although only fragmentarily.|$|E

5|$|IV. Allegro ma non troppo – Presto. The finale has {{the same}} {{structure}} {{as that of the}} previous sonata. Many elements of this movement imply large-scale resolution of harmonic and thematic conflicts established earlier in this and even the two previous sonatas. The main rondo <b>theme</b> opens with an 'empty' octave on G, which resolves to C minor, subsequently interpreted as ii of V in B-flat major. Brendel asserts that this <b>theme,</b> beginning in the ambiguous G/Cm, functions as a resolution of the troubling G trill presented in {{the very beginning of the}} sonata, using G to resolve to F major as V of B-flat. The second <b>theme,</b> in ternary form, is written in the traditional key of the dominant, with a central section in D major; it consists of an extended, characteristically Schubertian stepwise melody played over an uninterrupted flow of semiquavers. This second <b>theme</b> uses the same melodic contour (5-8-7-6-6-5-(5-4-4-3)) of the remarkable C major modulation in the final A section of the second movement, implying further connotations of conflict resolution. After an abrupt end to the second <b>theme</b> and a pregnant pause, a minor dotted-rhythm chordal <b>theme</b> in F-minor suddenly enters fortissimo, elaborating and modulating before sublimating into a pianissimo version of itself in the parallel major. This third <b>theme</b> is highly similar in rhythm and melodic contour as well as left hand pattern to the tarantella of the C minor sonata, which may not be a coincidence when considering the overall high level of cyclic connection between the sonatas. This <b>theme</b> evolves into a rhythmic segue that leads seamlessly back to the main <b>theme</b> of the rondo. The development section, based entirely on the rhythmic pattern of the main rondo <b>theme,</b> is characterised by juxtaposed eighth notes and triplets, reaching a climax on C-flat major, from which the bass descends in chromatic modulation eventually to G in an extended diminuendo to return to the main <b>theme.</b> In the coda, the main <b>theme</b> is fragmented in a manner also similar to the finale of the previous sonata; in a highly chromatic and unstable progression, the octave on G here descends through G-flat to F, in an extension of the G-G-F resolution of the <b>theme.</b> After finally reaching this dominant preparation for the final time, the movement closes with an exceedingly triumphant and affirming presto section that totally resolves all dramatic conflicts in the sonata and the series.|$|E

Many elements drew from Horner's previous work (a rhythm that accompanies Khan's <b>theme</b> during the surprise attack borrows from an attack <b>theme</b> from Wolfen, in turn influenced by Goldsmith's score for Alien).
