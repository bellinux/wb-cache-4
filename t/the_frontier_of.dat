5|$|Back in Zone Three, Al•Ith {{finds that}} her people have {{forgotten}} her, and her sister, Murti• {{has taken over}} as queen. Disturbed by the changes she sees in Al•Ith, Murti• exiles her to <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> Zone Two. Al•Ith, drawn by its allure, tries to enter Zone Two, but finds an unworldly and inhospitable place and is told by invisible people {{that it is not}} her time yet. At <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> Zone Five, Ben Ata reluctantly marries Vahshi, a tribal leader of a band of nomads who terrorise the inhabitants of her zone. But Ben Ata's marriage to Al•Ith has changed him, and he disbands most of his armies in Zone Four, sending the soldiers home to rebuild their towns and villages and uplift their communities. He also slowly wins over Vahshi's confidence and persuades her to stop plundering Zone Five.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 16th century, eastern Honduras {{was still}} beyond <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> conquest. The region was known as Taguzgalpa, {{stretching}} from Trujillo in the north, to the valleys of Olancho, Jamastran and Agalta in the west, to the Guayape and Guayambre rivers in the south, and the Caribbean Sea in the east. The territory was well populated by a diverse range of indigenous peoples, including Lencas, Nahuas and Misumalpas. The exact political composition of the territory was unknown to the Spanish, such that the Spanish Crown prohibited campaigns of conquest and reduction in Taguzgalpa owing to ignorance of its makeup.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, as {{elsewhere}} in the world of European colonies, <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> European exploration and settlement tended to be a linguistically diverse and fluid place, as cultures using different languages met and interacted. The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade, and (in some cases) intermarriage, {{led to the development of}} Mixed languages. Languages like Michif, Chinook Jargon and Bungi creole tended to be highly localized and were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable of speaking another language. Plains Sign Talk, which functioned originally as a trade language used to communicate internationally and across linguistic borders, reached across Canada, the United States and into Mexico.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Frontiers</b> <b>of</b> Engineering program assembles a {{group of}} {{emerging}} engineering leaders - usually aged 30-45 - to discuss cutting-edge research in various engineering fields and industry sectors. The goal of the meetings is to bring participants together to collaborate, network, and share ideas. There are three <b>Frontiers</b> <b>of</b> Engineering meetings every year: <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Frontiers</b> <b>of</b> Engineering Symposium, <b>the</b> German-American <b>Frontiers</b> <b>of</b> Engineering Symposium, and <b>the</b> Japan-America <b>Frontiers</b> <b>of</b> Engineering Symposium. <b>The</b> Indo-U.S. <b>Frontiers</b> <b>of</b> Engineering Symposium is held every other year.|$|R

5|$|Surtshellir, a {{group of}} {{volcanic}} tunnels in western Iceland recorded in the Landnámabók manuscript, is named after Surtr. In modern Iceland, the notion of Surtr as a giant of fire lives on; Surtsey ("Surtr's island"), a volcanic island that appeared in 1963 in Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland, is named after Surtr. The description found in Gylfaginning of Surtr guarding <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> Múspell is depicted in John Charles Dollman's painting The Giant with the Flaming Sword. Surtur, a natural satellite of the planet Saturn, and Surt, a volcano on the planet Jupiter's moon Io, are both named after Surtr. Surtur, a character from the American comic series Thor, is based on Surtr (1963).|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} region bordering Spanish and Portuguese territories in South America {{was largely}} unexplored {{at the end}} of the 17th century. Dispatched by the Spanish Crown, Jesuits explored and founded eleven settlements in 76 years in the remote Chiquitania – then known as Chiquitos – on <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> Spanish America. They built churches (templos) in a unique and distinct style that combined elements of native and European architecture. The indigenous inhabitants of the missions were taught European music as a means of conversion. The missions were self-sufficient, with thriving economies, and virtually autonomous from the Spanish crown.|$|E
5|$|One {{of several}} ecclesiastical sources that deal {{specifically}} with Ragnall is an undated grant to the Cluniac priory at Paisley. Since this grant probably {{dates to the}} period after Ragnall's defeat to Áengus, it may be evidence of an attempt made by Ragnall to secure an alliance with Alan fitz Walter, Steward of Scotland (died 1204). The patrons of this priory were members of Alan's own family, a powerful kindred that had recently begun to expand its influence westwards from Renfrew, to <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> the Scottish realm and the fringes of Argyll. Since Bute seems to have fallen {{into the hands of}} this kindred at about the time of Ragnall's grant, it is possible that Alan took advantage of the internal conflict between the meic Somairle, and seized the island before 1200. Alternately, Alan may have received the island from Ragnall as payment for military support against Áengus, who appears to have gained the upper hand over Ragnall by 1192. Alan's expansion and influence in territories outwith the bounds of the Scottish kingdom may have been perceived as a threat by William I, King of Scots (died 1214), and may partly explain the king's construction of a royal castle at Ayr in 1195. This fortress extended Scottish royal authority into the outer Firth of Clyde region, and was probably intended to dominate not only William's peripheral barons, but also independent rulers just beyond the borders of the Scottish realm. In fact, Alan's westward expansion appears to have suddenly ceased at about 1200, and may have been a consequence of royal anxiety concerning an alliance with Ragnall.|$|E

25|$|In 58 BC, the Helvetii {{tried to}} evade migratory {{pressure}} from Germanic tribes by moving into Gaul, but were defeated by Julius Caesar's armies {{and then sent}} back. The alpine region became integrated into the Roman Empire and was extensively romanized {{in the course of}} the following centuries. The center of Roman administration was at Aventicum (Avenches). In 259, Alamanni tribes overran the Limes, putting the settlements on Swiss territory on <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> the Roman Empire.|$|E
25|$|Further {{connections}} between Mammoth Cave and smaller caves or cave systems have followed, notably to Proctor/Morrison Cave beneath nearby Joppa Ridge in 1979.

Morrison cave was discovered by George Morrison in the 1920s. This connection pushed <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> <b>of</b> Mammoth exploration southeastward.|$|E
