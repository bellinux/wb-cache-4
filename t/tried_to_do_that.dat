500|$|Cast member Wil Wheaton rewatched {{the episode}} for AOL TV in November 2006. He criticised {{the writing of}} Fontana in this episode, saying that around this time she {{appeared}} on a panel at a convention about how to solve [...] "The Wesley Problem", but when rewatching the episode he thought that [...] "maybe instead of sitting on this panel and trashing me, D.C Fontana could have written intelligent dialogue for me and helped solve the [...] "Wesley problem" [...] herself. I don't know, maybe she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> and didn't {{get a lot of}} support {{from the rest of the}} producers and writing staff, but even I know of Dr. Channing's theory of not writing cliched dialogue for kids in science fiction, and then blaming the actor who is forced to deliver it." [...] Overall he criticised the [...] "very stiff" [...] dialogue throughout the episode, and called the set-up [...] "incredibly forced". He did highlight that Data acting out as Sherlock Holmes laid the foundation of future episodes which would expand on this.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{the film}} {{initially}} came to Jonze in the early 2000s when he read an article online that mentioned a website where a user could instant message with an artificial intelligence. [...] "For the first, maybe, 20 seconds of it, it had this real buzz," [...] said Jonze. [...] "I'd say 'Hey, hello,' and it would say 'Hey, how are you?', {{and it was like}} whoa [...] this is trippy. After 20 seconds, it quickly fell apart and you realized how it actually works, and it wasn't that impressive. But it was still, for 20 seconds, really exciting. The more people that talked to it, the smarter it got." [...] Jonze's interest in the project was renewed after directing the short film I'm Here (2010), which shares similar themes. Inspiration also came from Kaufman's writing approach for Synecdoche, New York (2008). Jonze explained, [...] " [...] said he wanted to try to write everything he was thinking about in that moment – all the ideas and feelings at that time – and put it into the script. I was very inspired by that, and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> in [...] And a lot of the feelings you have about relationships or about technology are often contradictory." ...|$|E

I wanted to avoid a war. The president [...] agreed with me. We <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> We couldn't get it through the U.N. and when the president made the decision, I supported that decision. And I've never blinked from that. I've never said I didn't support a decision to go to war." ...|$|E

2500|$|Muawiyah {{was very}} skilled at {{dealing with the}} Romans. Abdullah ibn Zubayr, who could see {{troubles}} ahead {{after the death of}} Muawiyah and was opposed to the appointment of Yazid, later said of Muawiyah: [...] "Truly the son of Hind deployed a dexterity and mental resourcefulness as one will never see after him. When we tried to impose something on him, an irritated lion with claws unsheathed would not show more audacity than him. He knew when to give into us, to even allow himself to be tricked when we <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> to him. He was the most artful of men, more crafty than a thief. I wished that we would never lose him, just as a rock remaining on this summit" [...] pointing to the mountain of Abu Qubays outside Mekka.|$|E

60|$|Her manner was defiant, {{her tone}} was positive; I doubted both.

And if my silly little preferences suggest cynicism--well, I may be smug enough, but I don't, and won't, believe I am a cynic. Remember I was young. Besides I love human beings, especially when they are very human, and I have even tried to forgive Miss M. her Miss M-ishness. How can I be a cynic if I have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> It {{is a far more}} difficult task than to make allowances for the poor, wretched, immortal waxwork creatures in Madame Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors, or even for the gentleman naturalist who shot and stuffed Kent's last golden oriole.|$|E
60|$|I felt, from my guardian's manner, that {{beyond this}} point I could not pursue the subject without {{changing}} the wind. I therefore forbore to ask any further questions. I was interested, but not curious. I thought {{a little while}} about this old love story in the night, when I was awakened by Mr. Boythorn's lusty snoring; and I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> very difficult thing, imagine old people young again and invested with the graces of youth. But I fell asleep before I had succeeded, and dreamed of the days when I lived in my godmother's house. I am not sufficiently acquainted with such subjects to know whether it is at all remarkable that I almost always dreamed of that period of my life.|$|E

60|$|Presents of {{iron and}} beads were now made to the savages, but they seemed to care little for these things, {{and in a few}} minutes they {{attempted}} to snatch the arms out of the sailors' hands. In this they failed, and Cook ordered Tupia to tell them that if they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> again, he would be compelled to kill them. In a few minutes Mr Green, one of the gentlemen, happened to turn about; immediately one of them snatched away his sword and ran to a little distance, waving it round his head with a shout of triumph. Seeing this, the rest became extremely insolent, and more savages came to join them {{from the other side of}} the river. It therefore became necessary to check them, and Mr Banks fired with small-shot at the man who had taken the sword. The shot had only the effect of stopping his shouts and causing him to retire a little farther off, still flourishing the sword, however. Seeing this, Mr Monkhouse fired with ball, and the man dropt instantly. Upon this the main body of the natives, who had retired to a rock in the middle of the river, began to return. Two that were near the man who had been killed ran to the body, and one seized his weapon of green talc, while the other tried to secure the sword, but Mr Monkhouse ran up in time to prevent this. Three muskets loaded with small-shot were then fired at the party, which wounded several, and caused them to retire to the opposite side of the river, after which Cook returned to the ship.|$|E
60|$|For a {{while after}} Cynthia's {{introduction}} to the school she was calmly ignored {{by many of the}} young ladies there, and once openly--snubbed, to use the word in its most disagreeable sense. Not that she gave any of them any real cause to snub her. She did not intrude her own affairs upon them, but she was used to conversing kindly with the people about her as equals, and for this offence; on the third day, Miss Sally Broke snubbed her. It is hard not to make a heroine of Cynthia, {{not to be able to}} relate that she instantly put Miss Sally's nose out of joint. Susan Merrill <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and failed signally, for Miss Sally's nose was not easily dislodged. Susan fought more than one of Cynthia's battles. As a matter of fact, Cynthia did not know that she had been affronted until that evening. She did not tell her friends how she spent the night yearning fiercely for Coniston and Uncle Jethro, at times weeping for them, if the truth be told; how she had risen before the dawn to write a letter, and to lay some things in the rawhide trunk. The letter was never sent, and the packing never finished. Uncle Jethro wished her to stay and to learn to be a lady, and stay she would, in spite of Miss Broke and the rest of them. She went to school the next day, and for many days and weeks thereafter, and held communion with the few alone who chose to treat her pleasantly. Unquestionably this is making a heroine of Cynthia.|$|E

5000|$|Simons store {{locations}} are each uniquely designed. The current CEO, Peter Simons, {{said in an}} interview with Canadian Business [...] "We’re <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> hold on to this belief in creativity and architecture and art. We’re working with Doug Coupland, for instance, on an art piece in Vancouver, and we <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> with all the stores we build.". All stores incorporate art installations and unique architectural elements.|$|R
60|$|Let us inquire {{a little}} {{into the nature}} of each of the elements. The first element, we say, is the love of Nature, leading to the effort to observe and report her truly. And this is the first and leading element. Review for yourselves the history of art, and you will find this to be a {{manifest}} certainty, that no great school ever yet existed which had not for primal aim the representation of some natural fact as truly as possible. There have only yet appeared in the world three schools of perfect art--schools, that is to say, that did their work as well as it seems possible to do it. These are the Athenian, [Footnote: See below, the farther notice of the real spirit of Greek work, in the address at Bradford.] Florentine, and Venetian. The Athenian proposed to itself the perfect representation of the form of the human body. It strove to do that as well as it could; it did that as well as it can be done; and all its greatness was founded upon and involved in that single and honest effort. The Florentine school proposed to itself the perfect expression of human emotion--the showing of the effects of passion in the human face and gesture. I call this the Florentine school, because, whether you take Raphael for the culminating master of expressional art in Italy, or Leonardo, or Michael Angelo, you will find that the whole energy of the national effort which produced those masters had its root in Florence; not at Urbino or Milan. I say, then, this Florentine or leading Italian school proposed to itself human expression for its aim in natural truth; it strove to do that as well as it could--did it as well as it can be done--and all its greatness is rooted in that single and honest effort. Thirdly, the Venetian school propose the representation of the effect of colour and shade on all things; chiefly on the human form. It <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> as well as it could--did it as well as it can be done--and all its greatness is founded on that single and honest effort.|$|E
6000|$|Tommy {{lost sight}} and sound of Corp and the boy. What he seemed to see was a baby lark that had got out of its nest sideways, a fall of half a foot only, but a dreadful drop for a baby. [...] "You can get back this way," [...] its mother said, and showed it the way, which was quite easy, but when the baby tried to leap, it fell on its back. Then the mother marked out lines on the ground, {{from one to the}} other of which it was to {{practise}} hopping, and soon it could hop beautifully so long as its mother was there to say every moment, [...] "How beautifully you hop!" [...] "Now teach me to hop up," [...] the little lark said, meaning that it wanted to fly; and the mother <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> also, but in vain; she could soar up, up, up bravely, but could not explain how she did it. This distressed her very much, and she thought hard about how she had learned to fly long ago last year, but all she could recall for certain was that you suddenly do it. [...] "Wait till the sun comes out after rain," [...] she said, half remembering. [...] "What is sun? What is rain?" [...] the little bird asked. [...] "If you cannot teach me to fly, teach me to sing." [...] "When the sun comes out after rain," [...] the mother replied, [...] "then you will know how to sing." [...] The rain came, and glued the little bird's wings together. [...] "I shall never be able to fly nor to sing," [...] it wailed. Then, of a sudden, it had to blink its eyes; for a glorious light had spread over the world, catching every leaf and twig and blade of grass in tears, and putting a smile into every tear. The baby bird's breast swelled, it did not know why; and it fluttered from the ground, it did not know how. [...] "The sun has come out after the rain," [...] it trilled. [...] "Thank you, sun; thank you, thank you! Oh, mother, did you hear me? I can sing!" [...] And it floated up, up, up, crying, [...] "Thank you, thank you, thank you!" [...] to the sun. [...] "Oh, mother, do you see me? I am flying!" [...] And being but a baby, it soon was gasping, but still it trilled the same ecstasy, and when it fell panting to earth it still trilled, and the distracted mother called to it to take breath or it would die, but it could not stop. [...] "Thank you, thank you, thank you!" [...] it sang to the sun till its little heart burst.|$|E
