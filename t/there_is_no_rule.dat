If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of them, want to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is all right with me. That is the business of the managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E
5|$|Susan Hall {{wrote that}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>rule</b> {{of law in}} the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic {{officials}} are unconstrained by laws, accountability {{or any kind of}} legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.|$|E

In 2003, Annika Sörenstam and Suzy Whaley played in PGA Tour events, and Michelle Wie did so in each year from 2004 through 2008.

2500|$|Down linemen: Down linemen are players who, at {{the start}} of every play, line up at the line of {{scrimmage}}; once in their stance, they may not move until the play begins. The offence must have at least seven players lined up at the line of scrimmage on every play. The exception to this rule is the player (typically the centre) who snaps the ball to the quarterback. Linemen generally do not run with the ball (unless they recover it on a fumble) or receive a hand-off or lateral pass, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>rule</b> against it. Interior linemen (that is, excluding the two players {{at either end of the}} scrimmage line) are ineligible receivers; they may not receive a forward pass either. (The two offensive ends on the line of scrimmage may receive forward passes, and may be in motion along the line of scrimmage prior to the snap.) ...|$|E

6000|$|To {{be really}} historic, I should have {{mentioned}} that {{before going to}} look for the Rhone I had spent part of the evening {{on the opposite side of}} the little place, and that I indulged in this recreation for two definite reasons. One of these was that I had an opportunity of gossiping at a café with a conversable young Englishman whom I had met in the afternoon at Tarascon and more remotely, in other years, in London; the other was that there sat enthroned behind the counter a splendid mature Arlésienne, whom my companion and I agreed that it was a rare privilege to contemplate. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>rule</b> of good manners or morals which makes it improper, at a café, to fix one's eyes upon the dame de comptoir; the lady is, in the nature of things, a part of your consummation.

60|$|There are, no doubt, women, {{as there}} are men, whom {{equality}} of consideration will not satisfy; with whom there is no peace while any will or wish is regarded but their own. Such persons are a proper subject for the law of divorce. They are only fit to live alone, and no human beings ought to be compelled to associate their lives with them. But the legal subordination tends to make such characters among women more, rather than less, frequent. If the man exerts his whole power, the woman is of course crushed: but if she is treated with indulgence, and permitted to assume power, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>rule</b> to set limits to her encroachments. The law, not determining her rights, but theoretically allowing her none at all, practically declares that the measure of what she has a right to, is what she can contrive to get.|$|E

Their perspective is, if not more subtle, at least more stringent than that of any other lines in Nature. It will not be detected by the general observer, if you miss the curve of a branch, or the sweep of a cloud, or the perspective of a building;[36] but every intelligent spectator will feel the difference between a rightly-drawn bend of shore or shingle, and a false one. Absolutely right, in difficult river perspectives seen from heights, I believe no one but Turner ever has been yet; and observe, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>NO</b> <b>rule</b> for them. To develop the curve mathematically would require a knowledge of the exact quantity of water in the river, the shape of its bed, and the hardness of the rock or shore; and even with these data, the problem would be one which no mathematician could solve but approximatively. The instinct of the eye can do it; nothing else.|$|E
60|$|For racing, a cutter; {{for a long}} {{pleasure}} voyage, a schooner; for cruising in home waters, the yawl; and {{the handling}} of them all is indeed a fine art. It requires not only {{the knowledge of the}} general principles of sailing, but a particular acquaintance with the character of the craft. All vessels are handled {{in the same way as}} far as theory goes, just as you may deal with all men on broad and rigid principles. But if you want that success in life which comes from the affection and confidence of your fellows, then with no two men, however similar they may appear in their nature, will you deal in the same way. There may be a rule of conduct; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>rule</b> of human fellowship. To deal with men is as fine an art as it is to deal with ships. Both men and ships live in an unstable element, are subject to subtle and powerful influences, and want to have their merits understood rather than their faults found out.|$|E
6000|$|In the {{beginning}} of this very Minute of Consultation, Mr. Hastings removes Mr. Fowke from the Residency of Benares because [...] "he cannot give him his confidence"; and yet, before the pen is out of his hand, he violates one of the soundest general principles in the whole system of dealing, in order to give a proof of the confidence he reposes in that gentleman. This apparent gross contradiction is to be reconciled but by one way,--which is, that confidence with Mr. Hastings comes and goes with his opposition to legal authority. Where that authority recommends any person, his confidence in him vanishes; but to show that it is the authority, and not the person, he opposes, when that is out of sight, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>rule</b> so sacred which is not to be violated to manifest his real esteem and perfect trust in the person whom he has rejected. However, by overturning general principles to compliment Mr. Fowke's integrity, he does all in his power to corrupt it; {{at the same time he}} establishes an example that must either subject all future dealings to the same pernicious clause, or which, being omitted, must become a strong implied charge on the integrity of those who shall hereafter be excluded from a trust so constituted.|$|E
